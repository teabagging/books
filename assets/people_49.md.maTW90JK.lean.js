It was so far from that! This book had everything... it had that poetic, reverie, optimism quality to it, that I \\"so dearly\\" luuuuuurve! Mmmmm... I'm speaking like a brit wannabe. (yummy!) Man, it was perfect... good ending, good middle. Not a slow book once you really dig into. You won't want to put it down, or when you do, you'll be whimpering until you have it in your hot little hands again. I know I did, until it was done, stopping in the middle, well I felt incomplete *somehow*. Not until it was finished was my life complete once more, it's a very thought-provoking book. I could definately relate to Molly, the main charecter.Then there was the bits of romance and sex that took me over the endge... a well written book, so colorful with words and phrases does that to you, or maybe I'm easy... &lt;shrug> But see...

The pleasure of reading Torrey is that he experienced the fullness or the baptism of the Holy Spirit yet did not let emotionalism dominate his teaching or lifestyle. Dr. D.L. Moody often called upon Torrey to speak at Moody Bible on the work of the Holy Spirit and later Torrey became president of Moody. His theology was replaced with cessationist teaching later on.

Not only does Torrey take the reader through the Scriptures to define the person and work of the Holy Spirit, but he also guides the reader through the steps of personal application in their own lives. However, this work is not for the timid or young believer. If you are a fully devoted follower of Christ and ready for the next step, then buy this book now."},{"Title":"The Person and Work of the Holy Spirit","review":"Torrey, although thorough and systematic in his teaching, presents the Holy Spirit in simple, powerful language that will help the believer see the Holy Spirit's role in their lives, the lives of their church, and in the lives of the lost. Unfortunately, in reaction to the Charismatic movement, most of the fundamental evangelical teaching of the last 50 years has downplayed the Holy Spirit. Because Torrey lived and taught not just before the Charismatic movement, but also during a time of great revival, I feel personally that he has far better balance on the topic than most modern conservative authors. While I doubt there are any evangelical pastors or laymen that deny the Holy Spirit is a person, and a member of the Godhead; the vast majority seem uncomfortable discussing the Holy Ghost. The overwhelming love that He shows us, and his role in the believer's life as put forth by Torrey from the Word of God are the focus of this book."},{"Title":"The Person and Work of the Holy Spirit","review":"Torrey never ceases to amaze me with his systematic way of teaching the Bible. In this book he shows plainly from the Bible that God's promise of the Holy Spirit is for Christians then and now. Yes this is good book to learn about the person of the Holy Spirit, but also this book teaches about the power of God through the fullness of the Spirit for witnessing that every Christian can have in their lives."},{"Title":"The Person and Work of the Holy Spirit","review":"I've found this book to be useful with the beginning probably more useful than the end.

To even mention the Holy Spirit in most churches today is taboo to say the least. There is more reverence given to Calvin than to Holy Spirit. I'm not surprised that this book is rare and hard to find. You won't find it in most bookstores but when you do stumble upon it, the teachings and scriptural references will bring you into a deeper and closer personal relationship with God.I bought this for myself and use it as a hand out for my prison ministry. The information in this book is so important I even bought copies for my two kids so they will be able to have this rare resource. The hardest concept for most, I think, will be to understand it's not about the denominations but about the personal relationship with an amazing and loving God who is Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Jesus didn't die just to save us from hell---He died to give us life---the Holy Spirit lives in believers through faith. Anyway, this book is amazing and highly recommended. Take your time reading it and enjoy the scripture references."},{"Title":"The Person and Work of the Holy Spirit","review":"When you read this book, you will no doubt go down on your knees and worship God. You will be assured that God keeps his promise to \\"never leave us nor forsake us\\" because He gave us the Holy Spirit. If you are ever in doubt as to the truth of anything you read in the Bible, you can be sure that the Holy Spirit is willing and able to \\"guide you into all truth.\\"This book assures us as well as gives a practical guideline on how to know if the promptings in our heart really do come from the Holy Spirit or they are just our own notions (or worse, signs of a mental disease or demon possession). More than ever, when there are so many voices out there clamoring for our attention, we as children of God need to know how to be \\"led by the Spirit of God.\\" When so many hardships assault us in our daily life, it is good to know that God has given us a Comforter who \\"runs alongside us\\" even when the road is dark and difficult.If you need encouragement in your daily Christian life, this book will surely be of help."},{"Title":"The Person and Work of the Holy Spirit","review":"This is an awesome book.

I don't necessarily agree with everything I read, but that's not uncommon when it comes to doctrine. However, it's simplicity and scripture references make it a good source of information for someone studying the work, attributes, and personality of the Holy Spirit. I would recommend it with the condition that you use your Bible along with it. A Born Again believer will have the \\"Holy Spirit\\" as their guide as you read God's word.

I read it on my Kindle and have been held captive by this remarkable account. It is not only deep,thorough and systematic in its presentation but written with the aim of inviting any serious disciple of the Lord Jesus Christ to pursue a more intimate walk with the Lord. It is not merely a Biblical understanding of the Holy Spirit but includes extremely helpful, humble, personal comments and experiences on how to benefit from this 'neglected' but astonishing ministry of the Third Person of the Trinity.

This book is both engaging and cuts straight to the heart even though it was written almost a century ago. Its relevance remains despite the decades of time that has past because the Holy Spirit is the same yesterday as he is today. This work is a must-read for every new believer and even older believers who still have questions about who the Holy Spirit is and what his business is in our lives. The book can also help remind others about the power the Holy Spirit has in the life of a believer willing to follow him. I loved this work and look forward to discovering other works by the thought-provoking theologian, R.A. Torrey."},{"Title":"Bases de Datos en MS Visual Basic 6.0 con CD-ROM: Manuales Compumagazine, en Espanol / Spanish (Spanish Edition)","review":"En mi opini&oacute;n, es un excelente libro, no solo para aprender como conectar VB a Base de Datoa, sino tambien te introduce en SQL Server, y lo m&aacute;s importantem la excelente atencion puesta en SQL, ADO y Programaci&oacute;n en 3 Capas (muy bien explicado)Es una buena introducci&oacute;n al concepto .NET de Microsoft.Lo recomiendo no solo para desarrolladores VB , sino tambien para desarrolladores de Internet (ASP/IIS)."},{"Title":"Bases de Datos en MS Visual Basic 6.0 con CD-ROM: Manuales Compumagazine, en Espanol / Spanish (Spanish Edition)","review":"Este es un libro excelente, no pretende ser un manual de usuario,no pretende ense&ntilde;ar la historia de la programaci&oacute;n visual, sino que va al grano y da las explicaciones pr&aacute;cticas que son las que el programador necesita para desarrollar sus tareas en forma eficiente.

In usual Cage fashion, the lectures, essays, \\"diaries,\\" anecdotes, and assorted miscellanea jump off the page - utilizing an increasingly diverse array of typefaces and sizes, the writings contained here blaze the trail that leads to the mesostics and other verbal experiments that characterize the remainder of Cage's literary work beginning with M: Writings '67-'72.Including, amongst numerous other gems, the \\"Two Statements on Ives,\\" \\"26 Statements re Duchamp,\\" \\"Jasper Johns: Stories and Ideas,\\" the \\"Julliard Lecture,\\" \\"Lecture on Commitment,\\" and a collection of personal reminiscences/Zen riddles entitled \\"How to Pass, Kick, Fall, and Run,\\" A Year From Monday contains an overflow of priceless Cageisms.Beginning with an unforgettable cover (three slightly-overlapping photos of Cage's face, the first serious, the second beginning to open up, the third in full cackle) and never slowing down, the collection demonstrates perfectly Cage's relevance to musicians firstly, and thinkers finally. From one of the most significant and influential composers of the 20th century, A year From Monday demonstrates the originality, openness, and precision of thought that make Cage relevant to a much broader audience than simply the avante-garde musician."},{"Title":"A Year From Monday: New Lectures And Writings","review":"I find his book very interesting and informative in many ways. Most of it is very difficult to read because 1. John Cage is extremely intellectual, and 2. He is very avan garde, so some of the formats in which he writes in can be very complicated. I enjoy it being complicated though because there is something you can always figure out about it or just look into very closely. My favorite subject of this book are his journal/diary entries. They include entries of him away at master classes and the things that he talks about are humorous, great to know, and interesting to think about. I recommend this selection of John Cage highly."},{"Title":"Earthwalking Sky Dancers: Women's Pilgrimages to Sacred Places","review":"Leila Castle has gathered an exceptional collection of distinguished women's journeys to sacred sites. It shares the feminine aspect of well known and lesser known ancient sites in Europe, South America, and South East Asia. It is a celebration of the creative, intuitive, and sensual experiences of women of all ages and cultures. The journeys vary in duration, but there is a common experience of finding one's &quot;ancient knowing&quot;, and remembering cultures that celebrated in harmony and co-creation with Mother Earth."},{"Title":"Earthwalking Sky Dancers: Women's Pilgrimages to Sacred Places","review":"One of the best books I've ever read, definitely the one I'd take along to that lonely island where you can only have one book. Deeply profound personal journey stories, wonderful to read, great range of experiences told in such a personal way that I sometimes thought my best friend gave me her personal travelogue. The story by Chesca Potter was the one that made me buy the book, and I love hers best, but - aww, what a cornucopia of delight on all pages!Fantastic, highly recommendable, both for \\"couch pilgrims\\" and for those of you who want to visit these wondrous places out there in the real world.

The premise is good, \\"Women's Pilgrimages To Sacred Places\\", and a few of the sections made me want to visit the sacred spaces mentioned. Where the book's strength should be but where it falls apart is it isn't written by professional authors, but everyday women on a personal journey. The chapter's gripping excitements range from 'sweet and naive native children appearing with magic mushrooms' to derogating the gifts left by other visitors...what makes one person's vision wrong and someone else's right?Uneven and in the end, uninteresting.

Should have saved my money."},{"Title":"A Choice of Destinies","review":"I can only speculate as to the past-life Melissa Scott might have enjoyed as a loyal soldier-officer in the Macedonian army of the Great Alexander, but in what is arguably her best short work, A Choice Of Destinies, the reader is certainly swept into the passion, place, and time of this remarkable man, as Ms. Scott unfolds an epic tapestry that presents Alexander and his generals with a choice they never had in Antiquity: an opportunity to embark upon the trans-Oxus campaign, or face the formidable power of the early Roman republic. An engaging read for lovers of classical studies as well as the science fiction/fantasy enthusiast, A Choice Of Destinies will fire the imaginations of all who've ever wondered what might have been if we had only chosen to zig, instead of zagging, on the slippery slope of Time."},{"Title":"A Choice of Destinies","review":"Absolutely terrific book. It could have gone on twice as long; since Scott only takes us through two of Alexander's \\"alternate\\" campaigns - against Rome and against Carthage - and doesn't show us the empire-building that must have followed. She is at ease with the military minutiae as well as with the different personalities of Alexander's Friends and Companions (it's amusing to hear about a Queen Cleopatra in the flash-forwards that show us the Empire down the centuries; she might be a Ptolemaic descendent, but through a different, clever history twist.) The only question I would have is that I'm not sure the sarissa was used by the cavalry - it must have made a very unwieldy weapon. You can tell how fine the research is, when quibbles become that detailed. (Also - wouldn't a Roman Consul need to be re-elected every year?) Much more important is how Melissa Scott manages to infuse every page with a terrific sense of suspense. We care and fear for her Alexander. Like Renault, she uses omens and visions woven into the perceptions of everyday life, with a good balance between the religious and the pragmatic. The Syrian seeresss, the augurs are all historical figures. Scott also creates perhaps the best adult Hephaestion in all Alexander fiction (since his point of view never appears in Mary Renault's The Persian Boy.) Nothing is explicitly written about the relationship between the king and his \\"best friend\\", but every clue is there if you know where to look; and even Bagoas briefly appears. This is a complete, unexpected sucess, and it's a shame it's out of print. I could do with sequels, both on the immediate aftermath of this book, and in the more distant future of the alternate Alexandrian empire; the glimpses we get are simply riveting. No Dark Ages and space travel by the 16th century AD? Bring it on!"},{"Title":"A Choice of Destinies","review":"Melissa Scott has created an amazing book here. Historical fiction concerning Alexander the Great has recently captured my attention and I have been eagerly devouring anything to do with the subject. This book, unlike the previous ones I've read, takes Alexander on a different route. What if Alexander skipped India? What if he went towards Rome? What if he had an heir before he started his journey? All of these questions and more create an interesting and exciting story.I would definitely recommend this story. I thought Melissa Scott captured Alexander the Great's character very well. Hephaistion also plays a large part, and even Bagoas is mentioned. I've never thought about what Rome would do if Alexander came calling, and the author has written a very plausible theory.Again, I recommend this story. If you're interested in other historical fiction concerning Alexander the Great, I recommend Mary Renault's Alexander trilogy:Fire from Heaven,The Persian Boy, andFuneral Games. I also just finishedLord of the Two Landsby Judith Tarr and would recommend that if you'd like to see Alexander from an Egyptian point of view.I'd also like to note that I was a bit put off by the cover art showing what looks like outer space. The majority of this story takes place in Alexander's time period. There are a few short chapters (only a few pages long) which are spread throughout the book, and take place far in the future; they deal with what is left with Alexander's empire. Not something I particularly cared for, but they did not take away from my enjoying the story."},{"Title":"A Choice of Destinies","review":"This is a very good read that looks at what may have happened should Alexander the Great turned away from his trip into India and instead returned to defeat rebels in Hellas, take Syracuse, subjugate southern Italy, defeat Rome and then sack Carthage. Included are interludes which show the resultant empire through the late 1500s (bce) including a scene from Alexandria-in-Orbit.The 'turning point', which apparently is important in alternate histories, is not really stark. Scott has the Sacred Band with Alexander in Bactria, when they were crushed at Chaeronea, so that must have been where it began its turn.All-in-all, a fine read with some big quibbles."},{"Title":"Symbols and Their Meanings: The Illustrated Guide to More Than 1,000 Symbols -- Their Traditional and Contemporary Significance","review":"I purchased this book thinking that I was ordering a book to add to my resource collection of symbols.

It offered me a tremendous amount of opportunities to help my toddler learn and explore. I have been reading to my toddler since her birth, also I was singing songs. I still felt there was much more that I could be doing during the day to stimulate her mind and to help her grow. This book stated it all. It showed me simple quick and easy things that I could do each day. Between cooking meals and cleaning the home, I wanted somethings that I could do with my daughter in a quick and easy yet efficient manner for her and this was the book that I needed. I give this book four stars each parent of a toddler should have one in their library."},{"Title":"Quick & Fun Learning Activities for 1 Year Olds","review":"This book suggest many activities that are developmentally inappropriate for 1 year olds. For example, it suggest having a 1 year old use a qtip to glue magazine pictures they have torn out on to construction paper.

The book is called the Top 10, as in Top 10 Grossing Films. So, if there were to be a list of Johnny Depp's films, then Secret Window would probably come before Cry-Baby because Secret Window grossed more; not because Secret Window was better as a film.This book is fun because you can see which bad movies did really, really well in the box office. It's also a good reference book for Oscars, Sight and Sound Polls, and even Harvard Lampoon's Worst Movies."},{"Title":"The Top 10 of Film","review":"I was so excited to dive into this book, but was quickly disappointed.I don't know what these top ten lists are based on?!

They'll be happy to know that \\"The Water Boy\\" took the #1 spot for best football movie of all time. Sorry, Rudy."},{"Title":"The Top 10 of Film","review":"I am extremely disappointed in this book. I thought there would be insight into cinema as an art and not just a regurgitation of facts about films accepted by the masses. Tarantino is not in the index or mentioned besides the listing of him as Oscar winner for Pulp Fiction (writer) - the book was made in 2002. The lists in general seem to be based purely on sales and not artistic talent. For the \\"Top Ten for Directors\\" this book rated Coppola's Dracula higher than The Godfather and Scorsese's Cape Fear higher than Taxi Driver. Personally I find the the entire thing to be unnecessary trash- A resource of information that can easily be found on wikipedia.

Lewis's book \\"The Last Battle.\\" If you are not familiar with the Chronicles of Narnia, then it might be helpful to read those reviews. If you're familiar with the series, read on to hear what we think about the radio dramas!We own all of Focus on the Family's Narnia Dramas that have been published to date (Sept 2002, and the Last Battle is next/last to be published in Oct 2002). We LOVE them all! Our son is 3 yrs old, and he will sit through almost an entire CD (all of the dramas are 2-3 CDs each), listening to the adventure! It's a great way to get him involved in the world of Narnia, and a wonderful alternative to T.V. One of the things that my husband and I enjoy about the series is that it is also captivating to adults. The actors are all British (as was C.S. Lewis), with an introduction by Douglas Gresham, Lewis's stepson. The actors maintain their roles throughout the series; for instance, the actor who plays the role of Eustace in \\"Voyage of the Dawn Treader\\" is the same actor who plays that role in \\"The Silver Chair;\\" the actor who plays the role of Aslan is the same in all the dramas. In a presentation that has many characters, it's helpful to be able to recognize the voices from one CD to the next.We HIGHLY recommend all the CDs in this series. They're a great way to pass the time on car trips, and a wonderful way to encourage a child's (or an adult's!) imagination. They are wholesome, and have a clear message that good will prevail over evil, and that love and forgiveness are qualities to be cherished.

This slim (87 pp.) volume is a relaxing and enjoyable afternoon's read. It mixes helpful hints on how to read dealer's listings with snippets of historical lore and suggestions for must-have reference books. I learned that 8vo in a dealer listing referred to the dimensions of the book (not the number of volumes), that the pulp that formed the basis for early European paper came from recycled underwear, that the reference book I was just outbid on on Ebay was one that I really DO want in my library and more. Two things sum up my reaction to this book: a immediate desire upon finishing the book to write the author and tell him how much I enjoyed reading it; and the feeling of kinship I had when I read one of the included quotes - one that I want on my tombstone when the time should come.&quot;I have always imagined that Paradise will be a sort of library.&quot; -Jorge Luis Borges"},{"Title":"Tombstone","review":"The book itself arrived a bit ragged but the seller did say that it was used so that was fine. It is a great find for the Tombstone fan, Mine was for my husband."},{"Title":"Tombstone","review":"Are you a big fan of the movie &quot;Tombstone&quot;? I was. I loved the interaction between the characters -- Wyatt and Doc as played by Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer, in particular. I'm sorry to say that the book doesn't come close to capturing the excitement of the movie. I think this was Giles Tippette's first attempt at writing a novelization, and I don't think he did it very well.What really ruins the book is the dialogue. A paraphrase:Doc said, &quot;And what would you do if 'she' walked in here?&quot;Wyatt said, &quot;Who?&quot;Doc said, &quot;You know who. That dusky-hued Lady Satan, that's who.&quot;Wyatt said, &quot;I'd probably just ignore her.&quot;Doc said, &quot;Ignore her?&quot;Wyatt said, &quot;That's right, ignore her.&quot;And so on. You get the impression that he simply used the Find -&gt; Replace function to replace the line break between the character name and the line of dialogue with &quot; said,&quot;.In Tippette's defense, the rest of his writing, to my knowledge, is nothing like this. But this book is depressingly poor at conveying the magic of the screen. If you're interested in having it on your shelf, I strongly recommend tracking down a copy of the actual screenplay."},{"Title":"In the company of eagles","review":"Superb prose in a gritty and vast WWI landscape. This is worth having, and reading over and over. This author has used some interesting ways of telling this story, and not just in the blood rivalry between the French ace Sgt. Chamay and his personal enemy, German Lt. Kupper. Look for some interesting subplots: the adventures of the ham from Kempinsky's, the comic (and sometimes dangerous) mishaps of Chamay's mechanics, and Sgt. Chamay's bicycle trip through the terrible aftermath of the Nivelle Offensive.The author has avoided the cliches about knights of the air. He spares nothing about the lethal and grisly nature of fighting, without parachutes, in what were little more than cloth-and-wood kites. And Chamay's battle with Kupper is not a duel but a search for vengeance: he wants to kill him, not joust.And the other people in the book! They're vivid; previous reviewers rightly praise Gann's characterizations. Another vivid character worth a mention is Chamay's squadron leader, Capt. Jourdan, \\"His Excellency\\" (not complimentary) to his unit, who shows some surprising changes. \\"For the seediest, most ineffectual officer they had ever known had taught them what it was to be a soldier of France.\\"Here's hoping this book is back in print someday."},{"Title":"In the company of eagles","review":"This is another of those lost gems no longer in print and that is a true pity.

The action is quite good and quite accurate. This is one of those novels which you are tempted to give a reread ever so often. The author has done is research on this one, so not only do we get a great story, but a good history lesson to boot. Cannot recommend this one highly enough."},{"Title":"In the company of eagles","review":"As he so brilliantly demonstrated in The High and the Mighty and Fate Is the Hunter, Ernest K. Gann has a unique ability to evoke the sense of lofty adventure, the mysterious exhilaration of spirit that is inherent in the very act of flight. It is his special gift to unshackle the earthbound reader, to release us from our daily humdrum - until we discover ourselves soaring in the company of eagles.Now in this, his finest novel, that gift is supremely manifest. The time is 1917. It is the eve of an appalling disaster - as General Nivelle and his poilus, desperate to expel the invader from their homeland, are about to hurl themselves at the impregnable Hindenburg line.High above the bloodsoaked fields of France, fighting with equal desperation, flies a breed of young men who are either quick or soon dead. They are the airmen of the Royal Flying Corps, of the Imperial German Air Force, of the French Air Service - knights of the sky, last heirs of the chivalric tradition, dueling in their fragile flying machines living with abandon, dying with glory.Gann takes us aloft with them - with the young Frenchman bearing the ancient name of Chamay, who has dedicated himself to personal vengeance, and with the veteran German ace Kupper, tormented by a love for his Vaterland and a loathing for legalized slaughter. It is the duel between these two brave men that is at the heart of the novel.From the opening pages to the final, climactic confrontaion, the tension eases only when, for brief moments, we alight on earth. And even then there stands in wait the ominoius figure of Pilger, the German private who is Kupper's batman, the clumsy, insensitive, cunning product of an education for death on the Eastern front - the symbol of the beast that war can make of man.In the Company of Eagles moves us with its counterpointing of the noblest and the basest actions to which men can be stirred by momentous events.

Does not have the emotional impact of some of his other works, but worth the read and a must for a serious collector."},{"Title":"In the company of eagles","review":"For a book with as much historical detail as this, I was surprised at some of the historical glitches. There is confusion about when certain models of the Albatros fighter were available in a couple cases. It must be a typo that keeps most of the story set in April and May 1917, as much time seems to pass and there is a reference to \\"finally admitting Richthofen was shot down,\\" (which happened in April 1918). And there is a huge boner about triplanes where a big surprise happens because the \\"Germans were the only ones who flew triplanes\\" and are shocked when the British fly them, when in fact it was the British who flew them first and the Germans who copied them. There's a little drama gap there also, as the story conjures a raid by \\"naval\\" airplanes that are never seen again.Still, it is a very good read in terms of characters and feelings. I think it would make a good movie (and Hollywood would mess up the history even more). I found it hard to put down and will probably read it again, and I will look for some of the author's other works.It's such a good read, these glitches are surprising."},{"Title":"In the company of eagles","review":"From inside flap:As he so brilliantly demonstrated in \\"The High and the Mighty\\" and \\"Fate is the Hunter,\\" Ernest K.

They have never seen the girl in their life; how could she have wound up murdered in their house? Mrs. Bantry calls in her good friend Miss Marple to search out the truth that several detectives cannot find, and bring the murderer to justice before he kills again.Miss Marple is just as puzzled as the Bantrys as to why the blonde was found in their house. The victim, Ruby Keene, was a dancer at the local hotel and had fallen into the affection of a hotel visitor, the wealthy and crippled Conway Jefferson. His son-in-law and daughter-in-law definitely had means to murder Ruby, but their alibis are solid. And the other suspicious characters without alibis, have no motives for the killing. Miss Marple has her work cut out for her, but as usual, she rises to the challenge and surpasses the efforts of the local constable and a retired Scotland Yard detective.\\"The Body in the Library\\" is a quick-paced, witty mystery. Agatha Christie uses several cliches in wonderful and clever plot twists as the mystery surrounding the murder begins to unravel.

And I DO NOT OVER EMPHASIZE that the many suspects tell many lies in attempt to cover up anything that may humilate them. Fascinating study of human character."},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"This book is a great starter for Miss Marple-readers. Though many will disagree and say that MURDER OF THE VICARAGE is (considering it was published as the first Miss Marple-book), THE BODY IN THE LIBRARY introduces an interesting plot, multiple settings, and suspects with multiple motives. It introduces the usual blueprint that surrounds Miss Marple mysteries. There is a detective or inspector who goes around asking initial questions and such. There is a chief who gives updates on a daily basis. Usually, they all have something to do with(or know about)Miss Marple.Miss Marple's great friend Mrs. Bantry and her husband Colonel Bantry wake up to a shocking sight: a blonde girl murdered brutally at Gossington Hall.

Her dear friends, Col. and Mrs. Bantry, have the unpleasant experience of having the body of a rather cheap-looking blonde found in their library. The unidentified corpse does not appear to be at all the type of person the Bantrys would associate with, and tongues begin wagging in the village. The search to identify the body involves many interesting characters: Ruby Keene, a professional dancer who has been reported missing; Josephine Turner, her cousin; Raymond Starr, exhibition dancer and tennis pro; and Conway Jefferson, a man confined to a wheelchair as the result of an accident that killed his wife and children. Mr. Jefferson was rumored to have been quite taken with the exotic Ruby. Add to this mix the Bantrys next door neighbor, Basil Blake, who is a &quot;party animal&quot; and been known to consort with film stars and others of loose reputations, according to the gossip-mongers in the village.The professional detectives are baffled and it is our shy and quiet Miss Marple who solves the case because of her past experiences and observations of how people act, particularly young girls."},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"Once I read The Body in the Library, it was like a whole new level of mystery novels opened up for me.

The Body in the Library is a MUST READ (I am completely serious- you HAVE to read it) and I encourage any age of reader to buy it!This book matched up all my expectations-it was beautifully written, had no typos whatsoever, and was chock-full of so many plot twists and red herrings that I was glued to the page."},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"Great read for a rainy afternoon, however...

If she had indeed damaged her ankle, how could she have carried a body? If she hadn't hurt her ankle, why did she bring in Ruby Keene to replace her? Big hmm...)"},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"This was the first Miss Marple mystery I ever read, and though it isn't my favourite, I find that it is the one I return to most frequently when I want a well-worn, rainy-day read.In the author's foreword, Christie tells us that she wanted to use the well-known theme of a dead body discovered in a library, but gave herself certain conditions on her use of this clich&eacute;: \\"the library in question must be a highly orthodox and conventional library. The body on the other hand, must be a wildly improbable and highly sensational body.\\" Inspired by the sight of a crippled elderly man at a hotel she was staying in, who was surrounded by family members of the younger generation, Christie merged the two elements together, and arrived at: \\"The Body in the Library.\\"Arthur and Dolly Bantry awaken one morning, only to be told by a hysterical maid that there's a dead body in their library. The news is absurd, but the facts speak for themselves: a very young woman with platinum blonde hair and a sparkling party dress is lying strangled on the floor of their library. Naturally, Mrs Bantry calls up Miss Marple to cast her eye over the crime-scene, and keeps her informed when the police follow their leads to a seaside hotel.The deceased is Ruby Keene, a young woman who was the prot&eacute;g&eacute;e and about-to-be adopted daughter of the wheelchair-bound Conway Jefferson, a wealthy business magnate. This was to the discreet displeasure of his son-in-law Mark Gaskell and daughter-in-law Mrs Jefferson (the respective widow and widower of Jefferson's deceased son and daughter), who both had an excellent motive to kill the girl...but impeccable alibis. Throw in a dance hostess, a tennis instructor, a film director, and you have a fascinating little formula and a water-tight mystery.Whereas Christie's slightly-more-famous detective Hercule Poirot relied on cold, hard logic in the face of baffling mysteries, Miss Marple's techniques involve the study of human behaviour. One of her most famous characteristics is to take a crime and compare it to a domestic issue that took place in her village of St Mary Mead, in this case, she takes one look at the body in the library and makes mention of little Tommy Bond, who put a frog in his teacher's clock. It's not until much later that you realize the significance of this rather incongruous statement (and sometimes it can be a *little* hard to believe that she reaches these conclusions so quickly - the woman sometimes seems clairvoyant. But then again, Miss Marple IS much more intelligent than I am!) How she can tell that a couple is married, how a girl is lying, how a dancer wasn't wearing what she should have; all have solutions that will leave an awed sort of smile on your face.Christie herself had a razor-sharp mind, a cynical outlook and a great sense of humour, which means the characters and the human relationships they're involved in ring impeccably true, even by today's standards. For example, there is a moment in which a relative of Jefferson wishes that he'd chosen a girl of a higher social standing to be his prot&eacute;g&eacute;e, and Miss Marple gently points out that this would defeat the very purpose of the exercise. The fact that Ruby Keene was poor meant that as her benefactor, Jefferson would enjoy the way in which she was dazzled by his wealth and generosity. Marple compares the situation to King Cophetua and the beggar maid, and on reading the passage I remember marveling at the human truth of this situation: how the ego of an old man could colour what may initially appear to be simple altruism.In many ways, this is a comedic book: many of the characters are played for laughs, there is a shrewd eye turned to the portrayal of the upper and lower classes, and Christie even manages to name-drop herself when a young detective fan rattles off a list of his favourite mystery-writers. And yet, the tragic death of two girls lingers in the mind well after the book is finished. To a point, one can sympathize with the killer's disposal of common gold-digger...but in order to do so, he/she also had to snuff out the life of an innocent. The cunning of one life and the blamelessness of the other are held up in comparison; two lives that are linked only in death and a person's greed for fifty thousand pounds."},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"Many Agatha Christie fans love Hercule Poirot and detest Miss Jane Marple.

It had it all--a tennis player/dancer, inn worker, handicapped man with lots of money and heirs, some old friends of Miss Marple's who find a dead body in their library.

My suspicions proved correct.I'm not sure why ITV felt the need to change the original ending. Agatha Christie's is better and far more credible.I know she has her detractors, but I still think her plots are far cleverer than people give her credit for. With its twists and turns, its subplots, mazes and red herrings, The Body in the Library is up there with the best of Mrs Christie.The Night of Harrison Monk's Death: Jane Hetherington's Adventures in Detection: 1 (Volume 1)Pandora's Box: Jane Hetherington's Adventures in Detection: 2 (Volume 2)A Game of Cat and Mouse: Jane Hetherington's Adventures in Detection: 3 (Volume 3)April (Jane Hetherington's Adventures in Detection: 4)"},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"Miss Marple was on track in this one, I loved the visiting to the hotel and Miss Marple interaction with the cast of characters.

Was reminded when watching an old Dr. Who reminded me of the book. So I down loaded the book to re-read an old friend."},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"The body of a young woman is found in Colonel Bantry's library. Mrs Bantry immediately sends for her friend Miss Jane Marple and the Colonel sends for the police. It seems the victim is working temporarily at the Majestic Hotel as a dancer and has inveigled her way into the affections of one of the guests to the extent that Mr Jefferson wants to legally adopt her.This is of course means there are plenty of people who might have wanted Ruby dead including her fellow workers at the Majestic and Colonel Bantry's neighbours who are starting to mutter about there being \`no smoke without fire'. Can Miss Marple discover the murderer even though the police are baffled before the Colonel is completely ostracized by his friends?This is an intriguing mystery which will definitely keep the reader guessing right up until the end. Of course the solution is obvious when you look back on it but at the time it seems far from clear. This well written mystery shows Miss Marple at her best as she displays her inimitable knowledge of human nature."},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"This is a well-written story, with an interesting but not overwhelmingly intricate plot line, and it is really enhanced by Stephanie Cole's reading. Her voices for the characters are different enough so that you know who's speaking, but not at all overdone. It's quite amazing that she can believably personify so many characters of varying ages, genders, and classes.As for the story, it is classic Christie. Even though it takes place in a very different world from the present one, you care about the characters and what they're going through. It's always fun to guess at the murderer as the story goes along, but Christie once again manages to come up with a surprising ending.Excellent entertainment!"},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"The Bantry's awake one morning to find a dead body in their library. They know that they are innocent, but the inhabitants of St. Mary Mead are firm believers in the concept that there is no smoke without fire. Thankfully, Miss Marple (making her second appearance in a Christie novel) is on the job. She knows that she needs to get to the bottom of this, and quick. There are those who will kill when very large quantities of money are involved, and they will no doubt kill again.Agatha Christie is considered the queen of mysteries writers, and Miss Marple is one of her most famous creations. Do yourself a favor, and read this excellent book - you will also find yourself turned into a Christie fan! It's not for nothing that this book is considered a classic of detective fiction.(Review of The Body in the Library by Agatha Christie)"},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"The people of St. Mary Mead get hold of some juicy gossip when a body of an unknown young blonde woman is found in the library of the respectable Bantrys. As the suspicion falls on Colonel Bantry, Mrs. Bantry calls on Miss Marple to help solve this perplexing case. Investigations performed by Colonel Melchett and Inspector Slack of Radfordshire force lead them to the rich invalid, Conway Jefferson. With the inclusion of Conway Jefferson in the case, the investigation spans to The Majestic Hotel in the neighbouring county of Glenshire. But as the number of suspects grows, the police seem to have no headway in the case. Maybe the clever but practical mind of Miss Marple is what they need to solve this complex case.When I read the title of \`The Body In The Library', the first thing that popped up into my mind was the boardgame, Cluedo (Have your played it? It's quite fun actually). Maybe it was because of the clich&eacute;d setting of the murder in the library of the large house of the Bantrys. Reading the foreword of the author, I think Agatha Christie had the same thing in mind while writing this novel. The Body in the Library is Agatha Christie's take on the conventional setting of a murder mystery novel. But the \`conventional' element of the novel does not prevent it from being ingenious.The characters of the book were intriguing, especially Mr. Conway Jefferson. Unable to cope up with the death of his children in a plane crash, he keeps his daughter-in-law, Adelaide, and son-in-law, Mark, close to him. This obligation to remain continuously close to him does not only make Mark and Adelaide a little bitter towards him but also makes them feel trapped. Then there is the dead girl's cousin, Josie who rather than being sad at her cousin's death is actually angry at her for being dead. Even Mrs Bantry is an interesting character. Instead of being disturbed by the discovery of a dead body in her house, she decides to enjoy the situation. Another unusual thing about the book was the number of detectives working on the case. Surprisingly, the characters of the detectives were exact carbon copies of each other, so much so that I had often difficulty in distinguishing them. Maybe this was intentional as Agatha Christie wanted to show the readers that the all the detectives involved in this case, wholly depended upon the circumstantial and forensic evidence to solve the case. On the contrary, Miss Marple chooses to closely study the characters and habits of the suspects and the victim while trying to find the murderer.Though I had heard a lot of praise about Agatha Christie before reading this book, but this is the first Agatha Christie I have ever tried. After reading The Body in the Library, I must say that Agatha Christie is truly the Queen of Mysteries. The suspense that she builds up by the end of the novel is almost unbearable. Your hand will continuously twitch to turn to the last chapter to know the murderer. So, now I am ready to gobble up the rest of the Agatha Christie mysteries. It's a good thing that my sister owns almost 50 of them!!"},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"I got this title free through Amazon. It was a very easy read and a nice low-key, fluffy book. Miss Marple is cute. I wish she had been in the story more. She popped in the scenes here and there and was the person who eventually solved the crime (of course) but other characters dominated.The reason I gave this story a three is there was very little description of the surroundings. It's nice to get a feel for the characters by reading of their setting. Very little of this was done. Christie also repeated - a lot. 'The old many is fragile and could die at any moment.' was talked about repeatedly in the story.I didn't hate it, just had hopes for something better."},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"Not overly exciting.

She is a favorite character of mine. I shall read many more Agatha Christie mysteries in the Miss Marple series"},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"I am a big fan of Agatha Christie and usually love her books but this one was a bit confusing."},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"A Solid Murder-MysteryThis Agatha Christie novel is a solid story with some very interesting characters. And best of all, it jumps right into the intrigue when Dolly Bantry, Mistress of Gossington Hall, is informed by her housemaid that a body has been found in the estate's library. From that point on, the cast of characters is introduced, and one-by-one they are added to the possible list of suspects - or at least people of interest.Agatha Christie uses just the right touch of humor and suspense in this book. I consider it a classic that should be read by most school children. It is short enough to not intimidate the average reader, yet long enough to be a memorable read.The motive and suspects are just vague enough to keep the reader guessing at \\"Who-dunnit?\\" the whole story. The only flaw in this book is that the reader is never really given enough information about one of the characters - Dinah Lee. Other than that, this is another must-read by Agatha Christie."},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"I have been following this series with a lot of excitment. I love this writer and have enjoyed all of her books. I know you will too. If you haven't tried one of her great mysteries you should. You have no idea what an entertaining time you are missing."},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"Miss Marple is called to the home of her friend Dolly Bantry when a dead body is discovered in the library. The body is that of a young girl and Dolly is afraid that her husband will be accused of the crime. Miss Marple does some sleuthing, along with some professional investigators, and of course she comes up with the solution to the crime before they do. All of the usual motives of love and money are involved and the solution is a typical complex web which is common to Agatha Christie's mysteries. This book is not quite as ingenious as others in the series and moves at a somewhat slow pace, so it doesn't rate 5 stars, but it is a good read nevertheless."},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"A unknown blonde female body is found in the library of a wealthy colonel. As the cops are called so is the old detective, Miss Marple. again she catches the murderer i thought was innocent. I enjoy her so much, especially the way she trappes the killers in mental games to make them slip. In this book she does it and the murder doesn't know what is coming. I like her alot better then Mr.Hercule Poriot. that is my opinion. it is great to see a women solve a crime once in a while. This is a great book for just about any age, especially those interested in murder mysteries."},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"It was amazing that how a body is found in a library and then how Miss Marple twists you and then when you think you know who did it you're wrong. You start to think that the characters are real and by the way Agatha Christie weaves the plot to make it different. Great suspenseful book!"},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"I have been a professional detective for over ten years and I can tell you that while the ending is surprising, the facts do not quite fit together as well as other Agatha Christie books. I would recommend it to the diehard Agatha Christie fans but would suggest that newcomers to Agatha Christie start with Murder on the Orient Express, And Then There Were None, or Death on the Nile."},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"Other readers have criticized this book as being boring or lax in the action department. However, I think that Dame Agatha didn't go out to lunch in this one--she just wrote a book that falls in closely to real life.I have been a detective for 11 years and I can tell you that not every homicide has cutting edge action. There are tiresome investigations, questioning, dead-end leads, and many more things that would lull any human to sleep. Christie must have known that sometimes things aren't that interesting and can't always be some cop and robber chase scene. Miss Marple is merely taking things slowly (as she should--she's not young anymore) and gathering the evidence prudently.Perhaps Christie really did have a dry spell and this was the result of it. She may not have been trying to make a realistic book. In any event, the fact is this book is realistic, by chance or purpose it matters not."},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"I read a couple of other reviews that described this story as boring. I could not disagree more. Really enjoyed Agatha Christie's descriptions of the characters and how they interacted with each other. Very fun to read, especially the chapters that included Mrs. Bantry. The ending surprised me, but it was explained very well and wasn't just thrown in to wrap up the story. This is the first Miss Marple mystery I have read, and I will definitely read more of them."},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"The Body in the Library is an Agatha Christie murder mystery.

He does not report the vehicle's disappearance unto the police until the following morning.Miss Marple's sharp eyes and sleuthing genius solve the case. This is one of Agatha's Christie's finest mysteries. Enjoy it and see if you can guess whodunit!"},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"Agatha Christie (1890-1976) is the best known mystery novelist of the 20th Century--and with good reason, for when it came to plots, truly fiendish plots, she could easily out-construct all competitors. She also had a knack for writing tongue-in-cheek, exhibiting a sly sense of humor for those sharp enough to catch it. The 1942 THE BODY IN THE LIBRARY is an excellent example of both.The title is a classic cliche, immediately bringing to mind an old fashioned whodunit of the Mary Roberts Rinehart type, the sort of novel in which an improbable victim is discovered in an impossible setting. But Christie twists the cliche, playing upon the idea in an darkly comic sort of way. After all, what would you do if you awoke one morning to find a bleached blonde strangled to death and tossed on the library floor before the fireplace?As it happens--and most fortunately--Col. and Mrs. Bantry know an expert in all things homocidal: everyone's favorite spinster lady, Miss Marple. When the victim is traced to a nearby resort, Mrs. Bantry wastes little time in booking rooms for both Miss Marple and herself and the hunt is on, complete with a series of unbreakable alibis, hidden motives, and a classic Christie plot twist at the end.THE BODY IN THE LIBRARY does not really compete with Christie's absolute best--but then few titles, regardless of author, do. But it is among her most witty works, a fast-paced read that can be swallowed whole in a single sitting. Recommended.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"Miss Marple's second outing seems a trifle tired. The writing appears forced at times, even repetitious, and there is too much foreshadowing. The ending is a long time in coming and stretches credulity. Not a bad book but certainly not in the same league with Agatha Christie's best works."},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"Great stuff.

Near the end the book rushes to finish as Miss Marple starts jumping to conclusions without sharing most of her insights until the coda chapter. But it's still a fun read."},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"This may be more engaging as a 'real read' than as an audio listen, so I will add my 2-cents: fine for commuting, but somewhat dissatisfying audio book - average with Stephanie Cole. As to the story, (1) predictability is really quite tenuous, and (2) character development provides few whom the listener can 'love.' Reason to care about the body in the library? A sweet young thing pretty much covers it. A bit of fun is had when Miss Marple unravels the case in closing, showing all the pert signs of a sweet, perceptive and well-grounded English villager."},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"Agatha is the best at what she does and this book is a prime demonstration of that fact. I love the quaint style and vivid (but not boring) descriptions.A first time Christie reader would do well with this one."},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"After reading a number of Hercule Poirot novels, I decided to give Agatha Christie's other famous detective a try. Enter Miss Jane Marple in The Body in the Library. When a married couple wake up one morning to find a dead girl in their library, they call Miss Marple to help them clear up the mystery. It seems that no one even knows who the poor girl is, let alone how or why her body got into the house. Working in her own somewhat eccentric style, she sets out to find the murderer. In typical Christie fashion, we start to assemble a motley array of suspects for Marple to talk to until she unravels the mystery.One thing you definitely have to give Christie credit for is that Miss Marple is no female knockoff of Poirot. She is an old Spinster who seems to be able to immediately predict anyone's behavior by comparing them to various people who live in her village. Once she matches the stranger with the correct villager, she seemingly knows everything they are capable of. Frankly, I found this to be pretty unrealistic and even irritating by the time I was halfway through the book. It's all so pat and simplistic that it's pretty ridiculous. I do think the overall tone is meant to be tongue-in-cheek but I can't say it worked for me. Compared to Poirot, Sherlock Holmes, Nero Wolfe, and nearly every detective series I've tried, this one just didn't interest me enough to want to read a second Miss Marple novel. Don't get me wrong, it's far from the worst mystery novel I've read, it just wasn't particularly good either. I would only recommend it to those who are already confirmed Marple fans."},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"Page after page of shallow character development would be tolerable if the characters weren't so utterly boring.Not a typical Christie yarn. Very little development of the mystery - except for page after page of people who aren't Miss Marple speculating. No puzzles to unravel. Just endless details about these boring characters until the end."},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"Body in the Library is just another book from Agatha Christie and, as the others, it is amazing.The body of a young blond woman is found in Ms Bantry's library. That's when Miss Maple comes to action in order to solve the mistery.Agatha has the gift to transport her readers to a misterious atmosphere, in a way that few authors do. You will feel just as if you were inside the book. You will devour it instead of reading it, without stopping.Her characters are truly fascinating for the way they can be close to reality and are usually alegoric. The end is, as usual, extremely surprising. It's worth reading every page of it."},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"This book was the first Agatha Christie book I read, and I thought it was boaring. So I thought that Christie wasent a really good writer. But then I read some of her other books, and they were great! I recomend to all: Don't read this book. I think you will find it boaring. (I want to get in contact with other Agatha Christie fans. I am a 12 yeard old girl from Norway.)"},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"The Body in the Library is of course classic Agatha Christie. The book evokes a particular time and place inhabited by generally interesting characters. I haven't read this in a long time and was surprized at how good it is.

Some of the plot was confusing and the book jumped around too much. Miss Marple was clever in the way she tought to catch the killer. The way she thought and sorted through ideas kept you wanting to read. I feel that this book deserves atmost three stars, because it sort of kept you wondering and guessing.

I never suspected the ending, even though I know thatChristie always has the most unlikely person as the murderer. Read it!"},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"The well-ordered world of Colonel and Mrs. Bantry is turned on its ear one morning when the body of a young woman is found in their library. Neither the Bantrys nor their staff knew the young woman, Ruby Keene, a dance hostess at the nearby Majestic Hotel. Fearing what the whispers in the village will do to her husband's reputation, Dolly Bantry calls her friend and sleuth, Miss Jane Marple. She and Miss Marple check in to the Majestic Hotel and begin investigating. They meet Conway Jefferson, an old man who had been planning to adopt the victim, and his young in-laws, all survivors of an accident that killed Jefferson's children. Ruby's cousin Josie also works at the hotel, having gotten Ruby the job when she hurt her ankle. Additional suspects are the too-handsome dance instructor, a poorly-spoken young guest of the hotel, and a neighbor of the Bantrys who throws too many film industry parties his neighbors do not approve of. In the end, Miss Marple has the whole thing figured out well in advance of the police, who fall for an obvious red herring before she straightens them out.Christie writes with typical British wit and humor, wry observations appearing here and there, such as a reference to a woman who regularly ministered to the poor, no matter how hard they tried to avoid her. Miss Marple's character is smarter than everyone else, but not in the least arrogant about it, finding effusive praise somewhat trying and deflecting any boastful claims about her abilities.An enjoyable read, I recommend this book for a quiet afternoon or evening when it can suck you right into polite English country society and amuse with its light sense of humor. It's easy to see why Christie's books have such timeless appeal."},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"I don't know why anyone would buy a book by Agatha Christie expecting sex and violence. Her style was to create the atmosphere of an English village before 1935 and to create a puzzle involving the death of someone in the village. Her detectives don't beat anyone up or make love to the suspects. Her detective is given the same clues that the reader sees, and in the last chapter, the detective weaves the relevant clues into the solution. In The Body in the Library, the detective is Jane Marple, an elderly spinster who uses a sharp mind so solve the puzzle. I like the early Jane Marple mysteries; The Body in the Library is fairly typical. You might find this book more enjoyable if you first read The Murder at the Vicarage."},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"The Body In The Library was a very appealing novel. It caught my attention and kept my interests. The author, Agatha Christie did a wonderful job of portraying the character Miss Marple. She did a great job of keeping the curiousity of the reader. I am not a big reader and this novel captured my attention right away. The body of the beautiful blonde found in the library was a great way to introduce mystery. The fact that no one knew who she was or how she got there was personally intriguing. Marple's techniques in finding the killer were smartand sharply thought out. She reminds me of Matlock because she tricks the accused into leading her to the truth. I think this novel is a great mystery for all students to read. I recommend it to all who enjoy thriller novels."},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"In the author's foreword to The Body in the Library Christie writes: \\"I laid down for myself certain conditions. The library in question must be a highly orthodox and conventional library. The body, on the other hand, must be a wildly improbably and highly sensational body.\\"Christie kept to her conditions, and the results were very nice indeed. Whenever I read a Miss Marple book that I really like, I say that \\"this is my favorite Miss Marple\\". But I really think that The Body in the Library may well be my actual favorite Miss Marple. I have read that Christie herself thought that it was the best opening she ever wrote.What makes it a favorite? The contrasts between a flashy dead girl and the house in which she clearly does not belong are a part of it. It allows for a very nice exploration of life in St. Mary Mead. The characters are also top notch. The Bantrys are warm and funny, but still have their own depth. Conway Jefferson, permanently in mourning, is one of the most interesting characters in the Christie body of work. Still very nice to read after all these years."},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"Agatha Christie's the Body in the Library is truly a great mystery book. Of course, Agatha Christie does not need any additional praise from humble me to boost her reputation as an unparallelled author of mysteries. In this book, the corpse of a young woman is found in the library of Gossington Hall, the home of a well-to-do colonel and his wife. Miss Marple, in conjunction with the police, sets out to investigate. She comes upon many discoveries, and it can be seen that many parties benefit from the death of the woman in the library and/or have the opportunity to kill her. As the investigations progress, a possibly related incident occurs: a car burned to shrapnel in a neighboring region. Miss Marple, of course, with her impeccable investigative prowess and sharp eye for detail, solves the mystery methodically and impressively. The outcome is dazzling and this book is a great read for all mystery-lovers out there."},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"I confess to absolutely loving Dame Agatha's Miss Marple books; I suppose I find the coziness of them soothing, or something. I especially enjoy this one because of the presence of Col. &amp; Mrs. Bantry. Miss Marple's character becomes more rounded as we see her interact with her friends. I agree with those readers who noted less &quot;action&quot; in this book, but I don't think that dooms it to being a bad book--it's just a change of pace, which is often refreshing."},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"As a teenager, I devoured one Miss Marple mystery after the other, feeling all the time slmildly uneasy for wasting my time on such fluff. But as I grow older and read more and better, and as I'm less influenced by the opinion of the powers that be, Agatha Christie grows in my mind.Miss Marple is one of the most popular literary figures of the 20th Century, and yet she does not have the literary status of Sherlock Holmes. She's not required reading in high school literature courses, and she should be.Agatha Christie created an entire litererary genre, which is not the same as the genre created by Conan Doyle (whose unabridged Sherlock Holmes I'ver read with great pleasure cover to cover three times). I think it's fair to say that in some significant way, her mysteries are more similar to the novels of Jane Austen than to those of Conan Doyle. Austen and Christie are fundamentally all about the motivations in human psychology. Where Holmes looks at a person's fingernails and deduces she is a musician, Christie watches a couple quarrel, and deduces they are really married, though they pretend otherwise. For her, such evidence is as solid as a footprint, and based on it, conclusions can be drawn.Nevertheless, she does revert to simple forensic evidence before convicting anyone. Her plots are always complicated, but Christie always provides a unique solution. If she did not, she would not be great. In th case of the Body in the Library, there is as usual all sorts of evidence floating around to confuse you and occupy your mind, but 3 pieces of evidence in the end identify the murderer uniquely.An inattentive reader might finish the book concluding that had Christie modified the plot just a little, the outcome might have been different. Not so. Not any more than Dorothy could have stayed in Oz or Hamlet survived. Christie creates an entire self-consistent and carefully planned microcosm of motivations. However, in this case, the identities are veiled, the dynamo which drives the plot is the who-done-it. In this regard, her genre, of course, is in Doyle's tradition.And I so much like Miss Marple as a literary figure -- the enlightened being, British style. She lives in British society with its commoners and gentry, but is somehow neither. She easily consorts and sympathizes with both. She seeks neither wealth nor fame. She is content, fearless. Her mind and emotions are steady without being cold. And she does not pass judgement on her fellow man, though she stands unflinching in the face of justice -- Nemesis, she is called in one novel. She always knows who did it at the precise moment when all the evidence is in. In this case, that happened when the little boy showed her the clipped nails. Inspector Slack dismisses him as irrelevant. Marple does not. To her all men are created equal. Yet each is unique and understood on his or her own terms. Best of all, Christie accomplishes this through a truly endearing personality -- one with a penchant for tea and herbaceous borders, and a tendency, like most of us, to slip a stitch, though most of hers are literal rather than metaphorical"},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"What \\"improvements\\" have been made for the Black Dog & Leventhal edition? There are already major differences in punctuation, word choices, and scene breaks between the original Collins and Dodd Mead editions of this novel. There are further differences between the Dodd Mead editions republished by Random House/Avenel and the Dodd Mead editions republished by Simon & Shuster/Pocket. There are further additions still in the Signet, Bantam, and Berkley editions. For every publishing house putting out her works, there seem to be a new batch of editors altering Agatha Christie's words and the sound of her voice. What's the matter with these publishers? Whose voice do they think we want to hear when we sit down to a novel by Agatha Christie? And what will she sound like twenty years from now? It's frightening that her estate has failed to see the importance of guarding her words as she wrote them. Please tell me I'm not the only one here who senses that a crime has been committed."},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"\\"Oh, ma'am, oh, ma'am, there's a body in the library!\\"Mary, the usually calm maid, is unfortunate enough to find the body of a dead girl in the middle of the Bantry's library. Nobody recognizes the murdered girl. She doesn't belong in the sleepy town of St. Mary Mead. Miss Jane Marple, the inquisitive investigator, whose forte is the ability to draw connections in human nature between suspects and villagers in St. Mary Mead, is brought into the case by her friend Dolly Bantry. The local police are also hot on the trail of the suspects. The body is identified as that of Ruby Keene, a young dancer at the Majestic Hotel. The list of suspects include: Basil Blake, an obnoxious young man; Mark Gaskell and Adelaide Jefferson, whose inheritance would be in jeopardy if Ruby Keene was adopted by Conway Jefferson, their father-in-law; Josephine Turner, Ruby's distant cousin; George Bartlett, a guest at the Majestic where Ruby worked; and Raymond Starr, a dancer at the Majestic.Agatha Christie, the author of this book, takes us on an exciting adventure to unravel the mystery of Ruby Keene's murder. In her usual fashion, Agatha Christie keeps us in suspense until the very end. I've read several of Agatha Christie's murder mysteries, and I was not disappointed with this book. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys murder mysteries.Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot are two of Agatha Christie's unforgettable characters. Miss Marple stories revolve in and around St. Mary Mead, a quaint little English town. Poirot on the other hand, travels all over Europe to solve mysteries."},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"I picked this up, half-way kidding to show my mom (who is going to be a librarian) when I was looking for a book for my sophomore English class. I decided to check it out with about 10 other books and I eventually chose it to read. I ended up really enjoying it. Her plot is so interwoven and threw me off the trail of the murderer many times. The characters felt real to me and I am looking forward to reading another one of her novels."},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"Agatha Christie dedicated her 1941 crime novel, &quot;The Body In the Library&quot;, with affection to her brother-in-law who had expressed a wish to find a body in the first chapter of her next book. Agatha Christie so contrived a response that the body could be found in the library at Gossington Hall, home of Colonel and Mrs Bantry, neighbors of her famous spinster sleuth Miss Marple.Accordingly, readers can expect to be entertained by mystery and mayhem, fortified by tea and sympathy, culminating in a well-explained denouement. Many of this writer's former conjuring tricks as well as one or two new one are provided, framed in a setting that has similarities to that of Dorothy L Sayers' &quot;Have His Carcase&quot;, and re-working a formula used previously in her own &quot;Death On the Nile&quot;. You might, like me, consider that the writer withholds too much information that might facilitate identifying the guilty, but a check will show that she provides clues (although well hidden) during the entertainment.As cozy as they come, and with less thrills and action than most, this is one of Agatha Christie's better middle order crime novels."},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"Dolly Bantry was slowly waking to the usual sounds of her well run household. Her peaceful, predictable life was thoroughly disrupted when her maid entered, bringing not the expected morning tea, but news of a body in the library! Not only a body, but a young woman! Platinum blonde no less! When her husband could supply no explanation for this occurance Dolly did the only sensible thing - she called her friend and neighbor, Jane Marple.Miss Marple set about her inquiries and, aided by the police, began to sort out the mess. The trail led to the film industry and then to the nearby seaside resort of Danemouth where the wealthy guests and the staff of the Majestic Hotel become embroiled in the mystery. Ultimately Miss Marple solves the crime, bringing the culprits to justice and saving her friends from a life time of suspicion.This 1941 work reflects small town English life and morals of the time. The reader needs to keep this mind and not try to see the story in a more contremporary light. It mattered very much at that time whether or not a couple was married or living in sin, teenage girls could be convinced that a talent scout could pick them out of a crowd and the suspicion of a middle-aged man's daliance with a young woman would lead to social exclusion for the whole family.The plot is, as always in a Christie mystery, fairly laid out with all the clues available to the reader. While the reader may get a suspicion of a red herring and even narrow the field of suspects I doubt that any will arrive at all the answers before Miss Marple reveals all."},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"I confess to absolutely loving Dame Agatha's Miss Marple books. I suppose I find the coziness of them soothing. I enjoyed this one because of the presence of Col. &amp; Mrs. Bantry but it was not quite up to par with most of her others.

I agree with those readers who noted less &quot;action&quot; in this book, but I don't think that dooms it to being a bad book--it's just a change of pace, which is often refreshing."},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"I read The Body in the Library when I was probably 12 or so and developed a great admiration for Agatha Christie and Miss Marple. (Can't say I like Hercule Poirot that much, but that's just me). Anyway, I went on to read a great many of the books, but always remember The Body as my first and one of my favourites. Now 23 years later, I bought a copy to read on vacation and I am loving it again. I still remember details from the first time I read it. I think that Agatha Christie was the best classic English mystery writer ever and Miss Marple was one of her best creations. Bravo!"},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"Like all Agatha Christies to me are just beautifuly written.I enjoyed reading this one; if you plan on reding The Mirror crack\`d fom side to side this on is a must it has back ground that will make that book a breeze!"},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"Okay, so I'm a fan of Miss Marple, and this is a fine story, so on that count I give it five stars.But in reading it on the Kindle, while the visual format is fine, there is a rather annoying problem: all speaking parts begin with a reverse apostrophy instead of a quotation. The effect of this is that when your start the text-to-speach (TTS) function, every speaking part opens with the Kindle saying \\"backquote,\\" as in'I did not commit that murder!' being read as \\"backquoteI did not commit that murder.\\" Minus two stars.Perhaps the publisher will fix that and push the repaired version to our Kindles. Or maybe it's just a new technique for saying on th ebook page that TTS is enabled, but still maintain their audiobook sales."},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"Many readers and critics have commented that the opening of Agatha Christie's &quot;The Body in the Library&quot; is not merely lighthearted but really funny. A sleeping couple is informed by an hysterical maid that there is a body in the library, a fact first the wife's and then her spouse's sleepy brain refuses to accept. Since neither of them have a clue who she is, we know we are off on a typically atypical Christie jaunt.The tongue-in-cheek feeling you will detect in the first chapters is utterly proven when a young lad includes Christie's own name in a list of mystery writers who sent him their autograph. Even the detective's inappropriate name, Inspector Slack, adds to the humor of this lovely little mystery.I notice that while the David Suchet television versions of the Poirot mysteries stray from the details of their sources, the Joan Hickson Miss Marple ones are fairly faithful. Therefore if you can get your hand on the HBO recording of this episode, you would probably enjoy reading the book first and then watching the video.Or perhaps better still, you can now hear the entire novel read on Audio Partner tapes or CDs by that stalwart British actress, Stephanie Cole, who is best known as the crusty Diana Trent in &quot;Waiting For God.&quot; Her deep voice can capture those of the male and female characters quite nicely; and while she does not go in for any grand displays of voice characterization (a problem when Christie does not identify the speaker during long exchanges), she is never less than arresting and a good choice for this sort of reading.The playing clocks in at 5 hours, 23 minutes."},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"One morning the body of a beautiful but rather cheap-looking girl is found in the library of Colonel and Mrs. Bantry at Gossington Hall. The Bantrys don't have a clue of the identity of this unfortunate girl. Luckily Miss Marple is there to help the police in their investigations and guide them politely to the discoveries that will solve this complex case.Following Murder at the Vicarage (1930) and The Thirteen Problems (1932) this is Miss Jane Marples third appearance. Why Christie waited more than a decade to get back to her old spinster in 1942 remains unknown, but it might have something to do with the enormous popularity of her private detective with the little grey cells: Hercule Poirot.The come-back of Miss Marple has not really the same spirit as the bulk of Agatha Christie pre-war books. It certainly lacks the freshness of Vicarage, although some characters from that book make their second appearance in The Body in the Library. The characters are drawn in the typical style that has become a trademark of Christie, so nothing wrong with that. The ending though is so utterly unlikely that is gives you a rather bitter aftertaste. From a whodunit point of view the end is neatly composed and proves the master ship of the Dame of Crime, but that is far from what real life is supposed to offer. I know, you shouldn't expect realistic story-lines if you open an Agatha Christie novel, but there are certain limits."},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"I enjoyed reading but some way could not get really get into it.But, I also could not figure out &#34;who did it&#34;."},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"What can you say about agatha?

I am fairly certain, though, that The Body in the Library is Christie's shortest novel. As a result, it's an especially quick and quickly-paced read, with the plot taking whip-sharp turns in each chapter. But despite the novel's tortuousness, it does not lack at all for neat logic and a satisfying denouement. In fact, this is an extremely satisfying mystery, complete with a complex crime, acute psychological observations and characterizations, and a creative crime solving from Miss Marple. This novel served as sort of an introduction to Agatha Christie's mysteries, and I'm sure that it would be an excellent read for any of her readers, new or old."},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"I had no idea who the killer was in The Body in the Library. The reveal was a complete surprise, but made sense when thinking back. Still, I never would have considered the possibility of the mystery ending this way.Miss Marple truly shines in The Body in the Library. I loved the village life comparisons she used to point out possible reasons why a suspect may be behaving as they were. And of course, she outwits everyone in the end. Luckily the police know to take this little old lady seriously.The victim works in a resort as a dancer. Some of the suspects are staying at the resort on a long term holiday. I found it almost impossible to relate to and it was a bit hard to grasp their situation. The characters didn't seem extremely rich, but I suppose it does fit in with what I know of the time Christie was writing about.The Body in the Library was a fantastic mystery. Miss Marple was the most interesting character, by far. She and the unforeseeable conclusion were the major high points of the book. I loved the time spent at the resort, but some of the time spent in the village where the body was found was a little dull. Overall, it's safe to say that The Body in the Library has become one of my favorite Marple mysteries."},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"I love Miss Marple stories, and I've enjoyed listening to the CDs in the car."},{"Title":"The Body in the Library","review":"I first read Agatha Christie's The Body In the Library several years ago, and to be honest, I really didn't like it very much (a rarity for a Christie book, as I am a huge fan of hers).

Cole does an absolutely marvelous job with all the characters, giving each a different inflection and filling each word with the appropriate emotion and feeling.

I read this edition (Pocket book, 1970), and I was attracted to the initial romanticism of a dead body in a private library. Libraries are dark and notoriously eerie.The book starts off hilariously, but quickly becomes an interesting investigation that shakes up a bourgeoise English town. I was suprised at how quiet Miss Marple is, and how much she sort of disappears into the background. It isn't until the end that she even begins raising her voice to get some answers.The investigation itself is nothing new. People are questioned and the reader is led to believe the facts fit together. Miss Marple, of course, provides the fresh insight that ultimately twists everything around. \\"Why didn't I think of that?\\" becomes the embarrassing thought in every policeman's -- and reader's -- minds.Unfortunately, this being the third Christie book I've read, I didn't get that thrilling feeling of following a murder case in an exotic locale. For this, I recommend And Then There Were None, or Murder on the Orient Express. Also, I've come to realize that, as a reader, I prefer multiple murders, serial killings, and inevitable doom. In The Body in the Library, we have nearly three murders, but I wanted more!The book itself is an extremely easy and quick read, making for a great summer/travel read.

I can't list even the obvious problems in the 1000 words I'm allowed here. The writing styles range from Stephen King's &quot;creative asides&quot; which attempt to educate the reader in the art of screenwriting by telling us what to write instead of showing us, to Ed Gorman's rip-off of William Goldman's style (next time he should rip off a decent story, too). In all, the book includes four feature-length scripts, two shorts, and one 50 pager. In the title for this review I said &quot;Six awful screenplays;&quot; the seventh is a short by Harlan Ellison which isn't exactly horror, but it's a cute little murder story with a surprising yet inevitable ending.

Perez. What are we to make of this statement? Talisman, prayer, abuse? None or all of the above? And then some? For it requires a literary critic - or a reader with the deep knowledge of a critic - to come to terms with this text. The depth and breadth attempted by Perez are fascinating, though the speed at which he moves through his self-proclaimed piece of \\"transgressive fiction\\" can be trying. Nonetheless, the text is a significant positive addition to a genre too often inundated with cheap and meaningless prose.Perez's deep interest in language is reaffirmed with each discrete segment of the text, which progress in a generally linear manner according to the three major parts of the book: the Crucifixion, the Resurrection, and the Ascension and/or Descension. A Glossary completes the text and provides references in four languages, as well as scientific and religious-theoretical terms. In these individual segments, sometimes a fragment, sometimes a few pages long, the Eunuch serves the Evil Queen in every possible capacity, graphically and carefully catalogued by Perez. The formatting of these segments plays an important role in a reading of the text, imposing a pace and rhythm that owes as much to contemporary poetry as it does to hypertext.With such skill as is displayed in The Evil Queen, and with such a demonstrated love for the theory and practice of language and writing, future work from Perez will be as worthy of notice as his debut. Perez is a bright new talent worth keeping an eye on, and The Evil Queen is a promising achievement."},{"Title":"The Evil Queen: A Pornolexicology","review":"Wow. This book is a real treat.

The reissue of this classic work, written right after WWII to vindicate the man who had done the most to give birth to the Soviet experiment and had been written out of its history by Stalin and his henchmen, is welcome. We are allowed to remember what we would rather forget, that despite our difficulties with Boshevism it did seek to right the wrong of Tsarism, one of the most backward, brutal, and desensitizing systems of oppression known to European man up to that time. Trotsky was unquestionably a genius, a hero, and of course also a man of weaknesses and ego who set the Soviet Union on a path which he could easily justify but which could also be used for more narrow and nefarious purposes by his old enemy, Joseph Stalin. Stalin in fact, while opposing Trotsky at almost every turn before and after Lenin's death, managed in the end to adopt Trotsky's economic policies with a ruthlessness which Trotsky would have approved had he not been forced to disapprove of it as a proscribed enemy of Stalinism.Trotsky demonstrates that a certain logic of history, in this case Russian history, a history half-European and half-Asiatic, forced the liberation of Russia to become its subjugation to a tyrrany more verbally benevolent but no less horrible than Tsarism. Trotsky was undoubtedly a more enlightened and humane man than the half-barbarian Stalin, but it is not clear that had he beaten Stalin he would have been able to do better than Stalin in two tasks: setting Russia on a path of industrialization and modernization and defeating Hitler. For Stalin, lest we forget because of his crimes, Stalin did these two important things and did them very well indeed.To relive the heroic days of the Russian Revolution is to be reminded that once Russian Socialism (including Bolshevism) deserved the respect of the onlooking world. The Cold War has distorted much about this history and hidden much from our eyes. We have allowed ourselves to adopt the counter-revolutionary ideology of the reactionary classes when it comes to the birth of Soviet Russia. Isaac Deutscher deserves praise for not only restoring our view of Trotsky but for having restored our view of the Russian revolutionary tradition."},{"Title":"The Prophet Armed: Trotsky 1879-1921.","review":"THIS YEAR MARKS THE 66TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ASSASSINATION OF LEON TROTSKY-ONE OF HISTORY'S GREAT REVOLUTIONARIES. IT IS THEREFORE FITTING TO REVIEW THE THREE VOLUME WORK OF HIS DEFINITIVE BIOGRAPHER, THE PROPHET ARMED, THE PROPHET UNARMED, THE OUTCAST.Isaac Deutscher's three-volume biography of the great Russian Bolshevik leader Leon Trotsky although written over one half century ago remains the standard biography of the man. Although this writer disagrees , as I believe that Trotsky himself would have, about the appropriateness of the title of prophet and its underlying premise that a tragic hero had fallen defeated in a worthy cause, the vast sum of work produced and researched makes up for those basically literary differences. Deutscher, himself, became in the end an adversary of Trotsky's politics around his differing interpretation of the historic role of Stalinism and the fate of the Fourth International but he makes those differences clear and in general they does not mar the work. I do not believe even with the eventual full opening of all the old Soviet-era files any future biographer will dramatically increase our knowledge about Trotsky and his revolutionary struggles. Moreover, as I have mentioned elsewhere in other reviews while he has not been historically fully vindicated he is in no need of any certificate of revolutionary good conduct.At the beginning of the 21st century when the validity of socialist political programs as tools for change is in apparent decline or disregarded as utopian it may be hard to imagine the spirit that drove Trotsky to dedicate his whole life to the fight for a socialist society. However, at the beginning of the 20th century he represented only the one of the most consistent and audacious of a revolutionary generation of mainly Eastern Europeans and Russians who set out to change the history of the 20th century. It was as if the best and brightest of that generation were afraid, for better or worse, not to take part in the political struggles that would shape the modern world. As Trotsky noted elsewhere this element was missing, with the exceptions of Rosa Luxemburg, Karl Liebknecht and precious few others, in the Western labor movement. Deutscher using Trotsky's own experiences tells the story of the creation of this revolutionary cadre with care and generally proper proportions. Here are some highlights militant leftists should think about.On the face of it Trotsky's personal profile does not stand out as that of a born revolutionary. Born of a hard working, eventually prosperous Jewish farming family in the Ukraine (of all places) there is something anomalous about his eventual political occupation. Always a vociferous reader, good writer and top student under other circumstances he would have found easy success, as others did, in the bourgeois academy, if not in Russia then in Western Europe. But there is the rub; it was the intolerable and personally repellant political and cultural conditions of Czarist Russia in the late 19th century that eventually drove Trotsky to the revolutionary movement- first as a \`ragtag' populist and then to his life long dedication to orthodox Marxism. As noted above, a glance at the biographies of Eastern European revolutionary leaders such as Lenin, Martov, Christian Rakovsky, Bukharin and others shows that Trotsky was hardly alone in his anger at the status quo. And the determination to something about it.For those who argue, as many did in the New Left in the 1960's, that the most oppressed are the most revolutionary the lives of the Russian and Eastern European revolutionaries provide a cautionary note. The most oppressed, those most in need of the benefits of socialist revolution, are mainly wrapped up in the sheer struggle for survival and do not enter the political arena until late, if at all. Even a quick glance at the biographies of the secondary leadership of various revolutionary movements, actual revolutionary workers who formed the links to the working class , generally show skilled or semi-skilled workers striving to better themselves rather than the most downtrodden lumpenproletarian elements. The sailors of Kronstadt and the Putilov workers in Saint Petersburg come to mind. The point is that \`the wild boys and girls' of the street do not lead revolutions; they simply do not have the staying power. On this point, militants can also take Trotsky's biography as a case study of what it takes to stay the course in the difficult struggle to create a new social order. While the Russian revolutionary movement, like the later New Left mentioned above, had more than its share of dropouts, especially after the failure of the 1905 revolution, it is notably how many stayed with the movement under much more difficult circumstances than we ever faced. For better or worst, and I think for the better, that is how revolutions are made.Once Trotsky made the transition to Marxism he became embroiled in the struggles to create a unity Russian Social Democratic Party, a party of the whole class, or at least a party representing the historic interests of that class. This led him to participate in the famous Bolshevik/Menshevik struggle in 1903 which defined what the party would be, its program, its methods of work and who would qualify for membership. The shorthand for this fight can be stated as the battle between the \`hards' (Bolsheviks, who stood for a party of professional revolutionaries) and the \`softs' (Mensheviks, who stood for a looser conception of party membership) although those terms do not do full justice to these fights. Strangely, given his later attitudes, Trotsky stood with the \`softs', the Mensheviks, in the initial fight in 1903. Although Trotsky almost immediately afterward broke from that faction I do not believe that his position in the 1903 fight contradicted the impulses he exhibited throughout his career- personally \`libertarian', for lack of a better word , and politically hard in the clutch.Even a cursory glance at most of Trotsky's career indicates that it was not spent in organizational in-fighting, or at least not successfully. Trotsky stands out as the consummate free-lancer. More than one biographer has noted this condition, including his definitive biographer Isaac Deutscher. Let me make a couple of points to take the edge of this characterization though. In that 1903 fight mentioned above Trotsky did fight against Economism (the tendency to only fight over trade union issues and not fight overtly political struggles against the Czarist regime) and he did fight against Bundism (the tendency for one group, in this case the Jewish workers, to set the political agenda for that particular group). Moreover, he most certainly favored a centralized organization. These were the key issues at that time. Furthermore, the controversial organizational question did not preclude the very strong notion that a \`big tent' unitary party was necessary. The \`big tent' German Social Democratic model held very strong sway among the Russian revolutionaries for a long time, including Lenin's Bolsheviks. The long and short of it was that Trotsky was not an organization man, per se. He knew how to organize revolutions, armies, Internationals, economies and so on when he needed to but on a day to day basis no. Thus, to compare or contrast him to Lenin and his very different successes is unfair. Both have an honorable place in the revolutionary movement; it is just a different place.That said, Trotsky really comes into his own as a revolutionary leader in the Revolution of 1905 not only as a publicist but as the central leader of the Soviets (workers councils) which made their first appearance at that time. In a sense it is because he was a freelancer that he was able to lead the Petrograd Soviet during its short existence and etch upon the working class of Russia (and in a more limited way, internationally) the need for its own organizations to seize state power. All revolutionaries honor this experience, as we do the Paris Commune, as the harbingers of October, 1917. As Lenin and Trotsky both confirm, it was truly a \`dress rehearsal' for that event. It is in 1905 that Trotsky first wins his stars by directing the struggle against the Czar at close quarters, in the streets and working class meeting halls. And later in his eloquent and \`hard' defense of the experiment after it was crushed by the Czarism reaction. I believe that it was here in the heat of the struggle in 1905 where the contradiction between Trotsky's \`soft' position in 1903 and his future \`hard' Bolshevik position of 1917 and thereafter is resolved. Here was a professional revolutionary who one could depend on when the deal went down.No discussion of this period of Trotsky's life is complete without mentioning his very real contribution to Marxist theory- that is, the theory of Permanent Revolution. Although the theory is over one hundred years old it still retains its validity today in those countries that still have not had their bourgeois revolutions. This rather simple straightforward theory about the direction of the Russian revolution (and which Trotsky later in the 1920's, after the debacle of the Chinese Revolution, made applicable to what today are called \\"third world\\" countries) has been covered with so many falsehoods, epithets, and misconceptions that it deserves further explanation. Why? Militants today must address the ramifications of the question what kind of revolution is necessary as a matter of international revolutionary strategy. Trotsky, taking the specific historical development and the peculiarities of Russian economic development as part of the international capitalist order as a starting point argued that there was no \`Chinese wall' between the bourgeois revolution Russian was in desperate need of and the tasks of the socialist revolution. In short, in the 20th century ( and by extension, now) the traditional leadership role of the bourgeois in the bourgeois revolution in a economically backward country, due to its subservience to the international capitalist powers and fear of its own working class and plebian masses, falls to the proletariat. The Russian Revolution of 1905 sharply demonstrated the outline of that tendency especially on the perfidious role of the Russian bourgeoisie. The unfolding of revolutionary events in 1917 graphically confirmed this. The history of revolutionary struggles since then, and not only in \`third world' countries, gives added, if negative, confirmation of that analysis.World War I was a watershed for modern history in many ways. For the purposes of this review two points are important. First, the failure of the bulk of the European social democracy- representing the masses of their respective working classes- to not only not oppose their own ruling classes' plunges into war, which would be a minimal practical expectation, but to go over and directly support their own respective ruling classes in that war. This position was most famously demonstrated when the entire parliamentary fraction of the German Social Democratic party voted for the war credits for the Kaiser on August 4, 1914. This initially left the anti-war elements of international social democracy, including Lenin and Trotsky, almost totally isolated. As the carnage of that war mounted in endless and senseless slaughter on both sides it became clear that a new political alignment in the labor movement was necessary. The old, basically useless Second International, which in its time held some promise of bringing in the new socialist order, needed to give way to a new revolutionary International. That eventually occurred in 1919 with the foundation of the Communist International (also known as the Third International). Horror of horrors, particularly for reformists of all stripes, this meant that the international labor movement, one way or another, had to split into its reformist and revolutionary components. It is during the war that Trotsky and Lenin, not without some lingering differences, drew closer and begins the process of several years, only ended by Lenin's death, of close political collaboration.Secondly, World War I marks the definite (at least for Europe) end of the progressive role of international capitalist development. The outlines of imperialist aggression previously noted had definitely taken center stage. This theory of imperialism was most closely associated with Lenin in his master work Imperialism-The Highest Stage of Capitalism but one should note that Trotsky in all his later work up until his death fully subscribed to the theory. Although Lenin's work is in need of some updating to account for various technological changes and the extensions of globalization since that time holds up for political purposes. This analysis meant that a fundamental shift in the relationship of the working class to the ruling class was necessary. A reformist perspective for social change, although not specific reforms, was no longer tenable. Politically, as a general proposition, socialist revolution was on the immediate agenda. This is when Trotsky's theory of Permanent Revolution meets the Leninist conception of revolutionary organization. It proved to be a successful formula in Russia in October, 1917. Unfortunately, those lessons were not learned (or at least learned in time) by those who followed and the events of October, 1917 stand today as the only \`pure' working class revolution in history.An argument can, and has, been made that the October Revolution could only have occurred under the specific condition of decimated, devastated war-weary Russia of 1917. This argument is generally made by those who were not well-wishers of revolution in Russia (or anywhere else, for that matter). It is rather a truism, indulged in by Marxists as well as by others, that war is the mother of revolution. That said, the October revolution was made then and there but only because of the convergence of enough revolutionary forces led by the Bolsheviks and additionally the forces closest to the Bolsheviks (including Trotsky's Inter-District Organization) who had prepared for these events by the entire pre-history of the revolution. This is the subjective factor in history. No, not substitutionalism, that was the program of the Social Revolutionary terrorists and the like, but if you like, revolutionary opportunism. I would be much more impressed by an argument that stated that the revolution would not have occurred without the presence of Lenin and Trotsky. That would be a subjective argument, par excellent. But, they were there.Again Trotsky in 1917, like in 1905, is in his element speaking seemingly everywhere, writing, organizing (when it counts, by the way). If not the brains of the revolution (that role is honorably conceded to Lenin) certainly the face of the Revolution. Here is a revolutionary moment in every great revolution when the fate of the revolution turned on a dime (the subjective factor). The dime turned. (See review dated April 18, 2006 for a review of Trotsky's History of the Russian Revolution).One of the great lessons that militants can learn from all previous modern revolutions is that once the revolutionary forces seize power from the old regime an inevitable counterrevolutionary onslaught by elements of the old order (aided by some banished moderate but previously revolutionary elements, as a rule). The Russian revolution proved no exception. If anything the old regime, aided and abetted by numerous foreign powers and armies, was even more bloodthirsty. It fell to Trotsky to organize the defense of the revolution. Now, you might ask- What is a nice Jewish boy like Trotsky doing playing with guns? Fair enough. Well, Jewish or Gentile if you play the revolution game you better the hell be prepared to defend the revolution (and yourself). Here, again Trotsky organized, essentially from scratch, a Red Army from a defeated, demoralized former peasant army under the Czar. The ensuing civil war was to leave the country devastated but the Red Army defeated the Whites. Why? In the final analysis it was not only the heroism of the working class defending its own but the peasant wanting to hold on to the newly acquired land he just got and was in jeopardy of losing if the Whites won. But these masses needed to be organized. Trotsky was the man for the task.Both Lenin's and Trotsky's calculation for the success of socialist revolution in Russia (and ultimately its fate) was its, more or less, immediate extension to the capitalist heartland of Europe, particularly Germany. While in 1917 that was probably not the controlling single factor for going forward in Russia it did have to come into play at some point. The founding of the Communist International makes no sense otherwise. Unfortunately, for many historical, national and leadership-related reasons no Bolshevik-styled socialist revolutions followed then, or ever. If the premise for socialism is for plenty, and ultimately as a result of plenty to take the struggle for existence off the agenda and put other more creative pursues on the agenda, then Russia in the early 1920's was not the land of plenty. Neither Lenin, Trotsky nor Stalin, for that matter, could wish that fact away. The ideological underpinnings of that fight centered on the Stalinist concept of \`socialism in one country', that is Russia going it alone versus the Trostskyist position of the absolutely necessary extension of the international revolution. In short, this is the fight that historically happens in great revolutions- the fight against Thermidor (from the overthrow of Robespierre in 1794 by more moderate Jacobins). What counts, in the final analysis, are their respective responses to the crisis of the isolation of the revolution. The word isolation is the key. Do you turn the revolution inward or push forward? We all know the result, and it wasn't pretty, then or now. That is the substance of the fight that Trotsky, if initially belatedly and hesitantly, led from about 1923 on under various conditions until the end of his life by assassination of a Stalinist agent in 1940.Although there were earlier signs that the Russia revolution was going off course the long illness and death of Lenin in 1924, at the time the only truly authoritative leader the Bolshevik party, set off a power struggle in the leadership of the party. This fight had Trotsky and the \`pretty boy' intellectuals of the party on one side and Stalin, Zinoviev and Kamenev (the so-called triumvirate).backed by the \`gray boys' of the emerging bureaucracy on the other. This struggle occurred against the backdrop of the failed revolution in Germany in 1923 and which thereafter heralded the continued isolation, imperialist blockade and economic backwardness of the Soviet Union for the foreseeable future.While the disputes in the Russian party eventually had international ramifications in the Communist International, they were at this time fought out almost solely with the Russian Party. Trotsky was slow, very slow to take up the battle for power that had become obvious to many elements in the party. He made many mistakes and granted too many concessions to the triumvirate. But he did fight. Although later (in 1935) Trotsky recognized that the 1923 fight represented a fight against the Russian Thermidor and thus a decisive turning point for the revolution that was not clear to him (or anyone else on either side) then. Whatever the appropriate analogy might have been Leon Trotsky was in fact fighting a last ditch effort to retard the further degeneration of the revolution. After that defeat, the way the Soviet Union was ruled, who ruled it and for what purposes all changed. And not for the better.In a sense if the fight in 1923-24 is the decisive fight to save the Russian revolution (and ultimately a perspective of international revolution) then the 1926-27 fight which was a bloc between Trotsky's forces and the just defeated forces of Zinoviev and Kamenev, Stalin's previous allies was the last rearguard action to save that perspective. That it failed does not deny the importance of the fight. Yes, it was a political bloc with some serious differences especially over China and the Anglo-Russian Committee. But two things are important here One- did a perspective of a new party, which some elements were clamoring for, make sense at the time of the clear waning of the revolutionary ebbing the country. No. Besides the place to look was at the most politically conscious elements, granted against heavy odds, in the party where whatever was left of the class-conscious elements of the working class were. As I have noted elsewhere in discussing the 1923 fight- that \\"Lenin levy\\" of raw recruits, careerists and just plain thugs which enhanced the growing power of the Stalinist bureaucracy was the key element in any defeat. Still the fight was necessary. Hey, that is why we talk about it now. That was a fight to the finish. After that the left opposition or elements of it were forever more outside the party- either in exile, prison or dead. As we know Trotsky went from expulsion from the party in 1927 to internal exile in Alma Ata in 1928 to external exile to Turkey in 1929. From there he underwent further exiles in France, Norway, and Mexico when he was finally felled by a Stalinist assassin. But no matter when he went he continued to struggle for his perspective. Not bad for a Jewish farmer's son from the Ukraine.The last period of Trotsky's life spent in harrowing exiles and under constant threat from Stalinist and White Guard threats- in short, on the planet without a visa -was dedicated to the continued fight for the Leninist heritage. It was an unequal fight, to be sure but he waged it and was able to cohere a core of revolutionaries to form a new international, the Fourth International. That that effort was essentially militarily defeat by fascist or Stalinist forces during World War II does not take away from the grandeur of the attempt. He himself stated that he felt this was the most important work of his life- and who would challenge that assertion.But one could understand the frustrations, first the failure of his correct analysis of the German debacle then in France and Spain. Hell a lesser man would have given up. In fact, more than one biographer has argued that he should have retired from the political arena to, I assume , a comfortable country cottage to write I do not know what. But, please reader, have you been paying attention? Does this seem even remotely like the Trotsky career I have attempted to highlight here? Hell, no.Many of the events such as the disputes within the Russian revolutionary movement, the attempts by the Western Powers to overthrow the Bolsheviks in the Civil War after their seizure of power and the struggle of the various tendencies inside the Russian Communist Party and in the Communist International discussed in the book may not be familiar to today's audience. Nevertheless one can still learn something from the strength of Trotsky's commitment to his cause and the fight to preserve his personal and political integrity against overwhelming odds. As the organizer of the October Revolution, creator of the Red Army in the Civil War, orator, writer and fighter Trotsky he was one of the most feared men of the early 20th century to friend and foe alike. Nevertheless, I do not believe that he took his personal fall from power as a world historic tragedy. Moreover, he does not gloss over his political mistakes. Nor does Trotsky generally do personal injustice to his various political opponents although I would not want to have been subject to his rapier wit and pen. Politicians, revolutionary or otherwise, in our times should take note.REVISED JULY 25, 2006"},{"Title":"The Prophet Armed: Trotsky 1879-1921.","review":"This is a great and very informative book, you never get tired of reading it"},{"Title":"The Prophet Armed: Trotsky 1879-1921.","review":"From the start, Trotsky always thought that revolution in any one country could only succeed if it received the active support of revolutions in other countries. But similarly, these other revolutions would also need to receive help from others: the Russian revolution could not survive without a revolution in Germany, but neither could a German revolution survive without a Russian. This mutual dependence meant that no country could ever start a revolution: it would have to wait on the success of another.So to provoke these indispensable other revolutions, Trotsky was quite prepared to invade other countries. For example, in 1919 he wrote, \\"A cavalry corps of 30-40,000 horsemen must be formed to invade India.\\"Similarly, at Brest-Litovsk in February 1918, Trotsky made the Soviet revolution's very survival depend on the putative German revolution, risking total defeat by the German army on the throw of a revolution in Germany. He said, \\"We declare we end the war but do not sign a peace. They will be unable to make an offensive against us. If they attack us, our position will be no worse than now ...\\" This phrase-mongering did not frighten the German generals, who saw only that Trotsky was refusing to sign the offered peace. They then attacked, as he said they could not do, and seized millions of square miles of Soviet territory, making the Soviet position far worse than before.In the 1930s, the Opposition leagued with Hitler. Churchill wrote, \\"The German government was in touch with important Russian personalities through the Soviet embassy in Prague. The plot aimed at overthrowing Stalin and introducing into Russia a new pro-German regime. Soviet Russia carried out a merciless but doubtless useful purge of political and economic circles. The Soviet army was purged of pro-German elements.\\" Goebels admitted, \\"Stalin got rid of all the opposition circles in the Red Army and thus succeeded in making sure there were no more defeatist groups in the Army.\\"The Opposition fought against the programmes of industrialisation and collectivisation that made possible all the Soviet Union's heroic achievements. For instance, in April 1930, Trotsky's Bulletin of the Opposition said, \\"Put a stop to \`mass collectivisation'. ... Put a stop to the hurdle race of industrialisation. ... Abandon the \`ideals' of self-contained economy. Draw up a new variant of a plan providing for the widest possible intercourse with the world market.\\" In 1938, Trotsky called for the collective farms to be closed down, and for Soviet enterprises to be handed over to foreign powers.He consistently called on the Soviet people to overthrow the Soviet government when Hitler attacked. He called for a \`revolutionary uprising', an \`insurrection' against the Soviet government, when Hitler attacked the Soviet Union. He wrote, \\"the impetus to the Soviet workers' revolutionary upsurge will probably be given by events outside the country.\\" \\"The first social shock, external or internal, may throw the atomized Soviet Society into civil war.\\"He asked, \\"Can we expect that the Soviet Union will come out of the coming great war without defeat? To this frankly posed question, we will answer as frankly: If the war should remain only a war, the defeat of the Soviet Union would be inevitable. In a technical, economic and military sense, imperialism is incomparably more strong. If it is not paralysed by revolution in the West, imperialism will sweep away the present regime.\\" \\"The defeat of the Soviet Union is inevitable in case the new war shall not provoke a new revolution. ... If we theoretically admit war without revolution, then the defeat of the Soviet Union is inevitable.\\"He wrote, \\"It would be childish to think that the Stalin bureaucracy can be removed by means of a Party or Soviet Congress. Normal, constitutional means are no longer available for the removal of the ruling clique. ... They can be compelled to hand over power to the Proletarian vanguard only by FORCE.\\"\\"Inside the Party, Stalin has put himself above all criticism and the State. It is impossible to displace him except by assassination. Every oppositionist becomes ipso facto a terrorist.\\"Trotsky lied to the \`Dewey Commission' when he told them that that he had not been organising an underground in the Soviet Union.The leader of Trotsky's Fourth International, Ernest Mandel, openly applauded Boris Yeltsin, the key figure in the counter-revolution that finally restored capitalism in the Soviet Union. He wrote, \\"The reformer Yeltsin represents the tendency which wants to reduce the gigantic state apparatus. Consequently he follows in Trotsky's footsteps.\\"The Socialist Workers Party backed the US-organised and funded terrorists, which spawned bin Laden, against the people of Afghanistan. \\"Mujehadin victory will encourage the opponents of Russian rule everywhere in the USSR and Eastern Europe.\\""},{"Title":"The Prophet Armed: Trotsky 1879-1921.","review":"Leon Trotsky would seem to most people today, simply by nature of having been a Communist and a founder of the Soviet Union, an utter irrelevance. Fifty years ago, when Deutscher published this volume of his chronicle Trotsky's life this was not the case. Trotsky was more libeled by Stalin's Soviet Union and the sycophantic Communist Parties of the Third International than any dissident has ever been by any regime. Deutscher took it upon himself to save the founder of the Red Army from an oblivion that he did not deserve, and place him in the pantheon of twentieth century giants where he belonged. The fact that his book is still in print after half a century shows that in the eyes of some portion of the reading public he succeded.This first volume deals with Trotsky's genesis from a bookish and brilliant student to a commited revolutionary and his successful part--second only Lenin--in leading the Soviet Union to victory against the forces of reaction. The years of Trotsky's life in exile; as the flamboyant leader of the St. Petersburg Soviet during the 1905 revolution; his violent and polemical disagreements with Lenin on socialist doctrine in the years before the Bolshevik seizure of power; and the often overlooked Trotsky who was a great critic of art and literature are all recounted with utter beauty. This biography reads like the best fiction because of Deutscher's unbelievable control over the English language--he did not begin using the language on a regular basis until after his thirteith year.Overall, for anyone interested in the beginning of that great experiment gone awry that has rightfully been consigned ash heap of history--Soviet socialism--this book is an absolute must. The Trotsky who was responsible for birthing the Soviet Union rightfully appears to the reader, especially in light of the state's collapse in 1991, as one who would have ensured that it would still exist today in a form that would have made the priveleged and the exploiters of the world quack with a fear that the murderous Stalinists never dreamed of--and without all the murder. Oh Brave world that never was!!"},{"Title":"The Prophet Armed: Trotsky 1879-1921.","review":"Firstly, it's necessary to keep in mind that Deustscher was not trying to write a biography of Trotsky- if by that is meant an account of his life for its own sake- nor was he trying to write a history of the Russian Revolution and its leaders as a self-contained account. Deutscher's goals where twofold: to vindicate Trotsky's early opposition against Lenin's conception of the revolutionary party as well as his later opposition to Stalin's policies _in the long run_ and at the same time to acknowledge the necessity of Leninism and Stalinism _in the short run_. However objectionable such a view is today, Deutscher's political dialogue with Trotsky's ghost is superbly argued and documented, and anyone, no matter one's political views, will finish reading this work feeling one knows more about the subject than beforehand. In all the languages this work was translated (and I remember the ruckus produced in Brazil by the 1960s Portuguese trans.) it played havoc with accepted Left commonplaces.There are many faults in this new Verso edition: first, its paperback binding is atrocious (after a first read, I have already a couple of loose pages); secondly, there lacks an introduction that sets the work in perspective 50 years after its publication, as well as a glossary of unusual terms for today's conservative age (such as comissar, soviet, etc.) and, perhaps, some short biographies of the smaller characters,with dates of birth and decease, positions held, whereabouts, etc.However, the work can still be enjoyably read on its own, even if you miss some (admittedly small) points."},{"Title":"The Prophet Armed: Trotsky 1879-1921.","review":"This is an excellent biography of Trotsky, and, despite the fact it takes up 3 books, it makes up excellent reading and gives one understanding of not just the life of Trotsky, but the reason for many of the peculiar changes that happened in the USSR in it's early days.

Get it!"},{"Title":"The Prophet Armed: Trotsky 1879-1921.","review":"This first of 3 volumes in Deutscher's biography is an astonishing and captivating achievement. Deutscher weaves together character study, drama, and historical narrative to give an authoritative account of Trotsky's life and the Russian Revolution from Trotsky's birth up through the quickening bureaucratization of Soviet Russia in 1921.Deutscher's deft handling of the facts, personalities, ideas, and situations of the time is simply unparallelled, and makes for a tremendously enjoyable and informative read.Essential material for anyone exploring the question of where socialism went wrong in the 20th century."},{"Title":"The Prophet Armed: Trotsky 1879-1921.","review":"This is the first volume of Isaac Deutscher's defining biography of Leon Trotsky, the great Russian revolutionary and one of the founders of the Soviet State. This three-volume work remains Isaac Deutscher's great opus.Covering the years from his birth in 1879 until the opening stages of Trotsky's struggle with Kamenev, Zinoviev and Stalin for leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, this volume is an exciting entre into the three-volume series.Isaac Deutscher, obviously, believes in what he writes about. He has a great deal of interest in explaining the details of the struggle that developed between Stalin and Trotsky. Consequently this first volume may give somewhat short shrift to the most productive period of Trosky's life while the author manuveres to tell the story he really wants to tell in the secon and third volumes."},{"Title":"The Prophet Armed: Trotsky 1879-1921.","review":"For nearly all its existence since Lenin's death in 1924 Trotsky (aka Lev Davidovich Bronstein) was Satan in the Bolshevik's manichean view of the world. Most of the purges of the 1930s were allegedly meant to cleanse Soviet society and its key institutions (the Communist Party, the unions, the Red Army, the intelligentsia) of the Trotskyte taint that, like some sort of Original Sin, pervaded the proletarian dictatorship. Stalin tried to erase Trotsky from the history of the Revolution. He even erased Trotsky's physical attributes, not just by killing him in 1940, half a world away, but by obliterating his likeness wherever it might have been found.This book, published fifty years ago, tried to counter the Stalinist plot against Trotsky by vindicating his key role in the 1905 and 1917 revolutions, in the Civil War and in the establishment of the Red Army and the Soviet state. The author partially succeeds. Here we see Trotsky in all his glory, as perhaps he would have liked to be remembered, as a child prodigy who from humble rural beginnings quickly found his way in the world, as a professional revolutionary, as a brilliant polemist and orator, who even as a young man was seen as worthy counterpart to Lenin, and far above the rest of the Party, as a good hearted man who tried to promote harmony within the Party and failed at it, as a cultured, civilized \\"westernizer\\", much more appealing than the brutal Stalin, who came straight from the \\"log cabin\\" of czarist barbarism. He also came up with many good ideas, such as Lenin's New Economic Policy. Deutscher also gives us some of the darker sides to Trotsky's scintillating personna. He was proud and haughty, but brittle. He was abusive to others, often unnecessarily. He often let abstractions and daydreams take the place of reality. And he came up with many bad ideas, such as War Communism and the Militarization of Labor.But, given Deutscher's profile (he was a Trotskyte) the book is often a competent whitewash. The author shares Trotsky's (and the Bolshevik's) worldview to a great extent, and sees the October Revolution as a worthy action. Mostly, he takes Trotskyte and Bolshevik motives as justification for their actions. He portrays opponents (such as the White Guards and nationalist Ukrainians and Poles) as illegitimate. Nowhere does the awfulness of Soviet rule, and the brutality of the Bolshevik leaders come through, except perhaps in their remarkably abusive writings. To find such bitchiness nowadays one would have to refer to the academic world, where the nastiness is commensurate to the irrelevance of that which is being discussed.Also, the book is often not very readable as history. The author will often refer to future or past events in a single page, without indication of the precise dates, which makes this a hard book to read for someone not familiar with the October Revolution.Having said this, a good reason to read this book is that it is beautifully written, and that the author really does get very close to his subject, which is mostly a negative in that he lacks perspective, but does bring the advantage of great liveliness which makes this a very good read. This reminds me of Preston's life of General Franco. Preston hated his subject and was unable utterly to develop any empathy with him, so the book was fairly arid and not insightful. Deutscher has the opposite defect: he gets too close, as perhaps does Nicholas Farrell to Mussolini. The ideal would be like Kershaw's Hitler or Short's Mao: far enough to look the monster in the eye, but not close enough to kiss him.At this book's end, Trotsky is at the apex of his power, from which he would begin to slip during Lenin's final year. But this is better left to volume II, which I also hope to review.So read the book, but don't take Deutscher at his word. Complement this with Volkogonov's Trotsky. And with Trotsky's own voluminous writings, which are often very amusing (particularly his biography of Stalin)."},{"Title":"The Prophet Armed: Trotsky 1879-1921.","review":"Not only a great overview of Trotsky, a great resource about the ideas, debates and people that formed this century and."},{"Title":"The Prophet Armed: Trotsky 1879-1921.","review":"A very readable biography.

My introduction to his work came when I pulled the impressive book \\"Moving Heavy Things\\" off my brother's bookshelf and then just had to take it home and sit delightedly with its illustrations of how we humans once did by machine power what machines now do thru automation and fossil-fuels.I'm reading this particular book, \\"String: Tying It Up, Tying It Down\\", just a little at a time, hiding it in my bedclothes to muse over before I sleep. In contrast to Adkins' grand overview of old-timers cleverly Moving Heavy Things, which left me feeling as if I might be able to accomplish some of those feats if hard-pressed to do so (you know, if the creek DOES rise, and the Good Lord isn't willing!), the String book is a masterful slow perusal through all the tie-ups and knots that defeated me in Scouting-type educational efforts. Starting with- oh dear, it must be said: string history, then string theory (of the non-quantum type), we work thru simple fibres & holds to lively vignettes showing many-times woven cables and hawsers, which can then be appreciated as ultimately just as simple.Somehow, Mr. Adkins' drawings have sufficient life where my hands twitch as if holding the lines and I can actually envision how that line goes here while this here other line stays put, or goes over there. I can actually not only follow the logic of individual moves, but get the sense of how the whole knotted mass got there, can be used, and best, can be \\"unfolded.\\"This is perhaps the best feature of Jan Adkins as an illustrator and teacher.

I sure as heck couldn't; which is one of the nice things about Odds Bodkin's oral version of the myth of Hercules. Bodkin is a well known storyteller, particularly here in New England, who accompanies himself on twelve string guitar. That's one other nice thing about this cd set, that it is reminiscent of how these stories and legends would have been presented when they were first being concocted, though the teller would probably have been blind and playing a lute or something.For the purposes of this setting, Bodkin imagines Hercules has died and Hades and Persephone prevail upon him to relate the story of the twelve labors before he can leave the underworld. Here they are (as listed at the Perseus Digital Library) :Labor 1: The Nemean Lion Labor 2: The Lernean Hydra Labor 3: The Hind of Ceryneia Labor 4: The Erymanthean Boar Labor 5: The Augean Stables Labor 6: The Stymphalian Birds Labor 7: The Cretan Bull Labor 8: The Horses of Diomedes Labor 9: The Belt of Hippolyte Labor 10: Geryon's Cattle Labor 11: The Apples of the Hesperides Labor 12: CerberusBodkin mixes thrills and humor in the telling and also, being &quot;socially conscious&quot;, has an ulterior motive here, the whole epic is sort of structured around Hercules trying to learn how to control his rage. You may recall that the labors were assigned to him as a way of purging his conscience after he accidentally murdered his family in a Hera-induced blinding rage. I guess this is Odds Bodkin's way of preventing another school shooting, a noble enough cause,nd for the most part he keeps it fairly subtle, though he does go a mite overboard when he has Hercules finally get control of his fury only after spending a few years cross-dressing (you'll have to give it a listen to find out) and getting in touch with his feminine side.Hercules does lead a pretty violent life, so the recording is not suitable for young children, but any teenage boys who watch wrestling are certainly old enough for this. You don't have to inform them that they're also getting a healthy dose of their cultural heritage in the process.GRADE : B-"},{"Title":"Business and Legal Forms for Fine Artists","review":"Very well organized and comprehensive.

Anthony Truax. The book was filled with excitement and thorough descriptions throughout the text. Although the story is a part of the horror genre, the story is also a coming of age tale.

His friends will want to help but danger is in store for everyone.Michelle ShealyReviewer for Myshelf.com"},{"Title":"The Naphtali Chronicles: A Whole New Breed","review":"The Naphtali Chronicles:A Whole New Breed ByT. Anthony TruaxT. Anthony has created a spine chilling story that is gracefully written with realistic characters and vivid details. From beginning to end this novel enthralls its readers and plunges them into the deepest caverns of their imagination.The tale begins with a tantalizing introduction from the author and sets the pace for a thought provoking story that blasts the logical mind with many illogical possibilities. I was immediately reminded of another great story, An Interview With a Vampire. But this is only a slight comparison, for The Naphtali Chronicles: A Whole New Breed, is a story uniquely its own.Mark and Kevin are two typical young men. They are seniors in college and football captains of their team. They live in a small apartment not far from campus. They drink, party and go to school perfectly content with their uneventful lives. But then after a great personal tragedy, Mark discovers a secret that will change his life and the lives of his friends forever. Mark is forced to discover his true identity and fulfill a birthright that he never imagined he possessed.A teacher that Mark has never considered one of his favorites, Professor Lansing, becomes his guide as he is hurled into a dark world filled with murder and mayhem. Lansing gives the young man a quick lesson about his ancestors and a fondness grows between them. But Mark soon discovers that only he holds the key that can end the destruction that surrounds him and that the survival of mankind rides on his young shoulders. Mark must release the beast within himself in order to destroy an evil enemy that kills without mercy. He is forced to release all that he has believed in the past and grasp the truth of a strange reality. He is thrown ruthlessly into a place where failure is not an option and death looms at every corner.T. Anthony is an exquisite storyteller and a very talented writer. He is a rare artist that uses his gifts to capture his reader's hearts and to thrust them into a story that they will never forget. His smooth words and graphic details paint a picture so vivid that for the time that one is in his brilliant tale they can do nothing but believe even the unbelievable. This book is a rare treasure that I would certainly recommend be read by all.T. Anthony Truax is not just an author but in this great profession he is definitely A Whole New Breed. Thank you T. Anthony for an excellent read and a story I will always remember.Reviewed by T.A.

It is a sensitive and timely, even now, aide to understanding each persons role in a relationship. I have used material from it in therapy, in a Sunday school class on relationships and often recommend it to clients. Together with Collection (formerly Collections, '79) it changed my life for the better."},{"Title":"Intimacy: the essence of male and female","review":"Shirley Luthman's first book, \\"Collection\\" (referred to by the other reviewer and also available on Amazon) changed my life. This book covers the same material. Luthman talks about the correct relationship and understanding between masculine and feminine forces inside an individual, and also in the outside world (\\"sexual polarity\\" as described by David Deida), which have been the single most important factor in my personal development and happiness, and also my lifelong obsession. Here the \\"masculine\\" element refers to the aspects that are active, rational, single-pointed consciousness and production-driven, while the \\"feminine\\" aspects are receptive, intuitive, diffuse consciousness and pleasure-driven. When these forces are in correct relationship the masculine's goal and primary source of meaning and fulfillment lies in service to the feminine and to its pleasure goals, while the feminine's goal and primary source of meaning lies in maximizing its own pleasure and the pleasure of the masculine partner. Each force (or individual) must be continually giving the other feedback and relating to it, and when this is done correctly the power generated by the interaction is mind-blowing. David Deida says something like (I paraphrase): \\"men without women tend to be flat and boring; women without men tend to be unfocussed and emotionally self-indulgent\\". Of course we all have masculine and feminine elements and so we all have to deal at times with these traits (flat and boring, and emotionally self-indulgent). Also all couples sexually-polarize to a greater or lesser degree and therefore this dynamic is present in gay couples also. These concepts are very controversial but extremely powerful. My teachers in this area include Shirley Gehrke Luthman, David Deida, and Victor Baranco and the Lafayette Morehouse. I also recommend David Deida \\"For my lover\\" and Steve and Vera Bodansky's books (Steve and Vera were students of Victor Baranco)."},{"Title":"Intimacy: the essence of male and female","review":"I have never looked at the dynamic between male and female this way...eye opening!...what else can I say!"},{"Title":"Marco and the tiger,","review":"Remember those huge books you used to have to read in Reading Class during grade school? You know, the ones which were filled with short stories and had the questionarres and/or matching assignments in the textbook's accompanying workbook which you had to answer after completing each story segment?Well, I had first encountered \\"Marco and The Tiger\\" as a \\"short story\\" in one of those things during the fourth grade. As I had taught myself to read before starting any school and regularly devoured books while the rest of my classmates still stumbled over words, I really ate this one up: it started with Marco collecting for his paper route at the weird huge door with the fist-shaped knocker and only got more and more strange and wonderous from there. I was fascinated with the whole setup, and I couldn't help but wonder what, if anything, had happened afterwards. The memory of it ended up both haunting and delighting my childhood memories for the rest of my life.WARNING: Spoilers ahead.Just the other day, I saw a copy of this sitting in my local thrift store and snatched it up.Now that I've read through the whole thing, it turns out that the \\"short story\\" was in reality just the first two chapters condensed to create one. And I'm happy to say that the rest of the book is just as charming as the portion I had originally read all those years ago. John Foster has quite a way with words throughout this quaint little tale, and he gives it real personality that is both unique and touching. This is the sort of book that I would have read in one setting way back then, and would later proceed to re-read again and again on a regular basis. Here is a book which is naturally cute and appealing without ACTING cute and appealing, a story so well-told that it was obviously second nature to its creator.The story is simple but actually quite unique when you compare it to others similar to it: a boy named Marco discovers a tiger living in the middle of a battered courtyard in the middle of New Orleans (!!!), befriends him and later wonders what on earth to do with him.Now I have to state something right off the bat: this is the type of story which will appeal only to those who love animals and have the natural ability to suspend disbelief and accept what's going on here. For example, the boy and the tiger work out a method of communication in which the tiger understands English, and in return Marco learns that the tiger uses his own form of sign language to communicate (a cocked eyebrow means \\"yes\\", stretching the neck means \\"no\\", thrashing the tail means \\"I don't know\\", etc... sort of makes the tiger sound like a typical Andy Warhol interview, doesn't it? ;) ). But Foster makes it work because he presents everything from Marco's point of view so well and effectively that you immediately get the impression the author himself (a) still has the natural ability to communicate with children as equals to be taken seriously, and (b) might have based this on a story he himself dreamed up as a boy. Every single detail is described with loving care, ringing true to Marco's personality and resulting point of view.For example, one passage describes Marco's fear of some kind of mustached gamekeeper hunting down and killing his tiger, and adds as an extra thought, \\"Marco had no idea why the man would have a mustache, he just knew that the man would.\\" A lesser author would never have bothered to have put in such details, but Foster is obviously a natural storyteller, and he's enjoying himself here with every page. I don't know how to describe his writing style except to say that it's appropriate to the story, gives it added believability and works wonderfully in presenting us with Marco's thoughts and perspective.I actually got hooked on this little story and got concerned about what was going to happen, especially since Foster also shows a GREAT natural flair for hooking your suspense... right down to the very last scene that closes the book in which he simply doesn't allow the reader to relax in relief until the last minute.I'm not sure whether later additions of this book ever had different illustrations or not, but the one I found--a first edition from 1967, I believe--has beautiful illustrations, particularly of Marco rowing his tiger across the water on the title page. In fact, the whole book brought back teary-eyed memories of what books for young people used to be like back during the time when this one came out, the time I grew up in.And after you finish this one, which I know both children AND their parents will enjoy, you just might find yourself as the grown-up-who-never-grew-up wondering to yourself: why can't more modern children's books be as naturally crafted and entertaining as this one?"},{"Title":"Marco and the tiger,","review":"This is a surprisingly good Children's book about a decent kid (Marco) from New Orleans who hasn't many friends and who accidentally befriends a tiger. Marco is also a kid with a non-attentive father, no mother, and a brutish housekeeper who gripes at him and only feeds him oatmeal. The tiger becomes more than a pet; it becomes Marco's surrogate friend and companion. Of course, Marco realizes this friendship cannot last, and he knows he must save the tiger from being shot or captured. The end result is a readable book that contains a combination of alienation, friendship, trust, challenge and problem solving. I read this book as a kid and I'm surprised it never became a hit among young readers - it's a pretty good story."},{"Title":"Longhorns North","review":"This is a 150-paged adventure novel inspired by the true story of Nelson Story, who drove the first herd of Texas Longhorns north to Montana. Many of the surprises, mishaps, accidents, and good fortune that befall the book's main character Whitlow Moody really happened in history to Nelson Story. In addition to the story's sense of history, there is a good sense of Longhorns in terms of their characteristics and behavior.The author spends 50 pages and 7 chapters introducing the protagonist Whitlow Moody, the antagonist - Whit's brother-in-law Dade, the rest of the characters, and the plot - driving 2000 miles of hell on hoof from Texas to Montana, which was unheard of if not downright crazy! A subplot is presented and cemented between Whit and Dade. And another subplot is presented between two major characters - the trail boss and the rear hand.The next 50 pages presents 7 chapters of obstacles in the form of west-east rivers to be crossed on the drive's northward journey. Every river poses new obstacles such as storms, flooding, and Homeland Security (Native American style) who had their own ways of dealing with unwanted immigrants. Further problems arise due to the unpredictable nature of the immigrants as well: they have to go all the way around the Territory of Kansas because Yankee immigrants with firearms believe Texas cattle carry a contagious Texas fever that will infect their Yankee cows.In the last 50 pages, everything comes to a head. They're racing against the clock to get to Montana before the snow does. The U.S. Army surprises them with outposts that first buy some beef and make Whit a rich man, only to have the next fort order them to halt their drive because the Lakota Americans (Sioux) don't like immigrants, Yankee or Johnny Rebs. Whit and Dade have it out, only for the matter to be settled once and for all by a suprise third party. And an even bigger surprise is not only does Whit get the money, but he gets the gal as well. What gal? That's the surprise, because there were no girls on the drive - or was there?In short, it was a very hard way to earn a buck. Some tried it, and a few even made it."},{"Title":"Conservative Management of Cervical Spine Syndromes","review":"Dr. Murphy has produced the state of the art text in the conservative management of the Cervical spine.

I've been to Charleston several times but I'm sorry to say I have not yet been to the the Old Post Office. I have made several recipes from this book and enjoyed them as I do all lowcountry food, but one recipe in particular has elevated this cookbook above most of my other Southern cookbooks (and I have them all, honey, from Miss Lewis to Miss Paula).After eating at Jestine's Kitchen in Charleston, I became obsessed with the widely-recommended Coca-Cola cake. I'm not even a cake lover, but like the fabled Loveless Cafe Biscuit recipe, Jestine's Coca-Cola Cake is legendary in the Lowcountry, and the owner will not give up the recipe for anything. I made dozens of different Coca-Cola and even Dr. Pepper cakes searching for that special quality that Jestine's had. I keep a giant closeup photo from the Stern's website of a piece of Jestine's cake so I can compare each one I make to the real thing. But every recipe variation I tried was lacking something, until I tried the one from this cookbook.Hallelujah! The Old Post Office Restaurant cookbook has a recipe for Coca-Cola cake that comes so close to Jestine's that it's hard the tell the difference. I got immediately boyfriend approval, and he's been pushing me to find \\"the real Coca-Cola Cake\\" for three years since we both tried it. Finally!

I have carefully read it cover to cover. It is one of the best explorations of Renaissance magical practice that I have found. In fact, I have discarded lesser volumes and maintained this one.This one volume covers the formal rites and ceremonies of evocation, spells, alchemy, conjuration, possession, and exorcism. It is very well illustrated with sigils, seals, pentacles, and tools. It is clear to me that much research went into the original grimoires. Sirdar Ikbal Ali Shah is a true scholar of the occult.Having said all this, I would warn the would be reader that the majority of this work deals with conjuring supernatural entities and binding them to your will. This is a foolish and dangerous practice. First of all, you are never sure of exactly what you have contacted- no matter what it CLAIMS to be. Secondly, this is a work of ego, an attempt to impose your personal will over the natural order. If your motives are impure or mistaken you risk three-fold retribution back upon yourself. I am not saying that it won't work, but is it worth this price to you?From the text it is clear to me that Shah knew the difference between Theurgia (aligning your will with the Divine will in Its service) and Goetia (using occult power to serve your own ego.) Just be aware of what you are dealing with here, especially in the sections dealing with infernal evocation and demonology.

Better than everything you've ever read!"},{"Title":"The Marquis de Sade,: A biography","review":"The Marquis de Sade (1740-1814) was a French nobleman, who became an infamous libertine (the word \\"sadism\\" was coined from his name) during the French society of Louis XVI. Interestingly, he also wrote several outrageously pornographic books such asThree Complete Novels: Justine, Philosophy in the Bedroom, Eug&eacute;nie De Franval and Other Writings,The 120 Days of Sodom and other Writings, andJuliette. Biographer Gilbert Lely (1904-1985) was a French poet.While incarcerated in an asylum at Charenton, a doctor noted, \\"I often came upon him, walking alone, with heavy, dragging gait, most carelessly dressed, in the corridors near the room which he occupied. I never once saw him talking to anybody. When I passed him, I would salute him, and he would respond with that icy sort of courtesy which at once disposes of any thought of entering into conversation... Nothing could have made one suspect that this was the author of 'Justine' or 'Juliette'; the only impression he made on me was that of a haughty, morose old gentleman.\\" (Pg. 50)He asks, \\"what sort of figure did Sade cut in the eyes of his contemporaries... [as] a libertine who went beyond all bounds and would soon be resorting to flagellation and to sweets doctored with aphrodisiacs... But at the same time the future author ... was beginning to assemble... the first items in his infernal dossier; and the dawn of a tragic knowledge, the laws of which no thinker before him had ever deciphered, was gradually breaking in the depths of his soul.\\" (Pg. 53-54)While in Vincennes Prison in 1777, Sade wrote to his wife, \\"I am overcome with despair... My blood is too hot to endure such frightful restriction. I mean to turn my resulting rage on myself. If I am not out in four days, nothing is more sure than that I shall crack my skull against these walls.\\" (Pg. 191) In 1781, he stated in another letter to her, \\"Yes, I am a libertine... My mind has encompassed everything possibly conceivable in that sphere, though I have certainly not done all I have conceived and certainly never shall. I am a libertine, but I am neither a criminal nor a murderer.\\" (Pg. 234)He admits, \\"One cannot give oneself virtues nor is one any longer able to adopt this or that taste, any more than a hunchback can make himself straight, or a man can make this or that opinion his general system or make himself auburn-haired when he is born ginger.\\" (Pg. 249) Later, he stated, \\"The man who adopts any train of thought to suit other people is certainly a madman. My train of thought is the fruit of my recollections, it is connected with my existence, my make-up. I am not able to change it, and I wouldn't if I could. This train of thought which you blame is the sole consolation my life contains, it alleviates all my tribulations in prison, it comprises all my pleasures in the world and I cling to it more than to life.\\" (Pg. 255) He summarized, \\"Imperious, choleric, impetuous, extreme in everything, of a disorderly wealth of imagination on human conduct such as life never saw the equal of... you must either kill me or take me as I am, for I shall not change.\\" (Pg. 256)After he had been liberated during the French Revolution, he bitterly lamented, \\"I had fifteen volumes ready for the press... [but] have come out of prison without even one quarter of those manuscripts. By unforgivable carelessness Lady de Sade allowed some to be lost and have the others seized, and that's thirteen lost years! Three-quarters of my works remained behind in my Bastille cell... My manuscripts, over the loss of which I shed tears of blood!... You can replace beds, tables, commodes, but you cannot get ideas again...\\" (Pg. 315-316)This book, as well as the more recentThe Marquis de Sade: A Life, are essential reading for anyone who wants to know more about this mysterious figure."},{"Title":"Theory and Experiment in Gravitational Physics","review":"Will is one of foremost leaders in the field and can do calculating at post-Newtonian orders that make the average relativist cringe.

It will NOT make you a strong player (you need to do tons of tactics problems for that) but it will give you a thorough understanding of what chess is about.What's great about the book is that it is replete with WORDS! Imagine that: A chess book with words in it. What a novel concept.There are words to describe everything. But it is not a dry, pictureless read. There are also diagrams with arrows, diagrams with X's, partial-board diagrams, sets of successive-move diagrams, and standard single-position diagrams from named historical games.Don't worry. It's not a kid's book with nothing but diagrams and arrows. The moves are given in standard algebraic notation, and some have normal annotations.Basically, if you consider yourself an intelligent adult, but you would like to understand this game better, buy this book. To find something more accessible to a non-chess player, you'd have to look to Edward Lasker and his old descriptive-notation books.But please note: This is NOT for serious players. It teaches you the intellectual side of chess. It gives you the full vocabulary to sound as if you know what you are talking about -- not just the rules (which are explained extremely well with the arrows etc.) but also the tactical motifs, the openings, and the strategic concepts.

ErichsenISBN 10-57168-514-62001For the most part this is a very readable book. It traces Heino Erichsen's story from capture in North Africa as an eighteen year old German soldier through prison camps in the United States, to repatriation to Germany, and ultimately to return to the United States.Erichsen's book initially interested me because in the town where I grew up in central Texas there had been a German prisoner of war camp. Mr. Erichsen's book answered my questions about life in those camps. The initial prison camp to which he was sent was Camp Hearne, Texas. The town was so depleted of agricultural labor that when the prisoners arrived at the camp, according to Erichsen, who spoke English, they were greeted with \\"Hi y'all, come on in.\\" As it turned out three-fourths of the prisoners were NCO's, who were exempted from work by the Geneva Convention. Accordingly, later, the locals dubbed the camp, \\"The Fritz Ritz\\".During Erichsen's stay, Nazis murdered an English-speaking prisoner, who had translated for the camp's commanding officer. The translator was thought to be too friendly to the Americans. Erichsen wrote that his American captors failed to distinguish between the Nazis and the non-political types who made up most of the German army. This oversight led to incidents such as the translator's murder.This book also discloses the fact, unknown at least to me, that after the war the German prisoners in the U.S. were not returned directly to Germany. Instead they had to serve one to two year terms in England, Scotland, Belgium, and France working on farms, in mines, or repairing war damages to make up for the manpower losses that those countries had suffered. Erichsen captured in 1943 did not make it back to his hometown of Kiel in north Germany until 1948. He writes that over 58 percent of the buildings had been destroyed. The city was barely recognizable.After a while, Erichsen was able to get a job as a translator for a British government organization. Outside of work, Erichsen wrote of the postwar period in Germany, it was difficult to have a social life of any kind because the men of his age had lost their contemporaries and the young women had lost their innocence. Surviving consumed the thoughts of women his age, he wrote. After six years, he returned to the United States with his new family.Life in the U.S. was not an immediate success for Erichsen. He had given up an excellent job in Germany. After weeks of interviews, he learned that his references and education counted for nothing. He was a foreigner with an accent. Eventually, he got work. Later, his wife left him. He married again. He and his second wife went on to found an international adoption agency, which placed hundreds of orphans. This became his life's work and his way of coping with his wartime experiences.Although \\"Reluctant Warrior\\" lacks the dramatic power of books such as \\"Destined to Witness\\" and \\"German Boy\\", two other books by Germans about their wartime experiences, it is nonetheless an interesting book. Its coverage of the lives of German prisoners in American POW camps provides an original insight into a somewhat forgotten aspect of our history."},{"Title":"Reluctant Warrior: Former German Pow Finds Peace in Texas","review":"This book is full of insights into what German life was like before, during and just after WWII. I have lived Germany for the better part of the last 25 years and it opened my eyes to what really went on during this time. There are events that we were never taught in history class. There are very personal and emotional accounts of events in a world that most of us can't even imagine. My only complaint is that the book started to fall apart on the third reading."},{"Title":"Reluctant Warrior: Former German Pow Finds Peace in Texas","review":"Written with authenticity and sensitivity, The Reluctant Warrior tells the incredible and inspiring story of a German boy growing up during the ravages of Hitler and Nazi Germany. He uses his intelligence, humor, stubbornness and ingenuity to survive not only the battles of war, but also life in an American POW Camp. The reader lives each moment with him through sorrows, challenges and accomplishments. This book will have you cheering as he not only survives, but later returns to the United States and dedicates his life to finding families for the orphans of the world. A wonderful book with a completely compelling story that I could not put down!"},{"Title":"Reluctant Warrior: Former German Pow Finds Peace in Texas","review":"Growing up in Grand Island, Nebraska, I was very aware of World War II because we had a huge Army Air Force base just outside town. We also had the Cornhusker Ordinance Plant, where bombs and ammunition for the war effort were manufactured. And as the war progressed we had something else: a prisoner-of-war camp. Ours was located in an old public school and I'll never forget the sight of those POWs &quot;heading&quot; the soccer ball in the first game I ever witnessed. This book is about the life of one such POW, and the dramatic events -- from North Africa to Texas to Germany to Minnesota to Texas -- in his life. If you're interested in World War II from a different vantage point and you want to see the heartwarming conclusion of a remarkable man's stubborn path to achievement, this is the book for you. And there's a sub-plot about a moving adoption story as a bonus!"},{"Title":"Reluctant Warrior: Former German Pow Finds Peace in Texas","review":"Heino and Jean Erichsen's The Reluctant Warrior is an exciting and engaging narrative about the life of a former WWII German Soldier who becomes an American shortly after the war. One learns of his upbringing in Nazi Germany, his adventures and survival while serving in the Afrikakorps, and life as a prisoner of war in numerous camps in the US and abroad. As one who has researched Fort Knox history, I can say that this book provides readers with the most detailed-published account of life as POW at Fort Knox, Kentucky. After the war Heino returned to America seeking a better life. He not only found that life, but also assisted families and orphaned children in discovering it as well through an international adoption agency he and his wife established. While Heino's war memories are sure to be of interest to military aficionados, his post war activities are equally moving and inspiring."},{"Title":"Reluctant Warrior: Former German Pow Finds Peace in Texas","review":"IT IS GREAT BOOK TO READ ABOUT WHAT A GERMAN SOLDIER INWORLD WAR II WENT THROUGH."},{"Title":"Reluctant Warrior: Former German Pow Finds Peace in Texas","review":"Among other things, this story is an enlightening view of an Axis &quot;enemy&quot; in WW 2. But not at all like the fearsome German soldier propagandized by Adolph Hitler, U.S. movies and documentaries, nor by our own Armed Services during that war. It is also a classic view of what the German people experienced through that long war.As for the soldier, you see the human side of a German boy, raised in a middle class family, whose parents secretly opposed the war and Hitler's grand schemes. Frail as a lad, required to participate as a member of the Hitler Youth Program, and schooled for office work, Heino was inept as a soldier before he became a member of the Afrikan Korps under Field Marshall Rommel in February 1943. His story could easily have been the life of a similar American youth, except for location, culture, and circumstance of war.For Heino Erichsen, that circumstance included being captured and shipped to the United States as a Prisoner of War. On reflection, it was perhaps a more fortunate fate for him than for some of his American counterparts interned as POWs in Germany - but not a good thing at best.What he made of his life, despite the war, the onus of being a POW, and many other obstacles in his path, is a tribute to Erichsen's self discipline, work ethic, faith in his God, and a good wife - a combination manifest in his many good works worldwide since immigrating and becoming an American citizen.I interviewed Heino and Jean after reading a story about them in the local paper. I was so impressed by both of them that I purchased The Reluctant Warrior for my own library. After reading it, I was even more impressed with what they have made of their life, and I strongly recommend their book to you. It is interesting, educational, and quite revealing."},{"Title":"Cameroon (Enchantment of the World, Second)","review":"This is a nice book which tells you the basic history of Cameroon.

The most common and widely publicized one is the so-called atom-by-atom approach envisaged by physichists. Chemists, on the other hand, have adopted a molecule-by-molecule approach whereby the molecule represents the key building block for constructing nano-objects. Among the various reasons for doing so, we remember that (1) a lot of information about the structural, electronic, and spectroscopic properties of polyatomic molecules has been so far accumulated by research chemists and (2) synthetic chemistry allows the precise, although very elaborated, positioning of groups within a certain molecular framework thereby allowing the constuction of complex molecules characterized by machine-like capabilities. A number of fashinating molecular-scale machines and devices (rotors, gears, turnstiles, brakes, gyroscanes, etc.) has already been realized, as discussed in detail by Balzani-Venturi-Credi (BVC) in Chapter 11 of their book. These molecules give rise to spontaneous machanical-like motion. However, a factor of paramount importance for nanotechnology is that of achieving controllable mechanical-like motion. BVC discuss how this can be achieved by, for example, electrochemical or photochemical means. Chapter 9 is of particular interest for those working in the field of molecular electronics since it discusses about &quot;Logic Gates&quot;, i.e. molecules that might (will) be employed as molecular switches in future chemical (or molecular) computers. The amazing thing of this book is that all the material contained in it is real stuff, not pure speculation! You can verify this by checking the original references given at the end of each chapter. Hence, chemists are following an original approach to nanotechnology and the key for success will probably depend on whether they will find a clever way for wiring-up (networking) their molecules and make them (i.e., the resulting nano-object) work in concert. All in all this book (made of 16 chapters, about 500 pp., dozens of clear drawings and figures) is masterly written and logically organized. I cannot but rate it with 5 stars and a plus. If you want to know how chemists are approaching the field of nanotechnology, it should be in your bookshelf."},{"Title":"CANETTI AND NIETZSCHE","review":"This book was not received particularly well in the academic press, but I would like to suggest its intellectual rigour and sense of adventure rather put them off.

In this book, Hans Kung is recognizing both the new opportunities and potential dangers in this time of geopolitical change. Kung is a renowned expert on world-religions and their impact on society. His knowledge of the Abrahamic faith - Christianity, Judaism and Islam - is probably one of the most comprehensive. In this book, he calls for a minimum of shared ethical principles on which we should all agree, bringing believers and non-believers closer together.With a billion Catholics in the world, a billion Protestants and a billion Muslims - not to speak of several million Jews - half of the planet claims to belong to one of these religions. Kung is inviting these representatives of the great religions to encourage reconciliation and peace. The world faiths must provide foundations for ethical values and norms which could be universally binding.This book was published in the early nineties but its problematic remains very actual and current at a time when the United Nations are working on bringing religious leaders into their midst, to fight corruption and self-serving politics.Our global responsibility is clear: inter-religious dialogue is absolutely necessary since there is no possible survival without a common world ethic.Beyond democracy, we need to rediscover the common creteria for truth and to promote reconciliation worldwide.This scholarly contribution will stimulate the social, business and political leaders of the world to accept the challenge of dialogue and peace."},{"Title":"Global Responsibility: In Search of a New World Ethic","review":"This is one of the best ever books about the issue"},{"Title":"Global Responsibility: In Search of a New World Ethic","review":"I rate this one star because despite its elevated language and intellectual pretensions, it is aimed at limiting freedom of religion.The Assembly of Religious and Spiritual Leaders, eveloping a consensus \\"for how people should behave,\\" endorsed an interfaith document titled Towards a Global Ethic, An Initial Declaration. This document, drafted by Catholic theologian Hans Kung (who has censured by the Vatican for heretical teachings), condemns the \\"abuses of Earth's ecosystems,\\" poverty, and social injustices. It affirms interdependence, calling for \\"a common set of core values...found in the teachings of the religions.\\" \\"The Ethic,\\" if accepted, would represent \\"an irrevocable, unconditional norm for all areas of life, for families and communities, for races, nations, and religions.\\"In this book, \\"Global Responsibility: In Search of a New World Ethic\\" (1991), Mr. Kung makes clear that participation in this new \\"ethic\\" (religion) will NOT be optional. He states:\\"Any form of... church conservatism is to be rejected... To put it bluntly: no regressive or repressive religion - whether Christian, Islamic, Jewish or of whatever provenance - has a long-term future... If ethics is to function for the wellbeing of all, it must be indivisible. The undivided world increasingly needs an undivided ethic. Post modern men and women need common values, goals, ideals, visions. But the great question in dispute is: does not all this presuppose a religious faith?... What we need is an ecumenical world order! \\"The Global Ethic is emerging as a companion to The Earth Charter and is expected to be to religion what \\"The Charter\\" is to international politics. Together, these documents are destined to impact, if not shape, the future course of mankind. The World Core Curriculum is intended to accommodate both decrees by promoting their ideas and propaganda through public education.God, of course, has already given us a set of \\"global ethics\\" as part of His created order.

As a reviewer, I don't take looks too seriously but I have to admit this is one cute package: a slim vanilla volume covered by a shiny dust jacket with candy-colored stripes and a picture of an (empty) ice-cream dish. It is almost edible.In fact, the title story wasn't by any means my favorite --- it's a sort of glamorous throwaway about the suppression of appetite and its greedy return. But Dunmore, who is also a poet, writes so sensuously and precisely that she can make nearly anything matter. Best known as the author of elegant, pared-down psychological thrillers like TALKING TO THE DEAD and WITH YOUR CROOKED HEART, she has recently ventured beyond that genre with THE SIEGE, a novel set in the USSR during World War II. And now comes this collection of 18 stories --- none of which, as far as I can make out, have been published previously.Stories aren't usually my thing, except when they're by Alice Munro or Katherine Mansfield. If they move me, I want more; I want to be immersed for days (if possible) in a world of somebody else's making. Still, there is something thrilling about the way a story can begin with a moment and then open up to an entire life --- but subtly and concisely, so you get only the details you need and not the entire family tree. Dunmore seems to know instinctively just how much to tell: not so much that the narrative loses pace and edge, not so little that it becomes annoyingly cryptic. And her talent is such that ICE CREAM, although uneven in quality (short-story collections inevitably are), lives up to its name. I wanted to devour it all at once and had to make myself take it in slowly, bite by voluptuous bite.Dunmore's sense of language is extraordinary: lush, unhackneyed and rhythmic. She has a way of getting inside a character's head and making herself at home there; the stream of sensation, memory and ephemera is perfectly believable. In \\"You Stayed Awake With Me,\\" two friends, one of them ill, revisit a childhood summerhouse --- and some past betrayals. \\"Pain is a climate like winter,\\" the sick woman thinks. \\"It closes over you and soon you can't imagine not living in it. Some days, when I wake, before I move, I pretend to myself. I think I've got away. I'm stepping off a plane into a different climate where warm, spicy breezes blow your clothes against your thighs. I'm walking so lightly and easily that it feels like flying.\\" \\"The Lighthouse Keeper's Wife,\\" one of the best stories in the book, presents us with a man in mourning whose conversation with himself becomes our lens for a woman's hard, isolated, sturdy life: \\"Slowly, methodically, he would climb the lighthouse tower, toward the light, thinking of her. A mound of sea thudded against the tower, then fell back and weaseled at the foot of the rock, getting its strength. Nancy said she did not mind thinking of him in the lighthouse, no matter how bad the storms, but what she kept out of her thoughts was the moment when he was brought off the landing-platform, with the sea hungry for him and the lighthouse tender pitching. ... It made her sick to think of it, she said, though he knew she could walk to the edge of the cliff and stand there without a moment's dizziness.\\"There is no theme as such in ICE CREAM; the eclectic mix suggests a conscious effort to show off Dunmore's range, which is impressive --- from the futuristic bite of \\"Leonardo, Michelangelo, Superstork\\" to macabre fables like \\"Emily's Ring\\" and \\"The Clear and Rolling Water\\" to gentler vignettes that release sweet moments of transcendence (\\"Swimming Into the Millennium\\"; \\"Be Vigilant, Rejoice, Eat Plenty\\"). But I think her most original stories are darker. They are about the courage, craziness and solitude of the outsider and involve psychological and physical violence as well.Many of the tales in ICE CREAM come from the \\"wrong\\" side of some cultural divide or social convention --- geography, language, class, sexual roles --- and three of them are linked by a common protagonist: Ulli, a Finnish woman whose smart, ironic voice reveals a wintry landscape of the soul. \\"The Icon Room,\\" a brilliant story, relates her encounter with a stranger, both of them with only a lonely Sunday to look forward to: \\"Drinking cups of coffee until your heart bangs and you feel dizzy when you stand up. Walking home the quiet way and standing still while a lick of spring sunlight needles your skin. Prickling all afternoon as you wait for the sound of the telephone bell, which doesn't ring and doesn't ring, until at last you give up and put on your dressing gown.\\"I'd like to hear from Ulli again.

The reader is exposed to a variety of scenarios, from the reality based--in the title story, an actress denies herself her favorite indulgencies in order to maintain her fame--to the unreal--a story of a horrific future where cloning is praised and natural births are punished. Many of the plots involve themes of serious illness and/or death, including &quot;You Stayed Awake With Me&quot; (a woman with terminal illness confronts the past), &quot;The Lighthouse Keeper's Wife&quot; (a doting husband reflects on loss), &quot;Emily's Ring&quot; (a young girl is burdened with the care of her many half-siblings), and &quot;Lisette&quot; (a promosing young family is doomed in WWII France). Many of the tales are set in the past; the time isn't always specified, but several stories have a turn of the century feel. One character, Ulli, appears in three different stories; at first, she seems to be a world-weary woman, but in the final story, we learn that she is a 16 year old girl. Of the 18 stories in the book, most are 10-12 pages in length, with the longest being 24 pages and the shortest being only 4 pages.

His skewering of British society as it was during the early decades of the 20th century, his word selection, his interesting and varied characterizations are among the finest products of British fiction. In the midst of his writing life he was writing as intelligently and satirically as he did at the beginning. Reading \\"Decline and Fall\\" and \\"The Loved One\\" (1947) shows that Waugh lost none of his power over 19 years.This book, \\"Decline and Fall\\", recounts the blossoming of a rather nebbishy young divinity student, Paul Pennyfeather, after he is expelled from Oxford for an \\"indecency\\" that he did not commit. Paul slowly winds his way through British society until he is engaged to a very beautiful, very duplicious divorced woman. On his wedding day he is charged with aiding white slavery and delivered into a harsh life in prison. Eventually rescued by his criminal fiancee, he acts on his discovery that he is happier away from the luxury and shallowness of British Society. The plot may not sound of great interest but Waugh's writing and characters had me laughing and shaking my head in wonder at his humor.I urge anyone that enjoys P.G. Wodehouse to try Evelyn Waugh."},{"Title":"Decline and Fall","review":"What more can one say - Evenlyn Waugh is the master of his craft.

Once, I made it to the third chapter, I was hooked. This is a fantastical novel with a wonderful sense of the absurd. Waugh doesn't seem to be afraid of offending anyone; everybody is fair game. The reader never knows where Waugh is going but its so funny and well written that I didn't care! It goes very quickly and it's hard to like anyone, and, yet, no one is completely unsympathetic. At the end, I was reminded a little bit of Edith Wharton. A sort of sadness crept in, not a lot, just a bit. This novel is completely different from Brideshead Revisited. Although, Brideshead Revisited is one of my favorites, this is an excellent book in itself. I found it to be a complete pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Decline and Fall","review":"I read a biography of Evelyn Waugh years ago, and one fact sticks with me: he was a devout Catholic.This provides his satiric viewpoint on the society and people he found around him. In \\"Decline and Fall,\\" virtually everyone except the non-hero Paul Pennyfeather is viewed and portrayed with an acid tongue. Waugh may have been a devout Christian, but his interpretation of the command to love your enemies certainly moved him to what might be delicately called Tough Love.Add to his hilarious deadpan satire, his uncommon gift for language, and you're set for a very puzzling and enjoyable read. The only thing which makes it drag is that everyone in the book, absolutely everyone, is portrayed as a failure, a crook, or an agent of moral evil. (Except for Paul Pennyfeather, who has no personality at all.) I could detail all the sins committed by the major characters, but that would be giving the plot away.All in all, I guess I prefer P. G.

Probably NOT the best audience for the book--they need to grow a little older and closer to death...

Waugh weaves satiric barbs into the pretentious, absurd fabric of post-WWI British &quot;society&quot; (which persists to the present day in its basic form). One of the basic treatises is that British public (i.e. private) schooling for the upper classes is perfect training for (and perfectly compatible with) prison life. The prejudices, vanities, idiocies and random injustices of the privileged and pedigreed are shown up for sport and ridicule. Waugh knows his subject and fairly skewers it in great humor for the reader's enjoyment."},{"Title":"Decline and Fall","review":"One of Waugh's comic masterpieces, Decline and Fall stands as a hilarious meditation on the calamities imposed on the support players in a superficially dignified world. Waugh's brief first novel is a scathing send up of 20th century aristocracy and its institutions, beginning with public (i.e., private, in Britain) boarding schools and progressing on, uproariously and yet somehow logically, to the British prison system.All the stylistic reserve and precision of Waugh's later works are in place in this novel, the earlier sections of which are loosely based on the author's brief stint as a teacher at an all-boys school. But Tom Brown's School Days this isn't. Mad deans, criminal instructors, worldly lads and promiscuous parents all provide gusts of absurd comedy that keep this whirlwind of absurd happenstance and hypocrisy twisting.

But this, Evelyn Waugh's first novel published in 1928, has no youthful awkwardness to shed. It is a fully accomplished work that may as well be a novice's introduction to Waugh for the way it distills his uniquely sardonic, misanthropic style.Paul Pennyfeather is an Oxford divinity student who comes to grief when some upper-class twits steal his trousers and get him expelled. With nowhere else to go, he accepts a teaching post at a Welsh boarding school, Llanabba, which caters to the problem children of the rich. It's not what you teach the children that's important, insists Llanabba's master, Dr. Fagan, but having what he calls \\"tone.\\"\\"Decline And Fall\\" has tone, too, a bloody whole lot of it. Waugh's depiction of the boarding school and its Welsh surroundings are presented in a series of deft one-liners offset only by delightfully meandering physical descriptions and a tortured tale worthy of Michael Palin's \\"Ripping Yarns\\" which raises the bar of comedic misery with every page.At one point, the school decides to put on an impromptu field day to impress some VIP parents. Having not bothered to acquire hurdles or other track gear to speak of, the boys are lined up and told to run at the sound of the starting gun. This is done with a real gun, by an inebriated teacher who manages to shoot one of the titled youngsters in the foot.\\"I knew that was going to happen,\\" sighs the stricken boy's noble father.\\"A most unfortunate beginning,\\" comments Dr. Fagan.\\"First blood to me!\\" cries the drunken teacher.Waugh is very much in his element already here. You have here the foibles of airhead aristocrats, socially-correct men whose standards of civility make them easy prey for the fairer sex, and quasi-religious concerns expressed by those of little faith for whom Waugh had the clearest contempt.\\"Once granted the first step, I can see that everything else follows - Tower of Babel, Babylonian captivity, Incarnation, Church, bishops, incense, everything - but what I couldn't see, and what I can't see now, is WHY did it all begin?\\" a would-be Anglican cleric tells Pennyfeather. Asking his bishop was no help, \\"he didn't think the point really arose as far as my practical duties as a parish priest were concerned.\\"Pennyfeather himself is very much in league with other Waugh protagonists, like Tony Last in \\"Handful Of Dust\\" and William Boot in \\"Scoop.\\" He initiates nothing; instead things keep happening to him. He's accurately described at one point as a person \\"meant to stay in the seats\\" rather than risk a hard fall by getting too close to life's spinning axle.Waugh's treatment of a black character in the book is off-putting, as other reviewers here note, though it should be added that the Welsh, \\"the only nation in the world that has produced no graphic or plastic art...they just sing...,\\" come in for harsher scorn. The real weakness of the book as I see it comes when Pennyfeather leaves the school and takes up with a flighty noblewoman with a suspicious sideline. It's not a bad detour, in many ways the subplot is quite good, but Llanabba is the heart and soul of this book, and the farther away the novel moves from that, the weaker it becomes.Yes, Waugh did mature and write deeper works in time. But his touch was never as sure, or his comic eye as sharp, as it is here."},{"Title":"Decline and Fall","review":"I think the cover of this book is very well drawn - the look of all the Waugh books put out by &quot;Back Bay,&quot; actually, is interesting, with those funny-looking illustrations and garish orange color. Still, I'm not sure about the quality of the binding. My copy has held up well, but I was in a bookstore, reading a copy of &quot;Scoop&quot; (also by Waugh, also put out by Back Bay, also a paperback) and the glue that bound the pages and the cover didn't do its job properly, and you can guess the rest.So it might be worth your while to get a brand new copy of this book, or find a hardcover. I should make clear that if you don't own a copy of this book, you are missing out on a potential reference for how to create an effective writing style. Waugh's style is magnificent, especially for a satire like this. His sometimes pretentious prose fits the ironic occassion perfectly. But usually his style is more restrained, and the book, as a consequence, reads quickly and is remembered easily.The novel concerns one Paul Pennyfeather, a former Oxford student kicked out (of Oxford) shortly after the First World War for &quot;indecent behavior.&quot; As the story goes on, he becomes a schoolmaster in Wales, engaged to a noblewoman who may have murdered her husband, and thrown into prison. The series of misadventures Paul undergoes is purposeful: at every level of '20's English society some group of people or some set of mores is castigated.Now you might be asking yourself whether or not you want to read this book. I think it is safe to say that no matter who you are, you should read it. It reads too quickly to be dismissed as &quot;not worth my time,&quot; but it is too important in terms of those large questions like &quot;Why is life so rotten? Could it be particular attitudes we have inherited from our ancestors?&quot; to be left alone."},{"Title":"Decline and Fall","review":"Waugh's first novel is an outrageous satire that pokes fun at the British class system, religion, and education. If one does not take it at all seriously, then it is a howlingly funny book. His \\"hero,\\" Paul Pennyfeather, and the other characters float in and out of various kinds of trouble without seeming to learn a single thing. Best moment - the casual, but horrifying fate of poor little Lord Tangent. The amusing illustrations drawn by Waugh himself are a delightful bonus. I highly recommend this book and look forward to reading more of Waugh."},{"Title":"Decline and Fall","review":"When the First World War ended in 1918, Evelyn Waugh was fifteen years old. Over the next decade, he saw a continuation of the wrenching that England had suffered first on a material level, then on a moral and social one. In DECLINE AND FALL, Waugh expresses his dismay that the psychic underpinning that had bolstered England for the fighting proved incapable to lead it in the years that led to the Great Depression. Everywhere Waugh looked, he saw a gradual disintegration of the English social fabric, and for him, this fraying of that fabric allowed him to use his new found sense of biting satire that could lash out in all directions.DECLINE AND FALL (1926) was Waugh's first novel. His protagonist Paul Pennyfeather is the contemporary English Everyman, a basically decent sort of chap who seeks to do the right thing, but finds out that all too often that he is the only one interested in doing that. Pennyfeather's approach to life is a passive one. When dire events happen, he tries harder to deflect their severity than to eradicate them altogether. The opening chapter sets the tone for his inability to confront dire evil with purposeful resolve. He is a student at Scone University who is subject to a mean trick by a group of consciousless upperclass cads, the result of which is that he is expelled for moral turpitude. Rather than fight to stay in school he meekly accepts his fate. From this point on, the novel descends into a series of events whose reverberations and ripples drag him ever more deeply into the muck and slime of existential disarray. He finds a job teaching vicious urchins at a tenth rate school, where he predictably encounters both students and teachers whose only purpose is to bedevil him. Eventually, he meets a woman who promises to be the Great Love of his life. She unwittingly involves him a white slavery deal that results in his imprisonment. By the time the novel ends, Pennyfeather has gone in a big circle. He returns to Scone University in a disguise (he needs one since he escaped from prison), but this disguise is external only. Inwardly, he is the same passive but good hearted naive youth that he was in the beginning.DECLINE AND FALL proved to be the first in a series of novels that allowed Waugh to explore the bitter angst that bubbled beneath the surface in an English middle class society that increasingly came to see itself as having lost its moral compass in an age that prized breaking the rules over following them. As with all good writers, Waugh depicts a society that draws the reader inwardly, all the while urging that reader to judge the worth of that society as viewed through the bitterly satiric lens of a man who wants his reading public to feel the same sense of outrage that he does. In DECLINE AND FALL, Waugh succeeds admirably."},{"Title":"Decline and Fall","review":"_Decline And Fall_ is a biting satire of the British class system. According to \\"the rules of the game\\" the British aristocracy not only own all wealth and property, but also have a licence to control and manipulate the lower classes for their own selfish needs. For instance, Margot Beste-Chetwynde, a wealthy and attractive widow deeply involved in the international prostitution trade, manipulates poor Paul Pennyfeather into travelling to Marseilles to assist several of Mrs. B-C's \\"ladies\\" detained there. For his part, Paul is arrested and forced to take the rap for Mrs. B-C. Mr. Waugh makes it quite clear that Paul is not the novel's hero. He is too light-weight and inconsequential to assume that role as the name Pennyfeather implies. Paul encounters one mishap after another, including disinheritence by his guardian, having been unjustly blamed for a prank that was played on him at Scone College, where Paul had been enrolled._Decline And Fall_ contains a bevy of colorful and picaresque characters: the shadowy butler, Philbrick, who recounts to anyone who will listen myriad versions of his background, none of them true; the drunken fool of a school-master, Prendergast, who later becomes a chaplain at the jail where Paul becomes incarcerated; the bigamist and very elusive Captain Grimes; and Mr. Sebastien (Chokey) Chotmondley, who is Mrs. B-C's constant companion, a sensitive and erudite black man, who is the subject of gossip of Mrs. B-C's aristocratic friends.Mr. Waugh's novel of class and culture clash is extraordinarily droll and full of dark humor. One character aptly sums up the author's highly cynical and critical philosophy when he puts to Paul Pennyfeather the query if he could ever imagine Mrs. Beste-Chetwynde spending time in prison? Of course not--it is the job of the lower classes to go to prison and to suffer for the pecadillos of the upper classes."},{"Title":"Decline and Fall","review":"After reading \\"Brideshead Revisited\\" and \\"Handful of Dust,\\" this one clinched Waugh as one of my favorite writers. The plot folds and refolds and unfolds with a big cast of amusing characters and the \\"shadow\\" of the antihero Paul vaguely at the center. The humor plays itself out in both the overall arc of the story and in shifts of meaning from one line to the next. This period of English history when all the old customs of the gentry were in place yet there were cars and airplanes is very interesting. I'd recommend Waugh's books to anyone who likes Jane Austen and Henry James. \\"Vile Bodies\\" is another of Waugh's satires that incorporates some of the same characters, but is not a sequel."},{"Title":"Decline and Fall","review":"On p. 163, the 25-year-old Waugh intrudes in the voice of his omniscient narrator, revealing his protagonist Paul Pennyfeather as a hollow man of the Jazz Age: \\"readers must not complain if the shadow which took his name does not amply fill the important part of hero for which he was originally cast.\\" By whom? The class system? Fate? His deceased parents or uncaring guardian? Oxford's \\"Scone\\" college's bullies who frame him and the masters who expel him for \\"indecent behavior\\"? The distanced stance taken by the author towards his creation in his d&eacute;but novel already reveals a more complicated tale than the side-splitter full of deadpan one-liners that casual readers of this novel may have assumed.The satire begins lightly, but as Paul's unfair expulsion shows, there's a serrated edge to this fictional undercutting of post-WWI English society. Having to fend for himself, as did Waugh, teaching in a Welsh college of less than distinguished lineage, Paul's told by the headmaster: \\"I have been in the scholastic profession long enough to know that nobody enters it unless he has some very good reason which he is anxious to conceal.\\" (15) At a dinner party for his future fiance&eacute; and nemesis, Lady Beste-Chetwynde, the Vicar notes how \\"lay interest in ecclesiastical matters is often a prelude to insanity.\\" (91)Neither Church nor the gentry can provide direction, let alone education or the prisons, war profiteers or white slavers, as Paul becomes enmeshed in plans he, as the opening passage I cited demonstrates, can never outwit. The central sections of the narration may, however, be the weakest. While amusing, their pace slackens and incidents follow one another without apparent reason here and there. This may well be intended to show Paul's lack of willpower in a frenzied decade, but the novel takes on, from our distance of eight decades, too remote a tone.It's hard to care much for any satire when the figures are all figureheads. Waugh's aware, young as he was when publishing this. The novel gains gravitas as it follows Paul's further decline and fall. A tremendous passage halfway through articulates the traditional fear behind the modern era's mask of confidence.Grimes laments: \\"Our life is lived between two homes. We emerge for a little into the light, and then the front door closes. The chintz curtains shut out the sun, and the hearth glows with the fire of home, while upstairs, above our heads, are enacted again the awful accidents of adolescence. There's a home and a family waiting for every one of us. We can't escape, try how we may.\\" (133) \\"As individuals we simply do not exist,\\" he continues. We seem like \\"potential home builders, beavers and ants. How do we come into being? What is birth?\\" (134)This reveals far more \\"The Waste Land\\"'s despair than a lighthearted send-up of Oxford, boarding school, snobs, or the smart set. Themes that \\"A Handful of Dust\\" would deepen in later years, as Alexander Waugh notes in his chronicle of his clan, \\"Fathers and Sons\\" (also reviewed by me here), make Waugh deserving of our respect for the care with which even the less-weighty works of his early years are assembled, and how they tackle, glancingly yet bruisingly, the terrors underneath the romps. His Majesty's Prison no worse than a British public school, war mongerers awaiting their investments to be paid off in the next global scrap, the uselessness of journalistic churning of the \\"news\\" to the jaded, the haplessness of religious institutions or conventional schooling: these all appear here, as Paul's long shadows.As the prison warden Sir Wilfrid Lucas-Dockery opines about Paul: \\"You could see with that unfortunate man what a difference it made to him to think that, far from being a mere nameless slave, he has now become part of a great revolution in statistics.\\" (227) The vocal register here's exact. So is that which to us turns more disturbing, with the Lady's black lover \\"Chokey.\\" Waugh does play this character close to the vest, but he does show that condescension gives as well as takes-- see the \\"rood screen\\" exchange-- in a manner that may prove more subtle and durable despite Waugh also displaying his own racial prejudices. It's a complicated scene, to say the least, with more than may meet the reader too quick to cast calumny then or now. \\"Chokey\\" stays elusive to survive.Authors from around 1930 with more solemn approaches may lodge on college reading lists, but Waugh, in his blend of effortlessly recorded dialogue and accurately rendered blather of all classes, may have brought this combination off with humane compassion, outrage, wickedness, and insight-- better than some of his more ambitious peers. As Alexander Waugh reminds us, Evelyn labored to capture how people talked as well as how they acted, and sentences here beg to be recited as testament to his skill at reminding us that we still wallow in patronizing attitudes, class stereotypes, and cruel behavior. Calling attention to this as Waugh does, he knows he is no less to blame, but at least he has the upper hand, for he expects us to recognize the foibles here and to behave better than those at whose follies we cringe as often as we chortle. That's the mark of satire that has no expiration date."},{"Title":"Decline and Fall","review":"This bitter farce tells the story of one Paul Pennyfeather, a young man who is expelled from an Oxford-like university due to a misunderstanding. Ever since this first scene the reader understands that he's reading a novel of the absurd. The point is never to tell a credible story with a tight plot, but to develop a savage satire on the British society, especially the educational system. After being expelled, Paul finds himself with no money and so is forced to get a job at a school of the worst level. His colleagues are pathetic and their small misadventures are hilarious. Of course, Waugh's humor is very British: caustic, understated, and at the same time some passages, like the athletic event, are excessive to the point of ridicule. At some point, Paul makes the acquaintance of the mother of one of his pupils, a rich and beautiful widow who proposes to him in marriage. This seems to be Paul's lucky break of a lifetime, and he eagerly accepts. But the woman runs a strange business which will produce the decline and fall of the title.What develops as a hilarious farce ends up being a sad story. Waugh aims his mockery at every person and system included in the novel. Education, prostitution, jail, politics and business are all the target of this first novel which promises much about the future work of Waugh. Recommended."},{"Title":"Decline and Fall","review":"In this his first novel, Evelyn Waugh lampoons the English education system, sporting events, theological study, the landed gentry, and prison reform, to name just some of the targets of his razor-sharp satirical barbs. Paul Pennyfeather, a third-year divinity student at Scone College, is kicked out after a prank is pulled on him leaving him indecently exposed; he then gets a job as a teacher in a prep school where his past is ignored (\\"I have been in the scholastic profession long enough,\\" says the school's head Dr. Fagan, \\"to know that nobody enters it unless he has some very good reason which he is anxious to conceal.\\"). From there the craziness only multiplies: a student is accidentally shot in the foot with a starter's gun at a track meet (and dies); Pennyfeather gets involved with the debauched Margot Beste-Chetwynde and goes to prison in her place as a white slave-trader (the truly insane practices of the prison seem right out of a Marx Brothers movie); he is somehow legally declared dead on an operating table in prison where he was to have his already-removed appendix taken out; and then miraculously finds himself back at Scone none the worse for wear.As I read the book I was reminded often of ALICE IN WONDERLAND: the Caucus race and the track meet, the nonsense poems in both, the \\"reforms\\" that are worse than the problems they are addressing, the return to \\"normalcy\\" at the end as if nothing of consequence ever happened. Waugh's satire is biting and very, very funny, but never excessively cruel or mean. One begins laughing while reading this novel right on the first page (the party scene is hilarious in its destructive foolishness, \\"a lovely evening\\") and continues to do so with few interruptions to the end. It's scathing, brilliant comedy - something Waugh was a master at."},{"Title":"Decline and Fall","review":"This is the novel that made a young Evelyn Waugh's reputation in 1928. \\"Decline and Fall\\" is dripping with early glimpses of the comic satire that Waugh would come to produce. The story follows the improbable events of Paul Pennyfeather's life after he is sent down from Scone College, Oxford.Pennyfeather, a meek and polite divinity student, runs afoul of a group of drunken students after a raucous old boy dinner of the Bollinger Club. After a misunderstanding about a school tie, the students take Pennyfeather's pants there on the school quad. Pennyfeather is expelled for indecency.What makes the hapless Pennyfeather so, for lack of a better word, huggable, is that events happen to him, not the other way around. He meets a bizarre cast of repeating characters, in this funny if somewhat moody book. If you read \\"Decline and Fall\\" as the satire that it is, even the casualness with which a grizzly murder is handled is funny.\\"Decline and Fall\\" is well worth reading, but it isn't Waugh's best work. His rather scattershot lampooning of every aspect of upper-middle class British life will be honed to perfection in later works like \\"Scoop.\\"It's a great read and a zany adventure for Paul Pennyfeather, and while it appears that the story ends where it starts, it doesn't. That is the key the satisfying conclusion that Waugh gives his tale that at times seems little more than a Monty Python skit. Penny feather is a changed man, even if England is the same. Evelyn Waugh was a great novelist, even in 1928."},{"Title":"Decline and Fall","review":"Waugh's notorious first novel, \\"Decline and Fall\\" brutally satirizes British society of the 1920s with his characteristic black humor. Based in part, upon his own experiences at Oxford and teaching at a private school in Wales in 1925, it lays waste British notions of honor, educational excellence, sportsmanship, the Church, and the upper class generally. In an age when most \\"humor\\" is visual slapstick, it is refreshing to read a writer who could be screamingly funny using words alone.Readers with Politically Correct views, will probably be offended by this book (or any of Waugh's other novels for that matter), but those who believe that the only test of humor is whether or not it is funny will find it an enjoyable read.Note: The movie version of another great satire by Waugh, \\"The Loved One,\\" has only recently been released on DVD. With a screenplay by Terry Southern (who also wrote the screenplay for \\"Dr. Strangelove\\"), it is definitely worth buying, although you will enjoy it more if you read the book first. It is one of those rare films that does the book justice."},{"Title":"Decline and Fall","review":"While I think that Brideshead Revisited is his best, this is Waugh at his funniest, before the iron had got into his soul. The satire of an English public school is executed with such a light touch that even a character's death cannot prick the bubble. Especially recommended to fans of Kingsley Amis's \\"Lucky Jim.\\""},{"Title":"Decline and Fall","review":"This book has become my personal invitation to screaming, stomach grasping laughter. Waugh's portrayal of the particular bigotries, blindnesses and vanities of the various members of the British class system; the manner by which it invades every personality and way of thinking lends a good shaking up to contemporay myopia and to my funny bone. And though I may have laughed before, I have never been so guaranteed of a side splitting mood changer as when I pick up this book and begin to read. Alas, although I've read just about everything else Waugh wrote, and God knows loved, nothing in his enormous body of great writing reached this level of perfection and perfect aim."},{"Title":"Decline and Fall","review":"One of Waugh's comic masterpieces, Decline and Fall stands as a hilarious meditation on the calamities imposed on the support players in a superficially dignified world.

An enjoyable read and high recommened."},{"Title":"Decline and Fall","review":"Like PG Wodehouse's mischievous younger brother -- the one who pulls wings off butterflies and fries ants beneath a magnifying glass -- Evelyn Waugh tore into British hypocrisy and human stupidity with something like joyful exuberance. While most of us repent our sins and frailty, Waugh reveled in fallen human nature.\\"Decline and Fall,\\" Waugh's first book (he was already a conspicuous talent at 25), is a skewed bildungsroman, that ever-popular genre of fiction wherein a young hero or heroine embarks on a journey of self-discovery. Our hero is Paul Pennyfeather, an affable young student at Oxford who is wrongly (well, sort of wrongly) accused of indecent exposure when he is separated from his trousers in a case of mistaken-identity hazing. Like Nicholas Nickleby before him, Pennyfeather must make his own way in the world and soon lands a position as a teacher at a boys school of questionable repute (Waugh had also taught at a private school). He is assigned to give organ lessons despite having no musical ability whatsoever. \\"Do the best you can,\\" is the headmaster's helpful advice. Pennyfeather is a quick study; his method for keeping a classful of unruly prepubescents occupied is quite ingenious: a reward of half a crown to whoever writes the longest essay, irrespective of quality.With PG Wodehouse there is always affection for his characters, however dumb, brutish, vain, or insipid. With Waugh there is only sneering disdain. His Dickensian characters (Lady Cirumference and Lord Tangent, for example) are like medieval allegories of the Seven Deadly Sins: Pride, Folly, Lust, and so forth. They aren't exactly 3-dimensional, but they are certainly vivid. One is grateful that the unforgiving Waugh, though later a Catholic convert, would never sit in judgment of his fellow men except for in his fiction. For as Hamlet said, \\"Use every man after his desert and who should 'scape whipping.'Though I prefer to 'scape whipping in my own life, witnessing Waugh whip others can be maliciously amusing. \\"Decline and Fall\\" is a lightning fast read--flashy and crackling with energy. Waugh takes aim at so many targets so indiscriminately (British class systems, educational institutions, prison life, brutalist German architecture, conspicuous consumption, and loose society women for starters) that one can't blame him if a few are only glancing blows. Sketchy, scattershot scenes tumble one after the other in a mad cinematic rush, and Waugh is on to the next target before you can stop to assess the damage to the last one.He would hone his skills as a satirist in the years to come -- \\"Decline and Fall\\" is more cudgel than scalpel --but it is a quick and amusing read. As an opening salvo to Waugh's career, it certainly proved loud and attention-getting; a full-frontal assault. No doubt British society felt pummeled by Waugh's brutal Blitzkrieg."},{"Title":"Decline and Fall","review":"This is a perfectly executed novel. Not a word can be cut out or changed without ruining the story. How writing used to be.... No, even in Waugh's day, this book stood out (I think) for being mannered yet anti-frilly. Amazingly current and timeless. Universal, eternal themes treated include the mixing and degeneration of cultures and civilizations, class consciousness, imperialism. I'm glad it hasn't made into a movie (at least I don't think it has been)."},{"Title":"Decline and Fall","review":"This is an under-read classic. The hapless hero, having been chucked out of university, lands in a barely respectable public school. What follows is an hilarious skewering of twentieth century society in microcosm. Sex, art, money, and, of course, class, figure prominently, with a sly nod at race, to boot. Never a dull moment."},{"Title":"Decline and Fall","review":"A hilariously funny novel by a young writer thoroughly out of touch with the mainstream. Set in a time when detachment was easy and even encouraged. A thoroughly enjoyable satire by Evelyn Waugh for fans and students."},{"Title":"Decline and Fall","review":"\\"Decline and Fall\\" has served as my introduction to Evelyn Waugh, and I am satisfied. This biting satire has deadpan dark humor, a protagonist whose detached observations serve the plot well, and an ending that is depressingly stark in its view of our human nature.This novel reminds me greatly of Voltaire's \\"Candide\\" in its themes, plotting, and characterization. The novel zips along and sweeps the reader into a plethora of events, each more outrageous than the last, until it dumps you at the end with a sad realization about this \\"ship of fools\\" we call life on earth. Don't get me wrong, the novel won't depress you, but it will leave you with a lot to mull over once you close it. However, Waugh makes the journey bearable through some of the most outrageously funny lines I have encountered in literature. I laughed out loud often while reading this text.This is a book that can easily be misread. One could read it on the surface level and get a funny story with a dope of a lead character. You would enjoy it, put it down, and move on. And that is fine. However, this novel is such a text and much more. Waugh has an innate ability to combine biting and relevant observations about society into the most ridiculous conversations between his characters. Read this text for the humor, but stay alert to the nuggets just beneath the surface and you will get a fuller experience.Some readers may have trouble with the British colloquialisms that Waugh uses, but most can be figured out from context.I will be exploring more of this writer. I can pay him no higher compliment that that."},{"Title":"Decline and Fall","review":"Why do you get the reviews for &quot;Loved One&quot; under &quot;Decline and Fall? &quot; Oh well, I thought that &quot;Decline and Fall&quot; was an extremely funny book, full of outrageous characters and events.

All in all I really enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Decline and Fall","review":"Well, it's a frothy, surrealistic romp, and had its moments of black humor that made me laugh, but it's hard to believe that it was written by the same person who would eventually give us \\"Brideshead Revisited\\". As an admirer of Waugh, I'm glad I read it, but I would definitely never read it a second time. The story would probably work better as a screwball comedy on the silver screen."},{"Title":"Decline and Fall","review":"\\"Decline and Fall\\" is the ninth book by Evelyn Waugh that I have read. There were times, during these nine books, when I wondered what the heck I was reading and why. Waugh's style of writing makes his books enjoyable to read but I don't always come away clear on what it was that he wrote. He's the sort of author that can make you feel like you've just read a powerful drama only to discover how the critics loved the book's hilarious satire. In the case of \\"Decline and Fall\\", I kept looking for a theme to the book; a reason that the author would have written it. I confess to laughing at time at the many satirical passages and the impossible situations that his characters fall into. Still, I kept thinking I was ambling down a directionless path. In time I was able to satisfy my need for a theme.I came to understand \\"Decline and Fall\\" as a comment on where do we each fit in and once we find that place in society, what does it really matter. Our \\"hero\\", Paul Pennyfeather, starts out with an uncomfortable fit with the upper class, moves into a reasonable middle class position and then finds himself in a largely lower class position. At every level, there are enough eccentrics to leave us wondering if anybody has a grip on reality. Towards the very end of the book, there's a brief comparison of life to a gravitational carnival ride; only those at the center have either the time or perspective to see things for what they are. Paul Pennyfeather's problem was that he was always surrounded by those in the process of falling off.I feel better having found a purpose in \\"Decline and Fall\\". I was tempted to rate the book a \\"3\\" and would have without the strong ending that it had.

It's been over 30 years since I last read this masterpiece. Oh what a treat to read it again!"},{"Title":"Decline and Fall","review":"I loved Waugh's Brideshead Revisited, and I have enjoyed some of his satires in the past. I didn't finish this book, and I am writing this only because I couldn't find a negative review to agree with. It is heavy handed satire with dull characters."},{"Title":"Decline and Fall","review":"It's not uncommon that the books we're assigned in high school or even college sail by the larger portions of our young brains. Not only are, ahem, \\"other things\\" clamoring for our attention when we are that age but for a great number of us, it isn't the ideal time to be turned on to subtlety. We're too raw. For example, even though I enjoyed the poetry of Wordsworth in undergraduate school, I was told by my professors that I would only truly come to appreciate him once I'd gotten a little older.Which brings me to Evelyn Waugh, and the novel Decline and Fall. I can certainly remember ... well, not /hating/ the book when I read it for a class in the Comic Novel, but now that I return to it a few decades later, well, sheesh, the thing has me in stitches!Waugh is definitely a \\"deadpan\\" humorist. It may seem strange to claim that \\"deadpan\\" actually covers a wide range of styles, but it does. There's the literal (!) deadpan of Buster Keaton. There's the deadpan camera of Jim Jarmusch. There's the kinda-stoned but hysterical deadpan of MST3K's Joel Hodgson. And then there's the deadpan of Evelyn Waugh:\\"My boy has been injured in the foot,\\" said Lady Circumference coldly.\\"Dear me! Not badly, I hope? Did he twist his ankle in the jumping?\\"\\"No,\\" said Lady Circumference, \\"he was shot at by one of the assistant masters. But it is kind of you to inquire.\\"I can still recall my professor's joy when she read this passage to us. I doubt most of us \\"got it\\" past the point of a distracted snicker or two. Wow, though, do I get it now. It's subtle, but it's also like a cannon disguised as a lemonade stand.To be sure, this novel requires that you allow yourself to ease into the rhythms and language and concerns of English school life, which may seem a bit alien to many of us. But once you are there, it is a delight to just relax, get to know Waugh's stable of eccentrics and then let the laughs wash up, out of and over you.Although this book is lighter than air, the satire also cuts deeply, and as a result I find Waugh far more satisfying than, say, P. G. Wodehouse, who on the surface travels through similar realms. If you are overstressed, overtired or fear you have lost your sense of humor at the already-worn horrors of the 21st century, there are worse remedies than turning to this delightful novel."},{"Title":"Decline and Fall","review":"Evelyn Waugh's first novel \\"Decline and Fall\\" pops like a cork from a bottle of champagne. While many authors take years and volumes to find just the right tone, the 25-year-old Waugh, who had just published a biography of Dante Rossetti, seems to have had his literary concept perfectly in mind from the start and hit the ground running with this raucously funny yet astonishingly mature debut.The hero (although Waugh would disagree with the term) is Paul Pennyfeather, a divinity student at Scone College, Oxford, who as the book begins is expelled for \\"indecent behavior\\" of which he is actually innocent, and is promptly disowned by his guardian over the shame educed by this incident. Now, in need of money, he searches for a job, and the only one he can get is a teaching position at a small boys' school located in a Welsh castle called Llanabba.Llanabba, while not quite rivaling Dotheboys Hall of \\"Nicholas Nickleby,\\" is a woefully undignified educational facility, an institution of incompetence. The headmaster is a crafty curmudgeon named Dr. Fagan, the butler Philbrick is a criminal who prospers by constantly falsifying his identity, and the boys are an undisciplined and ungifted lot. The other instructors seem to have been deposited there for having failed elsewhere: Mr. Prendergast, a clergyman who has left the Church because of \\"Doubts,\\" and Captain Grimes, a maimed ex-soldier (\\"Think I lost it in the war,\\" he tells Pennyfeather about his missing leg) who is continually \\"in the soup\\" but always manages to extricate himself.Romance, or rather that badinage between the sexes that passes for romance in Waugh's world, turns out to be Pennyfeather's bane, initiating his misadventures in the second half of the novel. His engagement to marry the voluptuous Mrs. Beste-Chetwynde, the widowed mother of one of the Llanabba boys, is interrupted by his incarceration for unwittingly assisting her business of procuring prostitutes, one of whom is Grimes's wife; in prison he unsurprisingly encounters some old friends who can help him break free, and by the author's grace everything comes full circle in the end.One of Waugh's many strengths is his ability to create a multitude of humorous characters out of completely original cloth. There is a family whose names are inspired by geometry: a Llanabba boy named Tangent and his mother, the globular Lady Circumference, whose boorish manners belie her title. The indirect cause of Pennyfeather's predicament, and his eventual savior, is the young dandy Sir Alistair Trumpington, who makes a major appearance in Waugh's later novel \\"Put Out More Flags.\\" And the brainiest character in the novel is Otto Silenus, a young German architect with a philosophical outlook and a radical style who is hired by Mrs. Beste-Chetwynde to renovate her celebrated country house called King's Thursday.Silenus's concluding metaphor about life--a spinning wheel on which some people are meant to be riders and the rest spectators--is not as silly as it sounds; it seems as if Waugh's authorial impulse is to exhibit the contrast between the two types of people and observe the comical results when the boundary is crossed."},{"Title":"Decline and Fall","review":"Waugh's gift, so apparent in this novelette, is to fill his books with incident, but to do it in such a way that it never seems gratuitous. Who else could have a drunk misfire the starting pistol at a boy's school's games, have the bullet hit a poor kid's foot, cause the kind of damage that necessitates the removal of the foot, and still have us smiling at the audaciousness of it all? So don't worry, this slim little volume is a full meal, and a very satisfying one. Waugh is also economical - characters regularly return for yet another go at having an effect upon the fate of the main character (reminiscent of &quot;Tom Jones&quot;). T.S. Eliot lovers will also have a pleasant surprise waiting for them: Toward the end of the book, Waugh has a character explaining the meaning of life that sounds suspiciously like a passage from Eliot's &quot;Four Quartets.&quot; But you don't have to know that, or anything else really, to get great pleasure from reading &quot;Decline and Fall.&quot; Make it your next book."},{"Title":"Decline and Fall","review":"In this story of Paul Pennyfather's disaster of a life Waugh takes his first satirical shots at just about every establishment and class in England at the time. Pennyfather suffers almost every possible misfortune though his life, from being sent down from university for indecent behaviour to imprisonment for white slave trading. Despite being innocent of all crime Paul allows misfortune and punishment to visit him almost unprotesting. It is as though Waugh punishes him for his insignificance and his lack of substance and that is his true crime. I am a huge fan of Waugh and find the satire and cutting wit outrageously funny, but beyond the humor there are more relevant messages for the society of his time and it's establishment figures. I cannot recommend any of Waugh's novels highly enough and this, his first, is no exception."},{"Title":"Decline and Fall","review":"Waugh's debut novel has the scattershot approach of a boy with his first bee-bee gun. The church, the gentry, public schools, the penal system, the judiciary, token blacks and the aristocracy. If he missed anything or anybody, that's the biggest accident of all.Paul Pennyfather is the transparent vessel that is acted upon by all the howling winds of hypocrisy. I liked Paul and always expected him to muddle through with his excellent manners (\\"always a gentleman.\\") He is sent down from an Oxford look-alike under the cloud of \\"indecent behavior\\" when he is the victim of a hazing incident that leaves him trouserless on the common. His guardian cancels his allowance for the shame of it, and Paul is forced to take a position in sub-par boys school in Wales. The cast of characters is well used, whoever he meets always returns later in the story until Waugh settles them or kills them off, whichever suits his fancy. As wild as the ride is, the story ends tidily with Paul in exactly the same position as when he started.There is an undertone of iron in this biting tale. I think Waugh already was getting his religious visions in place. \\"Decline and Fall\\" is brilliant, but moody. Your discomfort level might rise even while you are laughing. \\"Decline and Fall\\" is an excellent introduction to Evelyn Waugh's works. If all else fails, as another reviewer mentioned, pretend it's a Monty Python sketch.-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Decline and Fall","review":"Rarely does a debutant written such a novel with perfect pitch and right tone. Evelyn Waugh is one of those few talented people who can make an unforgettable impression with their very first work, \\"Decline and Fall\\". Book after book, he proved that this one was not a fluke and all the talent he promised here was confirmed later on.As he tells halfway through the narrative, \`the whole of this book is really an account of the mysterious disappearance of Paul Pennyfeather', and its pages tells us who is and what happened to the character. He is a strange man from the beginning when he is kicked out of college because of indecent exposure -not his fault, actually - and ends up forced to work as a schoolmaster.In his new position Pennyfeather will meet many interesting characters that eventually will lead to his fall. These people - mostly Margot and her son Peter - will change his life, mostly for worse, until he disappears - but there is more in Waugh witty narrative.With his main character, the writer depicted those kind of people who never acts, only reacts and therefore goes through the motions of life. Pennyfeather always seems to have a supporting role in his own life, and all the events that affects him take places much without his involvement.Waugh's talent resides, among other places, in his ability to make ordinary situations become funny with his clever approach. For most of the time we don't laugh out loud, just smile, but when the laughs come they are unstoppable. With this device, the writer is making an acid critic of his society. Many contemporary writers who are desperate to make important and strong comments about our contemporary world should read Waugh and learn something from the master."},{"Title":"Decline and Fall","review":"Waugh is currently my favorite writer -- it's a joy to give yourself over to his world. I tell all of my smart friends to read him; you should probably start with Scoop, then Brideshead, then read them in chronological order. (Oh, and if you want to be extra clever, the \\"E\\" in \\"Evelyn\\" is pronounced like \\"evening\\" not like \\"ever.\\""},{"Title":"Decline and Fall","review":"More deadpan than hilarious, \\"Decline and Fall\\" is the story of Paul Pennyfeather, who seems not only to attract misfortune but to embrace it as his due. While depicting Pennyfeather's downward trajectory, Waugh skewers the pretensions and mocks the hypocrisy of every class of British society. Although I trust Waugh did not mean for the reader to sympathize with Pennyfeather, who is truly an apathetic oaf, I (ironically) found him surprisingly likable.Blameless throughout, Pennyweather resignedly and almost eagerly accepts punishment for crimes committed by others. (In prison, he positively enjoys solitary confinement for its regimen and its lack of stress.) Some of Waugh's commentary is a bit pedestrian, especially to modern readers, but he occasionally and fearlessly tackles weighty and \\"scandalous\\" themes: the apostasy of the clergy (\\"modern churchmen who drew their pay without the necessity of the commitment to any religious belief\\"), the excesses of the prison reform movement (\\"So far as possible, I like the prisoners to carry on with their avocations in civilized life. What's this man's profession, officer?\\" \\"White Slave traffic, sir.\\"), and societal attitudes towards an aristocratic lady who takes a black American lover (and her own patronizing posture). This last subplot, it must be said, makes uncomfortable reading, because the black character barely rises above stereotype, because Waugh unflinchingly uses racial epithet, and because ultimately the reader is not quite sure where Waugh is coming from.Much of Waugh's satire is dated, but (like Candide) Paul Pennyweather is a virtuous nobody whose misadventures transcend time. The edition from Everyman Library also includes an astute introduction from the critic Frank Kermode, who provides useful background for the book instead of assuming you've already read it."},{"Title":"Decline and Fall","review":"Poor Paul Pennyfeather! As the \\"hero\\" of Evelyn Waugh's first novel he is barely worth a cent and light as pillow stuffing. This flimsiness of character may cause concern unto lack of concern in the reader who wishes to strongly identify with the protagonist, but halfway through the book, Waugh's narrator assures us that Pennyfeather's hollowness is intentional:\\"In fact, the whole of this book is really an account of the mysterious disappearance of Paul Pennyfeather, so that readers must not complain if the shadow which took his name does not amply fill the important part of hero for which he was originally cast.\\"Pennyfeather is someone who is acted upon more than he acts--perhaps it is better to say he is more sinned against than sinning--his story begins when he is attacked in an Oxford quad by a group of his snobbish bully classmates. They strip him naked from the waist down and before he knows it the university has expelled him for indecent behavior. He then loses his allowance and ends up teaching in a disreputable prep school in Wales where adventures continue to be inflicted upon him.Waugh never allows Pennyfeather to defend himself, his satirical point being that an English gentleman wouldn't stoop to blame those who had wronged him, even if it means he goes to jail. After all, his irrepressible fellow teacher Grimes tells Paul, no matter how bad things get, there is \\"a blessed equity in the English social system that insures the public school man [public schools in England are actually private] against starvation.\\" It's that social system that the young Waugh, twenty-five when this book was published, enjoys puffing up just to tear it down. Waugh maintains a light narrative touch though his subject matter is often serious and occasionally outrageous. He structures the book well and has a sharp appreciation for the absurdities of the English upper classes in the 1920s that is not inapplicable to many other time periods and cultures.DECLINE AND FALL did not make me laugh as much as I thought it might. There are funnier English campus comedies out there, notably Kingsley Amis's LUCKY JIM and the first part of Waugh's own BRIDESHEAD REVISITED. Waugh was one of the twentieth century's great stylists, however, and I look forward to reading his second book, VILE BODIES."},{"Title":"Decline and Fall","review":"On one level, \\"Decline and Fall\\" is a wild farce of English manners complete with odd characters, dry humor, and impossible situations. In Waugh's humor, you can see the foundation for many British comics to come. (As an example, the &quot;Sports&quot; chapter alone could easily be transformed into a Monty Python skit.) Within his breezy and compact prose, Waugh delivers consistent laughs -- which makes the novel an enjoyable read.But underneath the surface, Waugh is a wicked and sharp satirist who takes on many of the pillars of British culture c.1920 including the church, the schools, class structure, and the prisons. He occasionally uses ghastly imagery to make his point. But the tone never falters, and the reader may choose not to give second thought to all the pillorying going on. (As an aside, \\"Decline and Fall\\" would make an excellent selection for a student required to read \\"satire\\". It is much more accessible than, say, Candide.)"},{"Title":"Sound for Digital Video","review":"Target audience: Anyone involved in audio for video, from the rank amateur to theexperienced professional.As a video shooter, you are most concerned with your picture. But as we move from SD toHD, the quality of your soundtracks should follow suit. Video has never been more capableof delivering high quality sound and picture, yet today's soundtracks are getting worseinstead of better. Why? Partly because DV equipment has made video accessible to morepeople at lower cost. While there's nothing wrong with low cost gear, unless you really knowhow to handle your audio with the equipment you have, you'll end up with some truly awfulsound. But even expensive top of the line Pro gear can record bad audio, and does so often,and with great precision! So what can you do to ensure the best quality sound for yourvideo?Enter \\"Sound for Digital Video\\" by Tomlinson Holman. Simply put, every question aboutsound for DV, from microphones through recording, to editing and release audio formats iscovered. Yet, surprisingly, the principles are highly approachable by even the most non-technical reader. In fact, Mr. Holman has adopted a unique \\"Director's Cut\\" section withinchapters, intended to serve those, like Directors, who have limited time but need to digestthe key points quickly and with complete lucidity. The book is, in fact, quite easy toassimilate by someone who picks it up, but is in the middle of a production! Mr. Holmandirects those readers to what chapter to read FIRST, to glean the critical essentials, as well ashow to use the \\"Director's Cut\\" sections.But don't think it's only for the beginner or the time-limited. There is enough detail andscientific information contained that even a seasoned pro will find it an essential referencework. There is enough contained in each chapter to merit several readings, even by thosewith careers in audio. The beauty of the book is that it can serve such a wide audience withuseful information, without alienating the extremes.For those with more time, or more need to create a highly polished and effective soundtrack,the book delves into the real nuts and bolts of audio as it applies to digital video. Forexample, if you had to record dialog from a shout to a whisper, what do you need to know toaccomplish it? What microphone would be best (the answer might surprise you!), should youplug the mic into your camera directly, or use a mixer? What can you do in post productionto make your dynamic range sound larger than it is? Would using a compressor help you orhurt you, and when should it be used or avoided?The basics are completely explored: What type of mic should you use for a given type ofrecording circumstance? How can you use both channels of your camera to best advantage?Avoiding overload is covered more thoroughly than I've ever seen it before, and yet in ahighly understandable way.In today's competitive market, everyone needs some kind of \\"edge\\". After reading only aportion of this book (for example, on avoiding overload) you become equipped to producesoundtracks that can sound better than many very high profile producers. For example, werecently heard a track on a PBS TV show that, if the recordist had understood \\"avoidingoverload\\" in this book, the track would have contained clean and understandable dialog. Asit was, it was so overloaded as to be barely intelligible. So simply reading this book can giveyou the understanding to record better audio than National Geographic! How's that forReturn on Investment?Then there's the included CD. It's a collection of demo and illustration tracks to be used asexamples for material in the book, but is also a collection of audio tools that can be used forcalibration and testing. The demo material illustrates sonic characteristics not easilydescribed in words, like good and bad bump edits, and how to solve editing problems.There a group of Sound Process Demo tracks that demonstrate filers, limiting andcompression and numerous other audio processes. The demo tracks have descriptivenarration. There's also a standard leader track (30 seconds of tone plus \\"2-pop\\") that youcan use on the head of your project.

She had been a journalist with the PALM BEACH POST newspaper. Her poems are insightful and mature, employing a gift from the muses; her essays (many about dealing the trials she had to face) are inspirational without being sentimental. Most interesting to me are her book reviews. Oddly enough they reveal much about her character, while providing readers with a vehicle to access a wide variety of reading material.This is a beautifully designed book, with a photo of Lisa on the cover. That same photograph sits on my own writing desk, a gift from Lisa following a visit to her home in Jupiter, Florida in 1999. Years ago, I had the honor of teaching Lisa McDonough when she was in the eighth grade, in Hawaii. Later, she helped to edit two of my own books, published by Susquehanna and Syracuse University presses. What enormous pleasure it gave me to watch my little student, now a college honors graduate, take red pen to her teacher's work. She had learned well and had become an expert teacher herself.Lisa's brief time with us is a message that life--even with the weight of trials and tribulations--can be possible, useful, and hopeful.

I was told that the possibility of an update is NOT likely. So a lot of stuff is missing. However, one can learn from this book. For ex. Several smaller pieces which were once LE (limited editions) were being re-made as recently as 2011, and not as LE's. THAT was a real revelation. Several gorgeous larger pieces were made more recently in places like Portugal, and they are not in the book that way. Several larger pieces, more recently were stamped, pressed, and not made totally off-hand, although they apparently were hand-finished.Also, the prices in the book are soooo much lower that what Steuben was selling the stuff for during their MAJOR end-of-life sale. It was a shocker. And though Steuben kept lowering the prices, they were still so much more than what the book had them for.And, the organization of this book is odd. There are dedicated sections to certain types of items, but the definitions are not very clear as to what these distinctions are!? a bit hard to figure out unless you spend time going through carefully. It took me quite a while to figure out the re-issue of the LE's for example!Lovely, timeless photos of gorgeous glass make it a special book.

Men's erotica (or in most cases, men's porn in book form) often center on threesomes, teenage girls losing their innocence, voyeurism, or stories about harmless, shy women who morph into wanton sexpots. Chaz Thompson is guilty of writing stories with the aforementioned subjects in Candy Concussion -- only that his stories are actually very good. Candy Concussion is a lovely collection of erotic short stories and poems that satisfies the reader from cover to cover (so to speak). Interestingly enough, my favorites are the ones centered on the clich&eacute; subjects above. I enjoyed \\"Wendy,\\" \\"The Lollipop,\\" \\"The Librarian,\\" \\" 'Twas the Night Before Christmas,\\" \\"Mr. Frankenstein,\\" and \\"The First Time.\\" Most of the stories have interesting narratives that come from a voyeur of sorts, so they all have some form of fantasy about women (and girls) told by a man's point of view. That is not a bad thing though. As said earlier, I prefer to read erotica written by women for women, but Candy Concussion is a great treat. I look forward to reading more books by this author."},{"Title":"Discrete Mathematics","review":"'Discrete mathematics is the study of those things left over after you take away limits, convergence, differentiation, and other fun stuff' is the way many texts begin.

The Lewis Carroll is not an artifact but the form on which the text is built. So if you are in the business of tricking undergraduates into an unnderstanding of mathematical principles before they realize it, this is your guide."},{"Title":"London 1945: Life in the Debris of War","review":"Wow, I can't say enough good things about this book !

I have only been to London a few times so it was a little difficultto understand the narratives of events that happened in various parts of the city; nevertheless, it was a fascinating look at conditions that Londoners were living underSome did seem to bear more of the burden than others. This is an exceptionally well done book and a very comprehensive social history of the period.

About British rationing--rationing of food, clothing, gas/tires had started as a wartime measure in all the belligerent countries to enable an equitable distribution of resources. As for why it continued in Britain for so long after the war, one could ask Atlee to explain his austerity plan, but a simple answer is the British economy was in government-controlled disarray until the country started getting Marshall Plan money and the British government slowly began to realize that it was in its interest to allow the Europe it had so recently destroyed to rebuild itself--for trade. The privations of the citizenry were of little interest even to a Labour government. The British people did put up with a great deal, but there wasn't a lot one could do about it, and if it makes those who lived through it assign all blame to other governments and none to their own, so be it.There wasn't much bombing in Britain after the 1940 Blitz until the short-lived pilotless V-1/V-2 rockets appeared in 1944, and in perspective, had very little effect, and counter-measures, such as simply shooting them down, were quickly effected. As I recall, most were aimed at Brussels.As for sending food to Germany in 1945, I am curious about this blatant inaccuracy. The British government did many things post-war, such as illegally detaining POWs for at-home reconstruction and farm work for years, grabbing any and all German remaining coal supplies, industrial equipment, funds and property, and Churchill had initialed the gruesome U. S. Morgenthau Plan at Potsdam, but one thing Britain most certainly did not do was send food, and in short, hundreds of thousands more people died in the rubble of bombed-out Germany after the war.People in Germany were getting by on 1000 or 900 calories a day, without housing, fuel or medicines as well, and in the British zone during the first winter after the war, it dropped to 400 per day - the amount allocated at the Belsen concentration camp had been 1400 calories.Waller's book is a bit more than a paean to British pluckiness, and is an interesting read. The 'food for Germany' is untrue, but then newspapers print all sorts of propagandistic untruths; but if someone can cite any official source concerning British food aid to Germany in 1945, I'd appreciate an opportunity to examine it. And am looking forward to Waller writing something like Frankfurt 1945."},{"Title":"London 1945: Life in the Debris of War","review":"Although Maureen Waller has produced a good piece of researh it was clearly written for the British, if not London, reader. The information and terminology is very specific to that great city. If you are not completely comfortable with the geography and customs of London, don't read it."},{"Title":"London 1945: Life in the Debris of War","review":"London at many times during its history has been the most desirable place to be. 1945 was not one of those times as a war weary population began the year by V2 attacks and then at the end faced 9 more years of rationing, queing and essentially living life down at heels. The author contends that it took 50 years to realize some of the dreams of the post war planners, I would add that it probably took the same amount of time to overcome some of the after effects of the war.Maureen Waller is very able to the task of setting the scene, providing what amounts to a comprehensive depiction of the British capital in the last days of the war. She does not indulge in the sort of glory mongering, but shows just how miserable life could be for some and how they chose to go on despite these difficulties.Waller's approach is thorough. If you wanted to know how one was reimbursed following V2 bombing, how one bough sugar, or the practices of wartime criminals, this is the book for youThe Britain of the period amounts to a vastly different world in which all activity is governed by the state and to a degree that seems somewhat claustophobic by today's standards.This is a remarkable book, both readable and comprehensive. Waller is to be commended for her scholarship and attention to detail."},{"Title":"London 1945: Life in the Debris of War","review":"This well-written book covers life in London at the end of the war in immense detail. The ten chapters deal with (1) V-1/V-2 bombings, (2) censorship and propaganda, (3) housing, (4) rationing, (5) clothing, (6) crime, (7) V-E Day, (8) Churchill's defeat in the 1945 election, (9) heart-rending stories of the evacuation of children, and (10) demobilization and the transition to a peacetime society (my labels, not the book's).First person narratives are intertwined with historical fact to create a book that conveys the full flavor of living in that era. The author especially emphasizes the bureaucratic side of wartime London. For example, when a house was bombed, a complex set of procedures came into play to assess whether the house could be repaired, to account for the inhabitants and rescue them, to guard property against looting, to determine whether payments were warranted under insurance policies, to find replacement housing, to replace lost ration tickets, and lastly to serve snacks to the homeless victims. Everything was thought out, and everything was done in a systematic manner. Of course, crime and abuses of the system were commonplace as well.Even for those who are fairly knowledgeable about WWII history, it is amazing what Londoners suffered through. Homemakers had to be masters of bureaucracy to be on top of weekly changes to the ration system, as well as queuing for groceries and scrounging for clothes and household goods. The fear of being in the next bomb blast didn't disappear until the war ended. London housing was nothing to brag about even before the war, and during the war people crowded together in incredibly cramped conditions, often living in bombed-out ruins. Children were evacuated to the countryside for their own safety, but at the end of the war some children did not want to return to their real parents, and in many instances the parents didn't want their kids back. And when the war ended, wartime conditions continued. For instance, rationing continued after the war so that food could be provided to Germany. It took more than a decade after the war for London to truly recover. All in all, Waller has written a superb book that brings these events alive for the reader."},{"Title":"London 1945: Life in the Debris of War","review":"The publication of this book is timely. It gives an insight into what enormous civilian sacrifices war can require and what sparks the inspiration to persevere and to continue persevering through a long unremitting siege. It fosters a fesh awarenessof what duty, service, and charity can accomplish. Not all the players in this drama are saints, but abundant misdeeds are always upstaged by a fundamental decency as the citizens of London, somehow \\"out of the nettle danger\\" manage to \\"pluck the flower of safety.\\" The reader wonders what will be the venue of the next ordeal of similar size."},{"Title":"London 1945: Life in the Debris of War","review":"Maureen Waller gives a superb sense of what it was like for ordinary folks to live in London in the waining months of the war and just after, a time of profound change to the British lifestyle. She has combed original sources for the personal stories and telling details that bring the grand story of the War to life on an intimate scale. She honestly seems to have read every newspaper and government report issued for the entire period.Two examples will suffice: women's undergarments were almost impossible to obtain - the materials for corset stays had more worthy uses in the military - so women made undergarments out of blackout cloth, which wasn't rationed. Similarly, food in restaurants did not require the use of ration coupons, so Britons of the wealthier sort at least got in the habit of eating out for the first time - a habit which surely transformed British eating habits after the war as well.The sadder, tragic side of the war is not overlooked - Waller starts the book with a chapter on late-war bombings and their effect on the Londoners left behind in the city.The book is organized topically - a chapter on housing, one on food, one on kids, one on crime, one on politics, etc. The This topical method means the narrative thread is a bit lost (every chapter seems to start at January and wend its way to December over again). However, the accumulation of interesting stories is fascinating and a novel addition to the list of anyone interested in London, in the War, or both.Waller has written a similar book on 17th-century London which does not seem to be available in the U.S. but can be obtained on the UK website for those who enjoy this book as much as I did."},{"Title":"London 1945: Life in the Debris of War","review":"Fascinating book. So often we read about soldiers' stories, idealized lustful romances flourishing in a war-torn city, or grandious accounts of military might. Not here.This book tells you what the average citizen had to endure during WWII. Having been born in the 1970s, the concept of citizens sacrificing their material goods for their country and cooperating with and whole-heartedly believing in their government is a foreign concept to me. I cannot imagine rationing food, stealing to survive, having a 1-inch bar of soap to last for a month, or living in a subway tunnel, but the people of London did so for years. Reading this book has helped me put my priveledged, American life into perspective."},{"Title":"London 1945: Life in the Debris of War","review":"I read this book as a reference source for an historical fiction book I am writing, and found the information within it to be invaluable. The author must have spent hundreds and hundreds of hours doing research --- combing through photo archives, interviewing WWII survivors, visiting the Imperial War Museum, and who knows what else! The result is a book that is engaging, easy to understand, never dry or boring, and chock full of incredible information.The author has managed to put a personal face on the effects of war on civilians -- from food and clothing rationing, to air raids and shelters, loss of homes and lives, and even the lengths to which women went to look good (shoe polish for mascara, cooking browning for painted on stockings, and lard for makeup remover.The anecdotes, quotes, and photos really bring the time period to life! This is a wonderful book and it really shows the triumph of the human will, especially women's will, over adversity."},{"Title":"London 1945: Life in the Debris of War","review":"OK, so you've been sufficiently beguiled by David Kynaston's marvelous \`Austerity Britain' and \`Family Britain' that you've decided to write a book yourself, say about that culminating year of the British World War II experience, 1945. You'll concentrate on life in London as the war winds down with the long-awaited Allied victory in Europe and then the surprisingly abrupt Japanese surrender and especially on the poignant and sorrowful realization of the populace that the end of those struggles did not at all mean the end of their sacrifices and deprivations. You'll describe in wonderful detail, with incisively selected first-person recollections and compelling narrative, every aspect of wartime life, from the effect on the populace of the V-1's and V-2's to the shortage of women's undergarments to the endless struggles with food rations to rationing's inevitable spawning of a black market to the sexual interaction of women without their men but with Allied substitutes to the reasons for the facially astonishing replacement of Hero Churchill with Bureaucrat Attlee. Sounds like a wonderful, and wonderfully rewarding, project, doesn't it? Too late. The definitive social history of that year in that city has already been written, and this is it.While Professor Kynaston covers much of the same ground in \`Austerity Britain,' the temporal breadth of that work obviously precluded the kind of detailed analysis Ms. Waller is able to bring to bear for this relatively short period in the capitol city. And she doesn't miss any aspect of life in describing the people's anxiety and the strange but understandable lassitude as the war ground to a resolution. Particularly striking to me is her portrayal of the attitudes of the civilian population to servicemen coming home from the war; rather than being greeted as returning \`heroes,' they were as often treated as interlopers by a population which felt it had made at least as many sacrifices for the \`cause.' Indeed, all of the elements which one would expect to bring to the British people an unprecedented sense of cohesion and resolve instead combined to produce an expectation-less emotional and economical malaise exemplified, if not created and abetted, by the doggedly redistributive but almost universally desired \`welfare state.'Ms. Waller says it best: \`The wartime community spirit was replaced by a selfish Me First mentality, and general lowering of the moral climate. The new Labour Government projected its forthcoming plans for the welfare state not as a vision for living for which the country would need to work hard, but, naively, as the first great chance to get something for nothing. It was an attitude that seeped into the very fabric of life. Fiddling expenses and ripping people off were typical examples of the new, post-war British disease.' Further reading on this subject is available online in the British dailies.In sum, a terrific read which not only provides an unrivalled history of the matters addressed but an historical framework for much that has happened since. Sorry, you'll have to find another subject: this one is done and done."},{"Title":"London 1945: Life in the Debris of War","review":"It must be serendipity when a very talented author chooses a fascinating subject and writes, in my opinion, the definitive book on the subject. That is what has happened here. Author Maureen Waller combines first-person accounts, statistics, and narrative to tell the story of Londoners during the last months of war in 1945, and the first difficult days of peace that year. I can't begin to tell you how many times I shook my head in the coffee shop, reading about the courage, fortitude, and determination of the people of London, as they endured shortages, bombs and rockets, loss of their homes, and death for yet another year. The Government grew massively, in response to the needs of the people, entering into every phase of their lives. Just the detailed information on rationing was mind-boggling. So was the effort to save and recycle everything (especially compared to these days). For example, bus passengers were encourage to recycle their ticket stubs so the paper could be recycled! The author relates a huge number of fascinating bits of trivia. For example, pants cuffs were banned because they used too much cloth. And the most popular fruitcake recipe at Harrod's (recipes were newly popular since the servants of the wealthy had mostly gone to factory or other wartime jobs) had as its main ingredient---tea!! (The Government bought up the ENTIRE tea output of several Asian nations). Women's heels could only be 2\\", jars of homemade jam could not be sold legally (although one could 'give away the odd jar'), queuing (standing in line) originated during WWII, coal was carried home in prams (baby carriages), the list goes on. I didn't think it was possible for me to read any book that made me more of an Anglophile, but Ms. Waller accomplished that! If you love the English people, reading about WWII, just reading great history, this book is for you. If you've been to London, this book is also for you, since it names many places familiar to the average tourist.

Honest creative work breathes life to this anthology. I felt linked by the &quot;geography of individual pain&quot; (101, Rane Arroyo, &quot;The Europe of Their Scars&quot;). Learning to love is hard enough but as a man secretly loving another man, the task gets even harder, especially in a culture doused in a twisted definition of manhood. In latino families, words for pain are unspoken. Roger Schira's piece (83), &quot;News of Your Country&quot; captured the essence of solitude---where the unspoken beauty of tropical love between two men is ceaselessly replayed in dreams, where maps of our places of origin and birth hover in our memories. Aguilar's unpunctuated &quot;Nueva Flor de Canela (183)captures the raw anger and cold reality stemming from AIDS, of &quot;...queer lovers afraid of taking up a relationship that is bigger than each one anticipated, but the relationship is unavoidable...&quot;(190). The stories evoke a mosaic of my insignificant life, only this time, confronting my very self without flinching in self-hate is easier because it is their story not mine. Better yet, it is OUR story, not just mine. In short, this collection opens wounds, like bare stares from folks shocked to see that a man can kiss another man just as well as they can.

Published between 1819 and 1824, in sixteen cantos containing an average of 125 eight-line stanzas in each, Byron's work is essentially a vast novel in verse, a coming-of-age story, an erotic romp, and a fount of social commentary all in one. He reverses the normal characterization of Juan, turning the serial seducer into a pretty innocent who is himself seduced by woman after woman; he also changes the pronunciation, now rhyming with \\"true one.\\" It is easy to see why Stendhal wanted to quote him. Both books begin with easily-seduced heroes; both take them into many different walks of society; and both are punctuated by philosophical commentary from their respective authors. In Byron's case, though, the commentary is almost more the point than the plot; it is certainly entertaining -- he can be a very funny writer.Byron left the epic uncompleted at his death, but there is enough there already for several novels. Seduced at sixteen by a married woman, Juan is sent to Italy in the charge of a strict tutor. Surviving shipwreck (and a touch of cannibalism), he is washed up on a almost-deserted island, which becomes a second Eden in the arms of a girl of his own age, Haid&eacute;e. His further adventures see him enslaved in a Turkish harem, taking part in a bloody siege, serving in the court of Catherine the Great, then engaging in amorous and diplomatic adventures at the English court, to end on the bosom of the \\"full, voluptuous, but not o'ergrown bulk\\" of the Duchess of Fitz-Fulke.The implied rhyme here is one of the dominant characteristics of the poem, although it is seldom used so suggestively as to rhyme the Duchess' name with \\"bulk.\\" Byron writes in eight-line stanzas, the \\"ottava rima\\" of Ariosto, with the rhyme-scheme abababcc. That final couplet gives a kind of punch line to each stanza. So he ends a passage on blue-stocking women with:| But oh, ye lords of ladies intellectual,| Inform us truly, have they not hen-peck'd you all?Or Juan's distress on his exile from Spain:| No doubt he would have been much more pathetic| But the sea acted as a strong emetic.And as we have seen, Byron can also be quite naughty; here he is describing the interior of a harem, into which Juan has been smuggled disguised as a woman:| 'Twas on the whole a nobly furnish'd hall,| With all things ladies want, save one or two.| And even those were nearer than they knew.Every now and then, Byron resists the temptation towards comedy and writes passages of pathos with even a touch of the sublime:| Thus to their hopeless eyes the night was shown,| And grimly darkled o'er the faces pale,| And the dim desolate deep: twelve days had Fear| Been their familiar, and now Death was here.Some of the descriptions of the feasting of Juan and Haid&eacute;e on her father's island have echoes of Homer or Virgil, and his famous elegy on departed grandeur, \\"The Isles of Greece,\\" also comes from this section. I could personally have done with more seriousness and less comedy, and these moments were welcome when they came.And Byron's commentary is always amusing. Some contemporary references may require annotation, but his views on literature are still stimulating. He had little time for the \\"glassy brooks and leafy nooks\\" of the Lake Poets, for example:| There poets find materials for their books,| And every now and then we read them through,| So that their plan and prosody are eligible,| Unless, like Wordsworth, they prove unintelligible.Pointing out that \\"All tragedies are finish'd by a death; all comedies are ended by a marriage,\\" he asks:| Think you, if Laura had been Petrarch's wife,| He would have written sonnets all his life?For the most part, Byron's philosophy is the comfortable one of taking life as it comes:| Well -- well, the world must turn upon its axis,| And all mankind turn with it, heads or tails,| And live and die, make love and pay our taxes,| And as the veering wind shifts, shift our sails.But towards the end of the epic, he reaches towards a deeper explanation of the Romantic search for wider and wilder experiences:| The new world would be nothing to the old| If some Columbus of the moral seas| Would show mankind their souls' antipodes.The soul's antipodes: those are destinations worth punching on one's ticket!"},{"Title":"Don Juan","review":"Don Juan is recognized as Lord Byron's masterpiece and English's greatest mock epic poem but is also one of the greatest epic poems period. It has the strengths of prior Byron masterworks like Childe Harold's Pilgrimage plus a wealth of additional biting satire and other humor, fantastic poetic dexterity, and sheer imaginative abundance. Though a favorite of many poetry buffs, it is also known for appealing to those who do not normally like poetry. It is an immortal work that continues to sparkle and invigorate nearly as much as ever for those alive to its magic.The first thing one notices is its sheer length; at nearly two thousand stanzas and sixteen thousand lines, it is one of English's longest poems and its longest satirical work. That it is often printed as a standalone book - and a thick one at that - says much. Yet, like prior Byron pieces, it is thoroughly readable. Though such a thing is now almost impossible to even conceive, poetry was more popular than prose in the early nineteenth century, and Don was a stunning bestseller; people read it the way they now read Stephen King. It is easy to see why. Don practically leaps off the page; in distinct contrast to Wordsworth and other poets then popular, it can be read at near-pulp speed. This is partly due to Byron's effortless mastery of meter and other poetic facets; his ottava rima stanzas are immaculately conceived, the strict rhythm drawing us in and keeping us hooked. The audacious rhymes are also important. Byron had long had a reputation as a fearless rhymer but truly outdid himself here; time and time again, Don has the most incredible rhymes conceivable, especially in stanza-closing couplets, which are often milked for brilliant comic effect. This is so well-known that such rhymes are often called \\"Byronic.\\" Rhyme lovers want to keep reading just to see what he will chime next. All this makes a poem that not only begs to be read quickly but almost forces itself to be so; unlikely as it seems, it can be read very quickly. Readers will be astonished at how rapidly they tear through and will actually end up wanting more. If anything, it seems too short. It is indeed incomplete and even breaks off at something of a cliffhanger, though the sixteenth canto - the last finished - is complete. Byron had no end in sight and indeed wrote without a plan; he began a seventeenth canto shortly before his death and perhaps would have continued ad infinitum. That he was unable is a true shame, but there is no arguing with what is here.Content is in fact even more important than form, which is unsurprising in that the canvas is almost larger than life. Summarizing Don is not only superfluous but virtually impossible; it takes on practically every genre and contains almost every imaginable thought and feeling. This vast panorama contains everything from a war epic to several monumental love stories to various court dramas and seemingly everything between them. The poem can be appreciated on a very simple level as a picaresque adventure of the kind Byron had long specialized in but never taken anywhere near as far - literally or otherwise. Don travels through much of the world, seeing many landmarks and people and falling in and out of love many times. He is everything from a slave to a court favorite, an older woman's lover to a man disguised as a girl, a war hero to a society light. His adventures are as entertaining as any comparable novel's. Initial readers were enthralled by the virtual grand tour; today's can appreciate the fascinating historical peek.Don himself is one of the most intriguing facets. He is as thoroughly Byronic as Harold and the many subsequent Romantic heroes but very different and at least as fascinating. Even younger - indeed but a teen at the start -, he shares their good looks and lust for adventure and sex but lacks their intellect and melancholy. He starts out very nave and quite ignorant, full of potential but with little or no idea how to use it - in fact lacking a plan of any kind. We see him grow to a certain extent over the course of many escapades, making the poem a sort of bildungsroman on top of everything else. In many important ways, though, he remains unchanged; despite all he has been through - including much that went against conventional morality -, his fundamental youthful innocence is still there. His view of life and humanity changes little, and he is to a large degree still an overgrown boy at the end despite having had enough action - in both senses - to shame Casanova himself. This is of course a joke, especially in that, unlike prior Don Juan incarnations, he is consistently seduced rather than being a seducer. Like prior Byron protagonists, he to a great extent reflects how Byron saw himself. This fascinated initial readers, perpetuating an image of Byron that still subsists. Few people are as anecdotable, and the many still interested in him will find much to entice them. Byron initially chafed against such readings but came to accept them as inevitable, even reveling in them to a degree. When Byron realized the poem's popularity and saw that the image would not disappear, he began overtly using Don to advance his thoughts and ideas, most of which were quite radical, even more clearly than in prior works.There are many other interesting characters, most of them colorful and quite a few of them unforgettable. Don's numerous loves have great verve and are memorable for various reasons, while his friends and enemies are at least as compelling. The most interesting other character, though, is the narrator, who often steals the proverbial show. Indeed, he often takes over, going on long digressions that are sometimes about Juan or tangentially relevant but mostly about scarcely related topics. He may go off for several stanzas about a story element that reminds him of something, which may remind him of something else; at many points he seems to forget he is supposed to be telling a story. Much of the comedy comes from this, and it is a large part of the reason the work is so hard to summarize. The narrator says virtually nothing about himself directly, but a distinct personality shines through inadvertently - one of the most hilarious and otherwise entertaining to ever tell a tale. A sort of idealized unidealized figure, he is partly an exaggerated side of Byron's own personality as well as other poets' and narrators'. Like many other parts of Don, this has a large parodical element lending itself well to satire, but many will be at least as absorbed by his Byron affinity, however hyperbolic.Alluring as such crossovers are, they have unfortunately long overshadowed the poem's many conventional strengths. Few artists have suffered more from biographical criticism; it is all too easy to forget that Byron was a great poet on all fronts. Technical dexterity aside, Don is full of vibrant imagery; many descriptions and metaphors are superlative, even unforgettable. The lyricism often reaches sublime heights, and there is also much to provoke thought; Don challenged conventional morality and other accepted ideas as few popular works have and continues to be a touchstone. The poem is also very quotable and indeed often quoted. Perhaps above all, Byron's incredible diversity reached its peak here. Don constantly switches from ridiculous to sublime, often in close proximity; the tragedy is as grand as the comedy is hilarious, and there is a great deal of beauty and substantial material of various sorts in all the guises. Several of the love depictions are among the most vivid and memorable ever. The epic battle is so well-done that it is among the best of its kind - great enough to make Don a masterpiece in itself though it is not even the main part. It manages to convey both war's unparalleled dark side and its heroism; unlike most war stories, it is stirringly immediate and historically astute, truly seeming to bring a relatively obscure battle to life. Some of the more picaresque elements are just as good in their way, immensely entertaining and variously provocative.Satirical brilliance is probably Don's most lasting aspect. Satire had been a large part of Byron's work almost from the beginning and became more and more pronounced, climaxing here with incredible force. Nothing is safe from Don's mockery; it critiques many aspects of European society as well as Europeans themselves. Don is thus a comedy of manners in addition to everything else; nearly every cultural aspect is savagely critiqued. Byron pokes fun at many prominent practices and kicks just about every sacred cow. Not least interesting are the ubiquitous digs at rival poets and other enemies; Robert Southey is especially eviscerated - indeed from the very first line! Besides being supremely entertaining, this is of great historical interest; though avowedly anti-realist, Don ironically gives a very clear picture of Europe in nearly every sector, much of it unflattering and all the more revealing and interesting in being so.Simply put, this is essential for anyone who loves poetry, and even many who do not will be pleasantly surprised. It is that rare masterpiece with truly wide appeal; everyone from high-brow literary enthusiasts to the most casual readers can appreciate it - a truly notable accomplishment and a continuing testament to its multi-faceted vitality."},{"Title":"Don Juan","review":"The poem is as sexy as the life of its author, who died fighting for Greek national independence and lived with joie de vivre manifested both within his distinguished career as a poet, his sexual trysts, and his eccentricities, which included party trick mug made from a human skull. The book is a monumental achievement, a literary aphrodesiac, a genuine specimen of romance and whit. Byron's voice speaks clearly, beguilingly, insouciantly and with authority from beyond the grave in this literary classic."},{"Title":"Don Juan","review":"It is painfully evident that the reviewers have paid absolutely no attention! This is NOT Don Juan by Byron, it is Don Leon, a pseudo-Byronic pastiche probably written by Thomas Love Peacock, and dealing with a defence of homosexuality. Reviewers, please look before you leap! In any case, this (Don Leon, not Don Juan) is one of the finest poems ever written on a gay theme, and includes extensive notes."},{"Title":"Don Juan","review":"The poem attempts to encompass everything, as Byron tells us -- but everything literary, not everything in real life. War, stormy seas, tropical islands, British high-class society, queens and slaves -- all are presented as fictions, parodies, examples, not true portraits.

It was Rutledge of South Carolina that pushed for the clause condemning the slave trade to be dropped from the Declaration of Independence, John C. Calhoun of South Carolina who propagated the doctrine of nullification, and it was South Carolina that was the first state to secede from the Union and the place where the Civil War started when Confederate troops fired on Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor. So the story of South Carolina is the story of a state that often did not always want to be a state, which makes it rather unique.It is not without irony that in \\"A State of Change,\\" Chapter One of this look at \\"South Carolina\\" for the American the Beautiful, Second Series, that R. Conrad Stein focuses on Strom Thurmond, the late senior U.S. Senator from S.C. who was the longest-standing senator in history, as a symbol of that change (even more so today, when we know that Thurmond, who once ran for president as a segregationist, secretly fathered a child with an African-American woman). The history of South Carolina is detailed in the next three chapters, beginning with Chapter Two, \\"A Colony Carved from the Wilderness,\\" which begins with the \\"contact period\\" when the Cherokee first encountered Europeans and ends with South Carolina becoming the eighth state. Chapter Three, \\"A House Divided\\" focuses on the primarily on the Civil War but also recovers reconstruction, while Chapter Four, \\"Twentieth-Century South Carolina,\\" traces the change from a backward, mostly rural state, to a new economy following the Civil Rights revolution. Throughout this volume, Stein's emphasis is on reconstructing the state's image as the place that sparked the Civil War.Chapter Five explores South Carolina as \\"A Land of Contrasts,\\" including the topographical changes from the Atlantic coastal plain, to the lowcoutnry, to the upcountry. \\"Life around the State\\" is explored in Chapter Six, which focuses on each area. Chapter Seven, \\"Palmetto State Government,\\" covers the politics of South Carolina, which is where young readers get to find out about such state symbols as the state tree (the palmetto, of course) and the state hospitality beverage (tea, which it is the only stage to produce for business). \\"An Expanding Economy\\" is the subject of Chapter Eight, focusing on manufacturing, agriculture, and other industries. Chapter Nine, \\"Upcountry and Lowcountry Culture,\\" looks at population trends in the state along with education. Finally, Chapter Ten, \\"Arts, Sports, Fairs, and Fun,\\" looks at movies shot in the state (e.g., \\"The Abyss,\\" \\"Forrest Gump\\") and sports stars like Shoeless Joe Jackson and Althea Gibson.The back of the book includes a Timeline comparing U.S. and S.C. state history and several pages of Fast Facts with lots of key statistics. Like all of the volumes in this informative series, Stein's look at \\"South Carolina\\" has plenty of full-color photos, orignal maps, and a whole bunch of sidebars. These sidebars are where young readers get to find out about the buccaneer Anne Bonney, the \\"Swamp Fox,\\" Battery Wagner, Jesse Jackson, and the Hilton Head Vacationland. The recipe for this volume is for Shrimp Perlou, the main rice dish of South Carolina, and the most famous (you can substitute sausage, chicken, or any other meat, so do not feel compelled to go with shrimp)."},{"Title":"Trekking and Climbing in Nepal (Trekking & Climbing)","review":"I have purchased just about all of the trekking guides, including descriptions of trekking peaks, that are available for Nepal, but always felt that they lacked a little something.

It combines essential trekking information for major treks along with great descriptions of climbing routes all written compactfully in one easy to manage book. It is thorough, well-written and very complete. It not only describes the trek or climb, but also provides a good brief history, alternatives, good graphics and a great strip maps which provide altitude, time, distance charts which I find very helpful.

In between the treks, there are also information on Nepalese culture and traditions.However, if you think that all this is too much for a small, glossy book like this, then you're right. I find the info on some treks quite sketchy. You'll probably need additional references if you're going into a restricted area.

Since Inspector Witherspoon has a weak alibi for the time of the murder, he is taken off the case and his staff immediately jumps in to prove his innocence. Will they be able to prove that the Inspector did not commit the murder?This book is like the previous books in the series in that the strength of the books comes mainly from the characters. I enjoy the growing relationships between the members of Inspector Witherspoon's staff and like seeing how they will avoid having the Inspector figure out that they are helping him. This case is a bit different because of the fact that the staff needs the Inspector's help, and I enjoyed his reaction when he sees how much his staff can do for him.

Tree-Kangaroos, Possums, and Penis Gourds - on the Track of Unknown Mammals in Wildest New Guinea.","review":"If Tim Flannery isn't the luckiest biologist in the world, then perhaps he's the hardest working. He possesses a spirit of adventure that may exceed both. His twenty years of exploring the mysteries of New Guinea are superbly outlined and related in this engaging account. Although a mammalogist by profession, his interests range far beyond any academic discipline. We follow his efforts to meet and gain acceptance by the remote peoples of the New Guinea highlands. They are a diverse lot, and every new contact is fraught with uncertainty. He introduces us to the teasing pleasures of New Guinea pidgin, a language adopted by indigineous peoples to cross the nearly 1 000 languages that exist on the island.Throwim' Away Leg, New Guinean pidgin for a journey, is an appropriate title for this book. Flannery's 15 long-term expeditions took him over most of the island, meeting the people, tracking animals and assessing the changes in the ecology. It is difficult, in this jet travel age to comprehend the impact of \\"remote people,\\" but Flannery has done it. He's adept at sharing the wonder he felt in his travels. We feel his fears, his joys of discovery, his sadness at the incursion of industrial civilization in an unprepared land. Flannery's account is given with an astonishing detachment. He recognizes the needs of both the indigenous people and the invaders. Cannibalism, so abhorrent to \\"civilized\\" readers, is placed in its true framework as viewed by the New Guinean mountain peoples. He's aware of the population pressures on local resources among the tribes, not excusing, but imparting rare understanding of the reality of life in wilderness.The author's love of wildlife is made clear throughout the book. An encounter with three-metre-long python that tried desperately to throttle him is related with incredible compassion. One can only sympathize with the pilot and passengers who shared the cockpit of a small aircraft with it on its journey to Port Moresby. Flannery's real feelings, however, are for the varieties of tree kangaroos living on the island. He asserts the high point of his travels was the classification of a rare black and white species of this creature. High point, indeed! Threethousand metres up in the New Guinean highlands, local hunters brought him the chewed remains of two \\"Dingisios\\" - enough to identify and describe this rare animal.Flannery's enthusiasms and vivid desriptive powers make this book an unforgettable read. His descriptions of the impact of outsiders, from both East and West, portray a land under immense stress. Not only Western mining and lumber companies, who have seared the landscape with roads, mines and felling, but Indonesia's settlement programmes come under his penetrating gaze. He recognizes their needs, but urges better forms of accomodation are required. The biological story is conveyed well integrated with social, political and environmental issues. An all-encompassing study, this book will give the reader many fresh insights and topics for further reflection."},{"Title":"THROWIM WAY LEG. Tree-Kangaroos, Possums, and Penis Gourds - on the Track of Unknown Mammals in Wildest New Guinea.","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this wonderful book! In it, mammalogist Tim Flannery regales us with tales from his many years in New Guinea, searching for new species of mammals on the island, the second largest in the world. A difficult island to work in - highly mountainous; extremely few roads, most villages so isolated that they can only be reached by small planes flying to landing strips hacked out of the jungle; parts of it some of the rainiest spots on earth, some areas receiving 11 meters or more of rain a year; possessing many dangerous animals ranging from crocodiles to snakes to huge spiders; tropical diseases and parasites a real problem in many areas (including malaria and scrub typhus, from which Flannery almost died from when bit by an infected tick) &#65533; Flannery had his work cut out for them as he spent over two decades on the island, both in the eastern half, the independent nation of Papua New Guinea, and the western section, Irian Jaya, part of Indonesia.Flannery is a highly accomplished scientist, having discovered 16 new species of mammals in Melanesia, many of them in New Guinea. Many of these and others are described in the book, and make for fascinating reading. We meet the Black-tailed Giant-rat, the bite from its two centimeter long razor sharp incisors much feared by the inhabitants of the island. The Three-striped Dasyure, a vividly marked rat-sized marsupial predator, one of New Guinea's few mammals active during daylight hours. The Snow Mountains Robin, one of the rarest birds in the world, found in the high alpine regions of the Meren Glacier in Irian Jaya, one of the very few equatorial glaciers in the world. _Antechinus, a small carnivorous marsupial notable in that the male only lives for 11 months, existing only to breed. The diminutive, dingo-like New Guinea singing dog, which arrived in the islands some 2,000 years ago. The six o'clock cicada, a tremendously loud insect that received its name from its trill it emits roughly 6am and 6pm daily. The famous Birds of Paradise, breathtaking in their beauty, several species of which are extremely rare. He also describes the Long-fingered Triok, a black and white skunk smelling possum with the fourth finger of each hand a great elongated probe for finding insect larvae; you never know what he is going to find next lurking in the barely explored misty peaks and dripping jungles of the island.Three of the most remarkable animals are ones that Flannery discovered or in one case rediscovered. One is _Maokopia ronaldi_, an extinct marsupial herbivore that once dwelt in the high mountain forests. Panda-like in appearance, size, and probably habits, Flannery named this new genus and species from fossils he found in Irian Jaya. Bulmer's Fruit-bat, a bat though extinct for 12,000 years, the largest cave dwelling bat in the world, Flannery was elated to have found them alive in extremely rugged western Papua New Guinea. The one though that Flannery is the most proud of discovering was the Dingiso, a new species of tree-kangaroo he found in the alpine areas of Irian Jaya, a beautiful black and white animal, surprising tame, threatened but fortunately partially protected by native taboos against harming them.However, as remarkable as all of that is, one could argue that the real stars of this book are the people of New Guinea, particularly the indigenous Melanesian peoples that Flannery spends a great deal of time with and clearly loves. Much of his time researching in the field he was based out of the villages of such people as the Wopkaimin, the Telefol, and the Goilala where he became fast friends with many throughout the island, in both countries, viewing them not as savage barbarians, but as noble, often quite kind people, their older generation vast repositories of cultural and natural history lore. One of the most enjoyable aspects of the books were the many stories about life in those villages, some of the tales tragic, others heartwarming, and many hilarious.Particularly fascinating was what he wrote about the history of cannibalism on the island. Apparently it did exist in the not too distant past, actually in the living memory of some of the villagers he encountered. Though not an every day occurrence by any means, cannibalism was an important part of New Guinea life; indeed, one group Flannery spent some time with, the Miyanmin, were once avid raiders, and actually referred to the neighboring Atbalmin people as &#65533;bokis es bilong miplea,&#65533; which more or less translates into something like &#65533;our refrigerator.&#65533; Though cannibalism is now a thing of the past, its effects are still felt he writes, as villages once got some of their population from raids of other villages, the adults of that village were consumed and the children raised as their own; now, that is no longer a source of new people for villages and some are facing some depopulation as a result.Flannery sounds several cautionary notes in his book. Several species of New Guinea mammals and birds are in serious danger of extinction from over hunting. Though New Guinea is still a land largely without roads, more and more appear all the time, opening up virgin lands for hunters, loggers, and miners. Indeed in Irian Jaya the latter two are devastating ever larger sections of the island; the massive Freeport mine, which exports over ten million dollars worth of minerals daily, has destroyed large sections of forest with waste mine tailings.He also worries about the future of the people, particularly in Irian Jaya. He believes that in an attempt to make that land more like the rest of Indonesia it is causing not only environmental damage but also cultural damage. Indeed there are concerns over human rights abuses in Irian Jaya, of dissidents disappearing, of remote villagers forced to wear modern clothing and abandon their pig eating culture by distant Muslim politicians, who often find native culture abhorrent.Recommended."},{"Title":"THROWIM WAY LEG. Tree-Kangaroos, Possums, and Penis Gourds - on the Track of Unknown Mammals in Wildest New Guinea.","review":"This is a fascinating look at the mammals (most poignantly,humans) in the forests and caves of New Guinea. Flannery takes usalong on 15 years of searching for both living and fossil traces of everything from tree kangaroos to bats. But the compelling feature of the book is his contact with the isolated villagers, whose ways are as interesting--and imperilled--as the rarer wildlife that Flannery seeks. New Guinea is near the equator, but its highest peaks are in the 14,000 to 16,000 foot range. It is rugged. The island is filled with caves, dense life-filled forests, swamps, and a daunting array of diseases and pests. Peter Matthiessen took us there years ago in his Under the Mountain Wall. Some old ways prevail, but the gun, roads, mines, politics, and exposure to western ways are taking their toll on both man and wildlife. Flannery has a self-depricating manner that reminds of the Canadian naturalist-author Farley Mowat. What next? you think as you read from low-key adventure to low-key adventure. Along the way he teaches you too about those tree kangaroos, rats, bats, bandicoots, wallabies, etc."},{"Title":"THROWIM WAY LEG. Tree-Kangaroos, Possums, and Penis Gourds - on the Track of Unknown Mammals in Wildest New Guinea.","review":"As one who has traveled in New Guinea 8 times, I found this book suspenseful and fascinating. Flannery vividly portrays the magnificent landscapes he explored, and introduces us to wild creatures that are disappearing from the earth. And he captures well the tragic impact of an outside world greedy for the island's natural resources, especially in Irian Jaya.I have only two reservations. First, even recognizing that Flannery's mission was to collect rare mammals, I thought he conveyed too little of the richness and complexity of tribal life. The savage nature of the people was stressed, rather than their loyalties and kindnesses. Second, women were virtually invisible in the narrative."},{"Title":"THROWIM WAY LEG. Tree-Kangaroos, Possums, and Penis Gourds - on the Track of Unknown Mammals in Wildest New Guinea.","review":"Flannery is one of a kind. He is to New Guinea what Perry and Amundson are to the poles, a first-comer .... one of the first to explore and document the stone age peoples of the mysterious island wilderness in the last days of its age of innocence.Yes, there are cannibals, with bones in their noses and gourds worn on their penis, yet Flannery somehow manages to get the reader to empathize with these people, to understand their foibles and traditions, and to feel regret that their ancient ways are going, going, gone ... forever. Take the chapter where he goes in pursuit of the Bulmer's Fruit Fly Bat -- you suffer with him the agonies of failure and the desperations of the search, and the exhilaration of success. Or follow along with his learning experiences among the native tribes and come to actually understand the hows and whys of the way the led their lives, even to discovering there were (to the natives) valid reasons for their rare acts of cannibalism.Although he describes some of the most spectacular natural wonders of the world, the reader comes to know that Papua New Guinea will never rate very highly as a tourist destination, but you'll have to read this book to appreciate the reasons why.Think you couldn't possibly be interested in such things?

Otherwise this is an interesting book, which gives a rather stark picture of the conditions in PNG. It also raised interesting questions about the introduction of western values to a primitive culture, which on the one hand is in need of some civilising in terms of the cannibalism, the massacring of villages and the subjection of women, while on the other hand is need of preserving vis a vis religious and cultural beliefs. Did anyone else wonder if Father Michaelhod really was a pederast?"},{"Title":"THROWIM WAY LEG. Tree-Kangaroos, Possums, and Penis Gourds - on the Track of Unknown Mammals in Wildest New Guinea.","review":"Flannery is the Principal Research Scientist at the Australian Museum. This book recounts several of his expeditions in Papua New Guinea and Irian Jaya in the 80s and 90s.He's the opposite to Douglas Adams. In approaching some similar topics in his \`Last Chance to See' Adams was primarily a writer. Flannery is primarily a biologist - the writing came second. Thus there's not the wit, and the style is often understated. In some cases this is quite charming as he pretty casually relates some harrowing incidents (such as getting stuck alone in an underground crevice). In contrast his vocabulary can get a bit ostentatious: he'll use always use a word like \`ossuary', for example, rather than graveyard, and in one case he used a word I've forgotten now that from the context must mean something like overeating, but didn't even appear in my complete Macquarie dictionary. (Ah, another amazon reviewer had the same problem, although they were impressed by the obscure vocabulary, while I was unimpressed by same: 'farcarted' gets nothing from any online dictionaries - the only place it turns up in a google search is in these perplexed amazon reviews. Maybe it's an in-joke.)These are exotic places and creatures, and Flannery capably recalls some real adventures. Part of the strange appeal of this book is shaking your head at some of the near-insane deprivations and risks his biological obsession has entailed (hence the insightful description of another reviewer, \`bloody mad scientist'). Moreover half the fascination is anthropological. He generally does very well walking the line between eulogising and demonising the tribal Papuans. He ably conveys some of the dilemmas of contact between ancient and modern, such as the time when in all good faith he acceded to requests to sharpen all the knives in a village, but then was appalled to see several villagers accidentally cutting themselves deeply because they'd never had anything but blunt edges. He does tend towards the assumption that any loss of traditional culture is automatically bad, but honestly allows us to see some ugly things that challenge this assumption.Towards the end of the book, as much to his chagrin as ours, we're not able to merely enjoy the excitement of discovery of species because of the context of ugly mistreatment of Irian nationals by their Indonesian conquerors. I got the feel that none of us wanted this to be a \`political' book, particularly not a partisan one, but in telling his story it becomes unavoidable. Flannery again to his credit is very careful not to say \`all Indonesians', or \`all the mining company workers', but sadly his biological expeditions are somewhat overrun just at the end by encounters with some brutal racism, at times incidental, at others structural."},{"Title":"THROWIM WAY LEG.

Or rather, I should say the book found me. This is not a book I would ordinarily buy, but the reviews were quite compelling. After receiving it, I found my self immersed quickly into the book and not wanting to let go. I was transported into a world I thought I knew of from magazines and documentaries. However, I now realize I had much to learn. This book at times had me thoroughly disgusted and appauled, and at other times clutching my heart at the purity of a solitary moment. And reading through the eyes of this magnificent storyteller, I found it impossible to judge even the most bizarre of social practices because Dr. Flannery goes to such lengths to provide a fair and accurate story; I would wince, and then nod my head in educated understanding. Thank you, Tim Flannery, for the gifts you've given the world!"},{"Title":"THROWIM WAY LEG.

Its rare to find a scientist who can tell a great story.

Tim Flannery is a scientist with writing style that is simulatenously eloquent and explanatory. One learns about the amazing and newly discovered mammals of Papua New Guinea in the context of his amazing experiences. Readers learn of his unique interaction with the various tribes, stories that almost make cannibalism seem natural within the local environment.

This book transports you in to the jungles of New Guinea with an easy flowing prose. It changed my perspective and way of thinking about that part of the world.The meeting of an ancient culture that measures wealth in pigs with Muslim Indonesia is something you will appreciate after reading this book from the inside, although the author only touches on that.The strange animals that the author seeks out and encounters are fascinating. If you have particular interest in any of the subjects covered by this book, then it is a must-have.

The descriptors of the peoples, the landscapes, the cultures and most of all -- the animals were beyond anything you will see in a National Geographic Special. This is the kind of book that hooks you on an author. You have to also get this book \\"Astonishing Animals: Extraordinary Creatures and the Fantastic Worlds They Inhabit\\".

Tree-Kangaroos, Possums, and Penis Gourds - on the Track of Unknown Mammals in Wildest New Guinea.","review":"Throwim' Way Leg: Tree-Kangaroos, Possums, and Penis Gourds guides the reader to tops of misty mountains, beside a tropical glacier (for real!), over swinging vine bridges and through malaria infested swampland. If that isn't enough to excite you, there's always the stone age cultures, the hunt for unclassified (and unknown) species of mammals and fauna, fossils and many close calls. This is also the story of threatened cultures, an intrusive Irian Jayan government and greedy American mine owners. There's a little bit (or lot) for anyone who cares about how other people groups lead their daily lives, what they eat, how they play and what their surroundings look like.Tim Flannery paints New Guinea in colors that made me feel like I was there, trekking alongside him and his crew on their journeys through rugged, but beautiful terrain. I lived the first two years of my infant life there. This book captured the essence of New Guinea for me and I am grateful since I left too young to form my own memories. Flannery write his experiences in prose that read like a novel. It is not a difficult read in the least.The only knock I have on this book is that it ends the narrative in the mid-nineties. I'm sure a lot has changed since then, but maybe I wouldn't want to know what those changes are, especially in Irian Jaya where mining and logging was already ruining the environment."},{"Title":"THROWIM WAY LEG.

This edition is a complete urtext edition- no editorial suggestions, what so ever (so when it comes to Bach, it means no fingerings, no nothing. Only the notes themselves), and that can be quite refreshing. The book itself is made of good quality- good paper, good binding, and I also like the printing. And of course- the price. Such a low price for an Urtext edition, almost unbelievable (actually, I talked with a sheet music dealer, and he claims that for this price, it's impossible to conduct a real research for the edition. This might be true. But I don't care where does the editor finds his resources from, as long as Konemann keeps on publishing more and more new titles)."},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"I live in the Washington, DC area and remember all the details of the sniper case. I was pregnant at the time and terrified. I found this book to be choppy and repetitive. He says the same things over and over again - in the next sentence, paragaph, page, chapter, over and over again. He often writes in phrases instead of full sentences. It's the way he might speak, but it doesn't read well. There are a few grammatical errors and a mention of a &quot;Washington Wizards hockey game&quot; - it's a basketball team!There were no major secrets revealed about the investigation. Everything had made it out into the press. He doesn't even seem to reveal his thoughts as surprises unfolded, saying that it wasn't his place at times. To his credit, he does seem honest about his feelings for the most part. I just felt that he left out his unique perspective on the most interesting aspects of the investigation.The chapters alternate between his life and the investigation. It's effective. The race issue seems to come up in every part of his life, and I'm sure it is always a factor (I too am a minority) but for all of his accomplishments (which he's not shy about telling!) I would have liked for him to put the racial aspect in a more positive light, than with the bitterness alternating with ambivalence that I found through most of the book."},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"Self-serving and, above all else, boring. Moose provides precious little insight into crimes that terrorized a city and the nation. It is hard to imagine someone not being able to tell a compelling story about the shootings, but somehow he does. Moose is as adept an author as he was a public spokesperson during the crisis. Save your time reading \\"Three Weeks in October\\" and simply pat the former police chief on the back, though you'll have to wait for him to stop doing it himself - which is all Moose's 335 pages add up to."},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"As someone who was directly affected by the sniper shootings (I live in Hanover County, Virginia, where the Ashland shooting took place) I found this book pathetic and Chief Moose even more so. Moose fails to admit fault for just about anything and blames race for everything. Further, it is extremely obvious this book was rushed to print as there were glaring errors in it which a little research would have corrected. First, I had a good laugh when Moose discussed the white, good old boy, southern police here in the Richmond area and how they were prejudiced against a black northern police chief. The Richmond city police department is led by Chief Andre Parker, a black man who was hired from Illinois. In fact, the last 3 police chiefs in Richmond have been black and a white person has not held the position in about 20 years. Sheriff Stewart Cook of Hanover County was the voice of the combined law enforcement effort here in the area, but he worked very closely with Chief Parker as well as the other chiefs in our area to protect the citizenry.Also, Moose says Ashland is south of Richmond. Ashland is about 20 miles north of the city of Richmond.This book is like Moose's handling of the sniper incident. Full of mistakes, ineptitude and a rewriting of history. Moose bungled the investigation so badly that the police, ATF, and FBI in Virginia had no choice but to try and tackle the task on their own. Moose's abuse of the media to get his name and face on TV caused deaths rather than prevented them.The worst thing about the book is when anything negative happens to Moose, he constantly screams racism rather than accepting responsibility for his own shortcomings and moving on. Even the back of the book jacket starts off with how he was born a black boy in the segregated South. This from a man with a checkered past of his own on race relations.Chief Moose, get over it and move on. The best thing you did was leave your position so that competent leadership could hopefully prevail."},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"This book explains why it took so long to catch the sniper from the last paragraph on page 221 through page 223. Incompetence. The rest is a lot of whining by Moose. On page 226 he complains about how &quot;inconvenient&quot; it is to change out of uniform before going home although that is not required. Later he admits he was stopped for speeding and that his wife has been stopped multiple times! Great behavior for a chief of police. He is &quot;victimized&quot; by racial profiling. Hey so is every black person in this country. On page 288 he says Bush made a congratulatory phone call on the capture of the snipers. Moose whines that Bush should have made a personal visit. He left his job so he could write this book. Maybe that's a good thing. I must get the Horwitz book now to read the real story."},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"I remember those weeks in October very clearly: the news reports, the anxiety, the anticipation, the hopefulness that the perpetrators would be caught or taken down. The fact that Maryland has some of the most stringent gun control laws in the nation was ironic, as well.In this reader's opinion, Charles Moose did nothing but hurt the investigation. He initially ignored early eyewitness testimony and gave a 'look out' only for white males in a white delivery box van of varying descriptions. Thanks to this initial denial of evidence, Malvo and Muhammed slipped through checkpoints at least once, despite the suspicious cutouts in the trunk of their blue sedan.The cracking of case, despite Moose's claims, did not come at his hands, but at the hands of a courageous citizen (a truck driver) who had listened to the late-breaking media leak that the suspects were black males driving a blue, older-model sedan. A whopping two hours later, the shooters were caught.An Army vet, Steve Cribbin, was a witness to the first Beltway sniper shooting: \\"I told a cop I was in my car waiting to go to work [outside Papa John's Pizza in Aspen Hill, Md], just resting, and I heard a gunshot, and being I was in the military, I knew it was a rifle. It didn't sound like a backfire,\\" said Cribbin during an interview. \\"And I looked around and said, 'Man, where in the hell did that come from?' The next thing I know I see a car driving out, and it was, like, a dark blue Thunderbird or an old cop car, with a couple of black guys giving high-fives and driving away.\\"The detective that took his statement was Montgomery County Detective Chris Homrock. Finally, days later (and several killings later), the multi-agency sniper task force, headed by Moose, sent out a homicide detective to field-interrogate Cribbin about his prior statements. The detective, according to Cribbin, was suspicious of his testimony and tried to talk him out of his statements, asking, \\"How do you know it's black people?\\" Cribbin, while uncertain of the car make, was certain of the driver & passenger as it was still light out when he saw them.As later reported, Moose refused to give out physical descriptions of the suspects until very late in the investigation because he said he didn't want to \\"paint some group.\\" One Montgomery County PD detective said Moose was worried about patrol officers \\"stopping every black in Montgomery County. Of course, it was OK to stop every white in a white box truck.\\"Moose has a race-obsessed past, taking advantage of innocent situations and screeching \\"racism\\" or \\"discrimination\\" at the slightest question or inconvenience, then attempting to settle the proceeding suit for large sums of money. One known \\"successful\\" case was with the Marriott Corporation (for $200k). He fought furiously against the Montgomery County PD to get them to allow him to write and sell this book, despite longstanding ethics regulations preventing him from profiting from his job as police chief. In fact, because of the timing of the release (the start of the trial), the prosecution's case could have been jeopardized. Despite the Montgomery County ethics board's unanimous ruling against its release, Moose ignored them and released it anyway, and (he and his wife) then hurled reckless charges of racism at county employees.He says in his book that \\"We must all be social engineers\\" and admits to having \\"complicated\\" feelings about Muhammad and Malvo because they are black. His greed and racial-blinders may have cost some people their lives. Thankfully this book did not jeopardize the trial.Do not give this man any more money. ..."},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"Like most people in the Washington DC area, those three weeks in October were an amazing and difficult time for me. When I saw Chief Moose on television during the investigation I had the same initial reaction pretty much everyone else did. While he lacked the smooth slickness of a man accustomed to being in the limelight, he came across as a strong leader and a truly dedicated public servant. Boy, did this guy have me fooled, and would I eventually feel like a sucker for it.It's pretty clear now that inside this brave and dedicated exterior lies a man full of anger and personal demons. Right up to the very final minutes of the investigation, he either knowingly and deliberately misled the public as to the true nature of the assailants, or he was so blinded by his own personal prejudices that he simply could not face up to the evidence that was plainly in front of his face. In either case, such a man isn't fit to run Mayberry's police department, much less one of a large suburban county. Some cursory research into his past will show a long history of problems, caused in no small part by a giant racial chip on his shoulder. And in the end, his inability to abide by the rules set by his bosses led this dedicated public servant to dump his entire career in order to make a quick buck, which led to the book you're reading about here.Don't let this con-artist dupe you yet another time. If you absolutely must read it then check it out of the library, but don't reward this guy financially after what he did."},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"Mr. Moose provides a sad reflection on this terrible reign of terror. Possibly if he invested more time in the writing of the book, some meaningful passages and information may have been included within the book's covers. If only to question his blind response to those first witnesses who reported the dark sedan and it's passengers leaving the scene of the first shooting, or of the near universal disrespect of his fellow officers.The book is poorly developed and written as shown by its ranking of appr. 7500 on the Amazon list today. Mr. Moose might do well to examinehis inner self, rather than write of his imagined leadership."},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"Having lived in the area during the shootings...this book was terrible.This \\"Chief\\" did not \\"solve\\" anything. The suspects were stopped numerous times, but he was too busy focusing on suspects that perhaps looked different, or more what he wanted them to look like.He is extrememly self-serving, and honestly wasn't very articulate (as people often say) or organized while dealing with the media...he was hostile and not very likeable actually. Not sure what the big deal with this guy is."},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"Reading this book reminded me what it was like raising my hyperactive, hypersensitive nephew- he whined from the day he left the womb and hasn't stopped feeling sorry for himself since. Charles A. Moose's lukewarm regurgitation of the events through which all of us in the DC Metro region suffered, is not only a missed opportunity to redeem himself for his foibles during those tense three weeks, but in addition it serves to insult fellow law enforcement officers, the press, victim's families and the public at large. It doesn't take much research to realize that this is a person with a permanent chip on his shoulder and perhaps someone to be ignored at all costs. A better representation of what these three weeks entailed for people in that region of the country, will probably come from one of the several OTHER books about to be released on this subject. The quality of writing wasn't worthy of this Montgomery College student's time."},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"Former Montgomery County police chief Moose may have been the face of the investigation but certainly wasn't the brains. Quick to cash in on tragedy and ten deaths, he showed who he really is. I am a Montgomery County Police officer with over 20 years of proud service to my community. My brother and sister officers patrolled the streets during the dangerous days while Moose, a four year MCP officer, hid in front of the cameras assuring residents that they and their children were safe, ignoring credible police information about the Chevy Caprice. We seek no reward and are still here serving the community while Mr. Moose goes around the country peddling his dull, whiny news book.Let us not forget that it was Mr. Moose and his media savy boss who assured the community that their children were safe. That was a few days before the snipers shot a kid in Bowie. Some comfort. The value of the book is that it shows how anyone with an &quot;opportunity&quot; as Moose said, the media, blood, death, and tragedy can go from obscurity to fame without substance in the minds of those poor little who need to watch fewer soap operas and get a life."},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"I bought the book after a friend told me about it.

He didn't run the investigation, the FBI did. In fact, the FBI had to take it over because he was botching the case.

For shame, Moose."},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"The situation of October 2002 touches people at their core - which explains for polarity of the reviews. Sadly I feel many either read the book already prepared to vilify Chief Moose, or they didn't read it at all. Just in case you may think I was too geographically removed to feel the terror of those days, I was in the DC area for much of the siege.When I started reading the book I wasn't sure what to expect, inside details into the investigation - explaining people's concern it may jeopardize the trails, or just a fluff piece.I will agree that he isn't the best writer. But, he isn't a professional author and we should not have expected it.During and after the investigation Chief Moose was placed in an impossible situation. When reading, you could tell throughout the book that he wanted to set the record straight, as he saw it, if only to rebut the merciless press needing a new story or new angle every day. I don't blame him for wanting to do it. The saying in Hollywood may be at work here, \\"They build you up to tear you down.\\"Something I found really interesting was his continual discussion of his managerial approach - what happened in his life for him recognize and develop his techniques. It is an unexpected study in the development of a managerial style that obviously has served him well over the years. It is something that I wish more managers would read and implement into their own styles.I would recommend this book to people curious about whom the man was behind the microphone during those days in October. But I would also recommend this book to those interested in learning about the development of a successful administrator whose talents and strengths took him to the top of his profession."},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"I almost didn't check this out of the library due to the negative reviews on amazon.com. I found the book to be a great inside view of the dc sniper and into Charles Moose. I enjoyed the chapter by chapter switch from the case in and out of his life and arriving at Montgomery County. One irony is his occasional putting of people in bins. He discussed his interraction of a Hawian tour guide, who (obviously) coulnd't have believed that a Black could be a Chief of Police of Portland. He also bins a person when recounting a westerner who obviously couldn't have understood the marriage between a black and white. That aside, I occasionally pick up books that I consider rivitting, and this is one of them."},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"Several years after the serial sniper, I wanted to examine what had occurred to recall the terrible incident and understand a law enforcement perspective. Chief Moose walks through what happened while adding his first-hand experience and the details on his interactions with media and other law enforcement entities.It is rather noticeable that at every point possible, Chief Moose justifies decisions that received significant media scrutiny. On one hand, it's his choice since he's writing the book. However, it seems somewhat unfortunate that he has few or no regrets (or even lessons learned) from any mistakes.One part of his book was an unexpected addition - describing the challenges of an African American growing up and serving as a police officer and police chief in the United States. He recounts what I would call \\"less than equal\\" treatment even during his time as police chief. Clearly he has accomplished much in a society with some people who do not consistently judge people solely \\"by the content of their character\\" (to quote Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.).I think the book is useful for anyone in a law enforcement or counter-terrorism planning/leadership position. Chief Moose describes organizational challenges associated with crossing jurisdictional lines since he involved law enforcement from the federal government, District of Columbia and multiple counties in Maryland and Virginia.The pursuit of these two murderers was not easy. And, from the book, it's apparent that they presented police with the clues necessary to capture them. Nevertheless, there is solid planning and execution that could be replicated by other law enforcement leaders if such a crisis were to occur again."},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"Charles Moo$e disgusted me when he came out against Montgomery County for their repremand over his profiting from the office. This supposed \\"civil servant\\" used the office to attempt to make himself famous and rich, this book has proven that he fails in both endeavors. The quality of writing shows that Charles Moo$e not only rushed to churn out a book before the one year anniversary, neglecting his duties as Police Chief during that time, but he also seems to have the grammatical skills of a Montgomery County Middle Schooler. Perhaps this is the \\"homework\\" that they were sending that poor 13 year-old shot outside Benjamin Tasker while he was hospitalized for a month. I can only be glad that this book will tank in sales, preventing Mr Moo$e from profiting in his new position. As for me, I made sure to check it out of the Fairfax County Public Library, you aren't getting my dollar."},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"If you get your entire perception of police work from tv or the movies then this book is for you. If you believe that a police chief actually runs a criminal investigation then this is for you. If you think that the &quot;real police&quot;...the ones who work the street, talk to nuts on the phone, work 18 hour days watching suspects, hide in bushes on stakeouts, actually are the ones that solve cases then this is one is not for you."},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"For 3 weeks in October of 2002 two men terrorized an entire region. I remember malls being half empty, silent playgrounds and seeing people weaving and bobbing at the gas pump. It was a terrible time. Former Chief Charles Moose has written a book abou those days and it's infuriated a lot of people. For my part, I don't see why he couldn't write a book. A lot of people have made money from this case including reporters from USA Today. Also, according to Moose reporters from the Washington Post contacted him about joining with them to write a book of their own.As for the book itself, it's a difficult read. Moose is not an easy man or an especially likeable one. His treatment of his first wife and his admited hot temper didn't endear him to me at all but the story of how a kid from North Carolina ended up as the Chief of Montgomery County (one of the richest, proudest and self satisfied places in Metropolitan DC) is interesting.The sad story of his parents deaths, and his early days in Portland, Oregon (I'm certainly crossing Portland off my list of places to visit!)are compelling. The book does a good job at showing how dull the day to day details of semi small town police work are. It's nothing like a TV show or movie. Moose is pretty honest about his shortcomings. He tells how he managed to deeply offend his officers by showing up at an academy graduation without his dress uniform and he tells the story of how he got the job of Chief of Portland.Now about the investigation. Frankly, despite what Moose says, his team didn't catch the snipers. The big break came because a trucker spotted the killers in their car and called the hotline. The trucker never would've noticed if a description of the car hadn't been released by the media. Perhaps this was too big for a small town man, perhaps the ATF and FBI should've taken over instead of providing assistance. We'll never know for sure. The man in this book is complicated and angry. The book is worth reading because of this perhaps unintended portrait."},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"For all the information about Mr. Moose instead of the sniper killers. Mr. Moose is too hung up on his own accomplishments and racism and only gives out tidbits of information concerning the sniper killers. Again, if this were supposed to be an autobiography, this approach would be fine."},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"Thankfully, this horrible, opportunistic, self serving, greed driven gathering of semicoherent thoughts and ego driven, never ending chapters can be put to rest. The previous review seems to say much about this self serving man who tried to take credit for all of the hard working, talented, public service minded Law Enforcement Officers who worked long hours and in dangerous situations to track down and capture the sick individuals who perpetrated these horrendous crimes. This book doesn't even deserve to be at the ranking of 11,950 which it is at this time.Precious Thanks are given to those who really solved this crime in their quiet professional ways. As for the book and it's author, enough said in the title."},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"I would have never have purchased this book for myself after watching Moose's interview on 60 minutes. However, my wife purchased it for me without my knowledge and I must say that every penny spent was truly wasted. This book has very little to do with the sniper killings. It is much more focused on Moose's life and the trials and triumphs of being a black man in America.Moose gives examples in every other paragraph of how he has been mistreated, harassed, victimized and disrespected because he was an african american.If you would like to learn of details, investigative methods and other inside information on the sniper investigation you'd be better off of doing a simple query on the internet than purchasing this book.I must admit I had somewhat respect for Moose during the investigation, but am now truly disappointed."},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"The title is disengenuous. I worked under Moose in Portland. The book is all about his travails. You might call it a personal saga of one man's tearful life. That was about all he did well - cry on que. Oh - he could get angry on que also. Blister you up one side and down the other for any conceivable slight that he figured you might be guilty of.He seemed to always carry a chip on his shoulder, and figured that most white guys were prima facie racist.Guy is a walking, simmering stewpot. Can't write either. Only reason he made the big time was due to an ultra liberal, white-guilt ridden mayor by the name of Vera Katz."},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"A lot of other people are saying that this book is terrible and keeps repeating itself. However, I am currently writing a term paper about the Beltway sniper attacks and this book is my number one primary peer reviewed source. It has all the information about the investigation and lists everything I need to know. It is more than what was reported to the media if you read about a quarter into the book you find out that nothing in the investigation was told to the media until the correct times. If you want to leisurly read about the Beltway Sniper attacks then go find yourself a book by some author who doesnt really know anything. This is the lead investigator in charge of the task force to hunt for these guys. If you don't see the immense amount of information then you shouldn't be reading this. Everybody that says its boring, go find yourself a true document that is interesting. This is the real world, these are the true facts, and they are boring as hell but true. Sorry for the rant, but I thought this book would be terrible because of the reviews but give it a chance if you want the truth."},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"I was really looking foward to reading this book. Yet having been glued to the media like everyone else during these three weeks, there was never more I learned about the investigation, profile etc of the snipers. This was more like an autobiography of Chief Moose. At times how he became Chief was interesting but mostly very dry and hard to keep focus jumping back and forth between topics about himself then back to the investigation."},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"Time will the show the Charles Moose was completely out of his element as a police chief and would have been more useful handing out parking tickets. He botched the investigation and now he tries to profit from it, this should make anyone nauseous. Charles Moose, as a ploice chief was completely incompetent and a complete buffoon. Do not waste your money and make this con artist richer."},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"If you are looking for a well written account of these serial killers and their crimes, do not purchase this book. The vast majority of it is a disorganized and frequently tedious and redundant biography of the author and his forum on racism in U.S. law enforcement. Although both of these topics could make interesting reading, they are not well executed in this book. My interest in Three Weeks in October faded completely about three fourths of the way through the book. It did not deliver the goods."},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"If you want to know about what happened, do not read this book. The better book to get would be SNIPER by Horwitz. It is put together well and is not about Mooses life. Ever an officer here in Montgomery County said that SNIPER is better now what does that tell you."},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"It's always irritating when someone in a position of authority uses their involvement in an event of this nature to sell their own story, which is exactly what Charles Moose has done with this book.It's like calling a movie Titanic, then basing the story around the dramas of just two people when the bigger picture carries so much more gravity than can be expressed through the story of individuals.It's true that the racial identities of the perps in the case of the Washington Snipers was a key element (profiling would've suggested white men, when in fact the guilty men were of African descent) and that Charles Moose is a black man who has struggled against the prejudice of others, but at least half the book is a very poorly written autobiography which has little relevance to the killings. Without his involvement in the case, it's unlikely his story would've interested anyone enough to be published and whether that's right or wrong, it's most certainly wrong to use the case as a vehicle to sell his own biography.Also it's a difficult read: the first few chapters are written in a frustratingly concise prose made up of lots of short disconnected sentences with no cohesion to the rules of grammar, making for sloppy story telling. It does improve, but you have to battle with the first few chapters. Far be it from me to postulate, but it's as if two separate minds wrote this book. Ghost writers pay heed - either do it all yourself, or consult with the subject more closely.Where the story of the Washington Snipers is positioned between the chapters about the author and his experiences, it IS quite well detailed and described objectively (Mr. Gost Writer, take a bow.) This part of the book is riveting and makes for very interesting reading. But there's so much about Moose (it's like trying to watch a film on American TV, you just get fed up with adverts and lose interest in the film) screaming \\"ME ME MEEEEE.\\" Here lyeth the need for humility and the recognition that this story is not about one man and his struggles. It is, or rather SHOULD be, about - as the title refers - the hunt for the Washington sniper(s).On the whole this book had a lot of potential but was marred by the self indulgent nature of the biography which is at least half (if not more) of the book when the author's personal story could've been dealt with in one chapter or less. I'm no literary agent, but am sure that had it not been for the position Moose held in this investigation he wouldn't have got away without having at least a third of the book being edited out.I've read this book twice now, but on the second go round just skipped each chapter about the author's life and found the book to be much more edifying."},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"About the only two things one can conclude from this book are Moose is a racist, and Moose is a moron. It is a tale, told by an idiot, and not much of one at that.It is clear from the book that Moose is not a particularly adept policeman. He displays a penchant for suing people, possesses the aura of an &quot;angry black man,&quot; and on top of everything else can't write a coherent narrative, even with a co-author's help.I wonder if Mr. Moose is going to sue Charles Fleming when the critics pan this abysmal book."},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"I was fascinated by the manhunt for the snipers and wondering what on earth led the suspects to commit such meaningless crimes. I thought this book would satisfy my curiosity about the snipers and what exactly went on with the investigation. I was sadly disappointed.Moose wrote a great deal about himself, his life, and his racial issues. Moose stated in the book that the first a person notices about another is their color. I don't feel that this is necessarily true. I know that the first thing I notice about a person is whether they are male or female, then I start paying attention to their other characteristics. This is not a prejudice against males or females, it just dictates how I might communicate with or relate to them.The book was first a chapter about Moose, then a chapter about the case. It continually followed that pattern. This made the book somewhat difficult to read and to keep my interest. Moose is not a particularly good writer, nor is Charles Fleming - unless he wanted the book to come from Moose's own words.Moose has come very far in his life, and for this he should be proud. Personally, I gather from reading this book that he is a rather cold and distant man. I don't think I would find it easy to sit down and have a conversation with him. I admire what he has achieved, but I do not admire his racial issues."},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"The only reason I am not too mad at my self with this book purchase is that I picked it up on a sale table and spent only a few dollars on it. That happens to also be one of the nicest things I can say about the book. This review is really the tail of two books, the first book is the one I was interested in reading, which covered the Washington DC area sniper case. The second book is a history of the author, which I honestly did not care about. I will give the editor credit, he did keep the two sections in separate chapters, which made it easy as I got into the book to pass by the personal history parts. So on the section I wanted to read, well to say the writing was wooden would unfairly give trees a bad name. I have no idea how these two guys, the police chief and the ghost writer, managed to reduce an exciting and interesting story into a cure for insomnia, but they did it. Pfizer needs to bottle this and call it Sleep Fast because it was brutal to get through. To top off the dullness overload they provided less info then I could get from a single newspaper report of the incident. I bought this book to get all the good inside info, not white washed info that was already provided to the public.The sections of the book that dealt with the personal history of the author actually were written with a bit more spunk then the rest of the book. The only problem was that this guy is the most race aware public figure this side of Al Sharpton. Everything in the world is seen through a white black lens for this guy. It got so old reading about every slight or problem he ever had in his life that he could somehow link to racism. I have no doubt there have been events that he has been disadvantaged due to race, but it got to be too much. I really got the feeling that he was mad at every white man in the country and that he felt there was no way that a white man and black man could come together on any issue. His views on the subject were overbearing and rude. It was so much that he even went out of his way to identify every black person he writes about yet not the race of any of the other people. I have no idea why.So here is a book that I felt was about 50% bait and switch, I dare you to find on the cover or dust jacket any mention that over half of the book is this guys life story. What disappointed me even more about the content is that the authors could have given us so much more detail of the investigation. No pictures, no reprints of any of the messages, no transcripts of the recorded calls, the lack of detail was very disappointing. Overall I am very disappointed by this book. The author did detail out the case, but in almost a cliff notes fashion. The section of the book that details his life are written with such a chip on his shoulder that it makes this half of the book tiresome and distasteful. Overall I would not recommend this book other then the author says part of the proceeds are sent to a fund for the victims."},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"I live in the DC area and anxiously waited to get my hands on the book by who I feel is certainly a hero. Chief Moose stepped up and ran a first class operation, combining the services of dozens of agencies, thousands of officers, and tens of thousands of pieces information....and it worked, the snipers were caught and are now on trial. Like the Chief, I wish it had been solved sooner, but how many major crimes go for months without being solved, how many murders still appear years later in \\"cold case\\" files and on TV documentaries. I spent 20 years in law enforcement and am absolutely convinced the team he led did an outstanding job.Now, the book. I felt the coverage of the sniper investigation was good, but the bouncing back and forth between the time the task force was looking to solve the crime and the years Chief Moose spent growing up, then as a young officer in Portland, and on and on, was extremely distracting. I started scanning those chapters to get back to the sniper coverage. A chapter, maybe 2 to include Portland would have been fine, but this book is almost 50% biography. The constant references to the black-white struggles were also not necessary in this book.I love you Chief, but I really think you need to put the badge back on. Those who CAN. serve as cops; those who CAN'T, write about it.....let those who can't take care of the writing, someone needs you as their Chief....."},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"Three Weeks In October is the type of book you look for when you are trying to get an understanding of the humanity of law enforcement and what goes on behind the scenes of a high profile case.In this book, it appears that the author wanted to capture that aspect in the writing of this book about the Serial Sniper Case/Chief Moose Autobiography.As with most high profile cases, the top law enforcement officials such as Chief Moose are subject to the criticism of armchair quarterbacks and talking heads that have never been in a case of that nature, but are happy to give more than their fair share of what THEY think SHOULD have been done-- this is of course only AFTER the fact. It's almost like critics running in front of a parade and taking credit for the parade after it's already started. With that level of recognition, good and bad criticism goes with the territory and the author understood that, as he references in his book.Three Weeks gives an understanding of what makes Chief Moose tick and coming from that perspective and his upbringing, it gives you more of a human understanding of what went on behind the scenes and in front of the camera.Upon reading such a book, it helps to have an open mind and the right perspective toward wanting to understand the person, the elements of law enforcement and what they go through in handing high profile cases.Law enforcement is a very demanding and tough job. Handling tragedies and situations like the 9/11s, Snipers and Katrina puts our people in uniform in positions where the community's expectations take the human element away. It is not fair to them, but it's a reality. It makes it even tougher when they are placed in situations that have never happened before and there is not play book in which to stop or prevent the situation.Three Weeks goes into detail of how Chief Moose was placed in a \\"Damned If You Do, Damned If You Don't\\" type of situation. No matter if he had did everything right, he still would've been subject to harsh criticism. From day one, when the killings started, the community's emotions ran high and they expected their law enforcement to put a stop to it immediately. When it did not happen, there was that perception of fear and that their law enforcement agency was a failure in their ability to get the job done, whether it's fair or unfair.In fact, any other person in Chief Moose's position, regardless of race, age or location would have been subject to the same backlash-- Just ask former Jefferson County (Colorado) Sheriff Stone of the Columbine tragedy, Mark Brown, formerly of FEMA during Hurricane Katrina or former Boulder Colorado Police Detective Arndt of the JonBenet Ramsey case as examples.Few people outside of law enforcement ever understand or recognize the human element of the profession, where people do make mistakes and how it takes an even greater toll on their career, their health and reputation. Chief Moose does the most appropriate thing in ensuring that all of the agencies, federal, State and local get equal credit in cracking a case that had nearly impossible odds of getting solved.Three Weeks perhaps should've provided more balance between both of those elements and it would've been an outstanding book. Perhaps a separate Chief Moose biography and another book on the snipers would've been even better.Overall, it was still a good book to read and provides perspective not only into the case, Chief Moose and the law enforcement profession, but also the often forgotten human element."},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"I live literally 5 minutes away from the scence of the second shooting, and my grandmother's apartment was about 5 yards from the scence of another shooting. This is my home. So I figured that this book could prove interesting. Bah, humbug. Moose makes everytihng out to seem as if he was hero, ignoring the fact that there was no white box van, and the witnesses who described the actual car were ignored. What's worse is that publication of the book could screw up the sniper trials (at least in Maryland), and he violated every ethics law on the books. He wasn't that great of a police chief before the shootings, and he was even worse during and afer them. Buy the book if you want to hear about a man who wasn't even liked by his own officers."},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"This book dragged so much it was like reading Chief Moose's daily planner in the early stages of the investigation. I hope a more readable book is published on this investigation."},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"Mr. Moose has presented a sad and upsetting essay. That he presents himself, in this poorly written and developed book, as the leader of the investigation invites one to ask why he ignored the eyewitness accounts of the first attacks. I don't believe the book is worth the investment of time to read or money. It is a grim commentary on his character and literary abilities."},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"As a resident of the target area, I had hoped to learn what was going on &quot;behind the scenes&quot; as we watched the news reports. Instead the chief's book seemed to center on his personal life, his disappointments, and his problems with his perceptions of racial bias in this country. I'm sorry he resigned his job as Chief of Police. He was well liked in the police department. I think he was a much better policeman than an author."},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"I lived in this area through these events. My husband works at a car dealership one mile from the middle school shooting. We were afraid to go anywhere. I'd prefer to let my gas tank run dry than to try to pump gas. I feared my husband would go to work and not come home. I sent my daughter to school and prayed from the time she left the house until I knew she was safe inside the building. This was real. This was terror! I respected Charles Moose for the way he ran the investigation and for the way he handled the media and presented himself. He did a fantastic job. I still have a lot of gratitude and respect for him. As a result, I was anxious to read his book. I am utterly disappointed. I was not looking for a book about Charles A. Moose. I was looking for details about the sniper shootings. Perhaps I was hoping for a better understanding of what happened during those three weeks. I have not found that in Mr. Moose's book. I do not think it is well written at all. I feel that Mr. Moose spends far to much time discussing himself and his history as a black officer rising to a powerful position (every other chapter). That is not what the book should have been about. I applaud Mr. Moose's success, but this was not the place for him to pat himself on the back."},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"I've been wanting to read this book for a long time, and finally did. I got very interested in this subject because I followed the story very closely in the news at the time. Then, during about a week and half during the time of many of the shootings, my mother and I were on a road trip from Rhode Island to Arkansas. I remember getting into the Maryland/northern Virginia area and thinking I'd better have plenty of gas so we wouldn't have to stop in those areas. We actually stayed at a hotel in the northern Virginia area one night. We decided, because of the snipers on the loose, to just go to the Wendy's drive thru across the street, and bring dinner back to the hotel. At the hotel, I had the news on, and the shooting that had occurred that day was only about 45 minutes from where we were staying that night. The next morning, we repacked the car hurriedly and got back on the highway - without stopping for breakfast. We remember looking suspiciously at every white box van we saw on the drive. Reading this book brought back a lot of those memories for me; but in general, this book was problematic for me. Although it was intersting to learn more about Chief Moose's life and background - it was heavily a story about him, with the story of the sniper ordeal added in. Every other chapter was literally an autobiography about Moose - some details more intersting than others. There's one chapter in the middle of the book that is huge - about 40 pages in the paperback version, and it's all about Chief Moose's life. I thought I would never get through some parts of this book. What annoyed me a lot is that at least in the edition I read, there are typos or other errors. For one, there is a reference to the ill-blamed Richard Jewel from the Atlanta Olympic Park bombings. The Olympics is referred to as the 1998 Olympics, when I know it was the 1996 Olympics. I found at least two sentence strung together with no period in between. There are countless fragmented sentences in this book. Also, I found a sentence that had \\"at at\\" in it. Did anyone proofread this text, I wonder? Besides this nitty-gritty stuff, I was a little disappointed that this book really didn't shed too much more light on this crime that the public might have already gotten from news reports. There were a few insights here and there, but they come really late in the book, when I was already decided that this book was 'just ok'. I feel that it is still worthwhile to read, but if you're interested in it, be prepared to learn more about Chief Moose than you intended, and not as much about the crime at hand than you thought you would learn. In the end, I thought maybe this was his way of dealing with this whole ordeal - to talk more about himself and to have some closure in this chapter in his life - I don't know. I guess it's easy for me to say ... I've never walked in his shoes."},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"Unlike almost all the other reviewers here, I rather enjoyed reading Chief Moose's personal account of the sniper events. As I expected, this book provides one man's inside perspective on the sniper manhunt. It is not (as some others seemed to expect) and doesn't claim to be an all-inclusive, unsubjective, in-depth analysis (leave that to the media folks). And it provides information that only Chief Moose can provide -- such as how he really felt about the Washington Post and Channel 9 breaking the tarot card story without approval, or his interpersonal relationships with his co-leaders from the ATF and FBI.I agree that the biography chapters are a little dull at times, but it's not like the man has led the storied life of Albert Schweitzer or something. Up until last October, he was pretty much a regular guy. How interesting of a read would any of our own biographies be? However, his personal challenges (and how he dealt with them) of being a black man in a very traditionally white profession are worth reading or at least skimming. (Hey, if it's too boring for you, skip those chapters).I did not get the impression that he was being a whiney, self-serving &quot;victim&quot;. I thought he was trying to be honest about his life and career. While the writing isn't highly polished literature, it is certainly readable and I really felt like I was hearing the Chief's voice come through loud and clear. I think I would have been disappointed if the writing was too generic and voiceless.I think this book is worth including in any collection of material about the sniper investigation. It provides a legitimate first-person view of events and is a good complement to the Washington Post book."},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"I admired Chief Moose from the start of the sniper tragedy, and I always viewed the criticism of him as the sort of situation that's become more and more common in our 24/7 information access society: the media loves to build someone up and then tear that person down. Usually the public makes like a flock of sheep and follows along.The importance of this book, in my opinion, is that it showed his journey from the segregated South, through racial integration, all the way to the heights of his career. Most people would never have predicted, when he was a child, that a black male raised in a segregated town in North Carolina would become chief of police in two major metropolitan areas. He shows that someone from quiet, non-remarkable roots can grow up to make a tangible difference through their work (in his case, not only as a police officer but also as a college professor and member of the National Guard). The successful resolution of the sniper case is the icing on the cake - this man had an impressive \\"c.v.\\" long before October 2002.The book alternates between the time line of events during the sniper siege of the D.C. area and events from Moose's life. Some readers have complained that some facts were repeated, but it's more along the lines of revisiting key events from Moose's life to help the reader understand why a certain day or decision stuck out in Moose's recollection of those 23 long days. The writing is not prize-worthy, even though Moose hired an experienced co-writer. That's as it should be. The book remained largely \\"in his voice\\" which I strongly prefer to some ghost writer polishing over the personality of the person who lived through the events.I cheered out loud when Moose called out the Washington Post for their coverage of him after he declined to help their reporters write a book, and for reminding us that Jayson Blair of the New York Times was later shown to be not only a liar, but a full-fledged fraud.A good read, well worth your time."},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"At first I was put off by the alternating chapters that focused on Chief Moose and then the investigation. But as the book goes on you begin to appreciate the author's perspective. I think too many of these reviews focus on what is seen at first glance -- a black police officer and the book he wrote. The fact is the book makes you understand what the police were facing, the frustrations they felt in finding the sniper(s), and the relentless (and rightful) media attention. Effective leaders are not always loved by those they lead, but by the end of the book you realize Montgomery County, MD lost a good person when Moose was forced out to write this book."},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"I found this book riveting, educational, and inspirational. Anyone who focuses on the writing style can't see the forest for the trees. The autobiographical chapters are as irresistible as the manhunt. It's unfortunate that Chief Moose had to choose between his job and the book, but given the compelling aspects of the book, I'm personally glad he made the choice he did."},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"I worked with Charles Moose in Portland and know him to be an honest, dedicated professional man, loyal to his friends. This book is a brutally honest portrayal of the man and his beliefs. At a time when the entire nation was focused on his actions, he made us all proud of his professionalism and his humanity. The book is a bit disjointed because it skips back and forth between Portland and Montgomery County. It would have been better to have it chronologically. However, the information about his early life and his climb to the level of chief and then the sniper situation does give a complete picture of this dedicated law enforcement professional.(Charles Moose wrote the introduction to my autobiography, Triumph of Spirit, available on Amazon.com)"},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"I commend Moose for writing this book. I guess I don't really understand why so many people read his story and then complain that it wasn't all about the sniper investigation. Moose clearly states on the jacket of the book that it is an autobiography of his life, and how he became interested in law enforcement and pursued this career successfully, as well as how he came to lead the historical hunt for the killers in the sniper investigation. I don't think the book would have the substance it does, were it not for the inclusion of Moose's background.I enjoyed reading about Moose's personal life; his childhood, his family, and his becoming a police officer, and climbing the ranks to become chief in both Portland and Montgomery County.Moose did what he felt he had to do, or needed to do in writing this book. Who are we to criticize his decision?"},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"Here's to Chief Moose for single-handedly allowing the D.C./VA/Maryland Snipers to operate for so long. He went on television with his mythical white van driven by the mythical white racist gun-totin' drivers, meanwhile the real snipers, who just happened to be black AND Muslim, drove around in a Caprice and shot people in the head. Now, he wrote a book in which he tried to justify his poor police work. He was also an enemy of racial profiling (if they were black) only to use reverse racial profiling in this case (which failed, because the snipers were black). It's only in America where we can commend people for being \\"heroes\\" because they simply do their job. In this case, \\"Moose\\" did his job poorly, and the public, gratified that it didn't have to worry about the snipers anymore, kissed his butt in true fashion. Amazing how our society rewards poor performance.Get this book if you are a true sucka. I'm sure Moose will thank you for it. For my money, I'm gonna invest in a bullet proof vest, just in case this ever happens again.

That was a very unfair statement.Travel to Florida Chief Moose I will Asure you that You will be in the best of Area's here on that street Because most of the street's run together with his name.

Moose, and not come away inspired. Charles Moose's story is a \\"Horatio Alger\\" tale of our times - with one major difference - Mr. Moose's story is no tale! This book details his humble beginnings: his birth in New York in 1953, his \\"Oliver Twist like\\" string of odd jobs in his youth - chimney sweep, coal miner, and tailor's assistant in the Lower East Side. Mr. Moose endured racial taunts and oppression on a daily basis, yet always kept his \\"eyes on the prize\\". He perservered, and completed his degree in U.S. History in 1975 at UNC Chapel Hill. Shortly after, his meteoric career in law enforcement commenced - patrol officer in Portland, Oregon, rising to chief of police. He later was police chief of Montgomery County, Maryland, where we learn the details of how he single-handedly solved the \\"DC Sniper\\" case using brilliant police work and Sherlock Holmes style \\"gum shoe\\" tactics!Charles Moose is a definite inspiration to all, and I highly recommend this true-life literary masterpiece to all my associates and confreres in academia!"},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"The D.C. sniper case was solved in SPITE of Moose's incompetence, whose bungling and inaction cost lives.

This book, unfortunately, doesn't tell the real story of how dedicated and unsung law enforcement professionals solved this case.Take the money and donate it to your local fire and police instead of giving it to this moneyseeking man.

He quit his job as chief of police to write it, because ethics/rules prohibited his writing a book about those terrifying days in October. So, he quit his job. He goes on and on in this book about all his problems and racism, but this man quit his job as chief of police to write this book. Am I missing something here? A black man who is chief of police in an area near Washington DC, and I'm supposed to feel sorry for him?It wouldn't matter the race of this police chief. If they showed such a willingness to throw ethics to the wind, and showed they really didn't care about their job, wrote a book, half about the tragic days in October, half personal whine, that is a huge turn-off. Its no wonder this book is on the bargain tables."},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"Mr. Moose has written a pontifical,egocentric tome on a very serious subject. That he could wrap this book around his ego, instead of respecting the victims and their families and the thousands of law enforcement officers that were out there doing the work and finding the perpetrators is a travesty. I would much rather read a book by Bullwinkle!"},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"I live in Fredericksburg, VA. I had no intention of buying this book because I didn't want to give Chief Moose 1 penny of my money for writing this book. I think it is completely unethical. When the book came into the library I work at, I checked it out. The writing is nothing short of terrible. I would certainly get the money back from whoever pretended to edit your book. There are punctuation errors, spelling errors. (Opossum has an &quot;O&quot; at the front chief). I'm halfway hrough the book now, and 75% of it has been irrelevant to anything that happened last October. This flipping back and forth thing is tedious. I have no interest in hearing Chief Moose whine about racial profiling. I'm not sure what the sniper case has to do with his sister being a lesbian, and his brother being a drugged out junkie. It is laughable that he complains about what he called &quot;talking heads&quot;. These were ex police who were on the cable networks during the sniper trial. He said that they were just doing it to get their resume's out there, for their own self good. Seems like Moose has done the same thing with the writing(if it can be called that) and publication of this book."},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"Beyond the pathetic writings, it sickens me to think that Moo$e is being paid for a book that not only HURTS the investigation of the DC Snipers (tough to find an impartial jury now), but also allows him to gain credit for catching the bad guys. See, there was a reason the FBI was called in; Moo$e had no idea on how to run a major investigation. White guys in a white box van, huh? Funny the DC Snipers couldn't be further from that description. If anything, Moo$e needs to apologize to all the hard working people that were taken out of those white box vans at gun point, handcuffed and searched without more than an apology. But then again, Moo$e likes ignoring good information... like putting out a look out for a blue Chevy Caprice with two black guys in it."},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"I have not read this book because I have no interest in anything Chief Moose has to say about those three weeks in October. The mere fact that a public official, in his line of work, would try to capitalize on the deaths of 10 people in his area is despicable, disgusting and downright tacky. Chief Moose had NOTHING to do with the capture of the snipers. The incompetence of his team and the misinformation that he spewed out on a daily basis, did nothing to apprehend the snipers. If anything, it allowed them to continue terrorizing the area for that much longer.I did respect Chief Moose at one time, but after I heard about him giving up his job, morals and ethics for the almighty dollar, I was--and remain--disgusted by him. It is inconceivable to me that any human with half an ounce of dignity would stoop as low as he has. I don't know how many millions he was paid to put out this garbage, but if he was truly the role model he purports himself to be, he should donate every penny of his proceeds to the families of all of the victims.If I can take any comfort at all, it is the fact that this book is obviously selling very poorly. I am so glad that America is smart enough to see this pathetic banter and garbage for exactly what it is."},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"Reading this book reminded me what it was like raising my hyperactive, hypersensitive nephew- he whined from the day he left the womb and hasn't stopped feeling sorry for himself since. Charles A. Moose's lukewarm regurgitation of the events through which all of us in the DC Metro region suffered, is not only a missed opportunity to redeem himself for his foibles during those tense three weeks, but in addition it serves to insult fellow law enforcement officers, the press, victim's families and the public at large. It doesn't take much research to realize that this is a person with a permanent chip on his shoulder and perhaps someone to be ignored at all costs. A better representation of what these three weeks entailed for people in that region of the country, will probably come from one of the several OTHER books about to be released on this subject. The quality of writing wasn't worthy of this Montgomery College student's time.I heard Moose was planning to move to Germantown- I hope that's not true! If he comes to my home town, I'll leave!"},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"First, Charles Moose resigned his position as Chief of Police not to write this book, but to profit from it. I am a resident of Montgomery County, and the county ethics rules prevent county employees from PROFITING from work done in their official capacity. He could have written his life story up until his work as our Chief of Police, or written the exact same book without taking any money, but he chose neither of those paths, and that says volumes more about him than his book. He also, in a move that shocked even his harshest critics, repeatedly promised to let the prosecutors for the sniper trial review the book before it was published, and then published it without even giving the prosecutors advance notice, much less a chance to comment on whether anything in there would make their jobs more difficult. But most importantly, the man we trusted to uphold and enforce our laws asked to have them twisted like a pretzel when they got in the way of his ego and his wallet.Thankfully, the book is bland and revolves around Moose's massive ego, rather than any facts. Definitely a must-miss. My only regret is that there is nothing lower than one star."},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"This book was one of the best books i have ever read Charles Moose had alot of really good ethics and morals from my opionion i don't think that he was a self serving paper pushing punk i think we need alot more police chiefs like hime I really liked his leadership qualties because he took control when nobody else wanted to. I think his childhood backround helped him to be the most succseful police Chiefs in history.

It was as much a documentary on how the news media handles such events, as on the tools and techniques of today's law enforcement communities. In 1999, in &quot;Triumph of Spirit: An Autobiography by Chief Penny E. Harrington,&quot; Chief Moose wrote in the foreword: &quot;As we approach the twenty-first century, Americans are still seeking a way to develop a working relationship with the police in their communities. Americans clearly benefit from a police agency that reflects the community - a police agency that looks, feels, and thinks the way it does - a police agency designed to reflect the community in regard to demographics, ethics, and values.&quot; Many police agencies around the country have adopted effective community policing programs - and those communities have greatly benefited from that effort. The Portland, Oregon episodes described briefly by Moose in &quot;Three Weeks in October&quot; are discussed in great detail in Harrington's book. I would encourage readers with an interest in learning more about law enforcement diversity, and the often-delicate relationship between communities, their police agencies-and the media, to read her book. It sheds much light on many of the topics touched upon by Chief Moose and provides great perspective about the issues of law enforcement, diversity, the media - and the often-ensuing conflict between the three.

Gold, author of &quot;Top Cops: Profiles of Women in Command.&quot;)"},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"I thought this book was completely interesting, both from the viewpoint of Chief Moose's life in Law Enforcement and his role in the sniper investigation.

Anytime an unassuming, common-day law enforcement officer can make national headlines, actually capture the terriost and write a book about it, that's applaudable. Although the book did not give me the meat and potatoes of those three weeks as I had hoped, I respect Mr. Moose for stepping out on faith and doing what he thought he had to do. I believe whatever he does as an infamous black man, he's going to be attacked on every front. Case in point: I purchased &quot;Three Weeks...&quot; from a local grocery chain the day it hit the shelves. My grocery store receipt did not give the book credit, but rather gave the credit to another author. Here we go again. I've saved the receipt as a reminder that whatever a black person does in America it better include taking your opportunities wherever and whenever you can. Otherwise, stay at your stinking desk job, shut up and let the maddness continue to keep you in check. Right on Chuck!"},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"Charles Moose writes an excellent memoir here that brilliantly tells the story of a black man growing up in a sort of middle generation - too young to bare the brunt of Jim Crow laws and the most vile forms of segregation, but too old to have forgotten. Readers who come to this book looking for a tell-all about the insides of the sniper investigations will likely be disappointed. This book tells the tale of the sniper investigation and the police career of Moose. For all the comments that have been made about Moose blaming so many of his mistakes on racism, he seems to take the blame for his own mistakes with a surprising amount of candor. Where race comes to play in his life, it is not used as an excuse, but to give insight on certain circumstances. I was surprised that Moose spoke so candidly about missteps he felt he had made and about the details of certain about the investigation. I can't help but wonder about the hypersensitivity of some of the critics of his discussions of race. Do they believe that there are many black men in America who do not face some form of racism? When I first heard about this book, I thought it would fail because of Moose's insistence that it would be something more than a tell-all about the sniper investigation, but I now suspect, in the end, that the truth is that the book's very strength is the combination of the story of the investigation and his life. Bravo."},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"While I enjoyed the book (and the reviews)....I find it saddening that those from our area can look down upon Moose. If you dont agree with him writing, then thats your opinoin. Most readers enjoy this book and find it to be very informative. Dont give negative reviews when you are biased in the beginning. I found that Moose was able to capture the behind the scene drama and essence that we living the reality could not.It's definitely worth it."},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"I haven't finished his book yet but so far it reminds me of Rick Bragg's &quot;All Over But the Shoutin&quot; and Lisa Beamer's &quot;Let's Roll&quot;.

CHEERS to Charles Moose for telling his story."},{"Title":"Three Weeks in October: The Manhunt for the Serial Sniper","review":"As someone who lives only 6 miles from Aspen Hill, Maryland, and who was 8 months pregnant during the horrible ordeal, I fully admire and back everything that Chief Moose did during the investigation. He didn't bungle the investigation, he wasn't hogging the media, he simply did a job and lead us to the best outcome possible, a double arrest.I bought this book to take his side and to hear his side. I am glad I purchased it and proud to call him chief even though he is still not Mont. Co.'s Chief. It is sad that he felt he had to step down and really speaks horribly to the residents that he protected that not enough people protested the county basically forcing him to step down.I would highly recommend this book. While he is not a novelist and while he isn't an author by trade, he never claimed to be and he doesn't intend to be either. The public wants to hear a first hand account of the &quot;behind the scenes&quot; and that is what you get. If you don't like his history, skip those chapters.Kudos to Chief Moose AND to all the other officers of Montgomery County, Maryland, the FBI and EVERYONE (officers, whomever!) that got us through that time in one piece.Thank you thank you thank you!

However, profiles only come from an analysis of history -- after the crimes are committed and solved. Now they have some new data points. But to blame Moose for it? That's why I know it is the same redkneck because so many of these scathing reviews blame Moose for the profile and for every mistake made by every law enforcement person. Jeez! Go get a life!

If any of those words spark a flame of interest in your mind Master Sniper is a must read. Master Sniper is a novel of twisted murder conspiracies, evil bad guys, and any good novel isn't great without a World War II setting. I personally would recommend this book to any action book fan. This is by far the best book ever written by Stephen Hunter. Set back into the time of Nazi Germany, when Hitler and swing music were dominating the planet. In a German concentration camp a Jewish poet is being held captive, working 16 hours a day just to stay alive. One night they are led into a field in the heart of the Black Forest in Germany. One by one the Jewish prisoners are being sniped. The poet realizes what is happening and tries to escape. He succeeds. In London an American Sargent discovers a new weapon that can snipe better than any other weapon known to man, and with it the Germans can snipe even Eisenhower himself. But the target isn't Eisenhower, it's some one bigger the Eisenhower. Through out the story Leets, the American Sargent discovers more than he ought to know about the Reich. I personally would recommend this book to any one who loves to read historical fiction. I was first drawn to this book because it sounded like an action thriller that would sustain me through an 8-hour long plane ride. Then when I had read it I realized that it had more depth. This is the best novel ever written by Stephen Hunter. There really aren't many details about the book that are bad. Some good parts about the book are that one, the book is realistically placed (in time, setting, and character opinions.) in relation to the time period.

Not a Marine Corps sniper, but a Wermacht sniper, in the last days of World War II. Apparently, Stephen Hunter likes to \\"reach out and touch someone\\" in his stories. He does a lot of stories based on snipers.Hunter, by the way, spent his military service in the Army, not the Marine Corps. His bio does not discuss his Army experience, but he has encyclopedic knowledge about firearms, and if he makes a statement about a given model of firearm, or its ballistics, you can bet that he's done his research. He's done a lot of reading on the subject, but how much experience he has, again, is a questionmark. Not, I think, a competitive shooter.This tale looks at the Office of Strategic Services (reinvented as the CIA) of \\"Wild Bill\\" Donovan during WWII, (much like Claire Chennault's Civil Air Transpory was reborn as Air America, the CIA outfit) and the Brit intelligence apparatus, for part of its setting. I was interested to see, again, a reference to Ernest Hemingway--not too flattering. He was also in Hunter's novel, Havana--drunk there, too. I wonder what Hunter has against Papa? Apparently just doesn't like him. I always did.Another theme in this book is a strong current of sympathy for the Jewish people--not that they didn't deserve it, but I have noticed in Hunter's other books an almost obsessiveness about showing how badly treated were the blacks in the old South. He does seem to get caught up in these matters, a champion of the \\"underdog\\", although he uses variations on the \\"n-word\\" freely throughout all of his books, and I've read several of them.These are not just fault-finding comments. Stephen Hunter is currently my favorite author in his genre, as I've said before. He's a wonderful storyteller. But, I think I've accurately detected both his political bent and his agenda, if he has one besides simply writing great stories. He's that rarity, a liberal who knows something about firearms, and may even be infatuated with them. I wish him well, and hope he continues to write great novels to a ripe old age.Joseph (Joe) Pierre, USN (Ret)author of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenanceand other books"},{"Title":"The Master Sniper","review":"After reading \\"Point of Impact,\\" I was really excited about diving into this Hunter work about a German soldier, Repp, skilled in long range shooting, who is on a dangerous mission and has in his possession a very dangerous state of the art weapon to fulfill it.The book gets a little confusing because there are so many German towns, phrases, organizations, etc that it becomes hard to keep track of them througout the reading. Also, the romantic scene between the hero who hunts down Repp, Leets, and a nurse becomes more distracting and really has no relevance to the story. The action scenes were quite entertaining, however, and the book was hard to put down in the last 100 pages.It was a decent book but I think I'll stick with the \\"Swagger\\" series from now on."},{"Title":"The Master Sniper","review":"I will always give this author the benefit of the doubt and pick up his work.

I can't believe the publisher even read the book.Here's the info from the publisher, \\"It is the spring of 1945, and the Nazis are eliminating all the witnesses to their horrible crimes, including Jews and foreigners remaining in the prison camps. Kommandant Repp, who is known as a master sniper, decides to hone his sniping abilities by taking a little target practice at the remaining laborers in his own prison camp.\\"Incorrect.Repp is not the commander of a prison camp. He doesn't \\"decide to hone his sniping abilities by taking a little target practice\\" at the laborers. What is happening is that members of the German SS are frantically trying to develop a night vision device before the end of the war for some unknown and ghastly purpose. Repp is the \\"master sniper\\" of the project and will be the one to use the device once it has been developed. At the start of the book the Germans are testing the device on some Jews brought into the project for the purpose of being live targets. Unknown to the Germans one of the Jews has added some discarded packing material to the lining of his overcoat. This acts as a super insulator that makes him invisible to the infrared detecting night vision device Repp is using. The Jew escapes in the night to Allied lines and his strange story gives the Allies a clue that the Germans have some sinister project in the works. Because the war is obviously almost over most of the Allies are inclined to ignore the German project. Of course the main characters on the Allied side take the Germans seriously and that makes for a great story.There are a few holes in the plot you could drive a truck thru. The infrared night vision device cannot \\"see\\" a person because they are insulated but at the end of the book Repp blasts several inanimate objects that not emitting any infrared. Don't let these get in the way of enjoying the book. I found the book to be a fasinating action story. Very, very few authors ever get their gun talk right. Stephen Hunter is superb in this regard. (John Sandford aka John Camp is another, he writes great police detective stories.)"},{"Title":"The Master Sniper","review":"rating 3.5 starsI am a big fan of Stephen Hunter's work. The Swaggert series is fantastic. And there is a slight connection with that via the Vampir (which crops up in Black Light- a story about Earl Swaggert, Bobby Lee's father. There is no Swaggerts in this story, though Repp is a man somewhat similar to Bobby Lee (in some respect, vastly different in others)).So the major character here as a master sniper named Repp, a german with a mission to perform at the end of world war 2. Of course, he has Vampir to perform it with. This mission is fairly original I must say! It was a nice hook to keep you in in what is a very readable book (and the revelation of the mission won't cause you to cringe either...more like, 'hey wow isn't that cool'): about four hours to read.It is obvious that Stephen hunter was still learning his craft as his wrote this, however his talent is obvious and consistently shines through. It generally has strong characterizations: Leets, Repp, Susan, Shmauel. And the plot fairly races along, with consistently strong action sequences.The plot is where this novel falls down at times: the dead-ending of characters and then the sudden inspiration and location of the next lead to follow to chase Repp down is just a little too far-fetched at times, particualrly the segment, mid-book, in the camp. Just a little too convenient. If you know what I mean. I find this rather annoying. To me it seems a cop-out. This colors my opinion (and the unfair comparison with his current work, 20 years later which tends to be REALLY strongly plotted).However compared to many of the WW2 novels getting around, this one is still better than most. So in all, not a bad read. Fast, clever at times, suspenseful and never slow, dull or boring or worse, totally predictable. The ending is probably resolved too quickly (suggests some heavy editorial pressure was placed on the author) and in a manner that may have you questioning Repp's abilities, knowledge and intuition in being a master sniper. Nevertheless, it still has high adventure tempered with a acute proximity of the Holocaust and the complete disregard for the vlue of human life, other than as something to be exploited while it was of use and exterminated when it was not (Repp uses Jews for target practice with the Vampir: there is a subtle plot issue/flaw in this as well, particulalrly his choice of targets).You'll certainly notice its shortcoming if you read Stephen Hunter's later work before reading to this one. But fortunately the shortcomings aren't that prevelant or terminal. So enjoy. I could think of worse ways to spend 4 hours."},{"Title":"The Master Sniper","review":"'The Master Sniper' is a finely crafted novel, a very compelling tale much in the style of recent gems like &quot;The Triumph and the Glory&quot; or &quot;Black Notice&quot;, or even books of a more techno-thriller bent like &quot;The Devil's Teardrop.&quot; Four stars!"},{"Title":"The Master Sniper","review":"Murder, conspiracy, Nazis, and guns.

In that vein I have just completed, damply, the grand tour through Stephen Hunter's lexicon of gun-and-testosterone novels built around the cult of the lone rifleman and the wild killers from the hills and the dutiful men who oppose them.I liked them all, more or less: the Point of Impact/Dirty White Boys/Black Light trilogy; the now-dated cold-war era countdown to Armageddon &quot;The Day Before Midnight&quot;; and even the weak sister (now there's a Bob Lee Swagger phrase if i've heard one) of the bunch, &quot;The Master Sniper.&quot;Hunter has the mind and the method of the sniper down cold; the author bio mentions Hunter's time in Vietnam, so maybe he is really in the know. In these technical aspects he is unmatched, and his prose is smooth and elegant. He can describe a shooting like no other author I've ever read.THe problem with &quot;Master Sniper&quot; is that I just couldn't care enough about the story to justify the effort in getting through the book. Don't read on if you are intent on reading the book yourself.A legendary SS sniper is loosed by Himmler himself to hunt down and kill a prominent Zionist's son in his Swiss refuge. For a killer who has mowed down two or three hundred Russians in a day's work, this presents no insurmountable moral obstacle, for like all of Hunter's villains and some of his heroes, the sniper kills dispassionately, except for the endorphin storm the act of killing releases in the killer.The hitch is that our sniper can't be sure which of the twenty-odd kids holed up in the Swiss Alpine convent is the right one. No matter; with his cumbersome but deadly infrared night scope he'll take them all out in pitch darkness. The development of this early infrared sight is a major plot thread, and is some of the most interesting reading of the book.No kid, no inheritance, no fortune to be channelled to postwar Zionist causes. Even better,Himmler figures he'll appropriate the money for the SS and use it to help ex-SS men escape the Allies' Nuremberg noose: ODESSA gets a pay raise. A potentially interesting hook, but it falls flat here in Hunter's telling.His adversary is a downtrodden American OSS firearms expert, with a shot-up leg and a romance gone bad. I found it very hard to like or admire this Leets, alternating between lovesick puppy and man of steely resolve; and I failed to see how shooting the kid would really stop the Zionists' progress. Maybe my brain has been cooked in my skull by the glare and heat at poolside, but I never quite figured why the kid had to die so that the SS could get his inheritance. And I never grew fond enough of Leets to really care if he succeeded in stopping our Nazi. I found myself rooting for the sniper much of the time since he is the book's most exciting actor.In summary, the book is filled with tight, tactile, multisensory prose but the storyline itself just didn't reel me in like those of Hunter's other works.

It's worth reading for sure but I personally enjoy some of the later titles a little more.After reading the first hundred pages or so I set this down for a while and came back to it. It picks up in the second half of the story when the plot is actually starting to become somewhat clear. And when the full scope of the assassinaion plot is revealed it is quite unique. My main problem is with certain characters that seem to pop up and then go nowhere. There's a love story thrown in here for awhile that just kind of...disappears.

The same criticism can be leveled at &quot;The Master Sniper&quot;--but there's an important difference.The antagonist in this novel is Krepp, the Meisterschutze, or Master Sniper, who is admittedly a soulless robot. It is not until Hunter's later works that we learn that this soullessness is an important component of the personality of a successful sniper. ..But his protagonists, both American and British, are an interesting mix of heroic impulses and all-too-human flaws. Thriller readers who know anything at all about firearms are accustomed to seeing novels which are rife with mistakes about the nature and effect of small arms. Don't expect to see any of these mistakes in Hunter's work.

That said, virtually all of his books that I have read contain implausible, and/or poorly researched facts and situations. The master sniper was the worst of these. Shooting people at 400 meters with subsonic bullets defies the laws of physics. So many implausible technical flaws, it took me completely out of the novel.I was really into Dirty White Boys until Hunter once again started his unbelievable stuff. Has Hunter ever seen anybody shot with a 45 caliber handgun? In one book he has a Master sniper killing people running at 400 meters with effectively a pellet gun, and in another he has bad boys charging through a hail of bullets still fighting after being shot 30 times.I'd really enjoy his novels if he didn't take me out with ludicrous situations."},{"Title":"The Master Sniper","review":"If I had read this book first I never would have read the others which are mostly excellent.

Makes it more fun and challenging, really. After devouring the tales of heroism of Bud Pewtie, Earl Swagger, and Bob Lee Swagger, we find ourselves back in 1945 with a quiet anti-hero named Captain Leets, who stumbles across intelligence leading to the pursuit of SS Master Sniper Repp and his secret weapon, among the earliest of night vision weapon apparatus. Seeing the modern versions of this type of gear being routinely employed by common foot soldiers and police today, it's hard to picture what the earliest stuff was like, plagued with problems, attached to terribly heavy primitive battery packs.Hunter brings it all to life in a very enjoyable tale, quite outstanding for a first novel (1980) that still seems fresh today. The \\"love stuff\\" and the \\"tennis part\\" were minor annoyances, but Hunter must have felt, at least in the tennis scenes, that it was necessary to \\"flesh out\\" the Roger Evans character. Two thirds of the way through the book I had to go back and look up Roger's full name, as I was sure this was the origin of \\"Frenchy Short\\", brought to life in Hunter's masterpiece (one of several) \\"Hot Springs\\". Frenchy has the CIA and OSS ties, and is altogether a scheming scoundrel, but you like him anyway. Frenchy and Roger were perhaps in the same frat at Harvard.Hunter does a particularly fine job taking us inside the mind of Repp, who carries out his role in the ghastly \\"final solution\\" with no pangs of conscience whatsoever.

Rather it is a simple statement from my own point of view. When I read a Crichton or a Dan Brown it typically took me no more than three days to finish it because I couldn't put it down. But this one took me 10 days or so to finish because it just did not have the same kind of edge."},{"Title":"The Master Sniper","review":"THE MASTER SNIPER is an early novel by Stephen Hunter; it was originally published in 1980. It is a thriller of the Second World War--a sub-genre I love--and it reminded me just a little of Jack Higgins' bestselling THE EAGLE HAS LANDED.Captain Leets is an officer with the Office of Strategic Services, a paper-pusher really, who specializes in Nazi firearms. He, as everyone else, is waiting out the war. It is January 1945, and the Nazis are against the ropes. They still have enough muscle to do some damage, but the end of the war is in sight, and no one wants to take too many chances, and Captain Leets is no different.That all changes when a strange report crosses his desk: a small shipment of Stermgewehr-44s--an assault rifle that was produced and requisitioned in the thousands--was sent from the factory to a place called Anlage Elf. Leets isn't sure why, but something bothers him about this shipment of rifles. It's not just the number of rifles being shipped, but no one has heard of the requesting agency, and why would the Germans risk shipping such a small amount of rifles across the country when the war is lost?This sets up a mystery that Captain Leets will struggle to solve throughout the rest of the novel. He will go against his superiors, participate in a parachute raid of an enemy camp, discover things about himself that he doesn't like, alienate friends, and slowly, ever so slowly discover what the Germans are up to.THE MASTER SNIPER is a rewarding read. The prose is quick and spry, while the plot is rich enough to keep you guessing until shortly before the end. Mr. Hunter ratchets the tension and suspense perfectly, and the characters are enjoyable and likable--Mr. Hunter does an excellent job of creating a likable hero, while also creating a villain who doesn't seem terribly bad until the novel begins to unwind, and then he is unmasked as a truly despicable and dangerous person.Ben Boulden, Gravetapping"},{"Title":"The Master Sniper","review":"I first read this book back in 1983 and found it one of the strangest but certainly more interesting novels I have read set in WW II. The style of writing is remarkable with well drawn characters. Set within the closing weeks of WWII the book invokes a deeply mystical aura supported with a comprehensive knowledge of contemporary German weaponry and organisation. I was so intrigued by the book that I wrote to the author. His reply illuminates the thoughts behind the book and, having re-read the book recently I feel sure his letter will be of similar interest to other readers:++++++++++++++++++++++++++++From Stephen Hunter, April 1983.Thanks for your kind note concerning \\"The Master Sniper\\"; it encourages an author to know that his book is still being read. I shall try to answer your questions.In Repp, I was trying to represent authentically the German point of view viz a viz the Holocaust. I felt that too many popular novels had portrayed the Nazis as slithering fiends, cowards, bullies, molesters; in other words, so safely distanced from the human condition as to let all the rest of us off the hook. In Repp I tried to build a man in many ways honourable, even heroic, quite decent. Except that he murdered people and believed in it ; I felt that what no book had quite caught was the zeal, the missionary passion, the Nazis had for their self-appointed mission; I felt that they weren't cynics at all, but rather idealists and for this reason were far more terrifying a moral phenomenon. And naturally a part of this view (was) the conviction that the Jews caused the war and were responsible for their own death...my idea was that this, in its utter self delusion, was far more terrifying than the more conventional theatrical evil that the movies seem to insist on giving us.As for \\"Vampir\\" yes, such a device existed, much as I described it; I took the liberty however, of developing the \\"solar assist\\" unit, because I needed an artificial device to hold the Germans in that camp (Anlage Elf simply means installation 11, although I liked the pun in the word elf, because it suggested goblins and children, which are, of course, two other themes in the book) while Leets and his team tried to locate it.As for Vollmerhausen, no, he's not based on anybody specific (although I did use the Giepel team for some background) ; I simply borrowed the name from a road that runs near my house. And, in fact, other readers, when they pass under it on the super highway, have been compelled to call and find out if that's where I got the name. And all the organisatons of the Third Reich -- from WVHA to Amt IV-b-4 -- all existed.And thanks for your suggestion for another book on Repp, but in all honesty, I don't think it's in the cards -- although I almost wrote a book in which Leets and Evans got involved in the MacLean-Burgess-Philby espionage case. But at least for now, I've spent my obsessive interest in World War II and particularly the Third Reich. But I haven't given up history; my next book is set in 1937 in Spain, during the Civil War and I'm having a great time.Thanks and bestStephen Hunter++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++"},{"Title":"The Master Sniper","review":"I thought the first 3/4 of this book was entertaining. I was interested in how the German weapon was being created and,most importantly, its ultimate target. I also found most of the characters somewhat interesting.Let's just say, without giving anything away, that the ending is stupid and not worth the wait.

The fact that he was a pot bellied 'nobody' made me cheer more for him. Too many lead characters have the same 'Rambo-like' mold so Leets made it interesting.This story was about honour and duty. A couple of unexpected turns also made it interesting.The villain was likeable too. Great story."},{"Title":"The Master Sniper","review":"Hunter has set up an interesting novel here. There is so much that is implied and not explained. Anthony and Leets representing S.O.E. and O.S.S. do what Intelligence agents do, they analyze information, trying to glean something vital from the mass. They find something unusual and must convince, not only each other, but someone with the power to do something about it.The book shows how both the U.S. and U.K., while allied, still had their own interests. The aloof Brit with the stiff upper lip is revealed. Leets, not a Yale or Harvard man, must deal with his own position in OSS as well as being an American dominated by his British counterpart. The kid (his name escapes me)the golden boy, sitting out the war but glorying in what it can get him. Oh yeah, and the NAZI. Repp as the SS soldier. Not warrior, but Soldier. A good portrayal of what the SS and Nazi politicians were. Shmuel was as tragic as the camps themselves.The fact that a final act of contempt being the murder of twenty four children should give the reader some insight as to just what the Nazis were all about. Money just like what they were after in this novel has been sitting in Swiss banks for nearly sixty years, benefitting who knows. Lastly, I liked how the last days of the war were dealt with, the attacking Americans, the retreating Wermacht, the last ditch stands and brutality of the SS.

And I must admit a fascination with the year 1945 as the Second World War came to a close and and reconstruction began. In this thriller, we are introduced to Waffen SS Lieutenant-Colonel Repp, a veteran sharpshooter who has taken down hundreds of the enemy particularly on the Eastern Front. The plot involves an intricate assassination hatched as the Third Reich began to crumble. It is fairly standard fare with a cat and mouse chase along with unnecessary love interests. What keeps it interesting are Repp and the author's frequent references to real history. Yet, Hunter can also wander by introducing Hemingway into the tale, including a weird tennis subplot, and having the characters moralize a bit beyond belief on the subject of the Holocaust (such emotions and conclusions would not take hold for years - during the period the book took place most were unbelieving or in complete shock to digest the horrors so recently discovered). The best part of the book is Repp making his way to his objective across an apocalyptic Europe while the least entertaining are the final chapters which become cartoonish in comparison."},{"Title":"The Master Sniper","review":"Stephen hunter remains my favorite author, and this novel only further cements his place as such.

It's early Hunter, and it was the book which created his legions of fans.Fine storytelling, with a taut, credible plot, and good characterisation - that's &quot;The Master Sniper&quot;. It's the basic chase story, using the Second World War as a back-drop, with an extraodinary man cast as the villain, and good ol' Joe Average as the good guy.History tells us that it was good ol' Joe Average ( a pretty amazing man ) who won the war in the Pacific and West Europe. And Hunter draws him here with sympathy and clarity.This is a very, very good book: but Hunter got better with his next book, then better with the next one, and so on. Start here, and read on...."},{"Title":"The Master Sniper","review":"Although I've been reading Hunter's film reviews in my local paper for years, I've never picked up any of his books. However, I have a soft spot for WWII-based thrillers, so when I stumbled across this first book of Hunter's (originally published in 1980), I figured I'd give it a whirl. Set in the waning weeks of the war in Europe, the story concerns a top-secret Nazi plan to use their top sniper and a special weapon to eliminate a mysterious target. Meanwhile, an OSS small-arms analyst in London is given a scrap of information to check out, a tiny thread that he can't stop pulling on, which slowly but surely puts him on the trail of the German plot. The book then follows a fairly conventional thriller trope, as the Allied team races against the clock to stop the Nazis before it's too late.The resulting narrative has the unevenness you might expect from a first novel. Some sequences are quite good, and some are really flat, some characters are decent developed, others are stiff. For example, the description of the battle in Russia that turned the German sniper into a hero is outstanding. But there is an extended section in the middle about an exhibition tennis match one of the supporting characters in involved in which has nothing to do with anything. Parts of it are wildly over sentimentlized, while others are distinctly cold-blooded. The plot also relies entirely upon a ridiculous coincidence which brings the American analyst into contact with the one person who can provide him with several crucial pieces of information. Another big disappointment is the revelation of the target for this elaborate plot, which left me entirely underwhelmed. On the whole, I suppose it's a serviceable WWII-thriller, but nothing worth seeking out unless you're a fan of the genre. It does have enough bright parts to make me interested in checking out one of Hunter's later books to see if he's ironed out the wrinkles in his writing.Note: The secret weapon at the heart of the story is basically an infrared night-vision device heavily based on the real \\"Zielgeraet\\" system developed for the Sturmgewehr 44 assault rifle and really deployed sometime in late 1944, early 1945."},{"Title":"The Master Sniper","review":"After reading a number of the Earl and Bob Lee Swagger books I was expecting something similar and this book is not.

It was a gift and the recipient loved it."},{"Title":"The Master Sniper","review":"Hunter does a great job setting this novel back in the time of WW2. Character and plot development is good. Action is very fast paced. I did find some of the combat situations a bit implausible but then I have never partaken of that particular pastime myself-certainly not in WW2. The character of Repp is developed well-a person who seems not sociopathic as much as simply devoid of any normal human emotion-just dead emotionally. The novel is a bit scary in that it shows what happens when mortal instruments are placed in the hands of inhuman humans. Those younger folks who have suffered the effects of the , IMO, very poor educational system of the past 30 years might want to avail themselves of the many sources of information about the holocaust. The novel requires the reader to understand that what happened DID HAPPEN, whether or not the kind of techno thriller stuff described in the book took place. It's important to never break the chain of knowledge from generation to generation that what happened must not again if we can stop it.Off soap box now. My dad was a WW2 vet/ Europe.

Still, he is a good writer, with a cool, sardonic tone just right for the tale. The technical detail about a next generation sniper weapon is absorbing, is consistent with the historical one-step-ahead state of Nazi science, and is unfolded well to drive the plot.Hunter also does a good job drawing German sniper Repp - modest, fearless, invincible in battle, seemingly an all-purpose war hero until you learn more about him. He is tracked doggedly by Leets, an out-of-shape, underrespected, mostly ignored American intelligence desk jockey who must glean the tiniest of clues to determine what's up. Hunter's depiction of concentration camp survivor Shmuel, a lone witness to the plot, is touching and a cut above what I expected in this sort of military novel.Quibbles: The text could use a decent copy-editing; there were numerous errors involving quote marks. And Hunter allows himself an indulgence - a twenty-page passage on Leets' annoying college-boy assistant who plays an exhibition tennis match with no plot connection. It's just an excuse for Hunter to write about a sport he apparently loves.This is still a pretty good book. It keeps moving, it's paced right and it's absorbing."},{"Title":"The Master Sniper","review":"This was the first of Hunter's books that I read and it is probably my favourite, despite the implausible plot, because of the character Repp. I know that we are supposed to despise this killer but he is one of the most absorbing characters I have met in fiction. Men with such single-minded commitment to an ideal are very rare today, but in the 1930s and 1940s and during the Crusades or perhaps as Janissaries for the Ottomans they were more common. Hunter was still learning his trade at this stage but he manages to create some riveting battle scenes, especially the description of Repp's sniping battle in Demyansk in Russia. He has also obviously done some research on weapons from the period which gives a realistic feel to the story. It's an entertaining read for sure."},{"Title":"The Master Sniper","review":"This story was great in respect to its' plot and characters. Leets is a hero for all of us of a similar description. Repp appeared soulless, yet seemed to be trying to obtain one. Schumel had the soul, but seemed destined for the higher place for which he was prepared. The remaining characters blended well with the plot and the main characters. My only question is the time line. The whole scenario is completed in such a short period of time. From the smallest piece of evidence to the ending seems unrealistic for 1945. Other than that limitation, this is an excellent read for those who enjoy WWII mystery and intrigue."},{"Title":"The Master Sniper","review":"The Master Sniper was good. It's down points are when he has a lot of run on sentences and carries on with stuff and begins to bore you. When he does get to the point, he does a great job at it and I recommend reading this book."},{"Title":"The Master Sniper","review":"Tha Master Sniper is a solid book, however it is a little devoid of characters that you really care about. You spend a lot of time with the robot-like NAZI sniper who isn't that interesting. It is worth reading, but if you've read Point of Impact you may be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Master Sniper","review":"Although this was a good read, I would have to say that Point of Impact was better. Nevertheless, Stephen Hunter seems to prove his fiction skills once again."},{"Title":"The Master Sniper","review":"This was 4th Hunter book(Time to Hunt, Havana, Pale Horse Coming and this one) I've read.The book was pretty usual Hunter good, up until the last few pages when, all of sudden,the \\"Master\\" sniper turned into a jayshooter.Not so great compared to other Hunter books.Can someone explain why the German snipermissed the shots in the final scene, please?I just don't understand how that happened(won't narrate it for fear of spoiling).Thanks,"},{"Title":"The Master Sniper","review":"This is by far the best work that the author, Stephen Hunter, has ever done. His use if imagery to describe the lifestyles of the people in the mid 1940's was amazing. The overall sense and feel of the scene in which the Jewish prisoners are set free into a large open field just to be killed by a \\"Master Sniper\\" is awe inspiring and actually makes the reader feel like he/she is in the field with his/her dying comrades.Stephen hunter also uses slang and vernacular very prominently in this novel. His use of the German language in some parts of the book makes the reader feel like he/she is listening to an official German conversation and listening in on history. In some parts of the book, the gem and language actually seems scary in the way they speak, or their slang/idioms.One other literary device that Hunter significantly uses is personification. Hunter highly personifies bullets in this novel. Once, he calls a bullet sneaky, and muscular, thus, using personification to give human-like qualities to a little piece of metal. He also uses imagery to deeply set the mood of a bullet entering the body of a defenseless person that has no idea that they are even targeted. The imagery is very outstanding in this book, as well as all of the literary devices mentioned. I would recommend this book to anyone that is interested in historical fiction, Nazis, guns, or the holocaust time period. I give this book four stars."},{"Title":"Mental and emotional injuries in employment litigation","review":"While we consider this little, the reality is that among the types of health, physical, economic, intellectual, and emotional or psychological, mental health is actually little more than psychological and emotional health. Where men deny their emotions, therefore, it is often conclusory that women are the ones upon whom mental health has been focused, leaving men once again in the desert of health issues. Where women regularly evoke their emotional needs, men seldom do, and society places numerous substitutes to deter, or defer, the issues that come automatically from being human, as if men were robots. Since men spend so much of their lives at work, this necessarily invokes the issues of healthful working environments that properly and appropriately honor the emotional lives of men, and do not treat them as robotic. Astute lawyers will begin to increasingly define the importance of mental health in work and employment issues as they have been forced to do for women (coming into the workplace with all of their emotional clothing). Having long denied males the same privilege, the integration of men and women in the workplace has the potential to overload the human resources department responsible for insuring the collateral issues that confront employees to insure productivity for the employer, and contented employees. Far from being \\"girlie men,\\" the normal acceptance of human qualties is long overdue for men, and any company of social responsibility will jump at the chance to prove its image of \\"valuable work climates\\" for both men and women. This blossoming field of context in connection with both home and work environments, and the nexus of child raising must necessarily become the next giant step for corporations to address their corporate climate as worthy employers. Far from the hierarchial vision of the industrial complex, the 21st Century workplace that incorporates both men and women in positions of responsibility is advised to insure both physical health and mental health for its employees, as well as trying to handle the enormous task of diversity issue that have become one test of humanitarian excellence in a world increasingly complex and interdependent. For companies who ignore this vast area of health issues, they will continue to become the lumbering dinosaurs they must be in an integrated gender world where master/servant relationships and law have ignored the importance of human emotions as mental health. Correctly defining the existence of the whole human being was bound to come sooner or later."},{"Title":"A Descriptive Catalogue of the Etched Work of Wenceslaus Hollar 1607-1677","review":"I have always been facinated with etchings as a form of art and I have been searching for a comprehensive book on the etchings of Wenceslaus Hollar, one of the most talented etchers of the time... perhaps ever. However, when I read the description of the book it was always missing the section on how many illustrations are in the book. I suppose I should have been keyed in by the title... which says &quot;A descriptive Catalogue...&quot;... but I could not imagine it was possible that an art book could exist with no illustrations. So I ordered it... and lo and behold... it is in fact an art book with zero (0) illustrations. Only descriptive text of each of his 2700 works. While I imagine it is important to have such a catalogue for his works, I can not understand who the target audience for this book would be... except perhaps the holder of the collection of the actual art. A book on art, without the actual art, is not interesting to me."},{"Title":"Devil Walk: A True Story [With CD]","review":"A well written book, could not put it down. Conveyed in a very open,honest manner.Mr. Byar's recounts a time in his life which included unbelief and drug use.While on an acid trip, Mr. Byar's encountered Satan himself. Mr. Byar's shares openly with excellent detail his time spent in the presence of Satan, the father of lies and deception. At first glance, one may chalk Mr. Byar's experience up to \\"just some guy on a bad acid trip\\" and read no further. I highly recommend this book be read in it's entirety with an open mind while taking into consideration just how evil Satan truly is and how Satan was able to gain entry into Mr. Byar's mind. Most importantly, Mr. Byar's has emerged from his experience with pure evil to a life now filled with the love of Christ. I have never read a book quite like this. The author writes from the heart with great insight. Quite possibly lives will be changed after reading this book. Some of the best views of our God and Jesus Christ I have ever read. Many concepts of Christ I could not understand were made clear through the writings of Mr. Byar's. I no longer doubt that because of Christ, Satan is already defeated. A CD is also included with the book worthy of a listen."},{"Title":"Devil Walk: A True Story [With CD]","review":"I highly recommend this book! For the non-Christian and Christian alike, it reveals the hopelessness that can consume us when we listen to the negative, destructive accusations of satan. (I realized that this does not have to come through the actual voice of satan, but thoughts that tell us how doomed that we are.) After revealing the game that satan plays with us, we are offered the solutions for hope, peace and a knowing that God has provided life, not death! If you are discouraged, I highly recommend this book. If all is well, I highly recommend this book! It can only enhance your Christian walk."},{"Title":"Devil Walk: A True Story [With CD]","review":"Reading the personal experience of the author shows the power of God in our daily lives as well as reveals the deceiver that Satan really is.

Excellent read that will change how you see God and Satan.

Clint Byars has been through hell, repeatedly. His descriptions are too detailed and surreal to appear fabricated.

Blasphemy is an unpardonable sin."},{"Title":"Devil Walk: A True Story [With CD]","review":"Your Chance to Hear The Last Panther SpeakI have to admire Clint M. Byars bravery on more levels than could be expressed here. So many people have experiences that also are afraid to share them with others, due to the way they think they will be viewed afterwards. And frankly, some that have experiences and don't survive because of that fear and neglecting to reach out for help. The \\"Secret\\" has taken the world by storm. More and more are inclined to believe that everything is connected, and it's backed up with the famous equation, \\"E = MC 2\\" or E equals everything else. Esther and Jerry Hicks \\"Law of Attraction\\" and (The Teachings of Abraham) is also something that perhaps would have been scoffed at by many years ago but is taken very seriously now. I'm not someone knocking on doors handing out bibles but I do believe. Consequently I also believe in the darker side of that and this book has helped me accept some of the experiences I myself have had. You don't have to be a believer to read this book. As stated by someone else here, depression has a voice, and although you might not want to believe it is Satan or his minions, it's pretty obvious to many people that there is a negative force at work in our world and has been for some time, and it is continually attacking. I for one don't like looking at news anymore, and although I know if it bleeds, it leads, there is far too much of it. There are going to be so many people out there that read this book and relate with what he is saying intimately. I know, because I am one of them.

Oh, yes, back in the day when I was a little girl! Later, it reappeared during the days when my children were growing up. And now, it's my grand-daughter's turn to giggle her way into good manners. But that's not why I bought it! I actually purchased it for an 11th grade class I teach! It was just a fun way to introuduce a unit on answering questions. No matter what your reason, you will enjoy the fun scenarios and the helpful lessons of learning to say, \\"please\\" and \\"thank you\\". Maurice Sendak's pictures are just as creative and pleasing in 2009 as when they were when the book was first published. It's a fun book all around and even more affordable now that it's in paperback. Manners can be fun and certainly everyone enjoys a person with good manners."},{"Title":"What do you say, dear?","review":"I only wish I had known about this book when my children were little. This is an excellent book for teaching manners,using lots of unusual situations. The repetition of \\"what do you say dear\\" will engage small minds and is a great book for reading aloud.

The book's format is that on each page there's a humorously farfetched situation (like accidentally walking backward into a crocodile while walking down the street) and asks the reader what the proper etiquette would be in such a situation. The next page holds the answer. My kids (ages 6 and 4) laughed at the silly situations and the hysterical illustrations, but most of all they loved guessing the various answers to the central question, \\"What do you say, dear?\\""},{"Title":"What do you say, dear?","review":"This book tries to teach manners (no idea if it's successful), and avoids being totally condescending and didactic by putting them all in the case of bizarre, childish make-believe scenarios. What do you say when you're walking backwards to town (because you like to do that) and bump into an alligator? What do you say when you're flying your plane and remember the Duchess asked you to drop in, so you do and break her roof?It's silliness incarnate, and you have to love it!There are three scenarios in particular that reviewers have commented on, so let's tackle those.The first is the \\"decapitation\\". In this case you're asked what you say when you're out picking flowers in front of your castle, a dragon appears and breathes smoke at you, and then a knight saves you by chopping off its head. (You say thank you.)There's no blood or anything gory shown, and as far as I'm concerned the princess being saved from the dragon by the knight is a common fairy tale set-up. I don't have a problem with this. There are more violent scenes in both classic and recent Disney animated films, nobody is claiming the dragon was talking and friendly and just violently attacked - I have no problem with this scene for this age group. Let's move on.The next one is where you are a cowboy. Suddenly the bad guy shows up and holds a gun to your head and asks \\"Would you like me to shoot a hole in your head?\\" (You say \\"no thank you\\", which strikes me as perfectly sensible.)This one is a bit trickier. I'll be honest and skip ahead a bit by saying I, personally have no problem with ANY of this book - but in this case I can really see why some people do. The scene is a bit explicit, and the Western is no longer a popular form of drama anyway so it's not like this situation is likely to have come up in your child's play.However, as nobody actually gets hurt, I'd say most kids won't even notice to be upset. There's more violent scenes on cartoons in the morning.And the last one that people have complained about is the one where you're a pirate and have captured a lady and tied her up. Every morning when you untie her to eat breakfast she says \\"Good morning, how are you?\\" and you are supposed to say the same.As far as this goes... meh. Clearly nobody is being particularly ill-treated.Now, overall, I don't mind any of these scenes because I know quite a few children. This sort of thing and more is exactly what they come up with when they're playing pretend. If you think children do not play-act violence you are very much mistaken. They do. They do it because it's exciting. They do it because it's fun to practice being really bad in a safe way that doesn't actually harm anyone, when in real life they work so hard to be GOOD. They do it because these things scare them and playing them makes them less scary. They do because the stories they are exposed to have violence there, explicit or implied, and they want to understand that. They do because you can't have a good story without a villain.And children have been doing this for as long as there have been children to play pretend at all. I do not believe that this is in any way linked to actual violence when these children grow up.Obviously if your child is bothered by this sort of pretend violence, don't read them this book. Or if you are. However, truthfully, I don't think it's that big a deal in this context."},{"Title":"What do you say, dear?","review":"It's the art of understatement that a child learns from this book. The expected response of a young lady bumping into a crocodile would be \\"Eek! Help! Get me out of here!\\" Instead, she says simply, \\"Excuse me.\\" And a pilot who crashes through the roof into a Duchesse's living room says not, \\"Oh my goodness! What have I done,\\" but \\"I'm sorry.\\" It's wonderful to see such self-assured young ladies and gentlemen, able to handle any situation with a polite phrase. They're civilized, courteous, confident, well dressed, poised, articulate, serious (but not too) and able to rise to any occasion. No wonder children love them. In fact, if a dinosaur were to begin nibbling at a tree in my front yard, I should hope to say not \\"Scat!

The four and six year old boys who live next door love for me to play with them, and quite often that means they \\"kill\\" me with their rifles, aka dead tree branches.

We found this book, and I immediately bought it to bring home and read to the children I work with (I'm a preschool teacher). Kids from two years old on up loved this book. They laughed at the ridiculous scenarios and enjoyed guessing what the answers would be.

In each situation, the question comes up: &quot;What do you say, dear?&quot; By the answers that the little boy and girl give, they show that they know proper etiquette and good manners. In this interesting picture book with wonderful illustrations, each page shows the children in a different situation and different historical times. In the first question and answer set, the setting seems to be placed back in the early 1900's. The boy is wearing knickers and a long back overcoat. The car on the second page dates back to the 1920's with the long steering wheel and big thin tires. The next question-and-answer set makes a dramatic change because the boy and girl are now in the Medieval period of history when knights rode horses. In the third and fourth picture, the reader can see the girl as the typical damsel in distress and the little boy is dressed as a knight. He slays the evil dragon and saves the little girl. These are just two examples of how Foslin changes historical periods. I think that Foslin is trying to get the reader to think about, with the use of many different cultural and historical eras, is how good manners withstand time. He suggests that one should always be polite to others even if they are not polite to him/her. Good manners apply to every situation. In &quot;Children's Classic in the Electronic Medium,&quot; it talks about how books are now being read on electronic books. Electronic books bring advantages to children by allowing them to get more out of the readings from elaborate animation and special activities. Problems also arise from the &quot;difficulties of accessing the equipment required to read the book at home&quot; (193). This topic brings up a really important question: Would an electronic version make this book less valuable to children or more pleasurable to read? In the new generation of children, their whole lives are accommodated around films, television, and videos. This can cause a real problem with children reading the classic books in the original print. Many children find the readings long and difficult to understand. With the use of electronic books, children will be able to get more out of the book if there are pictures with animations, sounds, and activities in the readings. Many people hope the electronic books will do is to &quot;bridge the gap between print and other media, and thereby encourage reading in children who are reluctant&quot; (185). I see a great potential for using an electronic version for this classic 1958 picture book. I think that it would be able to enhance the story by using animation that would allow the child to interact in the book. The use of sound and visuals would bring a real excitement to the book and make it come alive. Special activities could also improve the child's understanding and give a big advantage over the original text. What Do You Say, Dear? still has a role for new generations of children. This book can show them good manners that are still vital in today's society."},{"Title":"What do you say, dear?","review":"If you love children, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK.

This should be mandatory reading for all children. It is too much fun to miss."},{"Title":"What do you say, dear?","review":"I am so glad to find this book on Amazon.com! I believe this book went out of print for a few years and was near impossible to find. This was my favorite children's book as a little girl. I used to make my older sister read it over and over again (Actually, I was the little sister, so I couldn't make her. She's just a good big sister.) The illustrations by Maurice Sendak are great, and the story is very witty. However, children will still get a health dose of good manners. I can't recommend this book enough!"},{"Title":"What do you say, dear?","review":"A classic book of manners for children of all ages, using outlandish situations to make the point. You accidentally crash your plane into your friend the duchess's house. What do you say, dear? &quot;Pardon me; I'm terribly sorry.&quot; And so on, hilariously. As some of the other posts note, our little hero is threatened at gunpoint by Black Bart, but since the hero also buys a baby elephant on a street corner and hobnobs with royalty, children are able to recognize this as fiction--they only take with them the laughter and good instruction in proper manners. Thank heavens this book is still in print! Your children will adore it."},{"Title":"What do you say, dear?","review":"This is a cute book on manners. My kids, ages 3 and 4, enjoy the book and request that it be read regularly. This book gives several scenarios and then asks what the polite response is in those situations. You turn the page, and it gives the answer: \\"May I be excused?\\", \\"I beg your pardon\\", etc.The scenarios are really silly, which is probably what my kids like. However, I have not seen them applying the responses to real life situations without my direction, and I think it is because the situations in the book are so humorously outrageous. I know, humor is great for kids and it does make the book enjoyable. It just makes the book hard to apply for the kids I think.It is a little more verbally graphic than what I care for, too, i.e. If someone asks you 'do you want me to shoot a hole in your head' what do you say?So, in summary, it's cute, but not great."},{"Title":"What do you say, dear?","review":"This book as well as The Blueberry Pie Elf were the two books I remember from my first grade experience. When my sister-in-law's baby shower came along with the request we bring a copy of our favorite childhood book, I bought this as The Blueberry Pie Elf is impossible to find. My sister-in-law was tickled pink as she, too, remembered this as a child. And, yes, those of you who cringe at anything approaching \\"violence\\" even in a comedic situation will not find this book acceptable, especially with the question about what to do if a cowboy asks you if you want to get shot in the head, but remember it was a different era when this was written. And since most of us do not have cowboys riding horses wildly down the street while swinging guns around, I think most children will take this in the light it was written. Besides, I didn't even remember this passage until I re-read the book. The one I remember most from my childhood is the one referring to somebody asking you over for a spaghetti dinner and what to say after every course has been spaghetti, and then they bring out spaghetti for dessert. (I'll leave out the answer, as I don't want to ruin the suspense for those who wish to read the book.)"},{"Title":"What do you say, dear?","review":"I love this book I remember reading it over and over again as a child and now am getting it for my children to read.

I would never read such violent text to my 2 year old. And \\"tieing up a woman for my ship\\"?!After reading all the rave reviews on this book from folks saying it brought back \\"such wonderful childhood memories of reading it over and over and over again...\\" -- I now see why violence is rampant in our society now.

Werner because he represents the Warhammer world very well. This follow up to Witch Hunter throws the protagonist Thulmann into a world not only of necromancy and undead (like in the first one), but chaos. And not the nice Slaneesh chaos, but the nasty Nurgle chaos. The web of characters is richer than the first book. If you play the game you will enjoy this tremendously, and if you run the game this is a very good template and has descriptions that can contribute to you creating the depth of the Warhammer world. This is a fast read reflecting the pace of the story so if you're on vacation make sure you have another book on hand. I made that mistake and ended up having to read the back of my shampoo bottle until we got out of the jungle. That'll learn me."},{"Title":"Witch Finder (Warhammer Novels)","review":"This second book of M. Werner's Witch Hunter series once again follows the adventures of the Witch Hunter Thulmann and his less-savory companion Streng, who seem a slightly altered, medieval Sherlock Holmes and Watson (compliments to Sir Doyle). The book picks up right on the tail of the first novel, and though reading the first book isn't strictly necessary, it's highly recommended. The continuity is so direct that not only do all the same heroes make the crossing, but so do all of the villains, as well as adding a few more to each category for good measure.Those additions, while they add some excellent supporting protagonists and fascinating villains, also prove a weakness in the work as a whole. There are too many characters and too many plotlines for each to receive the attention from M. Werner that they deserve. Likewise, the climax pulls a little too hard to bring all of the threads together without taxing the reader's credulity.These flaws aside, the book draws upon the rich history of the Warhammer world, and those looking to add to their knowledge of that fictional universe will be well rewarded. M. Werner's spins an immersive tale with gritty action true to the dark spirit of the setting.In conclusion: an entertaining, enjoyable read, but not as good as the first of the series."},{"Title":"Witch Finder (Warhammer Novels)","review":"This book picks up where Witch Hunter left off. It really helps if you have read Witch Hunter first.The book has more characters and is shorter than Witch Hunter, resulting is some of the characters getting a somewhat sparse accounting and a less focused feel. Still most of the new characters are worthwhile additions.The action is fast paced and the combat at the climax of the book is excellent. Some of the various plot threads are resolved, but plenty are left for the sequel.The writing style suffers from the same problems as Witch Hunter (heavy handed and somewhat overdone), but the pace is so fast it is less noticable.Overall a good Warhammer book, well worth reading."},{"Title":"Six Secrets of Successful Bettors: Winning Insights into Playing the Horses","review":"I have read several 'betting psychology' books and, being something of a skeptic, I expected to come away disappointed by 'Six Secrets'. I didn't/wasn't. Since I've gone from tyro to serious amateur, I know this book will help both. Will it help a pro? I don't see how it couldn't help anyone.Especially useful to me was the almost universal view of those interviewed that, whatever the game (in my case, thoroughbred racing) 'it's one long game'. A winning bet or day doesn't make you a genius, nor does a losing bet or day make you a dummy. Each bet you make is like the flip of a coin: some come up heads, some tails. A single outcome isn't as important as the reasoning which led you to make the bet in the first place. If your overall methodology is sound, if you know why it's sound, if you know yourself and what works (and doesn't) for you, profits should follow. A fair degree of competence at your game of choice is assumed.My biggest knock on the book is with a couple of those chosen for the interviews; I have known one of them and have friends who have known another. I just don't think that they're as expert or as successful as they are purported to be. For me, this came out in their interviews, which seemed weaker than the rest, as if they weren't really speaking from experience. It might just be my take, though.Don't think that this book is just a list of rules and homilies. Many other areas are explored in addition to what I found most useful. After a complete read, I think you'll walk away with a good perspective of what makes a winning gambler.As with most of these self-help books, execution is the hard part...."},{"Title":"Six Secrets of Successful Bettors: Winning Insights into Playing the Horses","review":"Frank R. Scatoni, Six Secrets of Successful Bettors (DRF Press, 2005)So you want to be a professional horseplayer. What's the first thing you should do? Well, okay, the first thing you should probably learn to do is become a decent handicapper. But if you want to take it to the professional level, sooner or later you're probably going to have to do what everyone needs to do if they want to make it big in any profession: network. Talk to the guys who have already made it. Get pointers on how to do so. Maybe talk to some people not in your chosen profession, but related to it, to get some more universal ideas on theory and practice as well.Previously, that step, unless you got lucky and had a pro in your backyard (not out of the question if your home track is Keeneland; if you frequent, say, Anthony Downs, however, you're going to be looking a long time), would have required a good deal of searching, a good deal of groveling (after all, the guy's not going to know you from Adam), and probably traversing the country a few times. A pretty expensive itinerary, to say the least, and you need to keep your bankroll up. But now Frank Scatoni has interviewed a bunch of them for you and boiled it all down into this book, which will cost you a whole lot less than plane tickets crisscrossing the country.Scatoni gets words from some of the best-known professionals in the game, both the pundits (Crist, Beyer, Quinn, etc.) and the guys who've never written a word, but still make their money at the game (Ernie Dahlman, especially, and some players who chose to remain anonymous). He also pulls in a player from the world of baseball betting, a former top Vegas odds-line maker (Roxy Roxborough), some poker and blackjack players, and the like. The end result is a book about why these folks are successful, largely in their own words.You would expect some conflicting and confusing information. That's life; there are many different ways to win this game. Beyer concentrates his play in exactas, Crist in pick sixes. They both make a living betting. One bettor puts twenty grand through the windows a day, another, if I was extrapolating his numbers right, bets in the vicinity of seventy-five million a year. They all make livings doing it. And a lot of what they have to say has been said time and again in books on handicapping, and you never really picked up on it before, did you? Well, give it another shot, and soak up the new info, as well. One way or the other, this is definitely one you want to pick up before quitting your job and going to the track full-time-- or even if you're a Christmas-and-Easter bettor who wants to get a little more disciplined like yours truly. ***"},{"Title":"Six Secrets of Successful Bettors: Winning Insights into Playing the Horses","review":"it kept my intrest , however i expected it to cover more of what type of plays these guys make at the track."},{"Title":"Six Secrets of Successful Bettors: Winning Insights into Playing the Horses","review":"I thought this book lacked focus and detail.

It is then up to the readers to explore in details each of these factors in other books so as to strengthen their horse handicapping and betting skills.As an experienced horse player who have read over 20 books on horse handicapping and betting, I cannot find any more secrets from these successful bettors.

That wasn't his style. He arose above pettiness and thought of his players instead of himself. He wanted them to succeed and taught us that quitting wasn't going to solve any problems for himself or us. He had a Southerner's personal pride, and he showed us that even though life doesn't treat you fairly, you must continue to do your best and make the most of every situation. This is what made the Titans such an outstanding team. A great man doing the responsible thing, with courage and integrity, and then everyone ends up a winner.He made some hard choices, even at his own personal cost, but in the end, he knew in his heart that what he did was right. He was true to himself.This is the lesson we should take from the book, \\" Remember This Titan: Lessons Learned from a Celebrated Coach's Journey.\\""},{"Title":"Remember This Titan: The Bill Yoast Story: Lessons Learned from a Celebrated Coach's Journey As Told to Steve Sullivan","review":"On the surface, you'd be impressed by the record breaking achievements of the team that were highlighted in the movie. Yet what is truly fascinating is Coach Yoast's journey as a person and a leader. What you learn about great leaders is that they are human. They have real experiences that helped them gain valuable insight, which they then transcend to the rest of us. Coach Yoast has done just that. And this book does not fall short of this remarkable man's accomplishments.The author does a fantastic job of drawing out the essence of a wonderful life's journey. In a style truly his own, Steve Sullivan gets right to the heart of the matter; never losing grasp of your attention.I read this book in one sitting. I flipped the last page only to find that I had reached the end of the journey. I realized immediately that although I had reached the end, the lessons and character of Coach Yoast will live on with me for a long long time.Thank you for the inspiration."},{"Title":"Remember This Titan: The Bill Yoast Story: Lessons Learned from a Celebrated Coach's Journey As Told to Steve Sullivan","review":"Remember This Titan, is a wonderful accounting of Bill Yoast's life, ups and downs, the expected and the unexpected. It is the story of a man who LIVED decency long before it was fashionable. The success of the team, both on the field and in their interpersonal relationships, was nurtured by the presence of this fine teacher, leader and coach. In a time when schools go out of their way to emphasize that character counts, this is a fine, enjoyable book to share with the children/students in your life. There are so many valuable lessons, from Mary's impact on Coach Yoast to the profound influence of Raymond Tetfeller on Yoast's young life. This book is beautifully written. It flows with astonishing honesty from humor to heart-wrenching pain. Sullivan has an obvious knowledge, understanding and respect for Coach Yoast. As if all of the above isn't enough, there are action plans and lists of invaluable facts in the back. Remember This Titan is a great read which has had a lasting impact on me. p.s. I had a student at the end of the year say, \\"Hey, Ms. Stewart are YOU reading a football book, cool!\\" Enjoy."},{"Title":"Remember This Titan: The Bill Yoast Story: Lessons Learned from a Celebrated Coach's Journey As Told to Steve Sullivan","review":"Unbelievable leadership.

Read this book and learn what real leadership is. Bill Yoast brings skill, knowledge, and respect for his players to his coaching. He realizes what so few leaders today seem to grasp - it's the leader who needs to adapt. Each leadership task (game) is different. Each player is different. Bill Yoast provides inspiration and instruction to his players. He keeps the goals clear and provides his players with the conditioning and training they need. He doesn't tell his players they are good, he works to make them good. The author, Steve Sullivan, has chosen to give us the story in smooth flowing bite-sized pieces and that works well. Each bite contains a gem of an idea or a rich example that aspiring leaders can and should adopt."},{"Title":"Remember This Titan: The Bill Yoast Story: Lessons Learned from a Celebrated Coach's Journey As Told to Steve Sullivan","review":"I laughed and cried and learned and loved.

I have stayed in touch with him over these past forty years and thanked him for the difference he made in my life. Reading his book, I never knew the trials and challenges he faced and overcame to become the man he is. Every person who coaches kids should read his book and discover that coaching is more than just winning. It is setting a positive example, developing and nurturing the spirit and strengths of your young players that have a life long effect.

This is an easy process to get things done in all aspects of your life. By following the basic points of the book, you can get started today. The book is organized well, and tells a story while teaching you in the process. By implementing the concepts spelled out in The X-Factor, you can get extraordinary results from ordinary people. The nice thing about this is that your people won't roll their eyes, because it is not a gimmick that will go away over time, it is a natural way to get things done and give people more satisfaction in their jobs. Ross Reck has proven that the key to solving the management puzzle is not very complicated. Take a few hours with this book and you will be well on your way to getting ordinary people x-cited about going the x-tra mile to help you, the manager, achieve x-traordinary results. It is the best Leadership book I have read this year."},{"Title":"The X-Factor: Getting Extraordinary Results from Ordinary People","review":"The X-Factor is the most complete and practical management/leadership/motivation book ever written.

In the first section of this book, the notorious Dr Bull, and his co-author Charles Murphy, provide the most detailed look at the Paris Guns ever written. Not only have they examined hitherto unpublished material (such as the manuscript of the memoirs of Dr Fritz Rausenberger, the Paris Gun project director), they also deploy their detailed practical and theoretical knowledge of artillery to fill in those gaps not covered by any concrete (or paper) evidence. Along the way they dispose of several myths, and provide tantalising glimpses of what might have been (plans for heavier, longer-range guns, capable of shelling London from France; and a proposal for discarding-sabot shells). Add to this a remarkable collection of photographs and reconstructions, and one is left with a classic book.The second part covers Project HARP, Bull's attempt to use heavy guns to fire rocket-assisted satellites into orbit. In the final pages, an artist's impression of Bull's projected 32 inch calibre Space Gun illustrates a retrospectively chilling forerunner of Project Babylon, the supergun Bull was building for Saddam Hussein (and which, to scotch any myths, was not the catalyst for Bull's assassination by the Israelis: it was his work on improving Saddam's long-range missiles that sealed his fate).All in all, the definitive book on the technical development of the Paris Guns, and a must-have for anyone interested in the history of artillery."},{"Title":"Paris Kanonen-The Paris Guns (Wilhelmgeschutze and Project Harp : the Application of Major Calibre Guns to Atmospheric and Space Research)","review":"Supergun-obsessed engineer Gerald Bull co-wrote this book before being assassinated by Isreali Intelligence for his Iraqi involvement. Two thirds of the book is a study of the huge guns constructed in France during WWI. The remainder is a discussion of Bull's own HARP program in the early 1960s. The first part is accompanied by B+W photos, while the latter has color photos of the modern equipment &amp; testing. There are also lots of graphs and technical formulae. Probably an important reference for anyone studying this technology."},{"Title":"Paris Kanonen-The Paris Guns (Wilhelmgeschutze and Project Harp : the Application of Major Calibre Guns to Atmospheric and Space Research)","review":"The book was very helpful to research I was doing about the 1918 Paris gun. It is the most authoritative and complete work I have found on the subject. The authors,G.V. Bull of McGill University and C.H. Murphy of US Army Ballistic Lab were uniquely qualified to write this book. German secrecy restrictions after WW 1 about the Paris gun made it difficult to reconstruct the design and performance of the gun. I found all of the information I needed to accurately replicate the calculation of the gun's range and flight profile of the fired shell. The book was sent from Aberdeen Bookstore. It was in perfect condition and had been packaged very expertly. I was very pleased with this purchase."},{"Title":"The Limbic System","review":"This was the classic work on the limbic system when I was a doctoral student in neurobiology. After about 50 pages of pretty intense neuroanatomy on the various areas, the author gets into the real meat of the book, discussing the functional aspects of this important area. Many of the studies concern results from classical ablation-type and electrophysiological experiments.The concluding and final chapter of the book is the most interesting, because here Isaacson proposes a general theory of the limbic system and what it really does. His idea is very subtle--the limbic system is concerned with the selective inhibition of retroactive interference. This means it is involved with an extremely pervasive but subtle aspect of learning. He mentions Lethe, who was the Greek god of forgetfulness. He suggests the limbic system has a comparable role in the overall functioning brain. I thought this was very interesting idea.I have been out of the field for some years now, but at the time I predicted that the limbic system and cognitive neuroscience would become a big area. This was back in the late 70's. I can only say that this prediction was right on, based on what has happened since, what with books like Joseph Ledoux's The Emotional Brain and others having been written since that time.But back when I was a grad student Isaacson's book was the only general survey of limbic system research I could find, and it made for fascinating reading. It was through this great book that I first acquired a detailed understanding of structures such as the amygdala, hippocampus, septal nucleus, cingulate gyrus, and the other important limbic system areas."},{"Title":"Viator","review":"Lucius Shepard, Viator (Night Shade Books, 2004)Lucius Shepard is one of America's most underrated writers by any standards. The man comes out with book after book of gorgeous prose and gets, for the most part, not a breath of press about it. Viator, his latest offering (but not for long; Shepard has two coming out in 2005), continues the trend both of wonderful writing and lack of anything even remotely resembling press coverage.Thomas Wilander, homeless, rootless, and unstable (his own word), has been hired by a Manpower temp agency in Alaska to go out to a wrecked ship called Viator and head up a team of four other men in assessing the value of the wreckage as scrap. Wilander goes about his business, rarely seeing the four other men, and eventually striking up a relationship with the owner of the trading post in the nearest town, Kaliaska. The other man, all of whom have been on the ship longer than Wilander, have become absorbed in obsessions with various parts of the ship (one is fascinated with the formations of the rust, one with the ship's glass, etc). As time goes on, Wilander starts to feel the tug of the ship as well, and becomes absorbed in his own obsessions, while those around him become ever more fearful of his sanity.The book has almost a Heart of Darkness feel to it, though granted the ship here is washed up on shore. Shepard's lush descriptions and deliberate pacing keep the reader always wondering what's just over the horizon, while simultaneously not wanting to leave whatever details Shepard is inking at the time. It's beautiful, beautiful prose, and it demands to be savored.The book's only real letdown is the ending, as other reviewers have noted; the book jumps from Heart of Darkness to The X-Files a little too quickly, and it's likely to jar the unsuspecting reader. Still, there is a good deal to be liked here; this is Shepard doing what Shepard does best, and he does it very well indeed. ***"},{"Title":"Viator","review":"Lucius Shepard is yet another of science fiction's elegant stylists, and a founding member of its cyberpunk movement. Unfortunately he may be the least known, most underrated American writer of elegant fictional prose. \\"Viator\\" is an excellent meditation of madness and love as seen through the eyes of Thomas Wilander, who wonders whether he is losing his mind while living aboard the nearly derelict freightor Viator, now beached permanently in an Alaskan coastal forest. We are thrust into a surrealistic fantastical landscape that's most reminiscent of tales penned by Edgar Allen Poe and especially, H. P. Lovecraft. Wilander finds some solace and love in Arlene, a local resident. And yet, having found reality in the form of Arlene, Wilander still wonders whether the strange dreams he has nightly are visions of his future, and that of the beached freightor. He finally obtains the truth about the ship's enigmatic history from the vessel's mysterious absentee owner. But is this sufficient knowledge enough for Wilander to save his mind, soul, and his love for Arlene? Long-time admirers of Shepard's fiction, as well as those new to it, will enjoy greatly this fine little novel."},{"Title":"Viator","review":"VIATOR is a lovely outing, with some of Shepard's most luminous prose to date. The plot of the novel is reminiscent of Edgar Allan Poe's flawed masterpiece, \\"Arthur Gordon Pym,\\" and like \\"Pym,\\" VIATOR's ending is far from satisfying. But this ending accounts for only 14 or so of the book's 170 pages and in no way dims the lush and illuminant prose that precedes.A gorgeous meditation on how the landscapes of the psyche, of madness, of love, of self-loathing, and--just perhaps--of other worlds can line up in precise moments of synchronicity and violence. One of the few true novels of the sublime to appear in some time: mindful on every page that the purest wonder is always shot through with danger, doubt, and despair."},{"Title":"Viator","review":"Lovely language coasts in long ribbons around a tale of haunting dreams and lonely lives. Five men, formerly homeless, all of Scandinavian descent, find themselves disturbingly bound to their new job. Manpower has sent them to Alaska to assess a grounded freighter for its salvage value. The men pursue this work in ways that Wilander, the latest to arrive, finds nonsensical -- cutting and storing away bits of the ship, inventing new words. The men are reticent, secretive, unwilling to leave the ship, so Wilander acts for them, travelling into town for supplies, where he meets the beautiful and compelling Arlene. But even as Wilander begins to remold his frustrated and directionless life together into what may be a new and stronger whole, his mind is drawn into the spell of Viator and her mysteries. Images appear in the ship's walls, mirroring those his companions have seen. Is the ship's prow moving forward through the forest to a new destiny, or is he losing his fragile hold on sanity? What has happened to the Viator? And if he casts off for the greatest adventure of his life, will he lose Arlene?"},{"Title":"Viator","review":"I am a longtime fan of Lucius Shepard's work but not of Viator. The long drawn out sentences, although perhaps an attempt at atmosphere and tone, do more to cause them to lose meaning than create mood. Too often, the reader is asked to reread a sentence to stay linear to the story. This choice in style is too against the grain of quality writing for me to swallow. As much as I would love to give Viator a solid review, the writing structure is overly tiresome and self-indulgent. It reads much like the absorbed work of undergraduate romantics than that of Shepard's finer work.Those familiar with Shepard will likely find some enjoyment here, but I suggest that those unfamiliar start elsewhere."},{"Title":"Viator","review":"This is a great book and Lucius Shepard's command of the language paints a picture of this world you will never forget."},{"Title":"CLEP Calculus with Elementary Functions (College-Level Examination Program)","review":"The review/essay portion of this book is dry and extraneous.

Flies have been buzzing around for at least 250 million years. There are now some 150 families, with 150,000 defined species. Flies have been studied as long, if not longer, than any similar organism. There have been so many studies that it is difficult for individual researchers to gain a broad perspective on the organisms they study.This book is an attempt to bring together contributions from a diverst group of scientists in a single volume. The book is broken into three broad units: Phylogeny, Genomics and Developmental Biology, and Evolutionary Ecology and Biogrography.In each of these parts, leading researchers have written articles that cover the main areas where research is being conducted. Yeates and Wiegmann edited this collection and contributed one article of their own. The other articles are written by specialists in their particular area and have been peer reviewed by a distinguished panel of scientists. Each chapter ends with an extensive list of references that can be used for further study.This volume is the best single volume work that provides a general overall view of the subject that I've seen."},{"Title":"Southern California Cooking from the Cottage: Casual Cuisine from Old La Jolla's Favorite Beachside Bungalow","review":"Eating at the Cottage in La Jolla is a real treat and I'm just so happy with this cookbook!!

There is no hidden agenda, just the truth, and the truth will set you free. God Bless."},{"Title":"Peace With God.","review":"Written in 1953, this is clearly Billy Graham's best book. It was penned for any person who wants to know how to have peace with God. \\"Peace with God\\" is a term that the Rev. Graham uses to refer to how a person becomes a Christian and a child of God. Becoming a Christian generally involves the following steps:1. Realizing our (mankind's) state of sinfulness and spiritual depravity and realizing we need a Savior.2. Repenting of our sinfulness (turning our backs on sin and the willingness to seek a new life).3. Learning how the death and resurrection of Jesus makes a new life (being \\"Born Again\\") possible.4. Accepting the sacrifice of Jesus and making him the leader and King of one's life.5. Beginning a new life in Christ, receiving his Holy Spirit, and living a life that is pleasing to God by loving others.Billy Graham's book is probably the single best book that explains the above process in detail. The reader learns what sin is, how God's law affects man and its implications for salvation, and what mankind can do through Christ to find a rock-solid secure salvation. People often hear how \\"Christ died for the sins of mankind\\", yet, many people do not understand what this means. Billy Graham makes this very clear chapter by chapter.This is a wonderfully written book and is gripping for the earnest person seeking peace with God. It helped me understand what the purpose of God's Law is, and what significance Christ's death has for every believer. Highly recommended. This book can change your future forever!Jim \\"Konedog\\" Koenig"},{"Title":"Peace With God.","review":"This book by Billy Graham is one of the best religious books I have ever read.

His love and humanity shine through."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Veneration of the Mother of God","review":"If anyone has read any of my previous reviews they are probably a little perplexed over the high rating I gave this book, especially after I was so critical in my reviews of Scott Hahn's book, Hail, Holy Queen, and Fulton Sheen's book, the World's First Love. The reason why I have given this book a higher rating is because I actually agree with much that was said, and I believe the Orthodox have avoided the extreme elevation that many Catholics have granted to Mary. That being said, I would like to analyze the arguments presented in this book and state why I believed many of them were valid. First, many of the arguments presented in this book aimed at defending the Theotokos are arguments that evolved very early in Church history. In fact, many of the things discussed in this book, Mary's perpetual virginity, and her definition as the Theotokos were doctrines that were readily accepted by the Reformers. Therefore, many of the things argued for in this book are not alien to Protestant teaching, but were in fact inherent in Protestant teaching and weren't eschewed until centuries later. I believe that the arguments made in this book that Mary was a perpetual virgin and that Jesus' brothers were step-brothers from a previous marriage of Joseph is not only a substantive argument, but makes sense of the Scriptural data provided.Second, I believe that the idea that Mary is the Theotokos is not only valid but is also a valid development obtained from Scripture. The problem with most arises when this term is translated into the Mother of God which is a loose translation, but is more accurately rendered as she who gave birth to God. The Orthodox regularly refer to Mary by her title Theotokos, and only usually translate it as Mother of God for convenience in dialogue with Western Christians. I am firmly convinced that anyone who objects to such a title is objecting to the idea that Christ was both fully human and fully divine, and is therefore either Nestorian or some other form of unorthodox Christian. In fact, as far as the Eastern Orthodox are concerned the only Mariological dogma taught within the Church is that Mary is truly the Theotokos. This is certainly not a hard idea to accept since it is 100% true.I believe this book is also truthful because Father John truthfully presents why the Roman Catholic dogma of the Immaculate Conception is unscriptural and dangerous because of the way it elevates the Mother of God. If Mary was immune from original sin, than she could not sin out of necessity and not because she chose not to sin. Therefore, the idea of the sinlessness of Mary becomes a theological necessity. In addition, the assumption of the Virgin becomes a necessity because if Mary was free from original sin and not subject to the divine punishment of death, than she could not die and had to be assumed by God into heaven. Furthermore, such a doctrine totally destroys the idea of Mary's cooperation with God in giving full agreement to be God's vessel to bring Jesus into the world. If Mary was immaculately conceived and free from all sin than she had to submit to God's request by necessity and not by choice. Therefore, Mary's obedience to God is decreased in significance and elevating Mary to such a high position is done because she is so different from humanity by nature, and not by choice, submission and obedience.The reason why I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the question of the assumption. I am glad the Orthodox have not defined this doctrine as a matter of faith like the Catholic Church has done. The assumption is a teaching I don't have a problem with in essence, but which I don't readily accept since it is not contained in Scripture and belongs more in the realm of a Church tradition. I understand how one can believe in such an idea and I can rationalize it in my own mind, but I am not fully convinced of it's truthfulness. Overall, I think this is a wonderful little book and gives a brief description as to why Marian devotion is a logical addition to Christological devotion."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Veneration of the Mother of God","review":"Author: St. John of Shanghai and San Francisco (St. John Maximovitch), of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia. Preface by Father Seraphim Rose (d. 1982), noted American Orthodox monastic and theologian.Topic: The proper veneration of the Blessed Mary from the Eastern Orthodox perspective.When St. John died in 1966, he little imagined that this work would be resurrected. It had originally been published in a Serbian church journal in the 1930's. It is a short exposition, grounded in Holy Scripture, Patristics, and Orthodox liturgy (including Vespers and Akathists).St. John does an amazing amout of theological exposition in this short essay. He explains from church history and the sources noted, the role always accorded the Theotokos in Christianity. This includes her full humanity, the fact that she was ever-virgin but not immaculately conceived herself, and that she led an exemplary life. St. John does this in no uncertain terms and with a clean simplicity of faith rather than speculation, legalism, or theorizing.In so doing, he presents the Orthodox refutation of the Protestant failure to give Mary the veneration scripture commands (Luke: \\"for, behold, from henceforth ALL generations shall call me Blessed\\"). He also refutes the Roman church's over-veneration to the point of adoration, semi-deification, and raising Mary to an incarnation of a hypostasis of Trinity and co-redemptrix.In the latter, St. John does a wonderful job of pointing out how, in misplaced love, humans in the Roman church may have actually lessened Mary's stature by attempting to ascribe unto her gifts beyond those given by God.If there's a failing in The Orthodox Veneration of Mary, it's that it could use three more things:a) A good explanation of Mary's intercession--scripturaly--at the wedding feast at Cannae--practically the first thing in the New Testament.b) A good explanation of how the Koine term 'theotokos' really translates into English.c) An explanation of how the Orthodox concept of the fall from grace and sin of Adam differs from the Protestant-Catholic concept of inherited, genetic original sin. This makes Mary's immaculate conception by Joachim and Ann unnecessary.St. John touches these topics--but just barely.Nonetheless, The Orthodox Veneration of Mary remainswell worth reading for Orthodox Christians seeking the explanation of their practice or other Christians seeking to understand the Orthodox Way on this topic."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Veneration of the Mother of God","review":"I read this book in one sitting and really enjoyed it.

Seraphim Rose translated it as the first of a series of archbishop's writings in English.The book is not a work of Orthodox apologetics directed towards Protestants searching for a solid basis for veneration of the Theotokos, as one might think. It is meant for Orthodox Christians to encourage them to more sincerely venerate the Theotokos and to guard against heresies involving her. The book consists of three main parts. The first is an account of attempts made against her veneration by heresiarchs from her dormition through the Jewish slander of her relationship with a Roman soldier, and finally on to the Nestorian and iconoclast heresies which were defeated by the Ecumenical Councils. The second part is a refutation of the Roman Catholic doctrine of the \\"immaculate conception\\", where Archbishop Maximovitch shows that in their zeal to praise the Theotokos, they really strip her of her saintly qualities. Finally, the last part summarizes all of Orthodoxy's hagiographical teachings on the life of the Theotokos.While most of the book seems sound Orthodox theology and will better equip Orthodox Christians to respond to Protestant criticisms and Latin innovations, I was uncomfortable with a reference to the \\"aerial toll house\\" concept, where the soul is beset by demons after death and can only make it through by the grace of God. Most Orthodox consider this a gnostic heresy, and it derives from old Slavic schismatics. While I do think highly of much of the material in the book, I would only recommend it to people aware of the controversy of Rose's views on the soul after death."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Veneration of the Mother of God","review":"This holy man, St. John Maximovitch of San Francisco and Shanghai, has given us a wonderful explanation of the veneration of the Blessed Virgin Mary in the historic Orthodox Church.

He also explains that certain doctrines added to the Christian faith by the Roman Catholic Church, such as the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception, though intended to give honor to Mary, actually dishonor her.

First of all, it was written by one of the most pious men of the 20th Century, St. John of Shanghai &amp; San Francisco.I recommend it to the three major forms of Christianity: Orthodox, Catholic &amp; Protestant because it sets forth the Orthodox Church's understanding of Mary and cleary shows how their views of her are unique. For Orthodox, it outlines the Church's belief and serves as a good, concise explanation. I think it would be particularly valuable for Catholics &amp; Protestants to read though. For Protestants so they don't confuse the Catholic teachings with the lesser known (in the west) Orthodox teachings. For Catholics because they will see why the Orthdox don't believe in certain Catholic teachings on Mary.This book isn't at all meant to be a theological debate book, or one that is intended to divide people.

John was canonized in 1995(?)]"},{"Title":"The Orthodox Veneration of the Mother of God","review":"The place of Mary in the Church is certainly among the most contentious issues along the Protestant/Catholic divide. Thus it is useful to see how the issue is handled by those Churches in the East who have no part in the contentions of the Reformation era. This little booklet written by an Orthodox saint of the 20th century sets in clear and sometimes blunt language the differences between the Eastern and Western approaches to the question of Mary's role in the continuing life of the Church.Maximoviotch begins by covering the history of opposition to Mary's veneration among heretics and non-Christians in the patristic era and the condemnation of their errrors by the Church. Given the most attention are the two issues that most directly involved the Church's veneration of Mary: the Netorian heresy and the Iconclast controversy. In each, the Church sided with those who continued the tradition of Mary's veneration against new opponents of the practice.Even among those who do honor the Blessed Virgin, there is the temptation to add to the honors given to her by God and invent new doctrines that could tangentially lead to considering her on a par with Christ. Such beliefs ascribed by Maximovitch as \\"zeal not according to knowledge\\" include the Catholic doctrine of the Immaculate Conception which states that Mary was conceived without stain of original sin. This was not part of the patristic witness and even the most honored theologians in Catholicism (St. Augustine of Hippo and St. Thomas Aquinas) did not hold it.Maximovitch counters both extremes with the Orthodox ideal of the great holiness of Mary and the proper respect and honor given her by the Church that venerates her without seeking to deify her. In this context the Orthodox veneration is an acknowledgement of the role of Mary in the Church that is reflective of the honors she has already receieved from God.One thing that might be unnerving to some is Maximovitch's unquestioned acceptance of beliefs concerning the life of Mary that are generally considered to be little more than pious legend to the modern world. The translator of the work, Fr. Seraphim Rose, makes a point in the introduction that an Orthdoox Christian cannot pick and choose among the Church's tradition because of modern sensibilities anymore than one should compromise the teaching of the Holy Scriptures to accomodate contemporary sensibilities. It is to be accepted or rejected as a whole.The book closes with the Akathist to the Theotolos - the greatest of all devotional prayers to Mary in the Orthodox Church. This allows us to close this work by seeing the Orthodox veneration in its clearest form and removed from the sometimes arid confines of theological discussion. Orthdooxy, perhaps more than any other form of Christianity is one that has to be seen in practice through the prayers, devotions, and liturgies to fully understand. Although the words of prayers are ceraintly not the same as seeing them prayed (which in turn is not the same as praying them), it allows us to get a glimpse of what Maximovitch has been describing in the previous chapters. Alhough it is unlikely that this book will change many minds, it does give a powerful witness to the honor that has always been given to the Theotokos by the Church."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Veneration of the Mother of God","review":"To give honor to Mary is to give honor to all ladys and to Jesus his son.

This book is a joy to read, largely because it is so spritually refreshing -- in my opinion, one cannot find a better book to begin an understanding of our Mother. After finishing this great book, one cannot help but feel the embrace of our loving and gracious Mother who will be with us always."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Veneration of the Mother of God","review":"I have several complaints about this book. First, the typography was sub-par. I don't know if this was inherent in St. John's original manuscript, but the Whole Work is filled with Unnecessary Capitalization. It seemed like every sentence contained a title, doctrine, or a personal pronoun that was capitalized such as every instance of \\"She\\" or \\"Who\\", or doctrines such as \\"Redemption\\", and titles such as \\"Mother of Jesus\\", \\"Teacher of the Church\\", \\"Her Icon of Hogiditria\\" et cetera. They were everywhere and made for difficult reading. Future editions might want to improve this by minimizing the capitals.Second, the first few chapters introducing the subject make numerous claims about traditions concerning Mary, most notably concerning her dormition, without referencing the sources for these traditions. Considering St. John's concern in later chapters, particular in VI, to distinguish between false and true traditions concerning Mary, it would seem prudent for an editor to add some footnotes to bolster Maximovitch's argument. I am particularly troubled by his insistance on the miraculous transportation of Dionysius the Areopogite to Jerusalem to join the other apostles at Mary's funeral. It troubles me because the Areopogite's position of high esteem in the Orthodox church is largely due to some mystical texts that have been falsely attributed to him. It is well known that these works were written many centuries later by a pseudonymous author and are not original to the Biblical character. In other words, the authenticity of the tradition cited by Maximovitch is called into question by his reference to the Areopagite.That being said, I did enjoy chapter VI, where Maximovitch counters what he sees as the heresies of Rome. Or rather, what I appreciated most were the many references from Sts. Ambrose, Epiphanius, Bernard, and others that breathe some fresh air into the discussion by distinguishing between truthful and fictitious traditions about Mary. I will definetly delve into their works more thoroughly as I seek to pursue this topic in greater depth.Otherwise, there were some good points made here and there about the need to give some level of veneration to Mary if only to safeguard the true glory of her divine Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.In sum, though I did not enjoy the book as thoroughly as I hoped, I think chapter VI was (almost) worth the cover price."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Veneration of the Mother of God","review":"I bought the book expecting to find an Orthodox explanation for the many prayers and praises for Mary that are used in the Orthodox services. The book does not address that and thus fails to live up to it's title, but it is meritorious for reasons other than it's title.Considering the title is \\"An Orthodox Veneration of Mary...\\" hoping to find an explanation from Orthodox/Catholic Holy Tradition for veneration of Mary is not too much to expect, but such explanations are not readily found. For example: that Mary is \\"More honorable than the Cherubim and beyond compare more glorious than the Seraphim\\" simply appear without any explanation of what the origin of the prayers and praises are. Since those are prayers and praises specific to the Orthodox Catholic faith (they are not found in Roman Catholicism), and they are repeated countless times in the Orthodox vigils and liturgies, it would seem a good idea to discuss them in this book. No such luck.What I did find in the book was a pretty good critique of other faiths and dogmas towards Mary such as the Roman Catholic dogma of Mary's \\"immaculate conception\\", the \\"Filioque\\" argument (which really seems out of place in a book of this title), and other heresies.The book is short which helps in it's readability.

St. John Maximovitch has made the exposition of Orthodox teaching on the Mother of God very easy to read. His style is warm and simple to understand--I would have LOVED to be in his theology classes.For the reader who decided that the veneration of the Mother of God is not a Christian, scriptural practice, this book is written from the viewpoint of the Orthodox Church, which, like the Roman Catholic Church, teaches there is not just Scripture, but Scripture AND Tradition. This has been true from earliest times. The veneration of Mary stopped in most Protestant churches because the reformers (especially Calvin, and the German reformers after Luther) threw the baby and the bathwater out.If you want a theological debate this book is not for you, but if you want to know what the Orthodox Church says about the veneration of the Mother or God and you can humbly accept that what St. John says IS the way the Orthodox see it, then this book is definitely for you. You don't have to accept it if you don't believe in it, but you ought to accept that this is the teaching of the Orthodox Church because that is EXACTLY what it is.\\"The Orthodox Veneration of the Mother of God\\" is a wonderful book.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Veneration of the Mother of God","review":"To this day, St. John [Maximovitch] remains a great wonder-worker and intercessor. The biography of his ministry to the Orthodox Church began at Baptism (1896) in a small Russian/Ukrainian village, long before the Bolshevik Revolution began, and ended by reposing in Christ during a pilgrimage with the Kursk-Root Icon of the Mother of God in Seattle, Washington (1966) while serving as Archbishop of the San Francisco Diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church outside Russia (ROCOR).Blessed Serpahim [before monastic tonsure: Eugene Dennis Rose, 1934-1982] translated this text from its 1933 Russian original, and added a 9-page Introduction plus various photographs of St. John and icons of the Virgin Mary. A useful index of subjects and names completes this brief, but popular, 87-page book. Seraphim was converted to Orthodoxy in 1962, and continued to serve under John as his spiritual father (mentor) until the time of John's repose.After John's repose in 1966, Seraphim left San Francisco along with all materials held by the St. Herman of Alaska Brotherhood to take up semi-eremetical life in the woods of northern California. The Brotherhood exists today by the same name as an Orthodox-book publishing house. (It holds the copyright to the book under review.) Boxes of John's untranslated writings went with Serpahim and another Orthodox man to the woods. Among the papers, the two later discovered this 1933 manuscript in a calendar. Comparing the date of the original manuscript to John's biography, its publication in 1933 by the St. Job of Pochaev Brotherhood (Czechoslovakia) occurred just prior to John leaving Belgrade as a newly-consecrated bishop to shepherd the Orthodox Church of Shanghai.Acknowledging conventions of speech required to identify years of birth and death (1896-1966), the Orthodox view of St. John's biography assumes a version of Christian anthropology that might sound unfamiliar to many North Americans and other descendants of western European emigrants now scattered throughout the world.Lack of familiarity requires that I say something about the book's tacit Orthodox context, which the author--then Bishop John--merely assumed that his reader understood to be the vessel of Truth in Christ. To be sure, the book unsettles many readers in the USA and elsewhere who believe that the Holy Scriptures contain all authority essential to Christian faith and order as an irrefutable conviction. However, St. John's ethos in this book adheres to an Orthodox conviction about Christian authority that opposes \\"sola Scriptura.\\"A tacit Orthodox ethos once explicated in a lexicon of sorts, if you will, provides rationale for three words that appear at the start of this review: \\"to this day.\\" Indeed, St. John remains alive and well in the ministry of Christ and devoted to the Mother of God long after his repose. For example, pilgrims to venerate St. John's remains in the basement of the Kazan Cathedral in San Francisco still experience wonders through St. John's intercessions on their behalf.From the Ukraine, John and his parents fled the Bolsheviks to settle in Belgrade (Serbia, former Yugoslavia), where John completed university education in theology at the University of Belgrade. Later John professed Christ as an Orthodox monk (tonsured). Thereafter, having reached the canonical age of 30 for ordinands, John was ordained to the priesthood, and within 10 years was ordained bishop. He left Belgrade on assignment headed for Shanghai (China). In Shanghai he served the duration of the Second World War. Afterward, John fled the Chinese Revolutionaries, under the insurgent army's general Mao Tse-Tung, who were invading Shanghai. In addition, around 5000 Orthodox Christians made the exodus with John as shepherd. Others in Shanghai chose to become \\"new\\" martyrs of the Orthodox Church.In the book's Introduction (p. 16), Seraphim illustrates how John taught theology by interrupting others during his service in Shanghai. For example, he interrupted a catechetical lesson in which a student correctly identified the Prophets' names from the category called \\"minor prophets\\" in Hebrew Scriptures, but John said that in God's eyes \\"there are no minor prophets!\\"John's interruption of the catechism class was said to have rattled the teacher's nerves. Nevertheless, intuitive timing for this classroom interruption combined with early adolescent students perceiving a tte &agrave; tte between bishop and teacher, left an indelible mark about the value of all prophets in God's eyes. Furthermore, the example marks John's simplicity of spirit especially as bishop, by participating in a catechism class and giving students in the classroom that day, as well as us readers through Seraphim's rehearsal of it, a remarkable chestnut to crack in order to consume the meat inside. Why not call it simply parabolic?Archbishop John fostered love and devotion to the Mother of God by way of things he wrote and preached (dogma), and how he revered the Blessed Mother's graphic revelations in scared icons and Holy Scripture (veneration). Consistent with an ancient ethos of \\"doing\\" Orthodox theology, Archbishop John wrote and spoke from the heart of love and delight.During his four years in San Francisco (1962-66), Archbishop John orchestrated building the Diocesan cathedral, which was dedicated to the \\"Joy of all Who Sorrow Icon of the Mother of God.\\" [The original icon has resided within the Annunciation Cathedral of the Kazan, inside the Kremlin, since 2005. In 1920, pious Christians had taken the Kazan icon of the Virgin Mary for veneration by the faithful in exile.] The Kazan icon has been blessed as protector of ROCOR ever since the icon crossed into Serbia in 1920.The archbishop's love and devotion were evident throughout his life. One might wonder how John's superb knowledge about the Theotokos could present the topic with ease and economy of scale. Blessed Seraphim (Rose) remarks: \\"Perhaps most of all one is impressed by the utter 'simplicity' of Archbishop John's writings\\" [emphasis his, p.17]. Not academic or stiff as it could have been from his pen, this book presents images of the Theotokos so sublime that a child can receive them, but scholars might well trip to refute them. I suspect that simplicity, as John's, comes from being sure that what he writes is true plus knowing his subject well.St. John's simplicity in doing theology was foreshadowed by a complex letter that (St.) Cyril of Alexandria sent Nestorius, and to circulate among Nestorian bishops, following the Third Ecumenical Council (431 AD). The Council was the occasion when the assembly adopted a Greek word to describe the mystery of the Virgin Mary in reference to the two natures of Christ. Thereafter, the word would be considered dogma of the Church, so the stakes ran high. However, it was not a new word. After more than two centuries of widespread use except by the Church of Antioch, the Council identified the Virgin Mary as \\"Theotokos,\\" translated Mother or Birthgiver (\\"-tokos\\") of God (\\"Theo-\\"). Opposing the word, Nestorius and many others from Antioch referred to Mary as Christotokos, or Christ-bearer.Archbishop John created a simple way to teach Cyril's complex statement of dogma concerning the Council's use of Theotokos. John reframes the terse rhetoric by Cyril, such as the following:\\"Confessing the Word to be made one with the flesh according to substance, we adore one Son and Lord Jesus Christ: we do not divide the God from the man, nor separate him into parts, as though the two natures were mutually united in him only through a sharing of dignity and authority (for that is a novelty and nothing else), neither do we give separately to the Word of God the name Christ and the same name separately to a different one born of a woman; but we know only one Christ, the Word from God the Father with his own Flesh.\\" -- Letter entitle 'The Epistle of Cyril to Nestorius with the Twelve Anathematisms.'\\"We know only one Christ...with his own flesh,\\" emphasizes not only the two natures of Christ (1st & 2nd Councils) in the child born of Mary, but also grounds these natures in the human experience of the Mother of God. Christ was born of Mary in whose womb his members were formed. Therefore, St. John depicts the Theotokos as one who bears and delivers both natures of Christ. In doing so, John cuations the reader to do the same, \\"...so as not to fall into blasphemy\\" (John quotes from St. Ephraim the Syrian, \\"To John the Monk\\" (p.63).To blaspheme the Theotokos, according to John, would occur if someone were to deny that the Theotokos did not bear the child who was both human and divine, by offering herself to God in obedient service. This point is the core of his book. Stated another way, looking at an icon of the Theotokos in prayerful veneration by repeating blessed hymns from sacred tradition will \\"please\\" the Theotokos, John teaches.Why wish to please the Theotokos, we might ask? According to this ancient belief among Orthodox Christians, the Mother of God was born with the same temptations to sin as the rest of us, an Orhtodox dogma that John discusses on several occasions. But she chose to live her life in perfect obedience to God, which is why she became the new Mother of the human race. By pleasing the Mother of God, Orthodox Christians model themselves by her example in Holy Scripture and sacred Tradition to become perfected in Christ. Thus, pleasing the Mother of God is part of the Mystery of salvation in Christ that St. John Maximovitch discloses in this book."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Veneration of the Mother of God","review":"1 OverviewSt. John Maximovitch, perhaps the greatest of twentieth century saints of the Orthodox Church, known for his gifts of healing and wonderworking, offers this concise guide to the theology and veneration of Mary in the tradition of the Orthodox Church.2 The Early Church's Practice as Described in Scripture and the FathersSince its beginnings, the Orthodox Church has called the Virgin Mary a blessed and great example to all believers of faith, purity, and obedience to Christ. This has been in accordance with Mary's Magnificat, where she proclaims, \\"henceforth all generations will call me blessed\\" (Luk 1:48). The Orthodox Church also praises Mary as \\"highly favored\\" and \\"full of grace,\\" in the same way that the Archangel Gabriel did in the Annunciation (Luk 1:28) (the original Greek charitou being translated alternatively as \\"full of grace\\" or \\"highly favored one\\"). She is praised by the Orthodox Church as filled with God's spirit and fully submitted to God's great plan for the salvation of humanity. This is the continuation of nearly two millennia of tradition, where Mary would be constantly alluded to in the Ecumenical Councils as \\"glorious\\" and \\"holy\\" and the Church Fathers would praise her purity and grace. The Epistle of Ignatius to St. John the Apostle puts it most beautifully when he writes that \\"there is in Mary the mother of Jesus an angelic purity of nature allied with the nature of humanity\\" (The Ante-Nicene Fathers, Vol. I. The Apostolic Fathers).3 \\"Zeal not According to Knowledge\\"3.1 St. John Maximovitch's Defense of the Ancient TraditionYet there are some in Christendom today who take this level of veneration to the next level. They attribute to Mary that which is attributable to God alone: complete purity and sinlessness. St. John Maximovitch deals with this controversy in his book The Orthodox Veneration of Mary, in chapter VI, which he titles \\"Zeal not According to Knowledge,\\" where he argues that the view that Mary was without sin is contrary to Scripture and Tradition.The view that Mary was without sin was formally instituted in the Roman Catholic Church in 1854 as \\"the Immaculate Conception,\\" which holds that the sensus fidelium (\\"sense of the faithful\\") has held to the sinlessness of Mary ever since the beginning of the Church. Concretely, the Catholic doctrine of the Immaculate Conception states that \\"the All-blessed Virgin Mary in the first instant of Her Conception, by the special grace of Almighty God and by a special privilege, for the sake of the future merits of Jesus Christ, Savior of the human race, was preserved exempt for all stain of original sin\\" (Bull of Pope Pius IX) (p. 47). The Orthodox Church, upholding the traditions of ancient Christianity as recorded in the Scriptures, the Ecumenical Church Councils, and the Fathers, concludes that only Christ is without sin. Bishop Brianchaninov spoke for Orthodoxy when he wrote that \\"sin and eternal death manifested their presence in Her\\" (p. 64). St. John Maximovitch, while venerating Mary as ever-blessed, holy, and pure, defends this Orthodox position by gathering together a heavy arsenal to support his case, which is summarized below (page references are to his book; if his book is not cited, I have cited the original source as a further example that supports Maximovitch's ideas). St. John Maximovitch argues that the teaching of the complete sinlessness of Mary:(i) Does not \\"correspond to Sacred Scripture, which states that \\"all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God\\" (Rom 3:23) and that \\"all [are confined] under sin\\" (Gal 3:22). St. John the Apostle (and Evangelist) says that if we say that we have no sin, \\"we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us\\" (1Jo 1:8). These writings all reiterate a doctrine that was infused in the Jewish tradition. Solomon writes in Ecclesiastes that \\"there is not a just man on earth who does good and does not sin\\" (7:20).The Scriptures repeatedly mention the \\"sinlessness of the One Mediator between God and man, the man Jesus Christ (I Tim. 2:5); and in Him is no sin (I John 3:5); Who did no sin, neither was guile found in His mouth (I Peter 2:22); One that hath been in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin (Heb. 4:15); Him Who knew no sin, He made to be sin on our behalf (II Cor. 5:21). But concerning the rest of men it is said, Who is pure of defilement? No one who has lived a single day of his life on earth (Job 14:4). God commendeth His own love toward us in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.... If, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, being reconciled, shall we be saved by His life (Rom. 5:8-10)\\" (p. 57-58).(ii) Contradicts Sacred Tradition. Maximovitch quotes St. Basil the Great, who writes that \\"There is none without stain before Thee, even though his life be but a day, save Thee alone, Jesus Christ our God, Who didst appear on earth without sin\\" (p. 58). Likewise, in the writings of the ante-Nicene Fathers, we find a reference to the \\"only spotless and sinless Christ\\" (The Ante-Nicene Fathers, Vol. I. The Apostolic Fathers, \\"Dialogue of Justin, Philosopher and Martyr, with Trypho, a Jew\\").Several of the Church Fathers of the West, such as St. Bonaventure, as well as other prominent voices in the Catholic Church, such as Bernard of Clairvaux, rejected the doctrine. Bernard has written, \\"I am frightened now, seeing that certain of you have desired to change the condition of important matters, introducing a new festival unknown to the Church, unapproved by reason, unjustified by ancient tradition. Are we really more learned and more pious than our Fathers? You will say, \`One must glorify the Mother of God as much as possible.' This is true; but the glorification ... demands discernment. This Royal Virgin does not have need of false glorifications\\" (p. 56). Maximovitch concludes that \\"the ancient teachers of the Church testify that in the West itself the teaching which is now spread there was earlier rejected there\\" (p. 56).Clearly the giant voices of Christianity have asserted that Christ alone is without sin. Yet one may argue that, although the doctrine of Mary's sinlessness appears to have been rejected by the early church, Holy Tradition is \\"living\\" and the Church's understanding today may be more complete than the understanding of the Church of the first centuries. The Orthodox Church rejects this reasoning. Truth may not change from generation to generation; it may only be clarified. In light of the clear teachings of the Scripture and the Fathers on the sinlessness of Christ alone, it cannot accept that Mary was immaculately conceived or that she was without sin. Rather, the Orthodox Church sings at Pascha every year that Christ alone was singless and, at its funeral services, acknowledges that \\"there is no man who lives and sins not.\\"(iii) Contradicts reason. If it is true, as Catholics say, that it would not be possible for God to enter the womb of a woman unless that woman is wholly without sin, then what are we to say of Mary, who entered into the womb of her mother, who did have sin? If Mary was to be born of sin, then wouldn't it be necessary for her parents also to be without sin, \\"and they again would have to be born of purified parents, and going further in this way ... to all [Christ's] ancestors\\" (p. 59)? The fact that Catholics could accept that Mary, pure and sinless, was able to be born of a mother who was not uncorrupted by original sin, would lead to the conclusion that Christ could also be born of a woman who was not uncorrupted by original sin.(iv) Makes God unmerciful and unjust, because \\"if God could preserve Mary from sin and purify Her before Her birth, then why does He not purify other men before their birth, but rather leaves them in sin?\\" I. 59). It seems contrary to the nature of God, who creates all men and women with the freewill to sin or obey. It may be argued that the Mary as understood by the Orthodox Church as \\"born in the sinful human race but ... \`more honorable than the Cherubim and beyond compare more glorious than the Seraphim'\\" (p. 68) is worthy of greater honor than Mary as taught in the Catholic tradition, since Mary in the Orthodox Church achieved true purity and holiness despite the original sin she inherited.3.2 The True Beauty of MaryConsidering Mary in this way, as having been an ordinary human being who inherited original sin and struggled with temptations, and yet rose above the flesh in an extraordinary and exemplary way, becoming a pure example of holiness, is a far more beautiful and more honorable conception than a view that attributes sinlessness to her by removing from her the struggle of original sin. Is there not something more praiseworthy of one who inherits the disease of sin and yet boldly overcomes it through daily faith and obedience? St. John Maximovitch sums this up beautifully when he writes \\"There is no intellect or words to express the greatness of Her Who was born in the sinful human race but became \`more honorable than the Cherubim and beyond compare more glorious than the Seraphim'\\" (p. 68).4 Conclusion: the True Beauty of the GospelSome may object to the conclusions herein stated: for how can God, almighty, perfect, and everlasting, become united and born into a woman who was stained by original sin? How can the perfect and immortal God touch what is ordinary and sinful? Yet indeed, the very beauty of the Gospel and of God's unlimited Grace is expressed in the humbling of a perfect, holy, and immortal God, through a great and profound mystery, to the level of man through His incarnation, in order to offer man a living example of perfection, and, through taking on death, to free man from sin and death. God could use a woman, an ordinary vessel, to accomplish His great plan attests to His power. Although it does not seem logical or possible to our ordinary human reasoning, it reminds us that \\"what is impossible with man is possible with God\\" (Luk 18:27).For a more thorough discussion of this topic, treating not only St. John Maximovitch's book, but also other books and Scriptural references, see my blog entry at [...]"},{"Title":"The Orthodox Veneration of the Mother of God","review":"St. John Maximovitch (1896-1966) of the Russian Orthodox Church does an amazing job in writing a book for the laymen, wether young adult or adult, tecaher or student, on the veneration of Mary, the Mother of God. He effectively deals with why Mary is called the Mother of God and the Nestorius controversy which climax at the Third Ecumenical Council and why denying Mary has Mother of God (Theotokos) also denies the full humanity and divinity of Jesus Christ.He also deals effectively with the ever-virgin position as espoused by the Orthodox Church and he does so using scripture and building a concise and logical argument (ch. 3).He also speaks to the dangers of putting more on Mary than is revealed in the sriptures and early Church history. He speaks to the errant teaching of sophia/marianism as espoused by a minority of Orthdoox Chrsitians such as Sergei Bulgakov aswell as the errant teachings of Latin/Rome theolgy of c0-reemptress. Of course, much of the book, by teaching what Orthodox affirm about Mary, counter the gregious erros of Prottetsant theologies about Mary and their lack of following the Biblical mandate.While I do have some minor disagreements with the presentation of the material and not citing enough sources, this book works extermely well as a work to aid teh Orthodox Christian in learning more about Christ, Mary and why blessing her is important and how to give one's who do not understand Marian doctrine an answer."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Veneration of the Mother of God","review":"St. John Maximovitch was a truly special figure in the 20th century Orthodox Church. He bore his sufferings with love and patience. To this day his memory and relics are venerated.

The combined effort of these two holy men merits, and perhaps even demands, one's time and careful consideration."},{"Title":"The Orthodox Veneration of the Mother of God","review":"I bought this book, thinking from the description it could give some sort of Biblical foundation for offering Prayers to Mary. The author, who is supposedly a master Theologian, doesn't do that. Instead, he merely reiterates Orthodox Church teaching on the subject. For instance, he says the 12 Apostles were transported from various parts of the world to be present at Mary's death...simply because the Orthodox Churches teaches this, and therefore you have to believe it. There's really no argument for the worship of Mary, other than the Orthodox church says to do it. I was unconvinced.But in a way, it did answer my question: Is there a Biblical foundation for praying to Mary. The answer is no. So for that, I gave it 2 stars."},{"Title":"A Portfolio Management Approach to Strategic Airline Planning (Europaische Hochschulschriften Reihe V, Volks- Und Betriebswirtschaft)","review":"Portfolio analysis, the titular subject of the book, is a well-known strategic technique, but in all probability few academics in the field of management and few practitioners and industry observers would have such detailed knowledge about the managerial technique as that displayed by the author, Mike L. Thomas. Arranged in three parts and seven chapters, the book's Part One, &quot;Theoretical Research,&quot; is made up of an introduction and overview, a literature review and definitions, and a conceptual framework for strategic decisions. The framework is based upon contingency theory views. Part Two, &quot;Empirical Research,&quot; discusses managerial aspects of international air transport services. In addition, it provides a detailed description of the field study results. Part Three, &quot;Applied Research,&quot; explores different models for strategic portfolio analysis as they are applied to airline planning, and offers concluding remarks and suggestions. Its probably best known version in the literature on strategic management is the BCG growth-share matrix. Thomas's discussion of the advantages and problems of this matrix is the best that I have read. Equally commendable is his review of the refinements of the growth-share matrix, as well as other models for strategic portfolio analysis. Overall, the author demonstrates that portfolio management may create the necessary context for stimulating innovation and help solve the industry's most critical problem, namely, its inability to match supply with demand. One of the author's findings was that in most of the airlines he surveyed, executives were preoccupied with pressing operational issues, with tactical management, so that strategic issues were generally ignored. He found that most airlines in his surveys do no strategic planning in any formal sense. They rely on financial planning, based on budgets. In conclusion, this book on portfolio management as it applies to strategic airline planning is admirable. Notably, the book includes both a very extensive reference list and a quite useful glossary of terms."},{"Title":"A Portfolio Management Approach to Strategic Airline Planning (Europaische Hochschulschriften Reihe V, Volks- Und Betriebswirtschaft)","review":"Thomas' book is a particularly timely and valuable contribution to the development of more effective strategic management of air transportation. The objective of his research effort was to improve the implementation of the concept of portfolio management as an instrument of strategic planning in the commercial airline industry. The book proves that this objective has been reached and offers guidelines for an effective (rather than an efficient) management of commercial airlines. The work is well organized in three parts (theoretical, empirical and applied research) and very well written, thus easy to read. Based upon his excellent knowledge of modern management literature, the author developed an &quot;integrative management framework&quot;, which consists of the systems approach as part of contingency theory. This holistic approach secures a solid framework for the empirical research and allows comprehensive conclusions on the management trinity (policy, process, people, i.e. culture). The research method consists of intensive semi-structured interviews with higher level airline executives. The survey is not representative for the entire industry, but it offers extremely interesting patterns of management practices and allows the development of relevant strategic guidelines. The author sees the limits of the portfolio management concept and, therefore, his findings are convincing that, under certain conditions, this instrument is very useful for the management of strategic issues which benefit from visual presentation. The author offers with his book not a solution but a better management of international airlines in turbulent and competitive markets. Overall, he shows a way how to build a strong corporate sector in a service industry and in society in general, without cutting costs and manpower. Today, this is the most important contribution to the theory and practice of business management."},{"Title":"A Portfolio Management Approach to Strategic Airline Planning (Europaische Hochschulschriften Reihe V, Volks- Und Betriebswirtschaft)","review":"The review for this book from &quot;a reader from Taiwan&quot; seems to have been copied from a review I wrote for a research journal, Annals of Tourism Research.

Thus, the dichotomization of entire cultures as either individualistic or collectivistic has been found to be too simple a characterization.\\" ~Susan Harter, 'The Construction of the Self: A Developmental Perspective,' p. 308This is a tremendous book based in logic, research and understanding of developmental psychology. The conclusions drawn are based in empiric research data and theory. The book should be required reading for all psychologists and professional counselors, or those working in other social service positions. I particular enjoyed the section on autonomy and connectedness as dimensions of the self, or polarity that individuals and groups of humans expand and contract upon. So ideas based in extreme polarities, about gender, culture, individuals, or groups, such as countries, are not accurate under examination.Of particular interest to me is the chapter on the effects of child abuse on the sense of self. A person who has undergone severe abuse does not successfully proceed through the developmental stages and certain elements of awareness, such as will (what the author refers to here as \\"agency\\"), are unable to develop and therefore absent in this person. It is as if the person, due to an onslaught of terrible experiences beyond their control interferes with their ability, leads to dissociation which prevents self-awareness (an individual must be grounded in the body and in present time for awareness to develop) and disrupts normal development.One of the coolest parts of this book, if you can read it and synthesize the contents, is the \\"mapping\\" of the milestones and roadblocks to the self-development, or expanding awareness, of the individual. All in all, this is a fascinating and well-written book. I hope this book is available for Kindle soon, so I can add it back into my library.

At first I fell in love with it, it's all of that which contemporary writer's such as Iris Johansen or James Patterson will NOT give you perhaps not even in of their writings, although to be honest although I do happen to love this book very, very much for the essence of it it does grow a bit lukewarm for my palate. It's probably the manner in which her vocabulary is so extended it forces me to look up words very often or how I am so unaccustomed to her, she gives you things to read which very few writer's offer and the manner in which she speaks it is so profound, nonetheless I've only read it through once and Im absolutely positive I'd love to read it again getting the hang of it a bit more. Just as someone said in some other review of a Virginia Woolf novel: she isn't to be read in 10 minute intervals, give her your time entirely and then you'll see how rewarding it is. Perhaps that's why people don't write like her anymore: Our society doesn't make the time for reading such works of art, all they have time for is bubble-gum-like James Patterson type fiction (and I probably should've made more time to enjoy it more thoroughly, too).

Simply inspiring."},{"Title":"A Room of One's Own","review":"I really didn't know much about Virginia Woolf until 2005, when I ended up living with a dear friend who taught at a local college. Like most folks, I knew Woolf was a writer of the early 1900s and I'd seen the movie \\"The Hours\\" and that was the sum total of my knowledge.One day, my dear friend handed me this book and said, \\"You'll like this.\\"I was intimidated. After all, it's Virginia Woolf and only really smart people can read Woolf's writings. But I decided to read what I could and glaze over the rest. I ended up tucking myself into bed with this book every night and reading it again and again and again.Yes, Woolf was a Victorian-era writer and the prose is thick and heavy-laden with Victorian verbosity, but her powerful writing style shines through the complicated sentences and nuanced lexicon.My very favorite part in this essay, originally delivered to college students, was where she wrote,\\"...moreover, it is all very well for you, who have got yourselves to college and enjoy sitting rooms of your own to say that genius should disregard such opinions; that genius should be above caring what is said of it. Unfortunately, it is precisely the men and women of genius who mind most what is said of them.\\"After reading that, I felt that Ms. Woolf had reached through the decades and touched my very soul. For so many years, I struggled and struggled and struggled to stop caring what people thought or said about me and that single statement uttered and recorded by this amazing woman changed my life forever."},{"Title":"A Room of One's Own","review":"This is a testament to writers everywhere. Write, write, and write is what you must do to become published, but you must have your own space to do so. Virginia Woolf's testament to that resounds just by the fact that her writing has survived various generations to still be read today."},{"Title":"A Room of One's Own","review":"\\"A Room of One's Own,\\" published in 1929, is an expanded essay combining two papers which author Virginia Woolf presented in 1928 at Newnham and Girton Colleges, the only women's colleges at Cambridge at that time. In this dissertation on women and literature, she discusses the various obstacles facing women involved in the creative process, and stresses the importance of financial and social independence for females. I think this is probably my favorite essay by the author, and one of her finest, most accessible pieces of writing. It is important to note that her interests did not lie particularly in the areas of politics and feminism, but solely on art itself and the freedom to create it.Ms. Woolf argues that the reason there were so few prominent, highly respected women authors before the twentieth century is because most women had not led lives conducive to creating great art or literature. She posits that there was no actual body of notable women's literature because, in the past, women did not have the education, the income, the privacy, the experiences of travel to broaden their world, or the time to write. Dominated by men throughout history, females have been denied access to education, independent travel, and to publication. Without an independent income, women are totally dependent upon men.Women are responsible for bearing children, and in almost all cases have the primary responsibility for bringing them up. Few have the luxury of hired help. Although rewarding in many way, child rearing allows for little privacy, independence and solitude, prerequisite conditions for writing, painting or composing. If privacy is non-existent, interruptions block creativity. Ms. Woolf clearly states that what a woman needs is a room of her own and a guaranteed fixed income in order to write noteworthy fiction. Here she challenges women to become economically self-sufficient in order to acquire the necessary intellectual freedom to create outstanding literature. Virginia Woolf believed that the remarkable, the momentous, could be found amongst the mundane details and occurrences of everyday life. She encourages women to write about all of the \\"minutely obscure lives\\" which men have ignored, and about themselves, their feelings and their reactions to the world around them. I believe the author's great novel, \\"Mrs Dalloway\\" reflects this mindset.Aphra Behn, (1640 - 1689), was the first female writer to earn her own income from writing. After John Dryden, she was the most prolific dramatist of the Restoration. However, she achieved her place in literary history for her pioneering work in prose narrative. Ms. Behn paved the way for 19th century novelists like Jane Austen, George Eliot and the Bronte sisters, who were able to write in their family sitting-rooms or libraries, despite their lack of independence and privacy. Woolf wrote/spoke: \\"All women together ought to let flowers fall upon the tomb of Aphra Behn, which is, most scandalously but rather appropriately, in Westminster Abbey, for it was she who earned them the right to speak their minds. It is she - shady and amorous as she was - who makes it not quite fantastic for me to say to you tonight: Earn five hundred a year by your wits.\\"Ms. Woolf quotes Sir Arthur Quiller-Coach, a Professor of Literature who wrote: \\"The poor poet has not in these days, nor has had for two hundred years, a dog's chance...a poor child in England has little more hope than had the son of an Athenian slave to be emancipated into that intellectual freedom of which great writings are born.\\" Ms Woolf goes on to state that obviously this noted professor believes that intellectual freedom depends upon material things. \\"Poetry depends upon intellectual freedom. And women have always been poor, not for two hundred years merely, but from the beginning of time. Women have had less intellectual freedom than the sons of Athenian slaves. Women, then, have not had a dog's chance of writing poetry. That is why I have laid so much stress on money and a room of one's own.\\"A good part of \\"A Room of One's Own\\" analyzes the patriarchal British society that so limited a woman's opportunities. Woolf theorized that while male authors write about women and allow their heroines to \\"shine like beacons\\" in fiction, in reality women were often treated like slaves, not free to choose their own mates, and frequently beaten by their husbands and fathers. She goes on to say that men historically belittle women as a means of asserting their own superiority. She uses the metaphor of a looking-glass relationship, men, threatened by the thought of losing their power, need to reduce women to enlarge themselves.The androgynous ideal, the writer with an androgynous mind, where a writer uses both parts of the brain equally, is also championed here. \\"The androgynous mind is resonant and porous; it transmits emotion without impediment; it is naturally creative, incandescent and undivided.\\" This is a fascinating proposition which Woolf explored more fully in her 1928 novel \\"Orlando,\\" a fantasy set in the Elizabethan court, tracing the career of the androgynous protagonist from a masculine identity to a feminine identity.Woolf constructed this essay as a partly-fictionalized narrative to make her points vividly. She invents an imaginary female narrator, a talented contemporary novelist of some potential. Unfortunately, because she lacks models and a tradition to draw on, our narrator is a hundred years away from being able to develop her gifts fully, to \\"be a poet.\\" A fictional historic character is introduced, Miss Judith Shakespeare, the very gifted sibling of Will, in order to illustrate the sorry fate of highly intelligent, creative women in the past. This device is extremely effective in bringing home the difficulties of talented women living in the traditional world.I highly recommend this extraordinary long essay to both men and women - to everyone interested in the creative process. It is a brilliantly written, perceptive thesis.JANA"},{"Title":"A Room of One's Own","review":"This essay taken from a lecture that Virginia Woolf gave to students in England during 1928 is an essential reading for writers and feminists alike.During the 1920's women writing literature were still struggling for a voice without prejudice. Virginia Woolf emerged as one of the first feminist voices ready to speak out against the silenced history of women writers and historians. In this book she argues that any woman serious about writing must have 500 pounds per year and a room of her own in which to capture a few moments of silence and restore her voice back to power without the pull of all her \\"womanly\\" responsibilities. Woolf seems to believe that one of the only true literary voices, one that wrote without anger, fear, or prejudice was Shakespeare and that his works have lasted because of the extension of this idea. Woolf discusses Br&ouml;nte and leans towards a woman writing with anger the seeps forth in her words and of Austen she expresses appreciation for what she must have endured in order to publish her works in a male dominated industry. Woolf clearly criticizes writer's that allow their gripes to appear in their works rather than their true talents. She appears hopeful that the future holds another Shakespeare and that inevitably it will be a woman who writes so extraordinarily this time around.Woolf shows herself to be one of the first true feminists our society had during her lifetime. She unabashedly criticizes a society dominated and silenced by men who felt it their duty to protect women from their own fear. Her critique of professors who openly claim women to be inferior is turned towards them as men concerned instead with being superior. She insists that the enlargement of men like Napoleon and Mussolini as well as the many wars society has experienced is purely because the light that is contained within women has been allowed to be dimmed by male domination. Woolf is saddened and disgusted by the fact that history and literature represented women so poorly in the past refusing to offer a woman as being anything more than a lover to a greater man. She also indicates that the suffrage movement probably contributed towards males feeling challenged by something far inferior to their inflated superiority. Her words are quite strong for a woman of her era but also fairly futuristic in thought.Woolf writes of many intelligent guidelines for any writer in this book. She offers a suggestion that one should write with an androgynous mind allowing both the softness of the feminine and the power of the masculine to come forth in words. A writer must not fear another's opinion but instead believe so forcefully in one's words that criticism cannot cause dishonesty of talent. And of course she is resolute in the fact that a writer needs a room of one's own to come to his or her center and in order to bring forth greatness without prejudice."},{"Title":"A Room of One's Own","review":"Oh, this was VERY good.

She ponders the plight of women during her time and through history. Her main question asks why women, despite even those with exceptional talents of intelligence and character, have been abused and dominated by men and relegated to roles as mothers and servants to the men around them. Why are there not great female financiers, writers, academics, etc.? Or why are there too few of them? She searches in many corners such as history books and makes deplorable discoveries: early teen marriages, beatings, restrictions of all sorts, and despicable opinions of women in general by academics and men in other stations. In one instance she compares the plight of Shakespeare and his sister, both equally talented, and you can imagine the results. Her musings are gripping and interesting and at the same time she paints the quality of her physical surroundings quite vividly. This is a favorite book."},{"Title":"A Room of One's Own","review":"Woolf's &quot;A Room of One's Own&quot;, a collection of papers Woolf delivered for the literary societies of Girton and Newnham in 1928, stands as an all-time classic of the feminist movement.The thesis of the essays consists of the simple statement that womens' literature would be on par with that of men, if women had had the same levels of income, privacy, and experience as their counterparts. Woolf's main illustration of this principle was a hypothetical sister to Shakespeare, who, even with the same talents as her brother, would have never had the chances to display her talents to the world.This book is actually rather apolitical, dealing directly with the arts. It is very positive, and is not accusitory towards men. It is straightforward and brief, and brings its point across quickly. For its time, it was an excellent and radical short work, but over the last 70 years it has lost some of its relevance to the modern reader, as its thesis has gradually been proven true."},{"Title":"A Room of One's Own","review":"Susan Gubar writes the excellent introduction to this lovely annotated version of Woolf's A Room of One's Own. Even those who have read this book before will enjoy reading a scholarly annotated edition--the notes and introduction provide valuable insight into Woolf's life and times, and the specific conditions against which she rebelled."},{"Title":"A Room of One's Own","review":"Her argument goes: \\"Intellectual freedom depends upon material things.\\" The intellectual freedom of writing books, good books, depends on a person's ability to acquire income and to have their own space, undisturbed and unashamed. Virginia Woolf suggests that she is an amateur in this matter, and, due to her lack of formal education, finds it difficult to properly research the topic. However, she proves herself competent in making a coherent argument that is convincing, though her conclusions are no longer very surprising. It is difficult to argue against her, to say that women, who have had substantially lower incomes than men and have faced many stigmas and prejudices are not disadvantaged in producing works of literature or art or in making intellectual contributions.As I said, her argument is no longer new. Most people probably do not have to read this book in order to agree with her main thesis. But she does make a few interesting points about the role of women in literature and what the effects of increased freedom for women might be. For the method of the argument alone this book has value: \\"...one cannot hope to tell the truth. One can only show how one came to hold whatever opinion one does hold.\\" She does not ask you to agree, but only to understand why she thinks what she does."},{"Title":"A Room of One's Own","review":"Critics might agree or disagree with Virginia Woolf, based on the degree to which they perceive her as threatening or unstable.Whether Woolf is portraying a feminist view or not in her \\"A Room of One's Own\\"; she is outstandingly candid and honest about the way she's perceiving life.I agree with a few great points that Woolf raised for example:1. As Woolf puts it in her own words: \\"intellectual freedom depends upon material things\\". No one who's financially dependent can have the freedom to explore any intellectual versions.2-One of most Woolf's fascinating opinions is her view of the subjective nature of truth. When a subject is highly controversial, no one can actually tell the truth, but simply defend her or his opinion and how they arrived at their opinion. Each person's reality simply depends on the circumstances and experiences they encountered, therefore, no reality is absolutely objective.In that way, Woolf insinuates that all the truth she presented in her book is questionable, just a very interesting way of dealing with any controversial matter.I strongly disagree that these points or ideas apply only to females. I think, they apply to every human being, but because of Woolf's own experience as a female, I believe she had to apply them to only females."},{"Title":"A Room of One's Own","review":"This may be a longer essay than many may be used to reading, but it is worth reading! It is brilliant! That is practically the only word I can describe it by. Some of her best work/thoughts and quotes on literature is in this essay. If you are a fan of Virginia Woolf, you must read this. If you are just starting to read her writings, this is a great introducion to her work. If anything it will make you want to read more of her writings( which is exactly what happened to me after I read this!) !"},{"Title":"A Room of One's Own","review":"Written in the late 1920's this long essay/book continues to be fresh and pertinent. The cause of feminist equality has improved somewhat in the intervening years but is still falls shamefully short of full emancipation.As Woolf so eloquently puts it, a woman needs money and a room of one's own. And it is still a rare woman who has both. Her use of the imaginary tale of Shakespeare's sister and her \\"feminine\\" fate still has weight and packs a significant punch of truth.The other significant factor that Woolf does not touch on in this essay is time. The weight of child rearing, housework and domesticity still falls heavily on women. There has been some movement with men being involved in that area but the movement is very, very slow. Added to that, it is a rare woman who does not have to work and bring income into the household.Woolf continues to speak with honesty to the issues of feminism and women over the intervening bridge of years. This book still resonates. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Room of One's Own","review":"I read A Room Of One's Own three years ago and I still remember it such a great book, it's interesting and helped me to reconogize on me a hidded writer woman.

The problem with it today is many people uses this work only as a vindicating feminist weapon, while few people has truly read it, but remember, Virginia Woolf wanted that room not for itself, but for a finality: to do an intellectual task inside. Some people forgets this fundamental fact."},{"Title":"A Room of One's Own","review":"I found it tedious to read in spite of the high literary reputation and ability of Virginia Woolf.

Since I was planning to hand her A.S. Byatt's Possession (my pick for the best book that I read in 1993), she felt that it would take three books to make an equivalent trade, and I agreed to the terms.I had seen part of a dramatization of this essay once, and had heard many references to this work, so it was about time that I read it for myself (one of these days I'll pick up Heart of Darkness in the same vein). I'm happy to have done so, for now I understand where Shakespeare's sister and Chloe likes Olivia falls into the scheme of the argument. It's nice to note that the state of women's writing has improved tremendously since this was originally presented. As a man, I like to see this same argument now as genderless--that is, the room and the money that one needs to support oneself is necessary to any writer, no matter what gender."},{"Title":"A Room of One's Own","review":"After having read several books by so-called feminist writers I have decided for myself that Woolf is one of the greatest. A Room of One's Own is not only valuable for female writers, but for all women trying to fulfill their dreams. What I find interesting about Woolf is her ability to make her essay become so much like fiction, and thus, easier to read for many people. I am truly impressed by Woolf's work and would like to recommend her to those who are a little curious about what she has to contribute!!"},{"Title":"A Room of One's Own","review":"Virginia Woolf in her best form - personal but not self-centred, concentrated and ready to fight for what she believes is right. This long essay gives her views on the position of women in literature but offers also an overview of their role through centuries - from the imaginary Shakespeare's sister to her contemporaries. A must read for all readers regardless of sex!"},{"Title":"A Room of One's Own","review":"Woolf's argument that \\"a woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction,\\" holds true not just for fiction but for any activity a woman wants to pursue. The early 20th century essay is still widely relevant, and not just in developing countries.On the reading style, this essay is much more accessible, compared to say \`Mrs. Dalloway' and \`To the Lighthouse'. Reading it felt like having a conversation with someone who was not just erudite, but also reflected some of my own thoughts and beliefs. Especially as I believe that economic independence and resource availability could be key to overturning the notions of sexual inequality.Many thanks to Woolf for airing these thoughts and inspiring the rest of us."},{"Title":"A Room of One's Own","review":"One cannot think well, love well, sleep well, if one has not dined well.~Virginia Woolf, A Room of One's OwnVirginia Woolf's very intense A Room Of One's Own, is actually a long essay she wrote \\"with ardour and conviction\\" on the the topic of women and fiction, that she prepared when asked to speak about this subject at women's colleges. A Room of One's Own was published in 1929, when young women were still discouraged from attending college (due to genuine fear that a good education would make women unfit for marriage and motherhood), and although it's not angry in tone the essay reflects a society in which severe limitations were put on women and their achievements. Virginia Woolf speaks about the creative process that lead to her talks, of her notebook in which she recorded a multitude of ideas, thoughts, and mental meanderings, and writes about the train of thought that led to her conclusion, that \\"a woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction\\". In A Room of One's Own Virginia Woolf grapples with what is exactly meant by women and fiction (not a simple matter), and demonstrates and expresses the complexity of her thought in her trademark stream-of-consciousness writing. Defying conventions of the time, she talks about the actual food served at the luncheon party, of the soles and partridges and potatoes, and of the importance of food to the artist in a more general sense. She discusses numerous things in this full, layered essay of her thoughts, among them a sense of loss due to the war which began in August of 1914, that changed the underlying current of life--previously filled with music and poetry, with romance--and of the special difficulties women artists face (still relevant today!). Her message is simple (though the means is not), that women must have money (a fixed income) and a room of their own (privacy) in order to have the freedom to create, luxuries that men may take for granted. She imagines Shakespeare's \\"sister\\", equal in talent and genius, but because of her sex, never writes a word, never expresses her genius, never lives to old age because she takes her own life in quiet desperation. Her essay is meant to encourage young women, to inspire them to create, as she's sympathetic to their plight. In A Room of One's Own,Virginia Woolf wants the limitations removed, and for women to have the same intellectual freedom that men have had for centuries, so that they, too, may express their genius.(This is a passage slightly modified from my blog about books, Suko's Notebook, suko95.blogspot.com, which I invite you to visit.)"},{"Title":"A Room of One's Own","review":"This book is very short and it expresses brilliant logic that I have not seen for a while. Virginia Wolf writes her case about women and writing. What it takes to be a woman artist and remain one. She argues very carefully, that woman artist needs means (read: money) and a room of her own where she can express herself without any interruptions from the outside world. While many male counterparts of her times argue that women have no character and are inferior to men, Virginia asks question on how come that almost two tousand years ago, Greeks were writing literary work that described women like: Cleopatra, Medea, Clytemnestra and Electra? These powerful female images have no characted and power? Anyone who read classics knows it is far from that. Virgina also argues from the works of early British female writers such as: Lady Winchilsea, Margaret Newcastle and Aphra Behn, that finest poetry was created by a women of noble birth married into a noble families. These women were educated, cultured, most had no children and had very understanding and supportive husbands or were single. They were lonely creatures who produced valuable work. Women of lower birth and less education, such as Jane Austen and Bronte sisters, were talented, but they wrote about the world they new about: middle class that was all around them. They were social observers who wrote in the crowded living rooms about people that were part of their own world. In addition, they did not produce poems, they produced novels primarily. Virginia argues that only the most perceptive of women are capable of producing remarkable poetry. She also draws similarity that it was male writers from the upper classes that created masterpieces. The exception was Keats, who was poor but who also dies young - since writing is exhausting both physically and emotionally. But she also argues that the finest of male voices who dedicated their lives to writing has sort of sensitivity that is unique to women. So the true writer is never he or she, it is a mix of both sexes. This is one of the most powerful feminist books I have ever read and I admire Virginia Woolf for having a courage to create it and share it with the public."},{"Title":"A Room of One's Own","review":"The inoffensive feminist tone of this text should not confine it's readership to the predominantly female. It is indeed from that point of view interesting,valuable and easy reading,accessible to both male and female readers alike.But outwith the political undercurrants, the precise and poetic delicacy of the writing provides not only a pleasure for the reader but potent advice for the aspirant writer.If one needs look for further justifications as to the significance of these essays, then it could be viewed as an historical viewfinder, not of only sociological relevance, but also the evolvlution of modern literature.

After all, it's Virginia Woolf and only really smart people can read Woolf's writings. But I decided to read what I could and glaze over the rest. I ended up tucking myself into bed with this book every night and reading it again and again and again.Yes, Woolf was a Victorian-era writer and the prose is thick and heavy-laden with Victorian verbosity, but her powerful writing style shines through the complicated sentences and nuanced lexicon.My very favorite part in this essay, originally delivered to college students, was where she wrote,\\"...moreover, it is all very well for you, who have got yourselves to college and enjoy sitting rooms of your own to say that genius should disregard such opinions; that genius should be above caring what is said of it. Unfortunately, it is precisely the men and women of genius who mind most what is said of them.\\"After reading that, I felt that Ms. Woolf had reached through the decades and touched my very soul. For so many years, I struggled and struggled and struggled to stop caring what people thought or said about me and that single statement uttered and recorded by this amazing woman changed my life forever."},{"Title":"A Room of One's Own","review":"In \\"A Room of One's Own,\\" Virginia Woolf explores the topics of feminism, individuality, and financial independence.

The book is supposed to be about women and fiction, but it offers so much more--acute observations on literature, disparities in society between sexes, interity of writing and activity of reading. Her writing style is fluid, beautifully and flawlessly transitions between facts, observations, thoughts and insight. Her criticism is sharp and poignant but without bitterness, self-pity, or arrogance, so inviting into her intimate thoughts. She has a great ability to use hypothetical character, such as Judith, Shakespeare's sister, and to use examples--Jane Austen, Coleridge-- so creatively without causing any distraction. This book satisfies her own standard, \\"One must strain off what was personal and accidental in all these impressions and so reach the pure fluid, the essential oil of truth\\".

It is also a plea for the liberation of women, and their full entrance into the world of Literature. Woolf argues that a woman needs financial independence, a room , that is a space of her own, if she is to be able to truly create. She also needs the kind of access to everyday life that women confined to hearth and home were as she sees it, traditionally denied.She urges that Woman enter into all fields of writing, and develop in directions they had no opportunity to develop in before.She also perhaps reflecting on her own experience and nature argues for the androgynous nature of the creator, seeing in Shakespeare, Keats and certainly Proust a strong feminine element.Woolf anticipates and perhaps in some sense helps creates the vast flourishing of Literature written by women which will come in the decades after her."},{"Title":"A Room of One's Own","review":"Woolf's book is a treatise in examining what is holding women back from writing their best fiction. She tells of the hindrances of women's fiction writing throughout history, and also tells of the well-known parable of Shakespeare's sister. Painful at times, but telling the truth without falter, Woolf's book should be read by all fiction writers, feminists, and anyone who has suffered oppression."},{"Title":"A Room of One's Own","review":"I have read much of what Virginia Woolf wrote, and this has to be my favorite.

As Woolf notes, \\"Coleridge perhaps meant this when he said that a great mind is androgynous.

But A Room of One's Own, a very long essay about feminism, independence, writing, and becoming one's own person, is actually quite readable, quite educational, and quite wonderful. The reader, at least this one, feels she's in the presence of a great mind at work as it ruminates on and on about these topics in a somewhat rambling but engaging personal reflection.

Unlike a sad number of feminist writers, Woolf does not make the mistake of tearing down the accomplishments of men in order to make room for those of women. Indeed, she speaks eloquently against just that danger throughout &quot;A Room of One's Own,&quot; which is partly what allows it to stand not only as a feminist classic, but also as a classic piece of both literature and literary criticism. It is not often that an essay reaches creative heights great enough to establish itself equally as a work of art and an intellectual effort, but Woolf has done it here.

It is when this fusion takes place that the mind is fully fertilised and uses all of its faculties.\\" Based on this criterion, Woolf promulgates her own canon of English male writers, a canon which includes Shakespeare, Keats, Sterne, Cowper, Lamb, Coleridge, and Proust (who \\"was perhaps wholly androgynous, if not perhaps a little too much of a woman\\").\\"A Room of One's Own\\" is, in sum, a fascinating, thoughtful and perceptive essay on women and fiction written by one of the Twentieth century's most formidable writers and thinkers, a woman who truly succeeded in creating a room of her own in the canon of modern English literature."},{"Title":"A Room of One's Own","review":"Virginia Woolf is a writer of intelligence and grace. A Room of One's Own is a skinny little treasure of a book with words and wisdom that will stay with the reader long after it is read. The essay contained in the book is the result of two papers that Ms. Woolf read to the Arts Society at newnham and Odtaa at Girton (England) in October of 1928. She was asked to speak about the topic of \\"Women and Fiction\\", and after doing so, she expanded her papers and later published them as this book.Woolf begins the essay by writing, \\"I soon saw that [the subject of women and fiction] had one fatal drawback. I should never be able to come to a conclusion. I should never be able to fulfil what is, I understand, the first duty of a lecturer- to hand you after an hour's discourse a nugget of pure truth to wrap up between the pages of your notebooks and keep on the mantelpiece for ever. All I could do was to offer you an opinion upon one minor point- a woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction... At any rate, when a subject is highly controversial- and any question about sex is that- one cannot hope to tell the truth. One can only show how one came to hold whatever opionion one does hold. One can only give one's audience the chance of drawing their own conslusions as they observe the limitations, the prejudices, the idiosyncrasies of the speaker.\\"It is in this straightforward and honest manner that Woolf writes about women and fiction. Although the speech was given and the book was published in 1929, all of its points are still important for women- and especially women writers and artists- today. In A Room of One's Own Woolf examines classic literary works of the past and wonders why most, until the 19th Century, were written by men, and why most of the works published by women in the 19th Century were fiction. She comes to the logical conclusion that women in the past had little to no time to write because of their childbearing and raising responsibilities. There is also the fact that they were not educated and were forbidden or discouraged from writing. When they did begin to write, they only had the common sitting rooms of Elizabethan homes to do so in, which did not provide much solitude or peace of mind, as it was open to any interruption and distraction that came along.Woolf argues passionately that true independence comes with economic well-being. This is true for countries, governments, individuals, and writers, especially female writers. Without financial security it is impossible for any writer to have the luxury of writing for writing's sake. It is also a very inspiring book for any aspiring write to read. I end this review with Virginia Woolf's own hopes for women in the future:\\"... I would ask you to write all kinds of books, hesitating at no subject however trivial or however vast. By hook or by crook, I hope that you will possess yourselves of money enough to travel and to idle, to contemplate the future or the past of the world, to dream over books and loiter at street corners and let the line of thought dip deep into the stream.\\"(If you liked this review, please read my other book reviews under my Amazon profile...)"},{"Title":"A Room of One's Own","review":"I was terrified when I found out that I had to read this book for my women's studies class because my mom told me that Virginia Woolf was like James Joyce stylistically. When I actually started reading A Room of Ones Own, I was pleasantly surprised by the intimacy and smoothness of Woolf's writing, and her clear logic compared with the rigidity of &quot;the old boy's club.&quot; She offers a simple, well thought-out argument for why a woman needs financial independence and a room of her own in order to achieve what men can achieve artistically and academically. The depressing part about A Room of Ones Own is a lot of what she writes about the status of women today compared to that of men is still true."},{"Title":"A Room of One's Own","review":"70 years have passed since the first publication of &quot;A Room of One's Own,&quot; and yet we have not seen as many dramatic changes, let alone improvements, in social mentality as early feminist thinkers like Virginia Woolf wished to provoke to establish women's new role as equal to men's. She argued that the reason why there was no female Shakespeare is not that women are biologically inferior to men but that there was simply no &quot;room&quot; for women to develop themselves, both metaphorically and realistically speaking. Therefore, in this book she encourages women to have a room of their own and a stable income to ensure a career. However, women, in the past as well as the present, have long been &quot;grounded&quot; by men. For a woman to have a room of her own and a stable income means that the woman is invading (from male chauvinistic viewpoint) men's territory, and this kind of behavior (and thoughts) is not to be allowed in male-dominated societies.Early feminist thinkers like Virginia Woolf provided later generations with iron-cast proof (as far as I'm concerned) that women are no &quot;second sex&quot; by pointing out the false discriminations men put against women for men's own convenience. (Ironically, I see men suffer as well from doing so.) Thinkers like Virginia Woolf provided &quot;rooms&quot; to develop feminist thoughts, and these rooms also provoke controversies and debates because feminist way of thinking is revolutionary. At any rate, there would be no improvements of women's role in society if there were no Virginia Woolf and other first-wave feminist thinkers.At the end of the twentieth century, in spite of the burgeoning &quot;industry&quot; of feminism, the real condition of women appears to be quite depressing. The real condition of women goes like this: &quot;During the last decades women's representation in education has grown enormously but so has our [their] participation in low paid and part-time work. So that, for example, the percentage of women in German higher education has doubled yet the degree of confidence German women express for women in non-traditional jobs is one of the lowest in Europe...,&quot; and &quot;similarly feminist literary criticism has created a lively and substantial body of work in the last decades but continues to exist in a hostile and often marginal academic place.&quot; (&quot;A Reader's Guide to Contemporary Feminist Literary Criticism&quot;, 1994: 290) One cannot fail to see (if one is willing to open his or her eyes) that we have made just a tiny bit of progress since the first-wave feminism. There is room for improvement, indeed, but people's ignorance of women's real position in society, women's subordinate educational, economical, and political conditions, and the overall social status of women being secondary, must first be recognized. In this sense, Virginia Woolf's &quot;A Room of One's Own&quot; appears to be especially inspiring.In my opinion, feminism is not only for or about women, it is also for and about men, because the world is composed of both sexes, and men suffer (without understanding, because of stupidity) from the traditional, male chauvinistic attitude as well. What is important is that feminist way of thinking is a breakthrough, revolutionary philosophy that challenges the way we perceive the world for centuries. &quot;A Room of One's Own&quot; opens my mind's eye; it is, no doubt, a classic that must be read."},{"Title":"A Room of One's Own","review":"I had no idea who this woman was, other than a generic realization that she was a writer of the early 1900s. Many months ago, my life fell apart and I ended up living in a friend's home while I sorted out the pieces of my messy life.One day, my dear friend handed me this book and said, \\"You'll like this.\\"I was intimidated. After all, it's Virginia Woolf and only really smart people can read Woolf's writings. But I decided to read what I could and glaze over the rest. I ended up tucking myself into bed with this book every night and reading it again and again and again.Yes, Woolf was a Victorian-era writer and the prose is thick and heavy-laden with Victorian verbosity, but her powerful writing style shines through the complicated sentences and nuanced lexicon.My very favorite part was the top of page 60. After reading that, I felt that Ms. Woolf had reached through the decades and touched my very soul. If you're a writer and a sensitive soul (as I am), you'll understand when you read it. :)Next semester, I'm teaching a course on writing and plan to quote Ms. Woolf extensively. This book will be well used and recommended to my students. And I highly recommend it to you, too.Roseauthor, The Houses That Sears Built"},{"Title":"A Room of One's Own","review":"Ah, Virginia! Never is she more charming or likeable than when she writes this book. This is a very important book nowadays, I think, when a lot of women who have gained a lot from the feminist movement are now saying &quot;I'm not a feminist&quot;, perhaps because the word is now associated with aggression and intolerance. Let's not get into that argument! But anyway, A Room of One's Own, is cool because it makes you feel good about being a woman, and it highlights so gently and kindly and humorously the biases that may exist in your own mind and in society around you about what women can and can't and should do. I read somewhere that VW was motivated to cheer up young women who seemed so depressed. It works! I don't know what other people think: is there irony in the way she talks about how women must flatter and please and be charming to get their way; and then she herself is so flattering and charming in this book? I don't know. I learnt a lesson, though, about how to argue. I wish VW were alive. I've wanted for years now to contact her and say thankyou, and then to tell her how things are going these days."},{"Title":"A Room of One's Own","review":"In this book, Virginia Woolf explores the following thesis: \\"Intellectual freedom depends upon material things. Poetry depends upon intellectual freedom.\\" Writing at a time when, as she herself stated in her diary, writing was not a respectable occupation for women, Woolf showed great courage in propounding this profoundly simple, pithy book.The book began as a lecture which she prepared for a girl's school. Asked to lecture on the subject of women and fiction, she determined to propound her theory that financial independence was necessary for the creation of genius. In her way of thinking, women throughout history may have had genius, but were never given the opportunity to develop it, being always dependant upon men for their social and financial standing. She urged women to earn their own living through writing; to break free of these social and financial constraints. However, in speaking out against the male-dominated intellectual scene, she did so without anger, without acrimony. Her usual good humor and simplicity, found so clearly in her diary and letters, shine throughout the book, making it invaluable not only as a social statement, but also as a precious insight into her personality. She is in turn serious, playful, mocking, and tender.A Room of One's Own is not so applicable today as it was seventy-five years ago, but it is still valuable as an historical document; as a moral boost for aspiring young women writers; and as a further insight into the character of Virginia Woolf."},{"Title":"A Room of One's Own","review":"A Room of One&iexcl;s Own is an essay, which is &iexcl;based upon two papers read to the Arts Society at Newnham and the Odtaa at Girton&iexcl; in 1928.Virginia Woolf, an advocate and speaker for women, gives a really good and important lesson to females. She challenges the norm and tradition of the patriarchal society. By questioning the phenomenon of the society, Woolf clearly points out the insufficient opportunities for women and the deprivation of talented women in different ways, especially in education and work. For the essay, Woolf invents Shakespeare&iexcl;s sister, Judith, and tells us the life of Judith. She shows us that society overlooks the talent of women; thus, a lot of intelligent women are not recognized in the world. She urge people to open their eyes, take a serious look at women and praise them for their talents.The other important message that Woolf brings to women is about freedom and the ways to strive for it. Adequate income and a room of one&iexcl;s own are the two essential factors for a woman to earn freedom. These basics can free women from getting nothing but children. Women can have more choices besides staying at home and doing housework; life will be different if one has her own space. I think Woolf&iexcl;s Essay is indeed a timeless lecture for every woman. As a woman, I think we should use our knowledge to strike for freedom and opportunities for ourselves and our next generations, just like Virginia Woolf challenges the norm and system of the society."},{"Title":"A Room of One's Own","review":"When I read this book the first time I was enthralled. We really take for granted the position our mothers and grandmothers worked so hard to ensure for us. I forget how close in time we are to when women couldn't vote or attend male universities.Virginia Woolf was provided a room of her own to be able to create the work that has become so influential in twentieth century writing. In an ideal world everyone would be allowed to artistically express themselves without having to be in the &quot;real world.&quot; I know that since I graduated from college and have been working 40-50 hour work weeks, I am less inclined to read or write. I don't feel like I can let that be my excuse, though, just because it would be easier to write if I could spend all my time doing it. The request that women have money and a room seems very upper-middle-class and out of touch with the way life was even in Woolf's time.In spite of those criticisms, I am so glad I read this book. It made me feel empowered as a woman and a writer. This is a must read for anyone trying to understand the history of feminism."},{"Title":"A Room of One's Own","review":"Virginia Woolf was asked to give a talk about Women and Fiction in 1928. The talk eventually became this book. Woolf shows very convincingly how women have found it difficult to be taken seriously in the world of literature. Her famous suggestion that women can only play a full part in writing if they have an income of five hundred year and a room of their own - with a lock on the door still holds good today though the amount of money needed would be larger. She provides some examples of how women's talents were just not taken seriously and they were regarded as totally inferior to even the most mediocre man.I found it interesting that she thought the best writing is androgynous and could have been written by either men or women. She accepts that women may write differently from men because they are aware of different aspects of life because of the way society is organised. Jane Austen wrote about what she knew as did George Eliot. They are disparaged because they deal with everyday life whereas men write about the outside world because that is what they know. Could Tolstoy have written \`War and Peace' if he had been female? Woolf thinks not.Woolf's overall thesis is that the world of literature needs both masculine qualities and feminine qualities. She does not want to downgrade the achievements of men because she believes the world needs both. The example of Shakespeare's sister is a telling one even though Shakespeare's writing is androgynous. Writers need to use both sides of their brains and personalities which echoes Jung's ideas that men have a feminine side just as women have a masculine side - wholeness comes from using both sides.This book is well worth reading for its writing style alone and for its humour. This is not a feminist tract by any means but it does make some very valid points about how women were still treated in the nineteen twenties even though they had the right to vote."},{"Title":"A Room of One's Own","review":"Woolf, in her poetically rambling way, manages to navigate through numerous subjects, including but not limited to: a history of women writing fiction, their male counterparts, the literary merits of both sexes, the dual-sexed nature of the brain, the limits placed upon women in society and to hold property, thwarts the critiques of men who dismiss the contributions and characters of women, and mediates over walks, meals and cigarettes. While she takes an indirect course, a characteristic of her fiction, she hits upon her thesis throughout: to be an artist of any merit a person needs a room to write in and a source of income; without both the artist is hard-pressed to have the time and energy in which to create. She notes that this holds true for men as well, holding up a number of authors we have long canonized who were not only from wealthy families, but highly educated; things denied women throughout most of history. What is most enjoyable is her dry humor that peppers the text, and I wish her fiction contained more of it. I would recommend reading Orlando in conjunction with this; not only does it explore the same themes of art, sex, gender and the evolution of women, but it does so with the same level of humor. It is also her most accessible work and the \\"love letter\\" to her lover, Vita Sackville-West, is a warm and sensual novel."},{"Title":"A Room of One's Own","review":"Virginia Woolf always blows my mind with her ability to marry illustrative, vivid paintings and academic writing. I often find that she makes a clear conclusion that I have previously arrived at independently, but could have never materialized or verbalized successfully. I will always have a room of my own!"},{"Title":"A Room of One's Own","review":"There it was, sitting high on my daughter's bookshelf, still, as I see it, while she is half a world away. What many consider to be the modern primogenitor of feminist literature, written long before Betty Friedan'sThe Feminine Mystiqueand even before Simone de Beauvoir'sThe Second Sex (Vintage). Virginia Woolf, in the 1920's, was nailing the central problem: to produce (and we're not talking more kids, Wolfe was talking literature) women needed a bit of space, as is implied by the title, and the all-important separate income (500 quid, on an annual basis, at a time before the ravages of inflation would make that figure insufficient even for a month.) I have read the other two books, polemics if you will, so why not start at the beginning, finally, when I am, well, a few years beyond the high school period when my daughter read it? She has managed to also \\"take the path less traveled,\\" and so there is that additional fillip: perhaps a voyeuristic one. What part did the many passages she underlined play in that decision when reaching the fork: Oh, the less traveled one looks more suitable?Virginia Woolf was a founding member of the Bloomsbury Group, a literary association that was prominent in what we now call the inter-war period. She did have periods of mental instability, which culminated in the taking of her life, by drowning, as the Second World War was in its early phases. Parts of that instability may be reflected in the somewhat erratic nature of these essays; but rest assured, when she is \\"on,\\" she is really \\"on.\\"Woolf packs a lot into not much more than 100 pages. She starts at Oxbridge, and the serene peace of the quadrangles of these two universities in the ultimate month: October. How were they built? First, it was the age of faith, and the kings and lords poured money in, to erect an edifice to defend their position in the social hierarchy. Then it was the age of reason, the old order undermined by its own wealth. Yet that era had a passage also, as Wolfe says: \\"When the guns fired in August, 1914, did the faces of men and women show so plain in each other's eyes that romance was killed? Certainly it was a shock (to women in particular with their illusions about education, and so on) to see the faces of our rulers in the light of shell-fire. So ugly they looked- German, English, French- so stupid.\\" She notes that it was only 48 years before that wives could possess money in their own name. In the next chapter she is off to the British museum, to read about women, in books that men have written, dyspeptic men, who, Wolfe speculates: :\\"Had he been laughed at, to adopt the Freudian theory, in his cradle by a pretty girl?\\" Further, she notes the sad human tendency of seeking reassurance of one's worth by knocking the value of others. As the author says: And how can we generate this imponderable quality which is yet so invaluable, most quickly? By thinking that other people are inferior to oneself. By feeling that one has some innate superiority- it may be wealth, or rank, a straight nose, or the portrait of a grandfather by Romney- for there is no end to the pathetic devices of the human imagination - over other people.\\" As for women in this game: \\"Women have served all these centuries as looking-glasses possessing the magic and delicious power of reflecting the figure of man at twice its natural size.\\" Acerbic, yes.No question too that Woolf is erudite. A take-away for me is that I should read the essays of Charles Lamb. In the third chapter she posits the literary fate of Shakespeare's \\"sister.\\" Why did both George Eliot and George Sand adopt male pseudonyms? She addresses that also, along with the works of Jane Austen and the Brontes. Mary Carmichael, to whom Woolf also devotes much ink has, alas, slipped into obscurity.Wolfe can be repetitive, and clearly the following insult at Oxbridge rankled, since it is expressed throughout: \\"Fellows and scholars only allowed on the grass! Ladies not admitted without a letter of introduction!\\" The solution also surfaced a few times: \\"...that it is necessary to have five hundred a year and a room with a lock on the door if you are to write fiction or poetry.\\"And my daughter? Still seeking the \\"essential oil of truth,\\" which was not merely underlined, but placed in a box, and in the process acquiring the two essential ingredients along the path less traveled: the room and the funds to sustain independent thought. And I, well, should have read this book much earlier in life, so only the old saw about better late is now available. 5-stars."},{"Title":"A Room of One's Own","review":"Keeping in mind the date these lectures were delivered, her biographical details, etc. this is now a totally enjoyable piece. It is wonderful seeing a writer put into practice what she suggests regarding good writing while she does it. It is also easier to see the hilarity of the event. Some of the lines must have been absolutely hysterical for the audience! Critiques written by her contemporaries, both pro and con, also seem interesting. I must confess the author I thought of right away was JKR writing her Harry Potter books - famously with sleeping child in tow at a coffee shop. No room of her own or 500 pounds either! (At least to start.)But what's in a room? I interpret this as a metaphor. There is more going on here than meets the eye. 500 pounds must have been sufficient money to live in comfort - that is, no worries. So one can concentrate. One has time to read and think. That is the point of that. Perhaps also the security of knowing what one chooses to say is not liable to cause a break in one's future security. Perhaps that is one point she makes regarding Jane Austen. So the central issue here is still very much a serious matter - and certainly not just for women. I take it to mean that one must be capable of such reflection as well as have the means to reflect. Of a more contemporary note is the issue of how many books we ought to have. Perhaps VW saw no potential for there being too many. Today with self- publishing via social media there comes a point when figuring out priorities is absolutely necessary. For example, how many people are going to read this? These essentially become my notes so I can easily access my basic thoughts having read the book regardless of where I am. But what value might these have for someone else? We cannot read everything. Much of what is written today might be self-reflection on the part of someone just starting out on life's journey. Unless you are a teacher or otherwise have an interest in that young person, reading their work could even be painful as well as a waste of time. So an education of some sort becomes a requirement. Where would we be without the guidance we received so that we had hints regarding the comparative worth of literary works? Harold Bloom anyone? But this book is also a pleasure to read. Perhaps we can spend some time reading just to enjoy ourselves."},{"Title":"A Room of One's Own","review":"She rambled around a bit but made some very important points about women, and writing inside the traditional male-driven hegemony. While I thought it could have been better written without such a stream of consciousness that she throws upon us, she makes some very important points. Near the end of her essay are a few sentences that I think synthesize nicely much of the syllogism she conveyed:\\"Intellectual freedom depends upon material things. Poetry depends upon intellectual freedom. And women have always been poor, not for two hundred years merely, but from the beginning of time. Women have had less intellectual freedom than the sons of Athenian slaves. Women, then, have not had a dog's chance of writing poetry. That is why I have laid so much stress on money and a room of one's own.\\""},{"Title":"A Room of One's Own","review":"This was an incredible work, mindblowing and provocative, putting intense subject matter and scope into a very short little account. Of the work I've read so far in 2010, it does the most with the least space, giving a fundamental feminist branching point for reflections on literature, politics, war, culture, family, psychology, the academy and identity. This final element is particularly effective, providing a rich understanding of how conditions of patriarchy determine not just power, not just social roles, but the very self. Starkly, this account delves into the scope of such politics, in framing how self-regard and the regard of others. Woolf perceives and expresses very clearly that men and women both have twisted psyches from the power disequilibrium, and some of her most resonant passages are the musings on why exactly the entrenched male intellectual elite show so much passion in denying female publications. Across the work there are areas where Woolf is no longer as applicable, where she reflects on conditions in our day that are substantively changed for the better. But this is far from total, and a lot of this writing still rings very true. That's not exactly a positive reflection on the state of our world ninety years later, but it makes this piece still a vital piece of thought for policy brokers and regular citizen here and now.Perhaps the area Woolf most impressed me was her thorough understanding of how systemic realities and power structures work. Long before historians had really started taking cultural history seriously or understanding the role of discourses in positioning individuals, Woolf paints a clear understanding in the feminist context. Specifically, her question of what would happen to a woman of literary genius in a society where she cannot express herself poses some stark look at structures, while her answer (probably go insane) reveals again how fundamental this type of control is, how non-negotiable basic equality should be to avoid this kind of intergenerational anguish.In addition to Woolf's effectiveness in analysis of many given topics, there's also a great energy and value to the way she moves from one angle of focus to another. There's apower fluidity in here that reflects both the power of her thought and the inherent interconnectivity of the issues she faces, women's place in literature leads smoothly into the cultural changes of Britain since the war, which leads to reflections on basic power distribution and the scope of nature. What the question ultimately returns to, and what Woolf powerfully voices, is how widespread the power gap is between men and women, how much the later have been abused, coerced and silenced, and how intolerable this situation is. Woolf's writing is self-consciously a record of main themes of that oppression and a challenge against it.In a more minor note, it's a bit surprising to encounter repeated references to Mussolini as the archetypal figure of masculinized, militaristic fascism. Pre '33 that makes sense, and works as a reminder on how rapidly political symbols of evil and violence can shift in global vocabulary.Similar to and better than: Woolf's Three GuineasSimilar to and worse than: Butler's Gender Trouble"},{"Title":"A Room of One's Own","review":"Virginia Woolf in her best form - personal but not self-centred, concentrated and ready to fight for what she believes is right.

Certainly, Woolf's mastery in writing should be applauded on its merit; however, I am not progressed far enough in my education to fully appreciate Woolf's subtleties. There is nothing in A Room of One's Own that remains once the book is closed, although the pages are full of wonderful ideas.

It's timeless and poetic.I came to this book as part of a book club, the DFW Literary Society. It was a pick by my Mother who grew up in Ranger, Texas not too far from the origins of John Graves journey on the Brazos river. Graves felt the need to embark on a 4 week adventure float to say goodbye to the condition of the Brazos pre- plans to dam up several sections as it meanders its way from the headwaters in New Mexico through Lubbock and on to the Gulf of Mexico. After Graves wrote this, some of those dams have gone in...Lake Grandbury and some of them have not. What we are left with is a truly unique work of fiction as Graves blends poetry with a wilderness of sorts adventure with regional history with a philosopical view of the people that inhabit and are drawn to the river. Quite simply put, the book is fascinating.Graves goes out with a canoe, a weiner dog only referred to as 'the passenger', some supplies, fishing rods, a gun or two...and lives off the river and small convenience stores he finds along the way. His semi-stream of consciousness style may take some intial getting used to but the poetry of the language he uses draws you in. He stays with locals along the way seeking out those in the know about the river's history and weaves those tales in with historical events between the Comanches and the settlers in the exact places he visits. I'm not sure there's another book like it.If you are a Texan, 'Goodbye to a River\\" is a must read. If you have ties to West Texas...even more so. If you love nature and are halfway concerned that it is preserved in a responsible way, also, you must read this. If you don't fall in those categories, I'd recommend you too read it as there is so much richness in language and place in this book. There are so many good quotes to choose from that I'll try to pick out a representative few, \\"If a man couldn't escape what he came from, we would most of us still be peasants in Old World hovels. But, if, having escaped or not, he wants in some way to know himself, define himself, and tries to do it without taking into account the thing he came from, he is writing without any ink in his pen. The provincial who cultivates only his roots is in peril, potato-like, of becoming more root than plant. The man who cuts his roots away and denies that they were ever connected with him withers into half a man.\\"And another, \\"Neither a land nor a people ever starts over clean. Country is compact of all its past disasters and strokes of luck-of flood and drouth, of the caprices of glaciers and sea winds, of misuse and disuse and greed and ignorance and wisdom-and though you may doze away the cedar and coax back the bluestem and mesquite grass and side-oats grama, you're not going to manhandle it into anything entirely new. It's limited by what it has been, by what's happened to it. And a people, until that time when it's uprooted and scattered and so mixed with other peoples that it has in fact perished, is much the same in this as land. It inherits.\\"What are you waiting for? Get this book and read it and find somebody to talk to about it. You'll want to do something equally crazy like floating down the slow almost dead water stretches of the Brazos in November or just to get out among the great outdoors and see what thoughts float up. Maybe you'll even want to write about it. The power of a book, \\"Goodbye to a River,\\" has it. Read it. --mmw"},{"Title":"Goodbye To A River","review":"This is one of the most beautifully written books I've ever read. It is funny, provocative, and sad. It is very hard for any Texan to see the end of an era, the end of a river. I've read it many times and will read it again and again. I will make sure that my grandchildren read it too, just as soon as their vocabulary and reading skills can handle it. What a sad commentary on our continuing destruction of our natural resources!"},{"Title":"Goodbye To A River","review":"I have a deep love for the outdoors whether its kayaking, fishing, mountain biking, or whatever. I recently kayaked the devils river over a 3 days weekend and this book took me right back to the river.

This book should be required reading in schools, not only in Texas, but though out the U.S."},{"Title":"Goodbye To A River","review":"An astonishing book, by an extraordinary writer, and more importantly, an extraordinary human being. The book assumes the form of a narrative of the author's three week solo canoe trip down the Brazos, a river about one hour by speeding car west of Ft. Worth, Texas; the journey was taken \\"way down in the fall,\\" in late November, 1959, when the northerners begin to howl, and bring snow. By most estimations, it is not much of a river, and even the author says: \\"...on a salty river unloved, unlovable except by a few loners and ranchers and cedar-hill misanthropes.\\" Graves gives only glimpses into his background, and if you blink, you might miss them. But consider, here is a man who has read Joyce's \\"Ulysses,\\" and recalls that Leopold Bloom's father had slept with his dog, Athos, in order to cure the father's aches and pains, just as Graves was carrying a six-month-old dachshund he routinely refers to as \\"the passenger,\\" for his own comfort. But Graves is equally well-grounded in the natural world, knows all the various types of trees, how they burn, and the appearance of the wood's grain, and that: \\"the white oaks are prime...one of the finest of aromatic fuels is a twisted, wave-grained branch of live oak...\\" Graves was a Marine Captain during World War II, wounded on Saipan, but again the reader only gets the slightest glimpse of that in one passage in which that perspective is used to reflect on the casualties of this countryside during the frontier days: \\"I once saw 4,000 Japanese stacked like cordwood, the harvest of two days' fighting, on one single islet on one single atoll awaiting bulldozer burial, more dead that the Brazos could show for its whole two or three decades of travail...\\" Graves has traveled as well, slight glimpses of which are permitted in \\"I'm familiar with the washed silent streets of Manhattan at five o'clock in the morning...\\" and \\"...did see dawn wash the top of the old wall at Avila...\\" and it was almost certainly there that he watched a man carve out a pair of wooden clogs with an ax, in fifteen minutes; a skill now permanently lost. An aspect of his life we are not afforded even the slightest glimpse are those that might be characterized, with a bit of leniency, as his \\"women problems,\\" and thus why he might be alone. In anticipation of that conversational gamut, he rebukes us all: \\"Few people are willing to believe that a piece of country, hunted and fished and roamed over, felt and remembered, can be company enough.\\"Graves wrings so much meaning, and numerous stories, just like Faulkner has done before him, about a similarly \\"postage-stamp size\\" part of America; in the formers' case it is the upper-middle Brazos river, maybe only a twentieth of its total length. He knows the history of the area well, particularly as it was settled during the frontier days, and one tectonic plate overwhelmed the one that had been there the longer, represented by \\"The People,\\" the Comanche's, the \\"Lords of the Plain,\\" and the Kiowas. He weaves some beautiful vignettes from that period into his journey, with my favorite being the hanging of Cooney Mitchell; but there are numerous other memorable ones, including the smoking out of the recluse, Sam Sowell, from his shack. Graves teases the reader at the end, indicating that there is \\"No room...\\" for so many other tales that he has left untold.The central theme is the river itself, and his farewell to it. At the beginning he describes his \\"enraged awe\\" when learning that it would shortly not exist, at least as he knew it, since it was being damned at several locations. Graves is one of the best naturalist writers extant, describing with love how the land lays \\"this way and that,\\" and the wildlife along the way, some of which he kills for his food. He is inspired by Thoreau, whom he repeatedly calls \\"St. Henry.\\" At the end, he questions whether it is all \\"a lament,\\" but overall, you get the sense of acceptance; that things change, and this is one more, as so many residents flee to the factories of Fort Worth, Dallas, and Detroit. And how many nature writers, traveling down a river, sleeping in skewed tents, and eating squirrels, could wryly reflect on his existence through the prism of Veblen's \\"The Theory of the Leisure Class\\"?Grave's book is chock full of philosophical takeaways, that should last me a long time, if not forever. I've traveled over the Brazos, about eight times in my life, each time I was going between 70, and hopefully 80 mph, trying to get out of Texas before nightfall. Thus, Graves rebuke stung: \\"The hard thing is to get slowed down.\\" A more ironic thought recently resonated, when I was traveling with my wife to Death Valley. She said, of a road 30 miles to the east of DV: \\"We've been on this road before.\\" And she was right: it was so like some other road we had previously traveled down in a desert landscape. I had to chuckle, because I assured her that it was quite impossible, but I shared with her one of Graves' insights: \\"On the fringes of the middle age and after, the d&eacute;ja-vu is likely not to be illusory.\\" Even less so, considerably beyond such a fringe!Graves is one of the wonderful members of the exclusive 6-star read club."},{"Title":"Goodbye To A River","review":"As a native Texan, I grew up with the stories of the wild frontier and I'm sure that Graves did too. But he takes those stories and, with beautiful prose, shows the really hardscrabble life that folks overcame on the edge of the frontier. Not the stories of Texas Rangers, but of ordinary pioneers who made a life for themselves despite drought, snowstorms and other natural disasters. But the book is also a wonderful \\"painting\\" of a part of Texas that is rich in history and natural beauty. A must-read for anyone who wants to know what Texas was like before the arrival of air conditioning and the discovery of oil."},{"Title":"Goodbye To A River","review":"I lived in Texas for 8 years and have seen the Brazos and the alligators and armadillos on its banks (although the Brazos that I saw was the section close to its mouth to the gulf and not the part that's described in this book). I have left Texas for a while now. On a recent trip back to Austin, I picked up this book in a local bookstore and I am glad I did.In this book Graves blends travelogue, history, folklore and personal reflections in a highly readable account. It is personal, anecdotal, sentimental, but not overly melancholy. The language is relaxed, yet well crafted, it gives you the feel of an intimate dialog, but the author also has tight control over what he chooses to say instead of rambling to endless tedium. The conversations, though few, carry the authentic flavor of western Texas, and as other reviewers alluded to, remind one of Steinbeck's writing. In a sense Graves was the last link to that frontier era -- although he was too late himself for the bygone days, he looked backward into those days, and personally talked to people who were its last ruminants. Even this book was written nearly 50 years ago now. Today we can get some glimpses of replicas and trinkets from museums, souvenir shops and Hollywood movies, but to get a real feel, one has to resort to books like this one. What is lost is not just another river.(A side note: if you like river rafting stories, you may want to check out Colin Fletcher's River)"},{"Title":"Goodbye To A River","review":"This meeting of the past, the present and the ugly future of change in the form of a passage down a wild river that will be transfomed is timelessly described by an evangelist of observation.

Excellent!"},{"Title":"Goodbye To A River","review":"This fine book is a compelling mixture of armchair history and philosophy, anecdote, and personal reflection. Contrary to what Mark@zombie.com wrote in a review I otherwise second, the book does not take Graves all the way to the Gulf but stops well short of there, at Lake Whitney. (It begins at the foot of the Possum Kingdom Lake dam in Palo Pinto county.) Along his canoe trip, accompanied by his nameless &quot;companion,&quot; a dog, Graves relates anecdotes he heard as a Fort Worth boy who grew up along the river, including much Indian and pioneer lore; he also imparts much knowledge of native flora and fauna and geology. His philosophical musings are compelling if sometimes longwinded. Some may find the prose stilted at times, but the overall feel of the book's prose is elegiac, nostaligiac, and autumnal"},{"Title":"Goodbye To A River","review":"I've read the hard-cover version of this book four times, and each reading makes me appreciate the fascinating, well-written narrative even more. As a young man in the early 1970s, I often canoed a section of the Brazos River, creating cherished memories of fishing, hunting and camping -- memories enhanced by John Graves' account of his similar adventures. Would love to have the Kindle edition, but at $12 it is overpriced -- like so many other titles that are part of the ebook price-fixing scheme involving Random House and other greedy publishers."},{"Title":"Goodbye To A River","review":"A slow, meandering story about a slow, meandering journey--a trip a man makes in a canoe down the river of his childhood (The Brazos in Texas) before it was dammed up and was no more.It is--or can be--a slow, meandering read, but the joy of this book--and there is a lot to enjoy--comes from the meandering---as the man, author John Graves, recounts the history, legend and lore that took place along the banks of his beloved river,at places and sites he is seeing for the last time--Indian stories and pioneer stories, some shocking in their horror, some inspiring, some humorous, and always, always, interesting.Join him on his trip.

I tried, I tried, I really tried. I even skipped around to various passages, hoping to find something that would convince me to read this book. I couldn't. There was ONE lovely snippet early on about camping with the dog that ignited a flicker of hope but that was it. His language is rambling and did not engage me. I can't ascribe this to the date of the novel, as much, much older books have held me captive despite difficult language and phraseology. Honestly, it was boring. The plot? Well, it started out with a man's journey back to the river of his childhood that was about to be dammed out of existence. I think although that was all I read, that's all you need to know.I can't ascribe my dislike of this book to my gender as I read more novels by males and abhor &quot;chick books&quot;. I suppose if you are local to that area, it holds some interest if you can work your way through the rambling language.

And although I've never been to that part of Texas, I feel as if I know Mr. Graves' stretch of the Brazos as well as the back of my hand. I have always felt guilty for never writing him a fan letter. He deserves as much credit as Wallace Stegner, Edward Abbey, John McPhee and all the rest or our naturalist philosophers for his beautiful prose and endlessly ruminative mind. I know that at least one reviewer found the book dull, and I have no capacity for empathy. In fact, I recently purchased, through Amazon, an autographed copy of the book with Mr. Graves' own photographs, for [$$].

Every time I would get terribly lonely for home and Texas, I would read this book. I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves history, Texas, nature, or rivers. I own several copies (five last count, as have given away half a dozen to good friends), and continue to re-read the book, as I always enjoy Mr. Graves' words, his history lessons, and his use of the English language. His imparting of the north Texas dialect is wonderful, as that dialect is the one in which I also was and am immersed. I have many other of Mr. Graves books, but GTAR is the first you should read! By the way, I also went to Boy Scout Camp at Worth Ranch on the Brazos as many boys did during the mid 50s, boated and canoed and fished on the Brazos, or the Brazos de Dios, the Arms of God. The sweet smell of oak and cedar, of campfires on river islands, the sounds of water rushing down river, the taste of fresh catfish fried up in a campfire...the bald eagles and deer, the ghosts of \\"The People\\" and early settlers....the best times.."},{"Title":"Goodbye To A River","review":"I was very impressed with this book. Graves does so much in this enjoyable volume. As he takes a canoe trip down the Brazos near where he grew up, he shares the history of the land--both recent and not-so-recent. Through him, we learn the reality of life for the average settler on the edge of the frontier. He also seems to be detailing a life that in his time was declining and in our age is nearly completely gone. His writing is difficult to describe and unlike anything I have ever read. It flows smoothly with a combination of regional speech and erudition. As you read you feel like you are in the canoe with an incomparable guide to this region of our state. A great book that deserves to be read much more widely than it is."},{"Title":"Goodbye To A River","review":"I live 25 miles from the spot on the Brazos river where John Graves begins his tale. I have floated this section of the river many times. Reading this book before making the trip makes the float immeasurably more interesting.

This is a great book for anyone who has ever floated or would like to float this section of the Brazos river."},{"Title":"Goodbye To A River","review":"A great story that incorporates history, the outdoors, and philosophy. With the rugged country of the upper Brazos river as his backdrop, Graves takes you on an enjoyable journey that you hope will never end.

I highly reccomend this book to all Texans, or anyone who wants to feel like a Texan for a while. I'm buying another Graves book soon."},{"Title":"Goodbye To A River","review":"I was only a few pages into this book when I realized that I was reading a person who was the real thing. John Graves is a master wordsmith, a thinker, and a person who has the background and experiences to address the subject. As a former Marine and a native Texan, I admit that I might have identified with him a bit more strongly than some, but there is no question that his prose is from a gifted and talented pen. I have experienced part of the trip he described (the first couple of days...spectacular sandstone bluffs and all...)so it made the read more enjoyable and absorbing for me. The book I read was borrowed, so naturally, I have to have my own copy as well as other of his efforts."},{"Title":"Goodbye To A River","review":"This is one of my favorite books. I went to YMCA and Scout camp in the Palo Pinto country. Back then, the divide that exists today between the so-called \\"cultural elite\\" and rural Texas didn't exist (or at least both sides respected each other enough to be civil, as a funny episode from the book relates), and Graves lived in both worlds. His is a lost generation, and although only one or two of the dams along his route got built, the country is now part of the vast exurb of Dallas-Fort Worth, filled with rural retreats for the city folk, 5 acre ranchettes, and driveways lined with 40-thousand-dollar pickup trucks. Graves doesn't mourn its loss, but commemorates what seemed like \\"progress\\" in the 60s and has only accelerated thousandfold since. If you pass through that country, or want to know what rural Texas used to be like, read this book. It's a bit long in the telling, but if you trace the journey on a map, it was no small trip."},{"Title":"Goodbye To A River","review":"As a Texan, I found this book to be a wonderful heartfelt tribute to Mr. Graves love of the Brazos River which included a lot of local history. I formerly lived in that area and have also canoed on the river and so I enjoyed his thoughts very much. I now live in the Hill Country and he wrote a book called &quot;From A Limestone Ledge&quot; that deals with his ruminations on life in our area! It is a pretty good one too!

I found it interesting because I can not wrap my brain around the fact that this girl did not try to escape and just amazed at how much mind control this man had over her. They did not touch on it but I can not believe that this girl would allow these horrible things to happen to her and not try to get away. This tells me she was very damaged before she was kidnapped.As you read on it becomes more and more apparent that this girl was completely lost and had no sense of self worth. This leads me to believe that she did at some point willingly stay. She felt no other belonging. The ending absolutely sucks! The entire ending was so rambling, twisted and tied up in legal mumbo jumbo that I found myself trying to skip chapters so that I could get past it. This was a descent book for a rainy day."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"Does this book come in LARGE PRINT? I bought the book in paperback and the print in so minute and virtually impossible for me to read.Does anyone know if and where I can find this in large print? Your help would be so greatly appreciated.Lastly, does anyone know if the movie is on Netflix? If so what is the title called? I tried the 'girl in the box' and 'sex slave' to no avail.Thank you much"},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"This book is a real page-turner; I could not put it down. The trouble is, I regretted having picked it up! The experience this victim went through is so horrifying that I was deeply affected as I read. Reading about such cruelty, imagining myself in the victim's place, I became quite depressed for the few days it took me to finish the book. At first, I thought perhaps I should just close the book and not finish it. But once you start, you really need to see this through to the conclusion. (So did the jurors, apparently. It is remarked in the book that 7 jurors attended the sentencing, although that is rare in most court cases.) So beware -- this is a very intense read."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"I read this book years ago and it is so powerful I have never forgotten it. I'll think of her now and again and remember what hell she was subjected to, wondering how she is doing and how she ever kept her mind. One to the most personally impactful books I have ever read. It reminds about books I have read about concentration camp surviors, they never leave me, nor do I think they should. When it is freezing outside and I run to the car through the cold hardly able to bear the few minutes to get the hearter cranked up and the memory of so many stories will pop into my mind. Trying to imagine how the survivors felt arriving in Auzchvitz(I know I butched the spelling), marching through the snow naked, no coat during the intake process and arriving at the administration building at 610PM. Since the building closed at 6PM they had to stand and wait outside in the cold, no protection for the office to open the following morning.Our minds can't really grasp the horror victims such as the women in this book and others in extreme situation endure. It just tears your heart out."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"I first heard about this book from my mother who read it years ago. I finished the book in three days flat. Alternating between working/reading while at work, I could not stop reading this book. The author (also the prosecutor)did an excellent job of writing=however, she did fail to explain how Colleen Hooker was indeed the &quot;Perfect Victim.&quot; The horrendous details of how she was captured, tortured and brainwashed for several years is unimaginable. I'm not sure if I am still in shock because she never left when she had the chance or the fact that she believed Cameron's blatant lies for so long. Either way, Colleen Hooker is a true survivor!"},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"I didn't like this book. Only about 1/3 is about Colleen Stan. The rest of it is about difficulties for the trial, the goings on of Christine McGuire and preparation for the trial. Author, of coarse, tries to depict herself as somewhat of a hero because of her conviction, after some difficulties surface. Too much is pure speculation by writer's own professional, verbal seduction to make the story more interesting and seduce the reader. She's saying what was going through their minds, at certain times. Several of the sequences are out of whack. They write it as scenarios surfaced through the trial, and not the way the true story actually happened. Monetary greed for the magnitude of story, is the reason they wrote the book. Coleen Stan did not help, or endorse this book and does not consider herself a \\"Perfect Victim\\". She went through 7 years of hell, plus a lengthy trial, and right away, they want to write the book. Authors are oblivious or inconsiderate of Colleen's only survival element of her ordeal. Colleen had to shut down her emotions on pain inflicted on her, to be able to survive. With her \\"finally freedom\\", She is anxious to be able to wear decent clothes, similar to a juror, since she has been naked, or wearing dull clothes for 7 years. She has programmed herself to deny expression of emotions for so long, and now, her lawyer wants her to give an award acting performance at her trial, so it will be easy for Christine to win the case. Christine keeps harping about Colleen not looking the part of a tortured victim. This book is not written for Colleen's benefit or comfort in mind. It's all about monetary greed for the authors. I have nothing but animosity for authors... Colleen was sick of reliving this hell again, and was ready for her life to re-begin. After about 8 years later, she is persuaded to tell her story as it actually happened, and what was going through her mind during certain brutalities inflicted on her as she is bound, helpless, and turned into a slave. \\"Colleen Stan; The Simple Gifts of Life\\", is the book you want to read to realize her story. \\"Perfect Victim\\" is a boggus book about the story, mostly about Christine McGuire's life and several of her lawyer friends. The story is in it for the attracting flavor. This does not compare to \\"Colleen Stan; The Simple Gifts of Life\\", which is told by Colleen as she experienced it."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"This book was great. It went through the whole story and didn't leave anything out. The ending was great although I got really mad at the girl for staying with him. I don't want to give too much away about the ending. It's amazing that this could happen in such a small town as Napa but it did! I live close by but at the time this occured I was living in Florida and didn't hear anything about it. It was recommended by a co-worker and I have passed this one on for many friends to read. If you like true crime then this is a great book!"},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"I promise this is a real page turner that you're not going to want to put down."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"I have read this book over and over, and it still scares me to death that something like this could ever happen. I have suggested it to many friends who want to start reading true crime. This book hooked me into only reading true crime. A true page turner."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"I have purchased this book called &quot;The Perfect Victim&quot; and I have found this book very interesting. I can tell you this was a real page turner for me. It gives insight on what the young lady was going through and how the suspect and his family were able to maintain a &quot;normal&quot; life to outsiders. I think people should think twice about hitchhiking because they can wind up like this young lady or even worse."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"The main reason I enjoyed this book is that it's glimpse into a world of unthinkable cruelty overcome by the resilience of the human spirit. The writing was not of epic caliber but the story is spellbinding. Well worth the few bucks it cost."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"It has been years since I read this book...But NEVER forgot it either..it was like I read it yesterday! I remember Thinking about what it would be like to be trapped in a box! It used to take my breath away! This book will leave you with some unaswered questions..Like...why not escape when you can?...or why not Tell someone You were kidnapped? I guess we don't understand these things If we have not been in her shoes. I actually cried for this girl..The fear of Not knowing what was coming next from her twisted abductors..gave me chills and many sleepless nights."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"Although &quot;Perfect Victim&quot; deals with very crude and disgusting elements, it does not go into so much detail that one gets ill reading it. The book is well-written and tells the unbelievable but true story of a girl who is kidnapped and held captive as a slave for seven years. As the district attorney who tried the case, co-author McGuire fills the book with details and legal explanations. The book covers the seven year time span with a few gaps in the story, but still gives enough information for the reader to know what is going on. Although it is not difficult to determine the outcome of the story, this is still a great suspenseful read. I especially liked the photo inserts because seeing the box that held Stan captive and getting to put faces with the names makes the story even more realistic than just reading about it."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"I read this book several years ago and IT TERRIFIED ME. I simply cannot fathom how one human being could do this to another person...oh, wait a sec, Hooker's not human, he's a monster! The atrocities this man committed made Hell look downright appealing...that man better hope he lives a long, long time because it will take eternity to come up with an answer for this on Judgement Day!Oh, and one other thing, this should really serve as a lesson for folks who hitchhike or easily open up to strangers! I got purely claustraphobic reading about the headbox, the box under the bed...I found myself twitching, wanting to flex, wanting to run out in the open!!!I saw Colleen Stan on Hard Copy back in 1995, she had gotten married, had a child, and was living some semblence of a normal life. Things appeared \\"normal\\" on the outside but surely has got to be tortured by the memories, nightmares...Godspeed to Colleen for health healing."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"&quot;Perfect Victim&quot; tells the bizarre story of a young woman kidnapped while hitchhiking from Oregon to her home in California in 1977. Colleen Stan is sadistically kept prisoner for most of 7 years. She is forced to spend many nights in a small box; a &quot;dungeon&quot; would be too generous a description. She is raped, tortured and just plain denigrated by her captors, Cameron and Jan Hooker. In the process she becomes their virtual slave. Apparently &quot;brainwashed&quot;, she ignores opportunities to escape. This is the most difficult part of the plot for the reader to fathom. Why didn't Colleen run? Was she truly brainwashed? This reviewer believes she was, but others will certainly disagree. Suddenly! Colleen is a free woman and the wheels of justice begin to spin. The second half of &quot;PV&quot; is concerned with the arrest and trial of the Hookers. In a special -and positive- twist, a co-author, Christine McGuire, is the prosecutor! As an author, she may favor her position. She takes an obvious shot or two at the defense counsel, but who can blame her, given the low life of a defendant? I firmly believe reviewers should not divulge endings (or how Colleen became &quot;free&quot;), so I will end quickly. &quot;PV&quot; is definitely recommended to true crime devotees. The only drawbacks are the disturbing nature of the plot and the amount of space devoted to the trial. It could have been edited down, but this is a minor detail. Who can blame author McGuire for writing about prosecutor McGuire? It's unclear if &quot;PV&quot; is readily available. My advice is to persist in finding a copy."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"The Perfect Victim was the most intense book I'd ever read due mostly to the fact that it was based on a true story. It's incomprehensible to me that such a horrible thing like this could happen in our country and that there are a lot of sick people out there. The story was so well written. I've read a few other novels by Christine McGuire. She's a wonderfully, gifted writer."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"I first read this book almost 8 years ago. I have read it several times since, and continue to think it is well written, although creepy. How anyone could be brainwashed as Colleen Stan was, is almost unbelievable. But for all you women out there, do you remember being 20 and gullible. It can, and did, happen. I would like to use this book as a semi-teaching tool for young females. If they can recognize the signs, then they can prevent something similar happening again. This book is pretty graphic, but still a fascinating read."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"Was this book edited? I found at least a dozen typos throughout the book, some of which were so egregious that it was difficult at first to understand the sentence. The story was good, super interesting and captivating, but really, someone needs to proofread a book before it gets to print..."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"This book is so well written, you can't put it down.This is a horrific, fascinating account of a young lady who was kidnapped and held as a slave for 6 years. It is written by the prosecutor's point of view, (see surprising note below *) and for the first half of the book, the subject changes between the beginning phases of the prosecutor's case against the captor, Cameron Hooker, and the entire, unimaginable torture that the victim, Colleen Stan endured during her captivity.The details of the case will startle, shock and horrify you. You will come to appreciate Prosecutor Christine McGuire's ability to take on public speculation that the victim in the case shouldered a great deal of blame for her prediciment for not going to police or trying to escape when she had chances to, several times during her captivity.You will have an eye opening expreience with this book, looking straight at evil and gaining insight into mind control and brainwashing.**And as you read this book and your mind begins to wrap iteslf around the horrible, vile, violent details of abuse, it will shock you to think about how Prosecutor Christine McGuire is now a CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY in Santa Cruz, California, with one of her defense specialties listed on her website as sexual offenses. Imagine that!"},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"There's a section in this book where a witness for the prosecution describes the step-by-step process of how someone can build control to a level where they could be 'let out' and still be controlled etc. It was while reading this book that i realised i was with a highly manipulative con. I ran away from him a few weeks later. For this reason I give this book the maximum rating."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"It has been about 5 years since I have read the book and all I can think about is how much I want to read it again. This was such a captivating story. I really felt for the victim. The book had such great detail and it kept you wanting to read more and more. I know i'll read it again."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"This book was sadly disappointing. I was expecting this elaborate book. What I read was a giant mess. The author skipped back and forth from when she was kidnapped to the court case. It made for a big huge puzzle of confusion and was not as good as it could have potentially been! I actually went through and read all the parts of her being kidnapped and what she went through and then went back and read the court case at the end. Then it seemed to make more sense to me but I still feel like I want my money back so I can buy a good true crime book, by a good author like Ann Rule....then I know I won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"This is a true crime book about a woman named Colleen Stan who was a sex slave to a mad man for seven years! It is the most freaking crazy book I've ever read, but also the most fascinating. Although I think Colleen should have run away when she had the chance this book really delves into her mind and is an amazing story. If you are a true crime freak like me, buy this book!"},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"I agree with a number of other reviews I have read about this book. The story itself is very interesting. What Colleen Stan endured for so many years, and how her captors were able to break her, confuse her, and frighten her to the point that she not only believed everything they told her, but that she did not try to escape their control is unbelievable for many people. However, it is not written objectively at all. Not only did I feel that Christine McGuire offered a skewed perception of the key players and witnesses in the trial, for the the prosecution and the defense, but she paints herself in a very odd, not particularly likable, light. Also, there was very little information about Colleen Stan's life prior to her capture, and from reading this, I got the feeling that there were some questionable elements about Stan's past that were purposely kept out for reasons other than just preserving the anonymity of her loved ones. Likewise there is not a lot of information about the Hookers early lives, or a lot of psychological information about Cameron Hooker. I found the book interesting enough to finish, and would probably recommend it to other true crime fans, but it is definitely flawed."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"This book kept my interest the whole time. I read this book in 2 days, reading every little extra minute i had. I couldn't believe at first what i was reading. I wonder how Colleen is today."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"The author grabs the reader's attention immediately, and has it hence forth. The book describes the horrors the victim suffered, but also jumps back and forth to the trial.The book is very descriptive of the characters, but leaves out some of their personal histories. It would have been nice to know more about the victim's past, rather than just the immediate. Same goes for her predator.Nevertheless, I rate this a four star book, because it captured, and kept my attention, but lacked a few details that I would have appreciated."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"Tells how a person can learn to live in horrible conditions and be brainwashed into thinking she was safe while being in harms way everyday and not say a word."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"This was a hard book to book down. It was so interesting to read the court transcripts and to really see how the defendant attempted to justify his horrific behaviour.Colleen Stan has been through so much, and the book shows her strength as a survivor of kidnapping, multiple rapes, sadistic torture, sensory deprivation, semi-starvation, complete isolation and the mind control and manipulation that these conditions made her more vulnerable to. It is amazing that she broke free at all, and that she found the strength to confront him in trial."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"OMG, I had read this book twice when it came out, it was so good. Then in 1990 I was visiting a friend in Moreno Valley Ca when a small girl about 5 came over. My friend said her name was Danielle and her mother was the girl kept in a box under a bed named Colleen. She had a terrible life and often asked if she could spend the night. We took her to a parade and I still have pics. They moved a short time later. Last we heard, no one knew where Colleen was and Danielle was in prison in No California."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"I've just started reading this and it is quite good so far. I love books like this and I'm glad I bought it. Also the place I purchased it from sent it quickly and I bought it used and it was in great shape."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"Colleen stuck out her thumb and hitched the wrong ride with Cameron and Janine. The husband and wife exchanged glances, and soon the woman in the backseat was locked into a \\"head box\\" and hidden under her own sleeping bag.Seven years later, neighbors considered Colleen a part of their family, babysitting and gardening, working as a hotel housekeeper, and going to church. What happened between her capture and the sensational \\"Sex Slave\\" trial?This book tells the astounding and alarming tale of a young woman who was turned into the submissive slave of a sadist. The author, who prosecuted the case, alternates between the chronology of Colleen's pathetically circumscribed existence, and the tale as it unfolded seven years later when she was \\"'freed\\" by his wife.Colleen's situation is terrible to contemplate, but the author portrays the case in a sympathetic yet professional manner, allowing the reader to develop a gradual emotional callous. I would imagine that the prosecutor herself went through the same process during her months of mind-numbing investigation.This is a classic account, and a must-read and must-have in every crime library."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"Although &quot;Perfect Victim&quot; deals with very crude and disgusting elements, it does not go into so much detail that one gets ill reading it.

The story of this tortured women is unlike anything i have ever heard, but it is told in a factual way, without sensationalism, like some true crime books. THe bare facts are the most horrifying things i have ever read, i cannot imagine this being done to someone, and more importantly, i was amazed at how the victim went through it without losing her faith in humanity or going insane. i think i would have.I wouldn't look at this as just another \\"true crime\\" book. It is also an amazing treatise on psychology and stockholm syndrome. I understand now how much some minds can take and the reasons behind it's bizarre sounding (but really ingenious) coping mechanisms. Reading this will teach you much about the human mind, some that will scare the crap out of you. It also has well researched footnotes about other similar cases and gives a glimpse into the legal system.Most importantly, this book shows how resilient and amazing the victim is. After knowing what the victim endured, i was amazed by her strength and by the fact that she did not seem as psychologically and physically damaged as i know i would be. Although this is probably the most horrific thing i have heard of happening to a person, she remains human (by that i mean kind and loving and dignified) and gentle in every sense. Truly an must readoff topic a bit, but my only concern was if the victim got any of the money made from the book (it was written by the D.A. who was her attorney). She seemed to not want the case well known (from what i read, she may have changed her mind) and it would be upsetting if she didn't want the book written, or didn't get her share share of payment. I hope she was not exploited YET AGAIN."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"A fascinating read about a real monster. Highly recommended. People read true crime books to discover real monsters as opposed to supernatural ones...and Cameron Hooker is fully qualified. Of especial interest is the authors' focus on the brainwashing approach selected by prosecutor and co-author McGuire against a sexual psychopath who kidnapped a young hitchhiker, his \\"perfect victim...sufficiently submissive not to threaten or even seriously resist her captor's techniques. I agree the psychology of the submissive impulse could've benefitted from some background, at least on the concept if not on specifics about Colleen (which might not be readily available anyway). The brainwashing defense failed with Patty Hearst, but McGuire's use of it in this case also sheds some light on the Hearst case, a subject I don't think was adequately explored at the time despite the tremendous publicity. As for the victim failing to run off when not under constant surveillance, McGuire notes that Colleen's family was also under threat by Hooker and, following torture, long isolation, conditioning, and unremitting fear, I have no problem with the idea, however exagerrated it may seem, that she felt she could not get away. Not a unique idea at all...pedophile cases are based firmly on the idea of powerlessness paralyzing the young victim. Penthouse Columnist Emily Prager wrote something years ago that stayed with me about the Hearst case, about asking a pimp how long it took to turn out some young Midwestern girl fresh off the bus...and the answer was something like one, two, or three days, I forget which. Several interesting issues explored in this book and an unforgettable crime make it a fine purchase."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"I had serious problems with this book as I read it. In the big picture, I found it poorly written and exploitive in nature. The story of Colleen Stan is interesting, however author/prosecutor Christine McGuire's decision to center the book with her personal life and largely overlook the criminal seems ego-centric and opportunistic.The earlier pages of the book describe the ordeal and torture of Colleen Stan. The descriptions are ragged and hard to follow. Most people do not know what the described torture devices look like, because the do not use them. In this circumstance, pictures certainly would have been helpful. Even when pictures such as the \\"head box\\" are given, it only gives a rough idea of how the contraption is used.I have a serious problem with authors who interject themselves into somebody else's tragedy. In this case, McGuire and her marital problems become a major subplot in somebody else's story. Rest assured, few people buy a true crime book to read about the author's marital problems. Eliminating these passages would have certainly made the story flow more naturally.Lastly, the review is titled based on a phrase on page 181. Make no mistake about it, the story of Colleen Stan is a tragedy. Yet by the author's own admission, the victim was naive and the story becomes hard to believe. At some point, most readers must ask why she did not try to leave or escape. An adult with average intelligence should not fall for the hijinx that Colleen Stan did. This wears on the sympathy the reader can give to her. But if this makes the reader feel jaded, it pales in comparison to forgetting the victim in a true crime book."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"Cameron Hooker believed that all women secretly desire to be dominated by the strong hand of a man. If a woman should protest, then corrective punishment is in order. After a night chained naked on the rack with her head encased in a \\"head box\\", the woman will place herself at the feet of the man the next morning and express \\"love\\". To Cameron Hooker, this was proof that he was right ... all women desire to be dominated.This true story will leave you sleepless and unable to get the image of an inocent woman, Colleen Stan, out of your mind. Over seven years of physical and mental torture, equal to anything experienced in the Holocaust, is unbelieveable yet true. This book is not for the weak of heart. Various tortures and lack of any human compassion, reduce Colleen Stan to a virtual sex slave. Sustained by her faith, Colleen fights to stay alive and survive, something that the young woman enslaved before her was unable to do. Buy this book and read it to learn just how evil one man can be."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"Most crimes occur in minutes or hours. This is the story of a crime that continued for over seven years. The husband, Cameron, enjoys inflicting pain and terror on his wife Janice. After years of abuse, Janice reaches an agreement with Cameron. She can have a baby while he can have a slave woman. The slave will endure the pain and terror, but there is to be no sex with her. A trap is set which springs upon an innocent 20 year old woman, Colleen. As if directed by the hand of the devil, Colleen is subjected to series of steps that leaves her out of touch with reality and unable to escape. All of this occurs while Cameron and Janice maintain the appearance of an average family with two young children. The book presents the heartrending details of Colleen's captivity, her faith in God, and her eventual freedom. The book leaves the reader wondering how they would fair if in Colleen's situation, if Janice was in some ways a victim herself, and how one man, from a normal background, could be so evil. The book draws mostly from newspaper articles and court records and lacks direct input from the primary participants. Recommended to anyone interested in the academic subjects of brainwashing, Patty Hurst, Stockholm syndrome, sadomasochism, and victim survival."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"Christine Mcguire did a wonderful job of telling this horrible true story. The crimes committed against these two women are almost unbelievable. I had a hard time putting the book down, because I became so ingrossed into finding out what happened. I needed to know if Colleen was able to move on with her life. Colleen is a remarkable woman. The only thing that I did not feel was necessary was all the information of the writer's life, while prosecuting this case. I felt that it took away some of the attention from the main story, and really wasn't something that the reader would really care about."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"As a lover of true crime books, this book ranks as one of those &quot;must-reads&quot;. It is well written, clear and horrifying yet not gratuitous. Hard to put down, you will find yourself pulled into Colleen Stan's desperate situation right until the end. You will question everything you think you know, and just how cruel people are willing to become.Not really for the faint of heart, this book is disturbing. I read it in one day and felt a little disillusioned with life afterwards. :) Colleen's story will definately help you reexamine what a bad day really is... and appreciate all the freedom most of take for granted.I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"This book tells the story of Coleen Stan, the woman who was kidnapped and kept prisoner, most of the time in a coffin size wooden box, by a couple in California. Written by the woman who prosecuted this case the book spares none of the shocking details of the case while still not appearing sensationalistic. It's a riveting and mesmerizing look into the true depths of human evil as well as a testament to the power of the human psyche to survive. One of the best books of its kind I have read!"},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"This is an incredible story and it is very well written. When we were reading about Coleen's time in the house, we were in that house; when reading about the court proceedings, we were in that courtroom. I hated putting the book down because it drew me in so well, and I was sad to see it end as I had enjoyed it so."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"Very good story, however it is horrific and very disturbing in some parts, it tended to play on my mind a lot as its a harrowing read of suffering and torture, I did find myself taking breaks from reading it as I found it very upsetting, having said that- I just had to finish it to see how it all turned out !"},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"If it were just a novel, you would never bother to read it cuz it is so unbelievable that a REAL person could get so brainwashed as to comply with this filthy animal. He should be broken on the wheel."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"I really enjoyed this book...both times I read it. It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. I couldn't put it down. I am a college student and am currently writing a report on this book. It is definitely a must read."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"This book is deccent but at times is boring. Almost half of the book is like reading a transcript from the trial. The book lacks detail for being a true crime and is poorly exectuted. The story itself is interesting but may have been better if written by someone other than the prosecutor."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"Stay on the author's good side. Otherwise all of your good qualities will be disregarded and everything else will be revealed.It amazes me that some psycho could treat someone the way the defendant did, let her go jogging and get a job, and still keep her under his control so she'd return. I would have thought she'd take ANY chance to try to escape.If this wasn't a true story I'd never have thought it was believeable."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"This book live by. It is the best book for all masters/ slaves to read. It mustRead it teaches us how to get a slave and how to keep her and train her."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"Written by the Colleens Lawyer, it takes you through the whole crime and court case very thoroughly. Its hard to believe what Colleen went through as a victim but the book does a good job making you see it from all points of view. A great book for those readers who love the terror and love the pyschology behind the captors and the victims."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"Does the person who wrote that they usually like bondage but that this was cruel and unnatural know how very immature that was to say? This book was not to excite someone into trying something new in the bedroom. It was to tell the horrible story of a brave woman. Whoever that was should grow up a little before graduating from the Dr. Suess books to real literature."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"I rode the school bus everyday with Janis and Cameron's brother to highschool. I would see Janis in the grocery store and stop and say hi. I cannot beleive all this happened in Red Bluff and to people I KNOW. Scary world out there."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"Norton's treatment of the subject matter, which crosses the line of merely cruel and unusual, is handled with tact, while still maintaining the ability to shock the reader in some places. But the shocks are only to give you a glimpse into the life of Colleen Stan, who was kept a prisoner for 7 years by the Cameron and Janice Hooker.Mrs. Norton is part a recollection, from the statements and conversations with Colleen, of what led up to her imprisonment and the specific methods the Hookers used to control her. Interspersed with the horrible images of her life inside the small box Cameron fashioned for her to live in, is the subsequent trial of Cameron Hooker.Carla Norton was living in Japan at the time of the crime, but the disturbing tale of modern-day slavery led her to quit her job and move for a time to the area in California where the case was being tried. She attended the trial and met with many of the people involved. Her immersion into the case allowed her to write a compelling book on the case of a woman that was subjected to some of the worst instances of mind control seen since World War II. She brings to light facts and paints a picture of those involved that could only have come from being there while the events were unfolding in the courtroom.The case of Colleen Stan is one that highlighted the role that pornography can play in the life of a man that already has certain predispositions regarding sex. It also shows the power that faith can have in the life of someone who has been systematically stripped of all independence and self-worth.I highly recommend this book for every true crime fan. Not only is it well-written and researched, it is a testament to the dedication of the prosecutors who try these cases, sometimes sacrificing their own lifestyles in the search for justice."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"I read it in 3 days! This book is EXCELLENT and HORRIFYING! What thie woman went through had to be more painful than anything most people could endure. Forcing her to live through all of his torture, just sick! Every page in this book is interesting, and believe me you won't put it down! I was up till 4 this morning finishing it!"},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"Colleen's story is one that few, if any, reading this would ever understand. She is kidnapped, tortured, beaten, humiliated, and it only gets worse.I don't know if people fully appreciate how long days must have been for her. I could only speculate what living in her \\"box\\" would be like for an hour or maybe a day. To have endured such horrible conditions for seven years is something none of us can comprehend.I couldn't stop reading this book, only because this was a true story, and not because it was by any means well written. The author interjects her own life far beyond what is nessasary to tell Coleen's sad tale. I find it almost insulting to Coleen and the horrible ordeal that she went through. The writer foreshadows the events of the trial with the skill of a high school creative writing class and whines about enduring single motherhood as a lawyer: Not in the same dimension of trouble as seven years brutal captivity. Hire a nanny and go see your shrink.Despite the author's inept ability to tell the story, most anyone would like to read this book because you will bond with Coleen early in the first chapter. An odd tale that ultimately will disturb you and keep your attention."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"I thought this book was a fantastic read.

Ms. McGuire and Ms.Norton wrote this book with all the objectivity and compassion possible, though, i believe that i would have been hard for me not to kill the guy outright ....but thats just me.i think this book is a way to show that the human spirt goes on even after a horrible incident such as this.

The main character actually kidnaps a young woman with his young wife and baby in the car. The victim, Colleen, is immediately put into a box, and lives there 24 hours a day for months. She is kept as a sex and torture slave. After she is totally brainwashed, she continues to stay with this deranged couple and is free to work and walk around the neighborhood.One would wonder how this could be possible, and yet from the months and months of constant deprivation, you come to depend on your captor for simple survival. This book was shocking beyond belief and a very good read. Thank you"},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"An unbelievable and true story that unfortunately is the result of a sadomasochistic monster's fantasies. It is hard to tell the difference between fiction and reality when you browse the details of Colleen Stan's ordeal. I strongly sympathise with the victim, and the book arouses my utter anger at her tormentors and the callousness of some legal practitioners in plea-bargaining. However, there are a few points that the book fails to reveal - Janice Hooker's testimony which is not entirely true, her claim that \\"Colleen was submissive\\" is to cover her skin, Janice's personality and the author's tendency to defend Janice (I suppose it's because of her female gender). Janice IS a monster aiding and abetting a MACHOMONSTER and I hope Colleen Stan reads this review. I'm female, so don't accuse me of sexism. There are also insufficient medical details that Colleen's torture and sensory deprivation affect her reactions and health - e.g. the fact she didn't flinch when burnt is due to death of neurons in her breasts NOT courage as it is impossible in this case; the hangings+whippings+dunkings all contribute to mental torture and enslavement. Also the brainwashing details are straight from Dr. Hatcher's description, but they are not in depth. I find the references to McGuire's personal background as irrelevant, and I doubt that Janice's daughters can be lovely girls, hopefully not monsters like their parents. I'll make sure no nephew of mine ends up with those girls since such parents are incapable of teaching them what morality is. As for those who still think of Colleen's role as a willing participant, I suggest they go and see a shrink to improve their IQ. To Colleen, I wish her the best of health, happiness, no more nightmares, and my unconditional friendship though I'm in Australia and am Vietnamese."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"I saw this book was mentioned Buried Memories - Katie Beers' Story and decided to search for it to download.

A man and a woman with a baby stops and picks her up. Quickly they bound and blindfold her and take her to their home. Colleen is subjected to excruciating torture and confinement in the home of Cameron Hooker. By brainwashing Colleen, Cameron now has exactly what he wants.. a slave. For seven years Colleen lives with the Hooker's until one day Janice Hooker, Cameron's wife, informs Colleen of the truth."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"Red Bluff is our neighboring town and I shutter to think that this happened so close to home.

I first read it about six years ago and have since read it again. It's just as good the second time round. A very shocking story of sex,brainwashing and sick perversions. Not for the easily disturbed. Very graphic details and very shocking in places. On reading the back of the book I almost laughed at the idea of someone being held captive for seven years and being brainwashed into staying. On reading the book however,you come to realise just how this can happen and how frighteningly real it was for the poor victim, Colleen Stan. All the way through I couldn't help but wonder why on earth Colleen's family didn't suss out that something was going on. I mean, hey, your daughter suddenly goes missing and when she finally turns up she is like a different person and totally controlled by two individuals that she normally wouldn't associate with. Surely someone must have thought that something was up? Really excellent read. Buy it,don't borrow it as you'll definitely want to read it again.Comes with quite a few photos too. Powerfull and compelling."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"true story about seven years in captivity full of deprevation, sexual abuse and torture. Colleen Stan is an amazingly strong person to be able to live through her ordeal at the hands of Cameron Hooker. This book starts with her abduction while hitch hiking, ironically she refused a few rides because she felt unsure about them. Along comes they typical American family and she accepts their offer of a ride.The story continues back and forth between her captivity and the investigation/trial after her escape. While reading the chapters about Colleen you often wonder why she didn't try to escape when she was free of the box or when she was allowed certain freedoms. But, I guess that unless we were in her situation we would never be able to comprehend exactly what she was feeling.This book is a great read, however, it's extremely graphic at times and is not for the weak at heart."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"When I was browsing through the True Crime section at my local bookstore, I asked my sister to help me narrow down my choices: a Jeffrey Dahmer piece, the BTK Killer book, or one about a girl kept in a coffin beneath a couple's bed for over 7 years. She immediately recommended the latter.And she was right--to a point. The subject is disturbingly fascinating for a True Crime novel about a victim who isn't murdered. How could they keep this young woman so carefully hidden away for so long? It seems outlandish, but the more you uncover, the more you realize that it IS feasible, and it's absolutely horrifying to imagine what Colleen Stan went through.But the book is written by the DA who prosecuted her captor, and it shows.We learned virtually nothing about what makes Cameron Hooker tick. Almost nothing is revealed about Colleen's past. And Janice Hooker, the most in-depth study, is more an accomplice/side victim than anything else.But we learned all about the DA's marital problems, the vacation to reconcile her marriage, the eventual divorce, how cute her daughter is, how much she loves children, and virtually her every reaction to minute things--when all those small details should have been put into Colleen's story.I could have enjoyed this so much more, but honestly--why should I care about the DA's personal problems? I read this book to learn about the crime, the victim, the captor, the associates. I didn't read it to hear about the author's personal issues throughout the trial.Snip out those details, and this book would have gotten 1.5 stars more, if I could."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"The journey begins when young Colleen Stan is hitchhiking in California and passes up several offers by people she felt uncomfortable accepting rides from. Then along comes a nice American family and she accepts. So begins a 7-year ordeal presumably unmatched by anyone else. I find the book filled with details not only of the horror Cameron Hooker inflicted on Colleen, but also of the earlier horror he inflicted on a young Janice in the days before their marriage. As difficult as it was to believe how Hooker could have Stan so under control he would allow her to hold down a job, it becomes crystal clear when trial testimony describes hostages undergoing the same experience. My only problem is the book is not wholely written in chronological order but jumps back and forth between the current investigation and the years prior when Stan is held captive by a cold, calculating, very intelligent but depraved individual. If you can handle descriptions of immense pain, torture and terror get your hands on this book immediately."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"One of the criticisms in reviews of this book is that it fails to answer the question, Why didn't Colleen Stan leave when she could?I am simply amazed that readers of this book could come away from it not knowing the answer to that question. It may seem impossible that after enduring three years of isolation and extreme torture, that Colleen wouldn't run away the first chance she got. But on the other hand, who among us has gone through anything remotely like what she went through? How can anyone suggest that they know what pyschological impact being kept in a coffin for eight months after being kidnapped would be?Colleen Stan didn't have the opportunity to \\"leave\\" until over three years of on-going control and abuse. To suggest that this might not put her in a mental state that would allow her to believe the lies she was being told is simply naive.The author of this book does NOT fail in attempting to make clear why Colleen Stan didn't leave and also why some people might not believe her. It is a very balanced and well-written tale. It is in no way boring as one reviewer suggested. It is a horrifically fascinating story of a bizzare sadist, his compliant wife, and their victim."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"I am a true crime die hard, and this book has got to be one of the most interesting, mind baffling books I have ever read. The way the author tells the story of this girl kept locked in a box, makes you feel as if you are going through her experience and feeling her fear. The details are extremely meticulous and detailed. Anyone who reads true crime should read this book!"},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"Cameron Hooker appeared to the outside world as a quiet, hard-working, mild-mannered young man with a nice, quiet wife. But inside, Cameron was driven by sadistic fantasies of having a dungeon of female slaves totally under his control, to torture, have sex with, and order about as he wished. Cameron put many hours into studying up on psychological dominance and constructing appropriate places and devices to keep and torture a slave, before he put his plan into action to actually grab one. His mousy wife, not wanting to be tortured herself and not wanting to lose her husband, went along with the plan. Cameron's first attempt was a failure in that he went too far and actually killed his victim. His second attempt, in which he kidnapped Colleen Stan, was more successful in that he managed to keep her around for years, after breaking her psychologically through torture, deprivation and isolation. As part of his coercion, he showed her an official-looking \\"slave contract\\" saying that if she escaped, she would be hunted down and killed by a national network of slave masters, and her loved ones would also be killed.Colleen Stan was fortunate in that she managed to survive Cameron's tortures, including being hung by her arms for extended periods, burned, electrically shocked, and kept in a coffinlike box under the Hooker's bed in a sweltering trailer for several days with almost no water. Eventually she was able to forge a bond with Cameron's neglected and fearful wife, who helped her escape and also helped the authorities bring Cameron to justice. Colleen was not so fortunate in that the prosecutor in her case, Christine McGuire, apparently wrote this book about her experiences and did not share the profits with Colleen, which is pretty sleazy in my opinion. The book delves into a bit of McGuire's private life and frankly, even before I heard about her running off with the profits of Colleen's story, she came off like an unstable, egomaniacal person. I am just glad she didn't somehow mess up Colleen's case and let Cameron go free.Colleen is also unfortunate in that many people who read this book will not understand how psychological control, threats and physical torture can break a person's spirit to the point where they do not try to run away when given the chance. Everybody always thinks they will run away if put in that situation, but the truth is that we don't know what we will really do until we're the victim. It's clear that Cameron Hooker did his homework; he paid attention to and enjoyed all the painstaking details of torturing and breaking a woman. Perhaps Colleen was a bit less assertive than many other women, but at the same time, when you have been tortured for days it would seem like it's pretty easy to believe that you might be hunted down and killed if you try to run away in an unfamiliar area. And of course, there is the well-documented phenomenon of \\"Stockholm syndrome.\\" In short, there are many reasons why a kidnap/ torture victim might not try to escape, and this book provides an excellent exploration of many of them.Although this is a worthwhile book to read, I don't like the comparison to Jaycee Dugard being made in the advertising of this book. First of all, Colleen Stan was not a snatched child like Jaycee Dugard (or Elizabeth Smart or other child sex-slave kidnap victims). Colleen was a young adult hitch-hiker in her early 20s when she was taken, although her personality seems to have been shy and perhaps child-like in some ways. Second, the events in this book took place, and the book was written, many years before Jaycee Dugard's case entered the public eye, and it seems grossly exploitative to use Jaycee's name to try and sell additional copies of this book. Because of that exploitation and the situation with the prosecutor, I cannot recommend that people buy this book new and put money in corrupt pockets. It's a good read, though, so buy a used copy like I did."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"The story of what happened to Colleen Stan really is horrendous, and so therefore this book is automatically pretty interesting. Trying to imagine years - YEARS - spent in darkness and sensory isolation, periodically broken by abuse and rape, is pretty terrifying. It is a wonder that Colleen Stan was able to hold it together in any way and retain some fragment of herself. That head box is pretty horrifying to think about.The writing is where this book falls short. It was a very bad move, in my opinion, to switch back and forth from Colleen's ordeal to McGuire's life. It was silly; going from this poor girl's trauma to the young prosecutor's new job in a redneck office. I was really, really, PAINFULLY aware that the author WAS the prosecutor. Growing more and more frustrated with updates on her marriage, descriptions of her daughter, and illustrated moments (holding her baby while juxtaposed against a backdrop of hardcore porn is one of them) written in third person, I became a wee bit annoyed with this book.But, the facts of this case, the details of the \\"Company\\", the empathy you feel for Colleen Stan and the urge to understand what happened within her mind, all outweigh the prosecutor/author's fascination with herself, and make for a very interesting book."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"Wow. I had thumbed through this book one day at a bookstore and could not forget the chilling details I had uncovered. 1 week later I was compelled to buy it. 2 days later I had finished it. This is a hard one to forget.I can not comprehend how any human being can be THIS sadistic. I have read MANY true crime books. This guy makes John Wayne Gacy look like a mercy killer. There aren't words to describe Cameron Hooker's twisted sexual hell he inflicted. Like many people have said, this story is hard to believe. I think part of the reason for this may be that it is just too horrible to accept. Upon completing this well written book, I was left with a bad taste in my mouth. I can't believe humans can reach this low."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"Today, August, 27, 2009, Investigative Discovery aired the Story of Colleen Stan and I recalled reading the book back in the early 90's. This book gave me nightmares for months. I couldn't imagine how someone could have endured 7 years of pain, and suffering at the hands of such a cruel and sadistic person, who in this case is named Cameron Hooker.Colleen's story was on my mind for months, and then one day I was introduced to one of the authors, Carla Norton, who I found to be a wonderful woman. We spoke extensively about the book and she answered a lot of my questions. After that meeting I was able to sleep at night without the nightmares, but I never forgot about Colleen Stan.I'm sure that Investigative Discovery will air the story again sometime, but watching it today and seeing it narrated by the real Colleen Stan was eye opening and it brought back all of those scary feelings I had when I read the book, which contained so many graphic details.If you're as sensitive as I am, I wouldn't read the book, but if you're into psychology and want to study the human mind and how fragile it is, then I would highly recommend it. Just don't read it at night. It's disturbing but a fascinating piece of work."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"While a good book, it was NOT authorized by the victim.

In sum, a man with control issues and low self- esteem marries a woman with even lower self-esteem. Together, they kidnap a woman with still LESS self-esteem and keep her in a box off and on for 7 years. The victim enjoys periods of freedom intermittantly but never tries to escape because she has been so completely dominated psychologically.That is it!!!!!!!!!There is nothing else interesting about this book......unless you like reading a lot of detail about court testimony, the prosecuter's personal life, expert opinions.Honestly, I almost could not finish this book it was so dull. Any true crime should focus more narrowly on the psyche of the criminal, but we got almost nothing.This would have been pretty good condensed to about 25 pages."},{"Title":"Perfect victim","review":"No, it's not a book that will change the world.

The conclusion, that only by playing by the corrupt rules of the game can an innocent defendeant find relief are sobering. Siegel is very convincing in showing how things can go very wrong. The portrait of a power hungry prosecutor more concerned with getting a conviction that convicting the guilty party has a ring of truth. Siegel writes with the assurance of one who knows of what he speaks. He also does a good job at conveying a sense of place in the foggy California town. Personally, I didn't feel the characters were fully realized, but the complex plot structure and intriguing ethical issues carry the book. The Perfect Witness is a good read that got steadily more exciting as I went along. I found at the end, I couldn't put it down, and I was a bit disappointed when it was over.

Ira turns to his former law partner Greg Monarch to defend him. Initially, Greg figures that he can easily get his client, who does not remember anything due to drug usage, off the hook. The murder weapon and $33,000 was found in the possession of Sandy Polson. However, Sandy, who is a witness for the DA, explains that Greg gave her the gun and cash and she was too scared to say no to him.Greg begins to tear apart Sandy's story, but she conveniently rewrites it to fit every objection he can find. His plan to prove Sandy a liar on the stand fails and is his client is convicted of murder. Greg knows that Sandy is a pathological liar and that the DA wants a scapegoat. Ever the idealist who believes in the justice system (though shaken a bit), Greg has just begun to fight, but the forces opposing him are growing ever stronger.THE PERFECT WITNESS is a phenomenal legal procedural because of a profound story line that accentuates the conflict between justice and an adequate defense. Greg is a great character as his ideals and friendship are tested to the max. For that matter, so is the American judicial system tested to the max, but unlike Greg, seems to have come up lacking. Fans who read Barry Siegel's novel will bear witness that this is a near perfect novel.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Perfect Witness","review":"This was absolutely the worst book i ever read.

It is in actuality a meta-book, in the sense of being a book about books. Ms. Burack-Weiss, a Clinical Social Worker and instructor at Columbia University School of Social Work, decided to expand and amplify an article she published in 1995 entitled \\"The Caregiver's Memoir: A New Look at Family Support.\\" She says in her prologue,\\"It was a topic close to my heart. For thirty years I'd practiced clinical social work with ill and disabled people and their families. ...caregiving was not an intrusion on family life but an intrinsic part of it, a crucible in which the crux of relationships was revealed; an occasion not only of stress and burden, but of growth, possibility, and meaning.... How do family caregivers \`keep on keeping on'? How do their views on family and on the meaning of life itself change over the course of caregiving? How can their hard-won wisdom be used to sustain others faced with the same challenges?\\"Her method for answering these questions is to utilize published memoirs as research texts. The main bulk of The Caregiver's Tale is a sweeping (though perhaps not entirely comprehensive) review of books about child-care, peer-care, and parent-care relationships. Ms. Burack-Weiss takes as her definition of caregiving \\"the sense that clinicians and researchers use the word: hands-on help with personal and instrumental tasks of daily living undertaken by one family member on behalf of another--usually for a time-limited period--of greater or lesser duration--of illness or disability.\\"The book is divided into three parts. Part 1 concerns itself with (and divides itself into) \\"Care Situations\\": caring for those with cancer, dementia, HIV/AIDS, mental illness or chemical dependence. The section begins with a look at the cultural context of the various illnesses/disabilities. Each care situation entails differing challenges, problems, obstacles, pains, and its own characteristic flavor of anguish. None is perhaps more difficult than the section on HIV/AIDS which describes the profound stigma those stricken often felt about their diagnosis (though hopefully and presumably this has diminished over the years).With HIV/AIDS there also exists the distinct possibility of surprise. Because it was often contracted through \\"culturally disapproved behaviors such as IV drug use and homosexual sex\\" there is sometimes in these memoirs a \\"...kind of secret that rocks authors to the depths of their beings: suddenly learning that the loved one they thought they knew was another person entirely.\\" In several of the memoirs, the caregiver finds out about adultery, unknown promiscuity, or unsuspected homosexuality. Elizabeth Cox finds out that her husband has not only been adulterous, but with a man. Susan Bergman sees that her father's \\"persona as a churchgoing husband and father of four is a sham....\\"In Part 2 it is \\"Care Relationships\\" that are examined: a parent or parents caring for a child, sibling care, couple care, and finally (and certainly most inevitably) children caring for their parents. \\"Memoirs of sibling and parent care show that there is no easy formula. Sisters may be estranged, fathers may have been alcoholic or neglectful, mothers may have thwarted their early attempts at independence, causing them to flee. Yet their siblings and their children return to care.\\"The caregivers are often faced with stark, and ghastly choices: a wife must decide whether to take a vacation with a husband with severe heart disease, a sister must decide whether to authorize sterilization of a mentally disabled sister, \\"an adult child deciding whether a mother with Alzheimer's disease can safely live alone....\\" Several choices may today seem odd. Many readers would (I suspect) be surprised to read how before 1970 \\"the necessity for secrecy (rationalized in the name of maintaining hope) was unquestioningly accepted. Simone de Beauvoir's mother was never given the name of her illness. John Gunther maintained the pretense that his son, Johnny, was going off to Harvard in the fall even when it was clear that he would never leave his hospital bed.\\"Part 3 \\"The Memoirs\\" is a succession of one paragraph summaries of the memoirs. The chapter is fifty pages long, and I must admit I that found it nearly pointless except for research purposes. Unlike Ms. Burack-Weiss's writing throughout the rest of the book which is often both wonderful and profound, the summaries are brief, dry, lacking in humor or warmth, and offer little or no actual insight into the works covered. They felt like filler to me:Ann Hood, Do Not Go Gentle: My Search for Miracles in a Cynical Time (Picador, 2000).Hood does not want the reader to miss the point of her memoir. In a prologue she writes that it is the story of her \\"spiritual Odyssey.\\" The inward journey described coexists with an outer journey--the search for a cure for her father, who was dying of inoperable lung cancer. Scenes of coping with the disease on the home front (where Hood and her young son lived close enough to visit her parents daily) alternate with scenes from a trip to Mexico to bring home a \\"miracle\\" and later to Europe to discover her family's roots. Hood's efforts did not prevent the inevitable. Her father's death and the memories of the family's response to the sudden death of Hood's beloved brother some years before add depth and pathos to the story.Part 3 aside, overall, The Caregiver's Tale is often a fascinating read. And yet it also felt like a published doctoral dissertation, with some of the flaws inherent in such an adaptation. The book was at times a bit over-academic-y. (As in the sweeping, but requisite-in-a-thesis, literature review.) Nevertheless, on the whole it is a fascinating gathering and analysis of works which, in many ways illuminate the core of what makes us truly human beings: that we care for one another. It is when Ms. Burack-Weiss gathers insights into patterns perhaps evident only to a reader of many many memoirs that she offers us her best, and most useful understandings.\\"...comfort and support is seldom available to those who suffer more subtle losses: \`deaths' of parts of the family member's personality long before his body is laid to rest. The mother who used to offer sage advice is now mute. The husband who is no longer the sexual partner and confidant he once was. These losses are often endured in silence--for who can complain when the one you are caring for suffers so much more? Also lost are parts of the author's identity in relation to the ill or disabled family member. No longer being a son, a mother, a wife--with all the cultural expectations and privileges attendant on the role--leaves many feeling as if a part of them has died along with their loved one.\\"Ms. Burack-Weiss's writing is at times quite marvelous, and the morsels harvested from the books she references and cites are tasty, tantalizing and alluring. Many of the memoirists are famous, or the people for whom they cared were: Philip Roth, Sue Miller, Kenzaburo O, Jamaica Kincaid, Kate Millett, Joe Heller, Isabel Allende, Martin Amis, Calvin Trillin, Elizabeth Swados, Danielle Steele. Much of the writing quoted from these books made me wish that we could get a great deal more than merely snippets. But I suppose the answer to that predicament would be to use The Caregiver's Tale as a tasting menu, and then go out and consume many of the splendid, illuminating, and affecting memoirs themselves."},{"Title":"Maverick: the story of Robert Six and Continental Airlines","review":"This is a fascinating biography of a man you've never heard of - Robert Six. Very famous in his time, but now largely forgotter, Six founded Continental Airlines (a company that still exists) and displayed 'true grit' in doing so. He married the world-famous singer Ethel Merman, later divorcing her, and marrying actress Audrey Meadows (The Honeymooners). He was a risk-taker who built an empire from almost nothing.Six was a pilot himself, loved flying, and helped bring aviation from the barn-storming era into the modern age of goliath planes and round-the-world trips. He built Continental into a global carrier that still serves millions of customers a year.His marriage to two powerful and famous women gave him entry into the fabled upper echelons of Hollywood.Recommended to readers who are interested in aviation, building businesses, and men who marry celebrities."},{"Title":"Environmental Management: Readings and Cases","review":"Russo has done everyone a great favor by collecting in one place many of the \\"classics\\" on the greening of business --the reasons for it, the challenges it presents, and the types of decisions entailed. Readers will become familiar with the basic language, concepts, and practices that have evolved in the 20+ years that forward-thinking businesses have have helped themselves (saving on costs) and their customers by adopting more environmentally friendly practice. The book touches on questions related to issues of poverty, socially responsbible business, and serving demand at the \\"bottom of the pyramid,\\" but that is not its main thrust. The case studies are good, but anyone using the book in a course will need to update using the various sources that are available. The book is a good choice for those who want to make a start in understanding this important trend in business. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Environmental Management: Readings and Cases","review":"This book contains articles of opinion on the subject of te environment, but very little concrete information. What references are offered in the various articles are pieces of select information that only tells half of the story. Most of the articles have an obvious left-leaning political slant (a few are absolute extremists), and most express opinions as though they are facts. Although the articles are well written for the most part, this book should not be used as a college textbook since it only presents one side of the environmental issue- basically, humans are bad for the environment.If you want facts, don't bother with this one."},{"Title":"Hawthorne's Short Stories","review":"In your face, obvious, and heavy-handedly allegorical, still Hawthorne manages to pique my interest and hammer home his point. Switching from historically based stories (&quot;The Gray Champion&quot; and &quot;Endicott and the Red Cross&quot;) to spiritual allegories (&quot;The Bosom Serpent&quot; and &quot;The Celestial Railroad&quot;), Hawthorne continually chips away at the danger of isolation. Although he clearly believed in the fallibility and evil of the human heart--particularly pointing out the religious hypocrites--he also believed that one must continue to risk and be a part of the community. In stories such as &quot;Young Goodman Brown&quot; and &quot;Wakefield&quot;, we see the gloom that comes over certain men who pull away.Hawthorne, like Poe, uses graphic and surreal imagery, sometimes repetitively, to set a mood and draw a picture. His characters and scenes are alive and psychological consistent with his tales, and he manages to wring a moral out of nearly every page.Heavy-handed? Yes, but he aims to state a message, and he states it clearly: The moral nature must never be sacrificed for intellectual pursuits (Ethan Brand). In a world of cheap commercialism and mindless brain fodder, at least Hawthorne has something to say."},{"Title":"Hawthorne's Short Stories","review":"Like most of us, Hawthorne was hot and cold. He is responsible for a few of the best American short stories, and a few of the very worst. But the bad ones - read &quot;The Bosom Serpent&quot; carefully, for example - are hilariously bad!"},{"Title":"Hawthorne's Short Stories","review":"It's easy for our contemporaries to accuse Hawthorne of being formulaic or using timeworn themes. It must be remembered that in Hawthorne's own day, the many of the &quot;timeworn&quot; ideas represented a truly novel vision, and it was appropriate to use many different stories to convey its fullness. Just remember, if you think it's a &quot;cliche,&quot; it's probably because you've read a lot of post-Hawthorne &quot;wannabes&quot;!"},{"Title":"Hawthorne's Short Stories","review":"I read these short stories in a haphazard fashion rather than sequentially and unknowingly saved the worst two for last. A few days ago I was ready to give the collection five stars but the egregiously macabre &quot;Ethan Brand&quot; and &quot;The Old White Maid&quot; caused it a few points. These two tales are out of place among Hawthorne's other gems; they seem more suitable to Edgar Allen Poe on a night when he was feeling exceedingly gruesome.Among the highlights is &quot;Feathertop&quot; an eccentric piece about a witch whose magic pipe gives life to her scarecrow. &quot;The Prophetic Pictures,&quot; allegedly based on a true incident, is an intriguing yarn of a painter whose portrait accurately predicted his subject's forthcoming madness. &quot;The Gray Champion,&quot; a patriotic tale, must have been a hit with Hawthorne's good friends President and Mrs. Franklin Pierce. A recurring theme through Hawthorne's works is the individual's perpetual battle with character flaws-a motif that makes them suitable to our modern age and indeed timeless. Many of the allegorical elements including the notorious &quot;A,&quot; Hawthorne immortalized in &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; are scattered throughout these works.The proem by Newton Arvin offers an interesting biographical summary of the author's life. Much has been written about Nathaniel Hawthorne-unquestionably one of America's finest and most beloved authors, and there is little I can add to voluminous evaluations. However, to anyone interested in building his or her vocabulary, Hawthorne's writing offers a cyclopean lagniappe to dulcify sesquipedalian pursuits. For me that aspect was as beneficial as the enjoyable vignettes."},{"Title":"Hawthorne's Short Stories","review":"I read this author a bit at a time. You need to have a very good knowledge of everyday life in Hawthornes' time to fully understand what he describes."},{"Title":"Hawthorne's Short Stories","review":"Don't get me wrong; Hawthorne's stories are incredible. The plots are fascinating, and the writing style is fantastic. However, the characters are little more than devices to drive the plot forward, and that's not at all what I look for in stories."},{"Title":"Hawthorne's Short Stories","review":"Nathaniel Hawthorne is supposed to be an author that everybody likes. Well, guess what? I can't stand his writing style. I can see that is a decent writer, but why does he have to make his message so blatant? Zippy the Chimp could see the obvious symbolism in Hawthorne's stories. He (Hawthorne, not Zippy) is basically beating us over the head with symbolism. Why can't he let the reader find out the meaning on his own? Another thing I noticed is that a large majority of his stories have the same exact theme. The only differences between some of the stories is that the characters' names are different. It's like Hawthorne was playing adlibs when he wrote the stories. He just fills in the setting, and the characters names, and then the story unfolds the same way as any other one in the book. His stories are extremely redundant and boring: once you've read one, you've read them all. How many times can he use the &quot;all mankind is bonded by original sin&quot; theme? It just gets so old. I'm sorry if I'm being &quot;un-American&quot;or something by not liking this &quot;great&quot;author, but I just think he is completely overrated."},{"Title":"The South American's Wife : Latin Lovers (Presents)","review":"Karen Downing wakes up in a strange hospital bed in Rio de Janeiro with a dark, brooding man by her side. The man promptly informs her that she is his wife of three months, but Karen can't remember the last three months of her life for anything. The man also informs her that she had left him for another man. Karen can hardly believe that she would cheat on her husband - especially a man such as handsome and virile as this one - but then again, she can hardly believe that she'd marry a man she didn't even know for a week! When her husband takes her back to the home they had shared, will Karen be able to remember the reason she ran away from this man?Luiz Andrade couldn't believe that his wife had left him for a sniveling jerk, but she apparently had. Luiz didn't believe in divorce, though, so he went after his wife, and had found her in a hospital, apparently devoid of her memories of him. Despite the fact that he can't get the picture of her in the arms of another man out of his mind, he is determined to make this marriage work, whether Karen wants it to or not. There has never been a divorce in the Andrade family, and he won't be the first to get one! The passion is still there between them, but Luiz doesn't trust it, and doesn?t trust her, either. Can their marriage be saved?I enjoyed this book a great deal. I was intrigued from the first page of the book, and I wouldn't put it down until I had finished the story! There was definite tension throughout most of the book while Karen wondered why she had left the man of her dreams, and the reader keeps guessing along with her. I was surprised once the reason she left was revealed, which is a rare thing since I usually figure out the 'surprise' endings before I read half of the book. Not this time! I also enjoyed the tension between Luiz and Karen, because the attraction was obviously still there even though her memories of him weren't there.The only reason I gave this book only four stars was the fact that Luiz was too domineering for my tastes. He was sexy, yes, and he was also intriguing, but he believed that his wife had to do exactly what he said at all times. I felt like he was treating Karen like a child instead of a wife and an equal. The ending of the book also left several loose ends, the epilogue tried to tie them up but I just wasn't satisfied at how rushed the ending of the book was. Still, this book was a great read, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys a quick, interesting romance."},{"Title":"The South American's Wife : Latin Lovers (Presents)","review":"Karen and Luiz Andrade are married for a few months after a whirlwind courtship - literally one week knowing each other. She ran off one day after getting some devastating news and he believes she left w/ OM. Of course she then gets into an accident and is injured w/ partial amnesia, and the OM is nowhere to be found. But Luiz will take his estranged wife back home and try to make a go at it because marriage is forever . . . doncha know?!Luiz wasn't a bad guy, but he did believe other people rather than looking for some solid evidence. Luiz also liked to keep things from his wife and by keeping his secrets he opened them up to hurt and manipulations by outside parties who only had their own best interests at heart. Karen believed at times that she may have cheated on her handsome hubby, but somehow she knew that didn't sound like her either. So she has to regain her memory and get to the bottom of this mystery.Karen believed other people as well rather than speaking to her husband, but seriously he should have told her. I suppose it looked bad that she was meeting w/ OM, but after he accuses her she does explain that . . . okay after she accuse him about OW he explains as well. I WANTED to see SIL get hers though. Didn't want to read that he took care of her I wanted to see her try to wiggle out of it or at least admit to her part in the whole thing.***SPOILERS*** Karen ran off because she believed that Luiz had a child w/ OW and that he was frequently seeing them when he was out that way. In Karen's defense she was still suffering the loss of her child w/ Luiz and she didn't think things through nor confront him. It was easier to be manipulated and believe the worst of Luiz. And it was nice that Luiz never really forgave his mother too for her part in the problems in his marriage."},{"Title":"Dead Run (Monkeewrench Series)","review":"First, this is a thriller not a mystery. It's a -- Can the good guys escape trouble themselves and stop the bad guys in time -- type of book. Second, the characters are way overblown, in the James Bond or Indianna Jones tradition. And they are not people I felt close to or felt like I even knew very well. But all of that said, it's a quick and entertaining, well written book."},{"Title":"Dead Run (Monkeewrench Series)","review":"I too didn't enjoy this one as much as the previous efforts. Plot seemed contrived, a little slow moving and overall, compared to the previous two, a little disapointing.Sure, they just happen to be driving through the boonies and uncover a plot by militants to lay waste to parts of the country. Yeah, right. Give me a break. This is a talented writing duo, but I think they missed the mark on this one."},{"Title":"Dead Run (Monkeewrench Series)","review":"I was so disappointed with this book. The sales blurb made it sound like one of those books I would read in one sitting; instead I had to force myself to keep going. The characters never became real for me and the narrative didn't flow and was stilted. In addition the whole thing was so unbelievable - even taking the point above about the Twin Towers. In short, I wanted a good read and got a mediocre one. Maybe if I had read the other books first, I would have liked this better. As it is I won't be buying the previous ones."},{"Title":"Dead Run (Monkeewrench Series)","review":"It is good. But different from the previous two, and I didn't enjoy it as much.

A small town will be eerily silent, or even a big city, and while the buildings still stand, the people will be gone. Travelers of one type or another will stumble across the vacant buildings and try to figure out just what happened to all the people. This classic idea is used to great effect in this latest novel of the series.Grace MacBride, Annie Belinsky and Sharon Mueller were to take a road trip from Minneapolis to Green Bay, Wisconsin at the request of the local Police. There is a concern among some in the Police force that a serial killer might be at work and in the beginnings of a spree. Thanks to their software and the reputation they have made helping Police Departments since the events depicted in \\"Monkeewrench\\" their offer of free help is accepted. Their road trip quickly becomes a nightmare as they get lost, their car breaks down, their cell phones won't work, and their walk through the woods brings them to a ghost town where nothing, neither man or animal, is alive.They have stumbled across the very small town of Four Corners, Wisconsin. The entire town, such as it is, is completely devoid of life. Counters have been washed, dishes done, and everything is spotless but no animals, people, or wildlife such as birds or squirrels are around. It seems as if the classic science fiction premise has happened and every living thing has been catalogued and removed. But space aliens wouldn't have needed to cut the phone lines. As Grace, Annie, and Sharon struggle to figure out what has happened and stay alive, the men in their lives launch a rescue mission with virtually no idea where to begin looking for them.After the mind numbingly boring read of \\"Live Bait\\" this third novel in the series is a welcome return to what made the series worth reading in the first place. While some new information is added to the development of these continuing characters, especially in regards to the women on the run, the effort is secondary to the main thrust of the book, which is an action adventure read. Secondary to that point also is the resolution of at least two storylines from the first book that should have significant impact on the further development of the series.The entire thrust of the book is not the mystery surrounding what happened in Four Corners, part of which becomes very obvious early on. The thrust is in providing an intense action adventure oriented read designed to keep the reader glued to the page despite whatever might be happening in the real world surrounding the reader. The authors pull the feat off masterfully by shoving the reader to the edge of the seat and keeping him or her there the entire time while the action flows at a breathtaking pace. This is an intense read and certainly a book to read this summer-preferably while alone.Dead RunBy P. J. TracyG. P. Putnam's Sons(...)2005ISBN # 0-399-15246-6Hardback326 Pages$23.95 USKevin R.

HydePark7@aol.com"},{"Title":"Dead Run (Monkeewrench Series)","review":"This is my favorite of the four current Monkeewrench novels by P. J. Tracy. The first book introduced the series' classic character sets: urban cops, rural cops, and computer nerds. Adding the FBI, some home-grown terrorists, and sundry other state and federal agencies to the mix, \\"Dead Run\\" deploys them over the Minnesota countryside to great effect.The story begins when an FBI agent and two computer nerds stumble upon an apparently deserted town after their car breaks down. The three ladies soon find themselves cut off, on the run, and committed to defusing a terror initiative. In the outside world, their friends are alarmed at their disappearance and set out to find them. Will the two groups get together in time? Will they foil the terrorists? No spoilers here; read the book.One of the great delights of this book, as well as the others in the series, is the crisp and stylish writing. Thrillers with such exciting plots and engaging characters too often force their readers to endure spells of leaden dialog and tedious explanation of complicated plot twists. Not so with the Monkeewrench books. The story zooms along, nicely spiced with humor, and all loose ends are quickly and firmly tied."},{"Title":"Dead Run (Monkeewrench Series)","review":"As a devoted new fan to the series, I picked up this book almost as soon as I finished the first one. This book takes a bit of a detour from the previously plausible last 2 books & goes for a bit of an outlandish spin. It doesn't fit well with the rest of the series & to be honest, this book is a bit dull in comparison with the other two. It's not a good starting point for anyone looking to get into the series, even though this book can stand alone.That being said, this book is still fun to read if you are willing to slog through the slow bits. The book focuses around Grace, Annie, & another female character as they stumble onto a town eerily empty of all of it's citizens. They have to stay one step beyond the terrorist faction that's determined to eradicate anyone that knows of their whereabouts.My main criticism is that so many of the elements seem so far fetched. Grace's team always seems to have some near-magical computer invention that can save the day. The terrorists are instantly able to detect that Grace & her friends are in the town. Grace's dog instantly goes from a regular abused mutt to a super sniffer. However the P.J. Tracy team manage to make it entertaining. I just don't think that anyone not previously into the series would like it as much, though."},{"Title":"Dead Run (Monkeewrench Series)","review":"This was my first book by P.J. Tracy and I found it to be just OK. There wasn't anything exceptionally great about it. I did have a problem, however, with the amount of characters in there. It was mind boggling at times. Nonetheless, I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Dead Run (Monkeewrench Series)","review":"Our friends from Monkeewrench are back for the third time: oversized biker/renaissance man Harley, plus-sized sexpot Annie, Spandex-clad beanpole Roadrunner, and paranoid beauty Grace are once again preparing to donate their crime-solving software to another law enforcement agency, this time in Green Bay. Grace, Annie, and Sharon, a Wisconsin deputy/FBI agent they worked with on their last adventure, decide to take a road trip to northern Wisconsin to deliver the software. It's August, so it's a good time for the three women to take a meandering trip through Wisconsin...except for a little accident that occurs in the northern region where their side trip takes them, and the fact that their cell phones won't work.In a northern Wisconsin county, a diver discovers three dead bodies who were all shot execution-style, and when the bodies are sent to the morgue, the feds immediately step in and take them. Meanwhile, in the itty-bitty town of Four Corners, which only has two since a fire, an accident with a milk truck occurs, so that by the time Grace, Annie, and Sharon hoof it in when Grace's Range Rover breaks down, the town is deserted. There doesn't seem to even be so much as a mosquito hanging out in Four Corners, even though the town shows signs of recent occupation. When Grace discovers all the phone lines have been cut, she knows they're all in trouble, and the three women go into hiding for their lives. They are on the run from an organized group of paramilitary men on some kind of mission, and it is only Grace's highly-honed paranoia that saves them. They have to survive the night and somehow escape from Four Corners the following day so they can warn the world about what is about to happen. When the women don't turn up in Green Bay on time, the rest of the Monkeewrench crew and a couple of cops from Minneapolis decide to hop in the Monkeewrench RV and head for Wisconsin to find out what has happened.This book excels at building tension and keeping the story going. The writers did a great job of weaving intrigue, making the reader wonder if Grace, Annie, and Sharon have stumbled across a big government secret, or possibly something even darker. I had to keep reading just so I would know what was going on in Four Corners and who was responsible.While I give the book high marks for holding my interest in the story, it loses a few points with the characters. Everyone in this book and everything they do is terribly dramatic. Nobody just gets up or goes off and does something; if they are bothering to do it at all, it is because they are the best person in the world at it and everyone else holds them in awe. Younger readers or perhaps simply overly-dramatic people might find it enjoyable, but I found it distracting. It's a little hard to like characters when nearly everything they do or say makes me roll my eyes. Sexism is big in this book, too, which I just plain don't care for. While some of it was done on purpose to show the readers how backwards people are in the sticks, it was prevalent in every part of the book. Note to authors: Not ALL women stop every 5 minutes on road trips or will go 50 miles out of their way to look at a ball of twine, and some of us resent the implication that we do. Additionally, this book suffers heavily from a lack of copyediting. I have noticed this problem is increasing in publishing, and have learned to brush it off, but there were some glaring errors here that should have been fixed. For instance, a deputy's wife's name changes from chapter to chapter, and toward the end when Charlie, Grace's dog, is tracking, he first does it on foot, apparently running more than 40 miles an hour, and then miraculously in the next chapter, he's back inside the RV, but still, amazingly enough, doing his tracking thing from inside the vehicle. We could put an end to the drug trade if the DEA had a few dogs like that. One question I have that will not go away is...why didn't the women fix the phone lines on the farm after the bad guys went away? They had time, but I guess it wouldn't have been as exciting as what happened.Complaints aside, I have to give this book high marks simply because I could not put it down. I could overlook the things that bothered me simply because I needed to know what was happening, and I devoured this book very quickly. Though Pete Hautman's books have a better \\"Minnesota feel\\" than Tracy's for us locals, these books are still fun, and the intrigue in this one was excellent."},{"Title":"Dead Run (Monkeewrench Series)","review":"I have really enjoyed all of the PJ Tracy novels. They develop the characters well and have an excellent blend of humor and intrigue.My only complaint about the books is that there are so many important characters that each book seems to focus on one group, to the detriment of the development of the other characters. For example, the second book did not include as much of the Monkeewrench gang who were easily my favorite characters from the first book.But the 3rd and 4th did a good job of catching up on those characters and balancing out the coverage.I've nearly finished their most recent novel and am already eagerly awaiting their next."},{"Title":"Dead Run (Monkeewrench Series)","review":"PJ Tracy is the pseudonym of the combination of a mother-daughter writing duo P.J. and Traci Lambrecht. It is certainly unusual if not unique. Their first three novels, Monkeewrench, Live Bait and Dead Run,, have become national and international bestsellers.Much like some of the other reviewers I read and enjoyed Monkeewrench and Live Bait and expected something equally good or better from this writing pair. I was not disappointed. Although this type of book is not my first choice, preferring to read historical fact or fiction, after reading the first in the series I was not about to pass up on this one. I don't know whether it is a matter of two brains is better than one, or the duo just have a knack of coming up with a good plot that stimulates the reader and keeps them attentive throughout the book.This book has a really sinister and eerie plot that involves the trio of Grace Macbride, Annie Belinsky and Deputy Sharon Mueller who break down on a drive from Minneapolis to Green Bay. They are deep in the forest and cannot obtain signals on their phones. A trek through the woods brings them to the town of Four Corners, where they had hoped to get a mechanic to fix the car. But the place is a ghost town and the telephone lines have been cut in every building.The trio who had set out to investigate what they believe to be the work of a serial killer, suddenly find themselves witnessing a horrific double killing and end up being the hunted instead of the hunters . . ."},{"Title":"Dead Run (Monkeewrench Series)","review":"While it didn't live up to the previous two, it was good nonetheless. However I had to wonder at Deputy Lee's wife's name going from Paula in one chapter to Cheryl several chapters later. At first I had no idea who this Cheryl was he was referring to - until it was obvious he was thinking about his wife. So I flipped back a few pages and, sure enough, she was Paula back then. A professional editor couldn't catch that and a mere reader did?And when all three of the women (one of them being a police officer herself w/ all the attenuating training) piled into the back of the deputy's car, I was appalled. First of all, she HAD to know that there was no way out; she should have automatically sat in the front in the shotgun seat. Secondly, why would they all pile into a cramped, uncomfortable back seat when one of them is a full figured woman? (In fact, full figured women are usually automatically given the shot gun seat.) There was no logic at all to that scenario, especially considering that Sharon was already having misgivings about the phony deputy.On a personal note, I'm curious if either of the authors have themselves adopted a stray. It adds a nice touch and sends a very good message."},{"Title":"Dead Run (Monkeewrench Series)","review":"Gotta love when you rediscover an author you like, and you find out they have put out a few books in your absence. In this case, it's Dead Run by the mother/daughter writing team of P. J. Tracy. The Monkeewrench crew is back, and this time they're trying to save one of their own...Grace MacBride and Annie Belinsky (along with one other female deputy) head off to Green Bay to lay the groundwork for their crime software to track down a potential killer. But they never quite make it there when their SUV breaks down. A relatively short walk takes them into a town in the middle of nowhere, called Four Corners. The problem is that there's nobody there... it's like everyone has up and vanished. Except for the armed military guards on the perimeter of the town, killing anyone who happens to slip through the line. Watching someone get gunned down convinces the women that they need to lay low, but their SUV was found and now they need to be eliminated. All this is taking place in a cell phone \\"dead zone\\", so their failure to show up in Green Bay quickly gets the rest of the Monkeewrench crew (as well as Magozzi and Rolseth) into panic mode to track down their partners and solve the mystery of Four Corners. And once the mystery of their disappearance is becoming more clear, everyone realizes the danger isn't over, and the stakes are even higher than they imagined...This Monkeewrench novel concentrates more on the team than on the two detectives (Magozzi and Rolseth), and that's just fine. There's a bit more technical wizardry in this installment, and the plotline had really good pacing. The images of Belinsky (the queen-sized fashion queen) having to survive on the run (and in the dirt) were comical, and it was great fun to keep reading to see what would happen next...I hated when this one ended, but it was tempered with the knowledge I'm now on the hold list for the newest novel by Tracy. I hope it arrives pretty soon..."},{"Title":"Dead Run (Monkeewrench Series)","review":"P. J. Tracy, Dead Run (Putnam, 2005)The third book in P. J. Tracy's Monkeewrench series focuses, again, on the actual Monkeewrench crowd, a welcome return after the second book, where they played a marginal part. Dead Run also brings back some old friends that we didn't see at all in the second book.Grace and Annie are on their way to Wisconsin for a case when they vanish. This makes no one happy, least of all Grace and Annie, with their old pal Sharon, who find themselves trapped in a deserted town with a bunch of paramilitary types running around, whom Grace, Annie, and Sharon are convinced will shoot them on sight. The three of them have to survive long enough for the cavalry to come rescue them. Problem is, the cavalry have absolutely no idea where they are.Another good one from Clan Tracy, of a very different stripe than the series' first two novels. It's nice to see the duo aren't restricted to the straight mystery, and turn in quite a serviceable little survival thriller here. If you liked the first two, you know you're going to like this one, so why are you still sitting here reading a review? Go get it! ***"},{"Title":"Dead Run (Monkeewrench Series)","review":"In this third mystery in the \`Monkeewrench' series, authors PJ Tracy start with a bang: a devastating accident eliminates the citizens of Four Corners, Wisconsin, who, along with pets and cattle, simply drop dead. Enter three characters from the previous two novels: Grace MacBride, Annie Belinsky, and Sharon Mueller, who are on their way to meet with law enforcement in Green Bay and get stranded near this now abandoned town. Anyone who's read the previous novels in this series knows these three women are a force to be reckoned with: Grace carries at least one gun at all times, Annie stabbed a man to death in her teens, and Sharon, a deputy, has been working for the FBI. To write too much about the plot would spoil it; however, I enjoyed the authors' pokes at male attitudes to women: at several points, the male characters dismiss the womens' intelligence (the bad guys really pay the price for that mistake), or believe they have to rescue the women. In addition, some of the plot ties into current events in terms of domestic terrorism and militia groups. The authors, to their credit, are not afraid to put good people in bad situations, and not all the characters introduced make it out alive. I read this in about seven hours, and didn't want to put it down. Excellent book!"},{"Title":"Dead Run (Monkeewrench Series)","review":"The mother daughter writing tandem P.J. Tracy has written another interesting book. Dead Run is based on what happens to Monkeewrench founders Grace MacBride and Annie Belinsky along with Deputy Sharon Mueller. When their car breaks down on the way to Green Bay, they find themselves in the small town of Four Corners, Wisconsin. When they find the town deserted, it has has the feel of a Twilight Zone episode. When they witness two murders and discover clues as to what happened in the town, they realize that they have stumbled upon a plot to bring destruction to many. As they try to get word to their cohorts they also have to dodge those who want them silenced for good. Interesting, fast-paced novel."},{"Title":"Dead Run (Monkeewrench Series)","review":"I enjoyed this book...it was a combination of the characters (whom I knew from the previous two books) and the tense plot that kept me turning the pages.I like books that can help me escape for an hour or two...this one lost me for a day!Farfetched plot? Yes, maybe slightly, but then it could be because it hasn't happened yet. 9/11 was farfetched once.If you've enjoyed the first two of PJ Tracy's novels then this one will not disappoint."},{"Title":"Dead Run (Monkeewrench Series)","review":"The third outing for the Monkeewrench crew finds Grace, Annie and Sharon (Wisconsin deputy from the first book, now on loan to the FBI) traveling from Minneapolis to Green Bay, Wisconsin. Along the way their car breaks down and they stumble into a town where everyone has mysteriously vanished, and progressively more sinister developments are taking place.Unlike the first two books which were more whodunnit mysteries, this is straight up slam-bang suspense as the three women pool all their considerable resources to survive their predicament and the rest of the now-familiar characters--Minneapolis detectives Maggozzi and Rolseth, the Monkeewrench geeks, and (welcome back!) Wisconsin sheriff Mike Halloran and deputy Bonar Carlson--race to their rescue as it becomes increasingly clear that not only as something horrible happened in the isolated Wisconsin town, but sinister forces are trying to make it happen again, on a larger scale.A couple of reviews have pointed out the preposterousness of the plot, and it is one of those books that you read breathlessly and then put down and think, now waaaaiit a minute, that is kind of unbelievable--but while you are caught up in it it's totally believable, and I'm okay with spending a few hours like that.Again, the characters are what drew me in and kept me involved with the story. The development of their intertwining plotlines, like Magozzi's slowly blooming romance with Grace and Sharon's with Mike Halloran, makes this more than a routinely forgettable thriller. The idea of three women kicking ass and getting themselves out of their predicament, plus the touches of humor amid the suspense and horror, are just icing on the cake.This is another book I devoured in a day, and my only disappointment is that I now have to wait until the next book comes out to spend more time with these memorable characters!Again, highly recommended but also recommended that you read this series in order: Monkeewrench, followed by Live Bait, followed by Dead Run."},{"Title":"Dead Run (Monkeewrench Series)","review":"P. J. Tracy first came on the scene with the tightly plotted serial killer novel MONKEEWRENCH. Tracy's sophomore effort, LIVE BAIT, although not as innovative as the first novel in the series, marked Tracy as an author to watch. Now, with DEAD RUN, Tracy offers a straight-up (but never straightforward) thriller that should propel this mother-daughter writing team into the company of the very best mystery and thriller writers.As with the earlier novels in this loosely connected series, DEAD RUN's story alternates between Minneapolis and small-town Wisconsin. The software developers known as the Monkeewrench team have volunteered their sophisticated computer programs and their considerable expertise to help police departments solve related crimes. When Sharon Mueller, a Wisconsin police deputy now working for the FBI in Minneapolis, asks Grace MacBride and Annie Belinsky of the Monkeewrench team to help her connect the dots in a series of Green Bay murders, the three women set off on a road trip through rural Wisconsin.Along the way, they find the grisly remnants of a mysterious event: an abandoned town, a quasi-military blockade, and a farm field filled with unspeakable horrors. Is this some kind of secret government experiment? Or is it the beginning of a new kind of war? Drawn into the mystery against their will, the three women soon find themselves actively involved not only in saving themselves, but also in preventing the potential deaths of thousands of other people.In the meantime, terrified by the women's disappearance, the rest of the Monkeewrench crew and law enforcement agencies in two states mobilize to find the three women before it's too late. For some, such as Detective Leo Magozzi, the motivation is as much about their personal desires as it is about professional concerns: \\"We're not on the job. What we really are is a couple of frantic guys chasing a couple of skirts. Saving our women. Caveman stuff.\\" Little do these frantic guys know, though, that their women are more than capable of taking care of business, sometimes surprising even themselves.If this fast-paced, breathlessly plotted thriller has a fault, it is that it depends too much on a reader's knowledge of the earlier books in the series to fully understand and appreciate the nuances of character development and relationships explored in this third volume. Don't view this as a weakness, though; instead, use it as an excuse to pick up all three volumes in this thrilling series.--- Reviewed by Norah Piehl"},{"Title":"Dead Run (Monkeewrench Series)","review":"ok plot, bad editing! they kept talking about how quiet it was but they couldn't hear a huge RV going breakneck speeds on country roads until it pulled up right in front of them? that is only one of the many inconsistencies I found.

The Tracys seem to enjoy coming up with 'improbably probable' scenarios and criminals (see their first two books), but the 'villains' here just seem to have been tacked onto the story because somebody had to behind everything...and because this isn't a 'Friday the 13th' type horror movie, after all!I'm afraid the plot went as far off course as the Monkeewrench crew did...hope they all hitched a ride back to Minnesota in the Mystery Machine with Shag and Scoob."},{"Title":"Dead Run (Monkeewrench Series)","review":"Not only was the plot unbelievable throughout the entire book, but the ending was terrible.

Tracy, and it left a pretty twoofold impression.My edition was something like 450+ page paperback, so the first 250 or 300 pages were a real yummy. I was thinking that as soon as i make a reading-break, i would sit at once to my PC and order everything else by P.J. Tracy (am not from the States, so it is quite possible not finding anything by this Author in a local book store anytime you drop by). The fabula appeared really great, the strongest point beeing realism. By realism i basically mean that the \\"amount of threat to the world\\" was very adequate - no two whole continets under threat of beeing wiped out from the globe, no dicoveries which will change the total perception of human evolution, nothing like that. Another praise to P.J.T. is that although the place and time of events was jumping throughout the book, it was easy to connect everything and get a very clear overall picture of action. Must admit, that even i am a pretty heavy smoker, i even forgot smoking while i was reading. So, the first 250-300 pages were just great, 4 stars at minimum.But the realism i mentioned, later proved to be an indirect reason of my dissapointment, so the other half ot the book deserves a maximum of 2 stars. More specifically, it was the scene, where the deputy of Halloran gets stopped by FBI guys, examining the crime sceen where. And it was a trigger- how come, that the FBI never clashed into the National Guard? Especially having in mind, that the later seemed to be pretty wide-spread troughout two counties- Kingsford and Misaqua. If talking about Kingsford - the lake was some 56 minutes drive from the Kingsford county police HQ. So how much is that - some 40 miles, maximum 50?, so pretty suspicoius that FBI didn't try to cover a wider teritory. Furthermore, some of the soldiers were out in the open at the roadblocks just like that! But as am not familiar with geography of Wisconsin, i survived this by making an assumption, that \\"ok, lake is 50 miles from police HQ, and the village where the action started is some 200 miles to the opposite direction\\". But then Misaqua - don't want to reveal too much what was happening in there, but with the FBI operation of that nature and extent and the county swarming with FBI agents, guess where there the National Guard? Again, in the open at roadblocks... It can happen in a book where a guy is wrestling 50 feet monsters with his hands tied, but in a book it was so realistic, such thing came as a real dissapointment. An explanation of ANY kind would have benefited much - even something like the only FBI chopper pilot available in a radius of 1000 miles broke-up with his girlfriend and got drunk. Or make it road-spikes and soldiers jumping in and out the forest, not standing at roadblocks.There was another thing, which looked childlisly foolish, but as it came in the very end, there was already no more damage could be done... Basically, the scene in the very end, where P.J.T. writes something like \\"ah, we don't one to make it look as if men came as a cavalry to same women\\" and and so on. C'mmon, in a situation like it was and after the huge amount of stress you've just received, you would be happy to see a talking crocodile if you knew for sure it was on your side. Call me a chauvinist, but a fact of saving the world usually already causes a light smile, a contest who's gonna save it first is ridiculous, but making a big issue about a person of which gender will be a true savior is way over the line of sound mind."},{"Title":"Dead Run (Monkeewrench Series)","review":"With a great premise, engaging writing style, and interesting suspense this should have added up to a great book. My problem was that I didn't know the characters, and I think there was an assumption by the writers that I already did. I didn't read the first two books with these characters, didn't even know there were two others. I picked this up at a store for quick reading while doing some extreme hospital visiting. It was easy to read, and really fun to read, but there were a lot of characters and I couldn't really tell them apart. Sharon was a cop with a past, Grace was an agent with a past (or was she? - one week later, and I have forgotten), and Annie was heavy and wore flowing clothing. While I could keep these separate, events from their past were hinted at but not explained.

They get lost along the way and after their car breaks down have to hike into the nearest town for help. Unfortunately for them the nearest town is Four Corners and everyone there is dead. Soon to be dead will be the arriving trio if they cannot allude the heavily armed militia who now control the town. Also soon to be dead are thousands of Americans if the trio can not get out of town and warn the authorities. Meanwhile cops they've met in past novels and the rest of the Monkeewrench gang are freaking out as the girls become more and more late and do not answer their mobiles so they set off in their RV to locate them.I preferred the serial killer Monkeewrench adventures to Dead Run especially Live Bait as they are so much more realistic but I thoroughly enjoyed this book as well.

To me, it makes each of the characters important and less likely to be killed off. :) And I like that!Grace, Annie and Sharon head to Green Bay, Wisconsin to plug a serial killer's info into the over the top, high-tech computer program created by Monkeewrench when they run into a little car trouble somewhere in No Man's Land, Wisconsin. No cell towers in that neck of the woods and no people anywhere to boot. Until they get to the cafe in Four Corners. And then the world gets a whole lotta crazy-insane. And the boys back home go a little crazy-insane trying to locate them. Something smells pretty foul in the midwest and it ain't the turkey farms.You will want to read this book straight through--it IS that engrossing. The end happens a little fast, and there isn't much narrative after the climax. I would have liked a little more wrapping up of the story. And some of the militia/FBI/police gets a little confusing to sort through, but by the end of middle I had that all figured out (and it being confusing might have been done on purpose?). But that's about all I could say that I didn't like about it. The rest was totally entertaining and you get to know Annie and especially Sharon a lot better.Better than Live Bait, and about as good as Monkeewrench."},{"Title":"Dead Run (Monkeewrench Series)","review":"DEAD RUN, is the third of the PJ Tracy novels. Once again, we are re-united with the Monkeewrench team. We have Grace McBride, still ever vigilante against the dark shadows which she has inherited from her past. Annie Belinsky, with her love for flamboyant and expensive dresses. Deputy Sherrif Sharon Mueller. Sharon is still trying to come to terms with the incident that has threatened to wreck her career. The story of DEAD RUN, is basically centered around these three characters, Grace, Annie and Sharon. However the other members of the Monkeewrech team, also come into their own, towards the ending of the story. Namely, Roadrunner, the computer whiz kid mainly responsible for the past success of the Monkeewrench computer software programme, and Harley Davidson, the tough, tattooed heavy man of the outfit. And let's not forget too, Charlie the Dog. Who very much follows his nose. Once again, the two Detectives Leo Mogozzi and Gino Rolseth provide their wise-cracking expertise.But here any resemblance to the past two Monkeewrench novels is quickly extinguished. DEAD RUN, is a showcase for non-stop, heart pounding suspense.To give a detailed review here, would be a travesty. It would spoil the impact of the story. Much of the book's drive is provided by the talents of the author to spin out the main facts, sparingly. So that the element of suspense is always there, often accompanied by moments of sheer terror, and action, as Grace, Sharon and Annie struggle to stay alive and escape from the seemingly insurmountable odds that are threatening their existence.The blurb on the front cover claims \`if you go down into the woods today...\`. And this is where the nightmare for the three female members of Monkeewrench begins. Grace, Sharon and Annie are on their way to Green Bay, in Wisconsin. Their objective to deliver some of their sophisticated computer software and assist with the identification of three bodies, recently recovered from a Lake. The problem is, that the three ladies never arrive there. They make a mistake of taking a detour through the woods. When it becomes apparent, that they have not reached their destination, and no contact has been made by them, Roadrunner, Harley, the detectives, Leo and Gino set out to search for them. They quickly learn that with a vast expanse of countryside that makes up the majority of Wisconsin this is like searching for a needle in a haystack. Even with their huge array of electronic equipment. But like I said, lets not forget Charlie!If books carried slogans, Dead Run, would have this on the front cover..\`This book is like supaglue. Once you pick it up and start reading, you cannot put it down\`"},{"Title":"Dead Run (Monkeewrench Series)","review":"The Monkeewrench crew is back in their third thriller. In an action-packed storyline the Monkeewrench team tests their survival skills. They stumble into Four Corners, Wisconsin, a place where tragedy struck just hours before after their car breaks down. The town is dead silent until numerous men in camouflage are spotted. Grace MacBride, Annie Belinsky, and Deputy Sharon Mueller are fighting for their lives on their quest to get out of Four Corners alive.The first two books in this series are excellent, as is this one. It's not to say the plotline is exactly realistic, but the suspense is high, the characters are engaging, and there is a real sense of atmosphere. This is a perfect summer reading book."},{"Title":"Dead Run (Monkeewrench Series)","review":"I enjoy the P.J. Tracy series so much that I order the next one before I've finished the current book. Dead Run is a little more suspenseful then the last two and, truthfully, more unbelievable than the last two but still a great read. This series has over the top characters and fun plot lines. You learn to love a bunch of super intelligent but emotionally scarred people. You laugh at the humorous bantering between the detectives and find yourself rooting for the hint of romance to get a move on while turning the page to see what plot twist is around the corner. Fun books, like a cozy read in that you get to know the characters well and but then with the thrill of a more hard core suspense novel."},{"Title":"Dead Run (Monkeewrench Series)","review":"I have all three of their series; Monkeywrench, Live Bait, and now Dead Run. Each one is better than the last. As long as they keep writing, I will keep buying. I pass them along to my daughter when I am finished and she like myself can't wait for the next installment."},{"Title":"Dead Run (Monkeewrench Series)","review":"However, you must read the 1st two books in the series first to get to know the characters and their past situations. This is only a plus however, because the first two books are as good as Dead Run. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes non-stop action."},{"Title":"Dead Run (Monkeewrench Series)","review":"I am constantly searching for new authors who create quality efforts and sadly this mom/daughter team is not one of those. The plots are unbelievable and the characterizations are stale. The cop who eats too much, the computer geeks, the strong yet vulnerable women, the grizzled local sherrifs, etc. ad nauseum. One aditional gripe...no woman who is 100 pounds overweight is sexy even if she \\"showed a lot of cleavage and a lot of plump, delicious leg\\". This is amateur hour at its best and shows how easy it is to publish bad books today."},{"Title":"Dead Run (Monkeewrench Series)","review":"I bought Monkeewrench and loved it so much that I bought the rest of PJ Tracy's books too.

On their way Sharon convinces them to make a quick stop at a place where she wants to show them something unique.They are in a deserted area when Grace immediately realizes something is wrong in the town of Four Corners and the area surrounding it. There are no people, animals or sounds of life except for men dressed in soldiers' uniforms setting up a roadblock keeping everyone out. These soldiers know Grace, Annie and Sharon are in the area and have orders to kill them on sight but these women aren't easy to murder and lead the men on a merry chase until they come up with a plan to get out of the area. The other two members of Monkeewrench, Sharon's wannabe lover, and law enforcement officials seek the trio so they can find out what these men are doing and put a stop to it.The soldier who are up against the Monkeewrench gang literally believe the words in the Declaration of Independence \\"to provide new guards for their security\\" since the government fails to do so. Tracy makes readers wonder if these soldiers are misguided patriots or the terrorists they want to annihilate. There is a very important political message embedded in this fascinating thriller one the government should heed if it doesn't want another revolution to explode on American soil. This refreshing novel stars protagonists trying their best to stop a horrible catastrophe from happening."},{"Title":"Dead Run (Monkeewrench Series)","review":"It's a close call, but this must be the most preposterous book in this highly implausible series. These ladies must be charter members of the tinfoil hat brigade. Too bad, the computer sleuth is an interesting premise, but wasted on conspiracy theory nonsense.

With a dinner and news break of an hour, I finished the book about 10:15. The book is that good, even if the delirious initial delight of meeting the characters in Monkeewrench has worn off a little bit. Although this book could be read alone, no aspiring reader shoud miss the joy of Monkeewrench. A couple of questions though: Is Jackson doing OK? How was the Arizona case from Live Bait resolved?

Always leaves me wanting more please PJ Tracy!"},{"Title":"Dead Run (Monkeewrench Series)","review":"Book Info: Genre: Suspense/Thriller/MysteryReading Level: AdultRecommended for: Fans of the genre, fans of the seriesTrigger Warnings: Violence, terrorismDisclosure: I purchased first the hardcover and later the e-book editions of this book for myself. All opinions are my own.Synopsis: Computer game company founders Grace MacBride and Annie Belinsky--along with Wisconsin deputy Sharon Mueller--are en route to Green Bay, following reports of a serial killer, when their car breaks down deep in the northern woods. A short walk through the forest leads them to the eerily quiet town of Four Corners, where they find severed phone lines and a complete absence of any life. But the quiet is deceptive. Before they know it, they witness a horrifying double murder--and discover that this is only the beginning of a race to save their own lives... and countless others.My Thoughts: This is the third book in the Monkeewrench series, followingLive Bait(review here where formatting allowed--there is a link in that review to the review of the first book). I first read it shortly after its release in 2006, but did not write a review for it at that time. After acquiring books five and six, subsequent to reading the first four, I decided to re-read the whole series before book seven comes out next year.I do not know exactly how this happened, but somewhere between the hardcover edition I originally purchased, and this e-book edition, some pretty annoying typos were introduced. I have no idea what \\"haifa\\" is, but I'm pretty sure the places where I've noticed it should have said \\"half a.\\" I also am fairly sure that Harley did not make a habit of calling Grace \\"Grade\\", but I'm much too lazy to track down the hardcover to verify that. There are a number of these sorts of ridiculous typos and mistakes in this e-book version, which is really odd, because I do not recall this being a problem in the original at all. Admittedly after this much time I might have just forgotten, but... I doubt that. Speaking of errors, in the synopsis is says they are racing to save their lives, and the lives of countless others. In fact, \\"countless\\" people were not being threatened--there was a very specific number mentioned.This book has a segment that gives you a perfect look at who Grace is, deep down inside. She, Annie and Sharon are on trip, and this conversation takes place.Sharon: \\"I thought all these fancy rides had GPS.\\"\\"Grace wouldn't hear of it,\\" Annie said. \\"Too Big Brother. They always know where you are with a GPS.\\"Sharon cocked her head at Grace. \\"And who is \`they'?\\"Grace shrugged. \\"Could be anybody.\\"This really gives the reader a good look at who Grace is. We had hints of it from the very beginning, of course. She always carries at least two weapons, always wears her English riding boots outside of her own house. Once you understand her background, you understand of course (it's all explained inMonkeewrench), but she is an intensely paranoid young woman.Now, I've been to Wisconsin, and I thought it was a beautiful state, especially the woods. It's not heavily populated, but I grew up in Montana, which borders both North and South Dakota, and I think all three states together are about the same population as Wisconsin, so I didn't really consider Wisconsin to be all that empty. But this conversation between Annie and Sharon really brought home to me how many people, used to more populous areas, might see the Wisconsin woods.Annie: \\"This is absolutely the spookiest place I have ever been in my life. I never heard of anyone famous from Wisconsin, and now I know why. Nobody lives here.\\"Sharon turned around... \\"Ed Gein was famous. He lived here.\\"\\"Never heard of him.\\"\\"He used to kill people, grind them up, and eat them.\\"\\"Hmph. Well, apparently he ate them all.\\"I'd have loved to have heard what Annie had to say about Montana, or North Dakota, or South Dakota for that matter, if she thinks backwoods Wisconsin is bad. Of course, as my mom used to say, at least in the prairie you can see them coming. Who is \\"them\\"? As Grace said: Could be [just about] anybody.I've seen many critical reviews of this book complaining of sexism, which really confuses me. I simply do not see it. While it is true that the men all jump up to go \\"rescue\\" Annie, Sharon, and Grace, they all also admit to themselves that these women do not need to be rescued, and that they are able to take care of themselves. They are worried, so they do what men do: take action. There is no sexism at all at work here in my opinion--just people worried over their friends and wanting to help however they can, even as they realize said friends can take care of themselves in most situations.This book is different from the first two, in that it is not a mystery, per se, but more a suspense thriller--and it is very, very suspenseful. At the moment the suspense broke, I literally had tears in my eyes and a goofy smile on my face, simultaneously. And this was the second time I'd read the book, so it was no surprise to me, but it is so skillfully done, and such a wonderful scene, that I could not help myself. If you like suspenseful thrillers, if you've enjoyed the series, then definitely read this great book. Next up:Snow Blind (Monkeewrench Mysteries)."},{"Title":"Dead Run (Monkeewrench Series)","review":"I have read this book three times as It gets me in each time I start it. It is action all the way through and really keeps me on the edge of my seat. This book really rates six stars to me. I loved it."},{"Title":"Dead Run (Monkeewrench Series)","review":"The first two novels about the Monkeewrench gang were action-packed thrillers but they also were essentially detective stories. This one is a little different. In fact, for the first few chapters, I thought I was getting involved in a horror story. Grace MacBride, the (justifiably) paranoid head of the computer company that has made the four of them very, very rich, is driving from the Twin Cities to Green Bay to consult with the local cops on what they believe may be a new serial killer. (Monkeewrench has some world-class software to lend them.) She's accompanied by Annie Belinsky, an oversized man-catcher (whom I have never found terribly convincing) and their buddy, Deputy Sheriff Sharon Mueller from Wisconsin, who was nearly killed at the end of the first book and is now working temporarily as a profiler for the FBI. (Which also seems a little improbable.) Grace is in a slowly developing relationship with Detective Leo Magozzi of Minneapolis, while Sharon is basically hiding out from her feelings for Sheriff Halloran. The three women do some rural sightseeing along the way, which takes them off their planned route, and they end up with a broken-down Range Rover near the completely deserted village of Four Corners far up in the North Woods, where there are no cell towers, and where strange, lethal events are taking place which may be the death of them all. There are armed men in military uniforms everywhere and the women find themselves trapped within a cordon. And there are an awful lot of unexpected dead bodies buried in a farmer's field. Meanwhile, Magozzi and Halloran are both getting worried because the ladies haven't yet shown up at their destination. Likewise Grace and Annie's other two partners, Harley and Roadrunner. And pretty soon, the guys are teaming up to go and search for their errant women.All in all, this isn't a bad yarn. It's exciting and well-paced and the Bad Guys are really, really bad. At the same time, it's not quite believable that a militia group of the type depicted could be so organized, well-trained and well funded and still operate beneath the federal radar. Some of the characters depicted also are borderline cartoonish, but that's been the case for three books now, and the author's fans have come to accept that. The Hollywood thriller formula apparently takes precedence over strict realism. But, hey, it's a pretty good afternoon's read."},{"Title":"Dead Run (Monkeewrench Series)","review":"This third entrant into the Monkeewrench series brings the Wisconsin characters from the first book,Monkeewrench, back into contact with their Minnesotan counterparts. Having that book in the middle helped strengthen the connection with those Minnesota detectives, so the confusion between duos Bonar/Halloran and Gino/Magozzi are much less this time around. Again, the varied cast of series characters does not develop very much. But since only twelve hours is covered in the entire book, I suppose that's to be expected, and is completely forgivable!This third book's premise is certainly unique and original. And despite its slow start, it does become very thrilling and quite difficult to put down towards the end. The funny dialogues continues to add to the series, and I'm definitely looking forward to the next book in the series!"},{"Title":"The critical path to sales success","review":"This book is completely outdated and speaks to selling insurance only.

Idaho has poetry as well as potatoes. And good reading it does make.Ronald McFarland and William Studebaker have made themselves some names among the Idaho literati set, but beyond those bounds and borders, I'm not sure how many folks have heard of the poesy-makers. Idaho has it's literary connections. Ernest Hemingway is buried here. Hemingway did some writing here. Allen Ginsberg has crossed the great state a time or two and has written about it. Ezra Pound, politics excepting, was a son of the state born in Hailey. What do you know, the state, though largely unknown, is on the literary map. \\"Idaho's Poetry, A Centennial Anthology,\\" speaks to that fact. It is a rich and varied collection of some really good and in spots great poetry.This book is arranged chronologically starting with the Native American poetry of the Nez Perce, Shoshone and Bannock, Coeur d'Alene, and Kutenai. You have to hand it to the editors of McFarland and Studebaker for the thoroughness of their project scope. And the words, rhymes, and language continue on from the Pioneer Poets of the 1860's on to the present contemporaries with each era well and equitably represented. Notable stand-outs for me and my taste in poetry are Margeret Aho's \\"Carpal Bones,\\" Richard Ardinger's \\"Report from More's Creek,\\" Alex Kuo's \\"A Chinaman's Change Shanghai, 1945,\\" and certainly not to be overlooked is Ron McFarland's own, \\"Orgy,\\" and Ford Swetnam's \\"One Winter,\\" and \\"Another Winter.\\"Like the land and it's poetry, their natural edge serrated rock have had a definite effect on my own writing. Thank you McFarland and Studebaker for putting this fine book together if you should ever stumble across this review.And dear reader I leave you with these fine words of Aho's straight from the pages of this good book, \\"What is unspoken, wordless, lives between the fingers and the forearm, in the pale throats of the wrists which swallow so much and are wise.\\"-- Ahh, beautiful land, beautiful poetry...MMW"},{"Title":"Russian Fairy Tales (Everyman's Library Children's Classics)","review":"I love fairytales that are regionally focused, we have a close family friend that is from Russia and I bought this with her in mind, when I told her the stories and shared the book with her she was thrilled to see such a good translation of stories that she had almost forgotten from her childhood. This book is not a complete collection of Russian fairytales as it has rather glaringly left out the story of the Phoenix, but perhaps it does require its own book. The pictures in the book as very subdued but I was assured that it is because that is what traditional Russian art looks like. I would be interested in looking into other fairytale books by this group."},{"Title":"Russian Fairy Tales (Everyman's Library Children's Classics)","review":"This little book is deffinately a change from the fairy tales I grew up hearing. I loved it!"},{"Title":"Russian Fairy Tales (Everyman's Library Children's Classics)","review":"It was terrific to get a book that compiled all the favourite russian fairy tales in one volume,and as an added bonus included illustrations by Ivan Bilibin."},{"Title":"Russian Fairy Tales (Everyman's Library Children's Classics)","review":"Bilibin is a great illustrator but the reproductions in this book do his work a great disservice.The book is very small and the illustrations are only A5 size and most are half that size. The print quality is very poor and combined with the matt paper makes the colours dull and muddy. Compared to the original Russian editions this book looks like it has been printed on newsprint with a very low quality photocopier.So bad I threw the book out."},{"Title":"Russian Fairy Tales (Everyman's Library Children's Classics)","review":"Yes, the illustrations are reduced to a smaller size than one might like and, yes, the colors are flatter than they presumably are in the originals. But for about $10 you get a very attractive, 180+ page, hard cover book with a sample of more than 50 of Ivan's Bilibin's gorgeous fairy tale illustrations, all but one or two in color and many full, or even double page.For the price, I don't think you can go wrong if you're at all interested in Russian fairy tale stories and illustrations. By way of comparison. I recently ran across some Russian editions of illustrated Russian fairy tale books, including at least one illustrated by Biliban, at a Russian gift Shop in Oakland, CA. They were larger format and the reproduction of the illustrations was somewhat better, but the were paperback, only about 32 pages, and cost $29.95 each if I remember correctly."},{"Title":"Russian Fairy Tales (Everyman's Library Children's Classics)","review":"The selection of tales in this book is excellent, the cover and the illustrations are luxorious, and more than worth what you pay. I was very pleasantly surprised when I opened the package and saw this book, because I needed it for a friend, and it is, indeed, a wonderful present."},{"Title":"Russian Fairy Tales (Everyman's Library Children's Classics)","review":"Very nice gift book,I ordered this book after coming back from Russia as a present for my nieces and nephews to give them a taste of the wonder of this wild country...and thoroughly enjoyed it myelf. I disagree with a previous reviewer over the illustrations: the pictures by Bilibin are great.. they're not dingy: just turn of the century Russian in a beautiful style-moderne style that was all the rage in St Petersburg.Russian Folktales typically have charming rhymed couplets sprinkled throughout the stories and unfortunately, in this translation, these have been flattened to strict prose, but the stories are still well told."},{"Title":"Russian Fairy Tales (Everyman's Library Children's Classics)","review":"Luxurious? I don't think so! This book is far too small to do justice to Ivan Bilibin's wonderful illustrations, which I could have accepted if their reproduction quality wasn't so poor! Most have white flecks through them, and some are even fuzzy and off-register. Ivan Bilibin's beautiful colors have also died on this paper stock, with a considerable loss of detail - don't be fooled by the picture sample here! This is a very disappointing and unworthy production."},{"Title":"Russian Fairy Tales (Everyman's Library Children's Classics)","review":"Five-star art by the masterful by Ivan Bilibin is diluted by disjointed storytelling that really could have used a decent editor, but the book is well worth its tiny price. This collection of Russian fairy tales was collected and transcribed late in the 19th century, and the uneveness of the writing greatly diminishes the work's overall quality.Nevertheless, the book is well worth the price simply due to Bilibin's gorgeous and evocative illustrations. After being raised in Westernized St. Petersburg in the last days of the Russian Empire, Bilibin became enraptured with traditional Russian themes and motiffs. He traveled the country and countryside widely before and during the 1917 Revolution to immerse himself in the grass-roots of rural Russia, and it permeates his art from this period.Much of his artwork in this book is in color, but it's difficult to distinguish between the preference for muted tones in the early 20th century Europe, or if cut-rate color printing by the publisher is involved. Regardless, Bilibin's imagination and grace shine through.The stories are poorly written, ill-paced, and hard for even seasoned fairy tale fanciers to follow. Endings are often garbled or rushed to the point of incoherence, and references to unfamiliar details of Russian life are not explained.Still, the small cost warrants the book's purchase for all who enjoy children's book illustration at its finest."},{"Title":"Russian Fairy Tales (Everyman's Library Children's Classics)","review":"I was really impressed with this book. I have been an admirer of Bilibin's illustrations for years, and it is good to finally have access to the stories that go with the paintings. For the price I paid, I was pleasantly surprised by the high quality of this edition and its beautiful cover (it looks wonderful on my bookshelf). I am definitely planning on purchasing other titles in the Everyman's series soon."},{"Title":"Russian Fairy Tales (Everyman's Library Children's Classics)","review":"It's a nice book. However I bought it for all the Ivan Bilibin illustrations & for some reason the book was printed on a mid tone, cream stock and so the brilliant Bilibin colours that he is justly famous for, are very muted, almost muddy...much of his marvelous details are even hard to see. His work should be printed a on bright white stock imo. Still glad to have the book,the writing looks good, but what a disappointment."},{"Title":"Russian Fairy Tales (Everyman's Library Children's Classics)","review":"It's true that the pictures in this book look like they could use a good cleaning, but that does nothing to diminish their beauty or the beauty of the storytelling. Classic stories from a time long ago. Our shared heritage should not be lost. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Russian Fairy Tales (Everyman's Library Children's Classics)","review":"I don't know that much about Russian fairy tales, so I cannot very well say how well the stories are summarized. As a chidrens book, they seem perfectly fine to me.The Illustrations by Ivan Bilibin are to die for. A 13 dollar book with JUST the included illustrations would still be well worth the price. The binding and overall construction of the book are admirable too."},{"Title":"Russian Fairy Tales (Everyman's Library Children's Classics)","review":"A good collection of stories, that would benefit from better paper and more illustrations. There are ratherfrighteningevents in these tales which makes them unsuitable for very young children, and I wish there hadbeen anindication or recommendation of age for the audience.

There are tons of practice problems in the book which I found extremely helpful. Practice is the only guaranteed technique to improve your ACT/SAT score, and that's where many of the competitors fall short. The Real ACT book by the makers of the test was also an excellent buy."},{"Title":"McGraw-Hill's ACT WITH CD-ROM (McGraw-Hill's ACT (W/CD))","review":"I work at a tutoring office which uses this book, among many other test-prep guides. Let me just give an example of the frequency of errors in this book.On one of the practice tests, I assigned my student 15 pseudo-random problems (all of them dealt vaguely with geometry). When we went back and discussed the questions, 8 of those 15 questions had errors varying degrees of severity.- One question had the same answer choice written twice, with the correct answer not available.- Four questions had completely incorrect answers. That is not to say that the answer choices had typos. Rather, the explanations in the back derived answers that were incorrect.- Other questions had used non-standard (and incorrect) terminology. For instance, one question asked \\"What is the corresponding acute angle of a 110 angle?\\". This use of \\"corresponding\\" (as a replacement for supplementary) is completely wrong.- Some questions had multiple correct answer choices. For instance, a questions asking which choice was an obtuse triangle had two obtuse triangles as answer choices.Anyone who bought this book should probably try to get a refund. Based on the huge number of not-so-subtle errors in one test, let alone the whole book, this book is more harmful than helpful for test preparation."},{"Title":"McGraw-Hill's ACT WITH CD-ROM (McGraw-Hill's ACT (W/CD))","review":"I bought this for brother who is taking ACT. We were going over his answers in one of the math practice tests. Many of the choices (A,B,C,D) did not correlate to the question posed. Furthermore, explanations were incorrect and inaccurate.

Bad proofreading and flat out incorrect answers found frequently."},{"Title":"McGraw-Hill's ACT WITH CD-ROM (McGraw-Hill's ACT (W/CD))","review":"We bought this and donated it to the school where I son attended.

We've stocked the house with my late parents' books. One, \\"And Baby Makes Four\\" by the Berenstains (of Bear fame), seems to attract every young mother.

He clear sets out the importance of purification and the steps that need to be taken for the individual to overcome delusions and to progress on the spiritual path to enlightenment.The text then explains the ritual of confession and contains detailed descriptions of the Buddhas and instructions on how you or I should engage in this practice. The text is very clear and avoids the tendency of some writers to obscure the meaning by using technical jargon - Kelsang Gyatso has avoided this and should be thanked for his efforts."},{"Title":"The Bodhisattva Vow: A Practical Guide to Helping Others","review":"This book is most helpful for those following or interested in the Bodhisattva way of life. It clearly lists all vows, and gives brief explanations on the meaning of each one, (It's size makes it reasonably portable, so is useful for those who have just recieved the vows and find them difficult to remember). It also contains a brief commentary on the practise of the six perfections. I have found this an indispensable guide to help me along the Bodhisattva path, and know of no other like it. I hope others will find it as useful as I do."},{"Title":"The Bodhisattva Vow: A Practical Guide to Helping Others","review":"The Geshe's style of elucidation is clear and step by step. This will be of more interest to the practitioner than the casual reader, or one interested in anecdotes and stories."},{"Title":"The Bodhisattva Vow: A Practical Guide to Helping Others","review":"I got this on audio and I would have given it more stars but for the recording is so soft that I have to turn the volume very very high. There is a lot of information on the vows of a bodhisattva as well as the 35 confession Buddhas... there are 22 chapters that are loaded with information. I would recommend this to anyone who already has a very good foundation of Buddhism in general and is curious about the vows of a bodhisattva or who is planning on taking the vows. Ven.Geshe Kelsang Gyatso is an amazing teacher who chooses his words very well for teaching and explaining. I highly recommend all of his books. There is a list of appropriate books for beginners, intermediate and advanced practitioners at www.kadampanewyork.org there is also a link that if you have any questions while reading or listening you can call or email the center and ask a monk or nun. I found that they are always very happy to help. I personally have purchased several of Geshe-la's books and plan on buying more."},{"Title":"The Bodhisattva Vow: A Practical Guide to Helping Others","review":"Geshe Kelsang Gyatso's beautiful book, The Bodhisattva Vow, gives an extensive explanation on how to practice higher moral discipline, the main path that leads to permanent happiness and enlightenment. Geshe Kelsang Gyatso demonstrates clearly, that developing a virtuous determination to abandon harmful actions such as: killing, stealing, lying, hurtful speech, malice etc, is essential to progress on and complete, one's spiritual path. If we conscientiously observe moral discipline, we can solve all our human problems and complete our spiritual practices powerfully.I recommend this book to anyone who is seeking clear and practical advice on how to abandon harmful actions and negative states of mind, and how to cultivate positive, powerful states of mind that will cause all our actions to become pure and of benefit to others."},{"Title":"The Bodhisattva Vow: A Practical Guide to Helping Others","review":"I should have posted this UPDATED review a long time ago in 2004.Like any spiritual seeker I was reading many different spiritual books, and Gyatso's books seemed genuine to me as I love the teachings of BUDDHA.In a nutshell, I joined their \\"meditation\\" group and went further to be trained as a teacher. What happened is SHOCKING.They informed me that I could NOT write my own books!!!!They told me I could not discuss any of the teachings!They told me I could NOT write ARTICLES.I couldn't believe how controlling this cult organization is. They give glory to Kelsang Gyatso - where a true Buddhist gives the glory to Buddha.If you are looking for excellent Buddhist books I do *NOT* recommend this book, or any of the other Gyatso books. I do recommend the books by Eknath Easwaran such as THE DAMMAPADA.I share this with the utmost pure motives and hope it helps you in your spiritual growth."},{"Title":"The Bodhisattva Vow: A Practical Guide to Helping Others","review":"This book takes you through the vows that you must take to become a boddhisattva.

A wonderful book to read."},{"Title":"The Bodhisattva Vow: A Practical Guide to Helping Others","review":"The audio-book is an excellent 2 disc set for the sincere students of Geshe Kelsang Gyatso (New Kadampa Traditon - New Kadampa Buddhist International Union). It is not beginner material, but more advanced. The Joyful Path of Good Fortune is an excellent but BIG foundation book. MODERN BUDDHISM will be released shortly. Eight Steps to Happiness is helpful introductory material.CDs of mantras can be purchased from your New Kadampa website.Amazon has excellent prices for the NKT materials!This book is likely NOT helpful to students of HH Dalai Lama, as a split occured between the 2 groups.The Teacher Training Program is about 12 years. It is a long and serious process. And yes, New Kadampa Buddhism has its own dogma, as do most religions.If you LOVE it and believe that the Lam Rim Buddhism presented in NKT is your own personal path to liberation and helping others, this book is very helpful."},{"Title":"The Bodhisattva Vow: A Practical Guide to Helping Others","review":"The product description says:\\"In this welcome guide to compassionate living, Geshe Kelsang explains in detail how to take and keep the Bodhisattva vows, and how to practice the Bodhisattva's deeds of giving, moral discipline, patience, effort, concentration, and wisdom.\\"Considering the plethora of books commenting on Bodhisattva vows, one would be better served by reading any one of those versus this nonsense. The author of this book (be it the hard copy book or the audio book version) is the same rigid character, who in his New Meditation Handbook, claims swatting a mosquito in anger will result in eons in the hell realm without any discussion of purification or karma. That is a very draconian statement from a very draconian \\"religious\\" leader. To learn more about the author, Google the \\"Dalai Lama\\" and \\"April 22, 2008\\" and then decide for yourself if you would want to follow these very non-Buddhist, Shugden-worshiping writings.You can also Google the author and click on some of the web sites that are not part of his self-serving empire to see that not only does un-Buddhist-like controversy follow him, he is not even a real Geshe (he was offered the test, refused it, but took the title anyway... ugh!).The presently reviewed title is yet another rigid outing for the self-proclaimed Geshe. Comparing this to genuine and authentic Buddhist authors will instantly reveal the inadequacies of this title. It is no more than \\"pop\\" Buddhism for the \\"new age\\" Western Buddhist mind rather than a serious commentary, which it purports to be. Again, with all the other commentaries available on Bodhisattva vows, pick a title written by a genuine and authentic Buddhist author instead of this narrow-minded book. Virtually any title would be better than this one, but an excellent book that immediately comes to mind and also available from Amazon is: NO TIME TO LOSE: A TIMELY GUIDE TO THE WAY OF THE BODHISATTVA by PEMA CHODRON.I only write this because readers need to know the author is not an authority on his subject matter as he claims to be, and therefore, the information contained within the book is misleading. Would you buy a health book by an author who uses the title \\"doctor\\" when there is no actual medical diploma to back it up? If so, then you might feel comfortable taking your chances with this \\"Geshe\\" as well."}]`),W={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],H={key:0},O={key:1};function R(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=y("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",x,[(t(!0),a(w,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),p(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",O,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",H,"See more"))],8,B)):b("",!0)])}const G=u(W,[["render",R],["__scopeId","data-v-4b718a49"]]),E=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/49.md","filePath":"people/49.md"}'),L={name:"people/49.md"},q=Object.assign(L,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(G)]))}});export{E as __pageData,q as default};
