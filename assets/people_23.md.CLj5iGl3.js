It is what I would call &quot;spiritual-lite.&quot; As one who has studied and used the circle a great deal in the last five years, I am amazed at how &quot;lite&quot; this work is. Not much of any substance is found in the history of using the circle, nor of how to use it effectively and practically in day to day life or in business. A MUCH better circle book is Christina Baldwin's groundbreaking work, &quot;Calling the Circle.&quot; Which interestingly enough, Jean Shinoda Bolen herself RECOMMENDS as a &quot;truly wise guide&quot; on the back cover of &quot;Calling the Circle&quot;, as well as with a much more indepth quote of support on the inside front cover of CTC.

I have given this book to several young women who have never been in a circle before, and who haven't read much about women's spirituality or feminism. Their responses were exactly the same: &quot;Wow, that is an amazing book!&quot; I believe it will probably change their lives. As a veteran of many years of women's circles, I find it valuable too, as a crystal-clear, straightforward statement of the essence of how circles work and how they can go wrong. It's a most welcome addition to my spiritual library, and one I intend to give as a gift often.

Then I started to realize how cut off woman and men are from each other...we get so lost in comparing ourselves and feeling so isolated and becoming so fake that we dont know who we really are inside and our minds become so clouded and we can't make the right decisions.After reading this book, only took me 45 min!

The account of Peleliu was more riveting than Okinawa to me. The descriptions of fear before hitting the Peleliu beach on the initial amphibious assault, and then later on running through a hail of bullets were great. Most thought provoking was the attitude of the enemy troops versus that of the Marines - no quarter, no surrender, and the emphasis on suicidal hand-to-hand combat by enemy infiltrators at night."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This is a very good book. Why ?

Mud, constant risk, brilliant officers and idiot officers, support between small groups to achieve a larger objective - it's all in this book.I suspect in spite of all the horror, he has left some out as just sometimes you can see how some of his leaders are so stupid in their orders (when he knows the impending disasterous result from previous failures) that more expedient short cuts were applied.You feel for these guys by the end of their 62 days of constant rain, mud, digging foxholes to find rotting corpses at the bottom of the hole, and hidden, constant and deadly Jap fire on Okinawa (and over 20,000 casualties) when some rear echelon officer orders them to collect all the brass shellcases and bury the dead Japs.Get a copy, read it and get as many others to read this as possible.

I highly recommend this book for anyone wanting to know what war is like."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Every combat veteran brings us a different and unique perspective of what war is really like. But Sledge takes us a step beyond the rest. His narrative will challenge your senses with revealing images of vicious combat you have seldom encountered in books of this sort. While he respects the bravery and sacrifice of his comrades, at the same time he shows us the awful futility and sorrow of war. In vivid detail he follows the US Marines as they battle their way across the rugged islands of Peleliu and Okinawa, against a hardened determined enemy bent on total destruction. It's a heart-rending account you won't soon forget. I highly recommend reading this book you will find it fascinating, frustrating and highly instructive.

His description of life and death from within a division which suffered over 150% cascualties is unsurpassed with realism.The author compliments his memoir with footnotes of historical details while retaining the simplicity of his personal account of the campaigns from the eyes of a PFC out in front against an enemy force which is determined to fight to the death.

Sledge has no axes to grind - he just wants to tell his reader what the Pacific campaign was like for the foot soldier. The account is first person. The writing style is simple and direct. He has created a book that enagages as well as any page-turner but also teaches by giving a glimpse of a world most of us, thankfully, will never have to experience. Read it."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Not much can be added to the previous reviews of this excellent book. I have read many fine books covering the Pacific campaign during WW2 and so many referred to this book that I had to find a copy for myself. It was well worth the time and effort. I have since bought a copy for a friend here in Australia and he also ranks it in his top 10 military history books. The author offers an insight into what its like to be in combat rarely found in most books nowadays. This is an honest, at times sad and occassionaly funny, look at the life of a combat Marine during the final battles in the Pacific. This book cannot be recommended highly enough!"},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This is an extraordinary memoir, not least because of its plain honesty and sometimes matter-of-fact delivery. That Mr. Sledge is not a literary stylist or professional writer gives his account of the nightmare of battle added weight and terror--we get the real story as it was lived. Such a book shows just how wrong Hollywood usually is when dealing with the subject of combat, particularly when it tries to make savages and lunatics of the men who fought and died. They were more often than not ordinary men who found that they were capable of extraordinary courage and valor in the face of unspeakable savagery. This book shows the stark, terrifying reality of war in an unforgettable way. There are lessons here that desperately need to be learned. As Mr. Sledge writes, \\"With privilege comes responsibility.\\" Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Eugene B. Sledge, a young man from Mobile, Alabama later to be a Ph.D. college professor, joined the Marines right after Pearl Harbor, and soon found himself engaged, along with thousands of other Marines, in two of the most horrific battles of the Pacific War, first Peleliu, and then Okinawa.The decision to take Peleliu has been debated to this day. Originally considered to be a necessary operation to protect McArthur's flank during the retaking of the Philippines, the battle for Peleliu, begun in September 1944, raged for two months (not the expected four days), and by the time Japanese resistance was crushed in the Urumbrogol Pocket, the Philippine Campaign was well under way. 6,500 Marines were killed or wounded out of 17,500 men, and 3,300 men of the Army's 81st Infantry Division were killed or wounded out of 11,000. The 1st Marine Division (\\"The Old Breed\\") was rendered hors de combat until April of 1945. These were the highest casualties to ratio of any Pacific battle.Almost all the 11,000 Japanese defenders died. 202 civilian Japanese workers were taken prisoner, and 27 Japanese troops remained in hiding, refusing to surrender until 1947.Professor Sledge, (he was euphoniously nicknamed \\"Sledgehammer\\" by his comrades, not for any especial toughness) was an ordinary Marine Private, trained as a mortarman, who found himself ashore on the vast coral rock that was Peleliu. Unlike previous Pacific battles where Japanese troops committed mass suicide while being cut down during insane banzai charges, the Peleliu defenders dug in and picked Marines off one at a time from the caves and rocky defiles of Peleliu's stony but convoluted surface.Professor Sledge wrote WITH THE OLD BREED as a personal reminiscence never intending it for publication, and as such it is an unpolished classic of World War Two literature. Sledge managed to retain an amazing amount of detail in his mind (with the aid of some scribbled notes), a task made even more amazing when a reader considers how emotionally and physically exhausted he had to have been in the midst of combat.A few reminiscences are amusing (he describes a hard-bitten World War I veteran who washed his \\"equipment\\" with an army brush), while others are nakedly sentimental (when he writes of the men he knew who died, it is with the obvious glitter of tears in his eyes), but for the most part, his reminiscences are simply, brutally, honest.WITH THE OLD BREED is an anti-war book, but not because Sledge has an \\"agenda\\". If anything, he honors \\"The Old Breed\\" highly for its storied history. Sledge does not speak of the glory battle or wave the flag. Instead, he tells us that a simple compliment from an experienced combat veteran meant more to him than any medal he could have won. He cannot say enough about the bravery and sacrifice of the men who fought and who were wounded and who died doing a necessary (if distasteful) task in a hellish place.I doubt there is anyone who can read WITH THE OLD BREED without being somehow changed.Sledge brings us right into the forefront of battle, where the stench of bloated, gaseous, and bursting corpses is in competition with the noisome exhalation of human excrement, the foul odor of discarded rotting rations, the coppery smell of drying blood, and the stink of cordite. Huge land crabs scuttle amongst the dead eating their eyes, and huge green bottle flies---so glutted they will not move---fester on wounds, and rise up from maggot-ridden torn dead flesh to infest the men's food supplies.The Marines trapped in the midst of this netherworld are reduced to eating nothing but cold fly-infested K rations and drinking oil-tainted water; they live for weeks on end covered in layers of coral dust baked shell-like by drenching rainstorms and prodigious heat over 100*. And they must contend with an implacable Japanese soldiery, given to committing atrocities indiscriminately upon the living and the dead. Sledge writes of the horrifyingly atavistic night sounds of Marines in foxholes engaged in grappling knife combat with Japanese infiltrators. He makes no bones about it. He hates his Japanese enemies and takes a grim satisfaction in their deaths.The Battle of Okinawa, while less otherworldly than Peleliu, was a battle fought upon Japanese home territory, and, if anything, the enemy was even more implacable there, having to be driven out of its redoubts man by man. Sledge tells us of the endless cacophony of Okinawa, of machine guns rattling endlessly, bombs dropping, shells bursting, men screaming in pain or fear or rage.Unlike blazing, rocky Peleliu, Okinawa was a world of mud and chill rains, a world where Marine progress was measured in feet per day, a world of death, where a man digging a foxhole might uncover a mud-buried corpse being greedily devoured by insects. Sledge tells of of his daily post overlooking a foxhole wherein a slain Marine's body, unable to be buried in the midst of the battle, slowly decomposed before his eyes, and how this ghastly sight has never left him.Of 183,000 Allied troops committed on Okinawa, over 84,000 were killed or wounded. Japanese losses were over 110,000 of 120,000, mostly killed.Somehow, amidst all the killing, Sledge (and most of his fellows) avoided going mad or being reduced to human wreckage. Sledge was not only one of the few of The Old Breed who survived both battles, he survived miraculously unscathed physically. There is no question in Sledge's mind that the war he fought was a \\"good war.\\" But he questions the human toll of any war.So would anyone who reads WITH THE OLD BREED. War may in fact be a necessary evil at times, but if it is, it must be the last of all possible options. Because, in the end, despite the banners and the speeches, only the flies benefit."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"The content of this book defies description. At numerous occasions while reading this memoir I had to stop and remind myself that all of these things truly happened. When combat veterans talk about the inability of noncombatants to grasp war, I believe I have a slightly greater appreciation for what they mean. I noticed that my mind tended to lapse into the book like any other story of fiction, except the indescribable horror, blackness, and utter hellishness that Mr. Sledge describes was all too real to him and the front line men he served with whose blood, viscera, and innocence stained the corral and mud of the many islands they fought on. His descriptions in the book are so strong and unforgettable that for very brief moments of time the fog of fiction that clouded my mind was lifted and I found myself shocked beyond words. For example, one passage that evoked in me a great feeling of sadness and remorse for the innocence these men left behind on our behalf came when Sledge stared down at a Marine corpse, he says:\\"Every time I looked over the edge of that foxhole down into that crater, the half-gone face leered up at me with a sardonic grin. It was as though he was mocking our pitiful efforts to hang on to life in the face of the constant violent death that had cut him down. Or maybe he was mocking the folly of war itself: \\"I am the harvest of man's stupidity. I am the fruit of the holocaust. I prayed like you to survive, but look at me now. It is over for us who are dead, but you must struggle, and will carry the memories all your life. People back home will wonder why you can't forget\\"\\".We who have never fought and tasted the bitter essence of war can never know, and thank God for that. But if you want perhaps the slightest inkling of why Sledge and men like him can't forget, read this book. Just read this book."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Me and my family were shortly going to California and some of the family went to Hastings to quickly pick up a CD or book for the trip. I've wanted this book for a couple years and when I saw it, this would be the perfect thing to read while driving all the way from Idaho to Cali. I've seen the 5 star rating on Amazon and had high expectations for this book.All I have to say is, that this is one of the few times, where my expectations were extremely high and they were actually beaten. I found out this was more than just a book... Reading this, you truly get a sense of World War II in the Pacific. This War was messed up, this just wasn't some tough adventure, this was survival. The enemy they were fighting was an unpredictable enemy and ruthless enemy, that did not surrender to anyone. The Japanese soldiers would even jump into your fox-hole at night and stab you while asleep and shell you unforgivably. I learned the people who went over there are heroes. I have a deeper respect for those Marines who fought. Throughout Sledge's hellish life in War, you get to know him, you understand the pain and loss he has to go through and through these conditions he becomes a new desensitized man. This book brought a tear to my eye at times, made me laugh out loud and at times horrify and disgust me. The images that you create from the text you read are powerful. I'm reading 'China Marine' right now, which is the sequel, which is great as well. If you only read one book about World War II, this is the book you should read. A book that will be with you your entire life. This is a disturbing book, but that just makes it all much more memorable and true. A real eye opener for me. 5 stars."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I bought this book because of the HBO series The Pacific. My father was there during WWII as a Sailor. The book was excellent . I especially liked the fact that it was from the man on the line view. Other books i have read were not as gritty and the real facts of life as this. It was how they lived, getting ammo, food, taking a crap. The friendship and shared reality that they may not live. One of the best I have read in a while. I have recomended it to several of my friends."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"After watching HBO's THE PACIFIC, I just had to learn more about the Marines' war in the Pacific and WITH THE OLD BREED was a great place to start. Although I was a history major, my knowledge of the Pacific was sketchy at best as my Dad and others I knew fought in Europe. For example, while I'd heard of Peleliu I knew virtually nothing of the horrific fighting and conditions there - guess generals and historians aren't likely to write much about battles that probably didn't need to be fought! But for the guys on the ground the death and carnage was just as real as it was for those at more \\"decisive\\" battles. Sledge wrote history from a marine's eyes/ears/nose on the ground but with a perspective straight from the heart and conscience. History is what happens not only to the influential and famous, but, as Eugene Sledge vividly reminds us, to regular folks who get caught up in events. One of the best war history books I've ever read."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Near the end of the book, Sledge laments his skill as a storyteller, wishing that he had the right words to finish up his details about the battles he fought in the Pacific in the Second World War. Alas, there is no summation, and this is not a defect in Sledge's narrative skills. Instead it is a reflection of the reality of modern war.Noncombatants the world over may have known that old lie: \\"Dulce and decorum est pro patria mori.\\" We have moved away from a glorification of warfare, in part I think because the ambiguity of the major wars we have fought since the Japanese surrender. Yet we still fit the events of WWII as part of some grand narrative in two parts - a race from Pearl Harbor to Berlin and Tokyo. Sledge shows the lie and the actual terror of the combatant and the unreality of war. One of the most telling things for me was that even after the fact and with access to resources he is often unable to exactly figure out where he is in time and space.Sledge lived to tell the tale; through two major battles he avoided the \\"law of averages\\" and missed out on the Purple Heart. He was one of the lucky ones, but this book is not about him. This book is about all those who were not a lucky as he was and all the men of the armed forces that found shallow graves on lonely islands in the Pacific. He writes a fitting eulogy for all those lost men; it is an eulogy too often told."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This is a personal account of the harrowing and brutal fighting and horror these brave men faced and hand-to-hand fighting seemingly without parallel in the annals of U.S. warfare.These are the unrelenting, earth shattering and macabre experiences that show how their love for each other did as much for their perseverence as any training or experience ever did. Courage beyond belief, and tragedy without let up until literally the last volleys were expended, and the last Japs and Marines, dead.They lived with death, dying and destruction, artillery noise that shattered eardrums,unthinkable wounds, concussions, shattered bodies hanging in trees, screaming and insanity often minute by minute hour by hour day by day and sometimes, week by week...without letup.

A classmate said he thought he had a book about my dad's outfit and brought in \\"With The Old Breed\\"...I read it that night cover to cover. I called my dad the next day and described the book, and I only wish I would have recorded what he said. He started talking about what happened there like it was last week, not 45+ years before! I called EB Sledge and had the honor of talking with him about the book and told him the affect on my dad. He said that it took years of prompting by family and friends to write the book because he knew there were so many like my dad who would not talk about how bad those battles were...and that the affect the book had on my father was further payment and satisfaction that he had done the right thing. My father was actually inspired to join the Old Breed Organization and he made contact with old friends...my father had a work accident and later died of his injuries in 1996. I am so glad I read this book and sent it to my father, and I just purchased another one to send to the son of another Old Breed member. It is indeed a classic epic of history thanks to EB Sledge."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"The vast majority of military books are written by the Generals who look at and analyse battles and wars from a \\"chess board\\" perspective; move this corps, support this division , bring up the reserve battalion , watch the flanks, call in an air strike, bomb the planned assault area. Good reading, but they do not go to the front, charge over ground that only the infantry do, sometimes without support knowing that this could be their last day.\\"With the Old Breed\\" does for WW2 what \\"All Quiet in the Western Front\\" did for WW1. This has to be the most gripping and honest book about two of the most horrific battles of WW2. The reader can smell the death, the fear , the hunger and the filth.It further reinforces that the generation that fought WW2 was the greatest generation of them all. They went through a depression, fought this terrible war and then went on to rebuild great nations. My and future generations owe them a debt we can never repay."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I have read many histories of WWII battles, and this is the best. A well-written account by a person who experienced the horrors of the invasions, and you have a better understanding of what the marines and soldiers went through to capture these islands."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"It was not a story as much as a documentary on what took place at Peleliu and Okinawa, uncut, unedited and with the covers thrown back. After reading the book, I had my good friend read it. He was a jungle fighter in Greece against the Nazis and later became a US soldier. His brother, it turns out, actually fought in Peleliu and Okinawa. My friend broke down and cried because he now knew, after all these years, what his brother went through and how bad it really was. He told me he wished he'd known this long ago. That his brother had kept it all in and their relationship had suffered because of it. To Mr. Sledge, my good friend, my own brother, Dave Latoria, John Veremis, Jerral Hancock and all those who have served, I say I owe you a great debt of gratitude and Thank You!"},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Eugene Sledge's vivid first hand accounts of the battles for Peleliu and Okinawa. If your interest is WWII history, the war in the Pacific, or Marine Corps history, this book is essential. Sledge portrays combat in the pacific so well the reader is right beside Sledge, enduring the hot humidity of Peleliu, the cold rain of Okinawa, and the fear and horror of war. A superb book.German Paratroops in North Africa: Tropical Uniforms, Headgear, and Insignia of the Fallschirmjager in World War II"},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I was first inspired to read this book after watching HBO's Series \\"The Pacific\\", which had Gene Sledge as one of its focal characters. Although the series and the book cover much of the same material and experiences, the book is still definitely worth reading. \\"With the Old Breed\\" is an amazingly well-written personal account of an enlisted Marine's experiences during the carnage of battle for control of Pacific islands.This book is so well-written that most should be able to finish it in a few hours. Sledge writes in a very honest, personal style, which makes his experiences appear much more genuine than many other accounts. He does not attempt to glorify the USA, war, the Marines, or himself, but simply tells it like it was. His accounts of the true personal privations during combat, as well as the horrible suffering during the war differ greatly from most histories which are very matter of fact and focus on generalities, while ignoring what the individual felt and experienced. His accounts of interactions with other servicemembers, as well as the Japanese, are also very fascinating.As this book was written as a personal narrative, I would not recommend the book if you are looking for a detailed history of the Pacific battles. Sledge does not go into great detail describing the campaigns. But if you are interested in WWII history, the US Marine Corps, or just generally would like to know more about what servicemembers went through during the Pacific campaigns of WWII, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This classic is the definitive work on the war in the Pacific and the culture of the United States Marines in World War II. Sledge gives a deeply human account of warfare as seen by the grunt on the front lines of battle.From the oppressive tropical heat and thirst of Peleliu to the cold, wet, slimy mud of Okinawa, Sledge takes the reader on a journey with the First Marine Division - The Old Breed - through the depths of depravity and the unspeakable horrors of war as fought by rules established by the Japanese.Heroic acts of bravery were rampant and ordinary as young Marines fought to survive the dreadful brutality and mindless killing that were their daily companions. Few emerged unscathed from the ferocious battles that cost too many their lives and many others their souls.Sledge was one of the fortunate ones who returned home and eventually exorcised his own demons through the telling of his story. This book is a page-turner that will both inform and delight those with even a passing interest in World War II.John E.

What he made it through without being wounded (at least not physically) is hard to believe until you read about it."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Fantastic accounting of the war in the Pacific. Written by someone in the thick of the action and in a manner that has you not wanting to put down the book!"},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This is one of the best books that I have ever read. It is written extremely well. I had trouble putting the book down. This book describes in great detail the horrors and hardships that the Marines faced in WWII during the battles of Peleliu and Okinawa from a grunt Marine's perspective. After reading this book, you will have a genuine appreciation for the sacrifices made by the young men, many in their teens, who fought one of the most horrific campaigns in U.S. military history.

Just buy it!"},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"There are numerous written accounts from the infantryman's point of view of the Pacific theater of War. Sledge's masterpiece,is without equal, it draws you back again and again, not for the brutal horror of the experiences, but more to share in the search for humanity and meaning to where none seems to reside. The humor is there as it's own defense mechanism and moments of comfort are fleeting."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Eb Sledge is the man.

This is an incredible story told from a participant's perspective and is really true to life down to the smallest detail. It gives some much credibility/testimony to the heroic men and women who served in some of the most horrible little known campaigns during WWII. This is a good read for anyone who is really interested in what the Marines are truly like, what WWI in the Pacific was like and why we should be greatful for their heroic sacrifices."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This is a riveting story of Sledge's WWII experiences. He writes in a very easy to follow manner, while giving you great details as to what was going on. As far as I'm concerned, this book should be strongly recommended reading in our schools."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"As with any book that is exceptional and has been around awhile, the so called \\"experts\\" have to put in their two cents worth and turn this wonderful account into a textbook. I skipped the introductions because they were full of plot spoilers and discussion regarding the plot spoilers. I have never understood why editors put that stuff first, when it should go last. I suggest you skip the intros and come back to them after you have finished reading Sledge's account.The story was artfully done. Details that only someone who experienced the situations would know abound all around in this story. God speaking to him was a little much, but he was in a super stressful situation, which could have caused him to hear a voice, saying what he wanted to hear. The voice was strong and vivid. The imagery was excellent. I laughed. I cried. I felt profound sorrow. Any book that can produce any one of those emotions is well-written. This one produced them all. Well done Sledges!I've already told my friends and family to read this."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I was expecting a good book from other reviews. Sledgehammer wrote what I consider the best first person account I have ever read in 4 decades of reading books on WWII. It is personal and poignant. The inhumanity of man to man is brought out as well as the tenderness of those who serve under great pressure. Best WWII book ever."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This book was outstanding. You really felt like you were there with Sledge in the horrible battles he endured. I also appreciate how he took the time to describe the unsightly details of battle which make us appreciate our warriors that much more."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"If your a history buff or Marine this is a must read.

I was taken on a journey, albeit a breif one, through this man's experiences in one of the most turbulent places in American history. It kept me always wanting to read more. I wish I could say more to describe this work, but I don't think words alone can tell the entire story (war and all of his experiences) but what's written is truly history."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This book was a great first hand account of the war and what Marines faced during the Pacific campaign. With The Old Breed is a good read."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"My mother and aunts and uncles lived though the experience of WWII and shared stories of the loved ones they lost then. This has fostered my intense interest in the war over the past 25 or so years. I find that Sledge's book is probably the best at describing the extreme range of emotions experienced by veterans of that war, particularly the foot solders.I have had the privilege of talking with many veterans of WWII (many of whom are now departed), and while they spoke freely of their experiences, they usually tended to stay away from discussing their own trials. They focused on the highlights of their campaigns, comedic events, and their fallen brothers (who they universally consider heroes).I think \\"With The Old Breed\\" provides an insight to the part of war that all these veterans felt reticent to share.Again, \\"With the Old Breed\\" is not a dashing story, but it spills out the human emotions of the infantryman as well as any I have read."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This true story genuinely rings true as it takes you back to the forties and the hardships of WW2 combat. This author makes you feel that you are there with him more and better than any that I have read. There is little military jargon to inhibit understanding by readers with no familiarity with the military.I thoroughly enjoyed reading this story on my kindle."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"All of the 5 star ratings are accurate. This is an incredible telling of a marine grunt's view of brutal combat against the Japanese during WW2 at Peleliu and Okinawa. It is one of those books you cannot put down. Terse and gripping. Not a lot of philosophy or discussion of broader war strategy or tactics. But boy does it convey a sense of life in the ranks. Great character sketches of good and bad soldiers and officers. Also an important portrayal of how vicious the Japanese soldiers were and how necessary the atomic bombs were to end this war and spare our soldier from further brutality and death. Useful maps and commentary to supplement the writing.I read this after reading George Feifer'sThe Battle of Okinawa: The Blood and the Bomb, which helped provide a useful context of Sledge's marine's-eye view of the fighting.The Kindle version gets only 3 stars because a number of the maps were not oriented properly for the Kindle Fire, such that the map kept turning when I rotated the Fire to get a proper alignment. Jumping to and from the footnotes also was problematic because of placement of the links too close to the page edge."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"After 40 years of reading about World War II and military history in general, I've just finished the best war memoir out there. \\"With The Old Breed\\" -- which along with Robert Leckie's \\"Helmet for my Pillow\\" was relied upon for the HBO mini-series \\"The Pacific\\" -- is in a class by itself. Want to know what it's like to be Marine? Want to read what war is really like? Want to get a taste for what action in the Pacific theater looked, smelled, sounded and felt like? Read this book. There is no way one could read this book and ever forget it. This book, in its spare, unpretentious prose, details action on Peleliu and Okinawa and absolutely blows away Leckie's account, which read more like an artsy-fartsy satire and failed to capture the esprit de corps of the United States Marine Corps. By turns chilling, gruesome, heartbreaking, exciting and captivating, the book is impossible to put down. If you decide to read only one war memoir, this should be it. Never has there been a book that precisely details the debilitating effects that war has on the body, mind and spirit. It's a unique and terrifying look inside hell, plain and simple. Filled with pride, pathos and a faith in one's brothers in the Corps, this book will mesmerize you for years to come. Not only will you never think about war or its participants the same, you will hardly be able to believe people can live through trauma like this. You will never get closer to the realities of war unless you go there yourself. Don't waste any more time thinking about it. This book is the first and last word in accounts of its kind. Buy it!"},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This book takes war for all it is. War is brutal and Sledge does not hide any of it. He brings the war to you clearly and plainly. He is not an author, he is a writer simply writing about what he say, felt, and experienced. After reading this book there is no way you will not have a whole new appreciation for &quot;The Big Red One&quot; and all military units. This is the best book recounting WWII out there. It has a clarity and honesty that no reporter could get, this book is from a front line solider and shows what he saw. Absolutely superb."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Shows how savage the war in the Pacific could, and did, become."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I have read many combat veterans accounts of battle. This book is the most compelling so far. Sledge has a way of telling a calm and sane story that could never be calm nor sane. The fact that this was written by a frontline Marine is what makes it so unique. This is a great book for anyone but especially someone interested in becoming a Marine."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"The best book I have ever read. His horrific accounts of the war are spellbinding, but at the same time shocking. He gets down to details of the war on the two islands. A very graphic book explaining the horrors of war. Yet Sledge has a keen understanding for humanity at all its cost. Very well writen. I can not say enought about this book . I great buy for anyone. VERY INTRESTING"},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I felt the author did an outstanding job telling his story of war. Mr. Sledge shows that being an infantryman in a war zone is one of the most difficult things that one could be asked to do. His descriptions of the battlefield and horror of war overshadow everything I had ever seen or heard. Also, I see the comradship that he formed with the other men he served with. I thoroughly enjoyed reading his book and would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This description of the nature of military combat as experienced by the frontline fighter is the best of its kind I have read. The writing is clear, direct, and honest. One can understand how this brief, intense moment in Gene Sledge's life left a searing and indelible impression.The great value of the book is that it strips war of its gloty and romance. Gene saw and understood the necessity of the effort in which he was a part, but regretted that necessity, and he deplored the brutality and horror which characterized it.For those who would understand the nature of close military combat, the price it exacts from those who engage in it, and the debt we owe them, it is required reading."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I was a Marine in the Gulf War, and earned a couple other combat action ribbons. Of course, never had to go through what the Marines of WWII did. But the thing I loved the most about this book compared to other accounts of war, is the details he mentions. Like how fighting for weeks without bathing or even shaving can have a real impact on you. And what it's like in a foxhole during a war. For anyone that thought D-Day or any of the Marine landings in the Pacific had glamour and excitement, really needs to read this."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This fascinating and sometimes shocking book is a must have for any WWII history buff. Some of the Author's recolations are truely unforgetable. I've read a lot of books on the war but this has to be one of the five best."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Somehow my recollection of Dr. Sledge as my cheerful, quiet-mannered, humble (but tough!) zoology professor is stood on its head after reading his book. How did this gentleman live through such stark and utter hell? How could anyone? But he tells you -- his fine scientific mind observant and sparing no detail to clouded memory or gentrified constraints -- so Peleliu and Okinawa are beyond my words (but no longer beyond my imagination). No one who has not endured the horror of entrenched infantry warfare could adequately describe it; but this book helps any reader who hasn't -- like me -- begin to fathom its terror. And as we begin to take it in, we realize what an enormous legacy of sacrifice that generation left us, that \\"with privilege comes responsibility,\\" as Dr. Sledge says. How can we ever repay these numbed, reluctant heroes? I suspect we never can. But we can listen to some who were lucky enough to survive, and never forget those countless boys and men who came out maimed, or just didn't come out at all. We owe them all a tremendous debt of gratitude for the lives we lead today, and this book tells you, in graphic and heart-gripping detail, exactly why.(May you Rest in Peace now, Dr. Sledge. Thank you.)"},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"My father was in the 11th marines on both Peleliu and Okinawa.

As a teenager, I worked for a guy in Mobile, AL who was a Marine Raider in the Pacific in WWII and the descriptions in this book mirror some of the horror he used to describe when he had too much to drink (like many, it was the only time he would ever talk about it).

IT was well written with exellent detail from a participant. It was an excellent book. I had watched the Pacific and it was a great follow up to that. It made me rewatch some of the DVD after reading the book."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"E.B. \\"Sledgehammer\\" Sledge writes an amazing memoir of the Marine Corps in WWII and one of its great, forgotten battles, Peleliu. Sledge brings home the utter brutality of war in vivid descriptions. You have to wonder how different WWII might have been if we had the same ease of instant communications that we have today. The soldiers, sailors and Marines of that era were so isolated in these forlorn locations.His insights on human nature, the esprit de corps of the US Marines and the bonds that are forged in war are just great."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"With the Old Breed should be required reading in our classrooms, for this is the brutal reality of war at its most horrific. No sensationalism here; E. B. Sledge merely tells it the way it was. There is no glory in war, in the shedding of another man's blood; in digging a foxhole in a torrential downpour only to uncover the badly decomposing body of a Japanese soldier crawling with maggots; in watching helplessly as four of your comrades retrieve, on a stretcher, a wounded Marine amid machinegun fire (\\"If it were me out there,\\" Sledge recounts, \\"I would want to know I wouldn't be left behind.\\"); in enduring a night while being shelled by enemy artillery; in stumbling upon fellow Marines that have been tortured, decapitated and butchered in the worst way imaginable; in suffering sleep deprivation, from malaria and jungle rot, and from hunger, thirst, and, alternately, heat and cold. This is why war should be avoided at all costs, and this is why no one man should ever be given the authority, with a flourish of his signature, to risk the lives of young men and women.My dad fought on Okinawa, receiving a citation from the office of the president for his participation in the taking of Shuri Ridge. I never knew my dad as a Marine, as he retired from the Corps before getting married and starting a family. I asked him once, when I was a boy, to tell me about his service, but he refused. I asked him again, about six and a half years ago, during the final year of his life, and he again refused. I had hoped that by sharing his pain a healing could take place. Unfortunately, what he saw, what he endured, died with him.Sledge, in this memoir of his service on Peleliu and Okinawa, told me everything my dad withheld from me. This incredible account, told with frank detachment, is hailed as the best World War II memoir of an enlisted man, and with good reason. Part adventure, part history, \\"Sledgehammer\\" not only relates many of the clich&eacute;s every Hollywood movie depicted on the subject, but also everything they left out.Thanks, Sledgehammer, for sharing your story, and my dad's, with me. He perhaps felt I couldn't understand what he endured. Perhaps no civilian can. Yet after having read With the Old Breed, I understand a little better why he was the way he was.Your generation is truly the greatest generation."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"&quot;With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa&quot; by Eugene B. Sledge was highly recommended by a graduate student in Military History who insisted on this is the best memoir book on World War II available. Eugene B. Sledge or known as Sledgehammer by his fellow Marines provided a detailed account of the battles in Peleliu and Okinawa which was both horrifying and insightful. Sledge started off the book with his boot camp training and how he discontinued his officer training program to participate in the war as an enlisted man.The descriptions that Sledge provided was unbelievably vivid. He described the terrified feeling of being constantly shelled by the enemy while staying in the foxhole, of running in the open space while being shot at and having to live in a dirty, and muddy condition. The part that really got my attention was when he described the dead bodies of men, deteriorating beyond recognition and the stench that filled the air.&quot;With the Old Breed&quot; is written in a simple way to tell a very complicating story. Sledge did not use too many military jargons that might confused the average readers. This book provides a very detailed description of life during war. In addition, the book also revealed the close bonds that were formed among the marines and how they came to value each other. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about a soldier's life during World War II, particularly the pacific theater."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"A sensitive and perceptive young college freshman from south Alabama, Eugene B. Sledge volunteered for Marine Corps officer training school during the middle of W.W. II. However, such was Sledge's desire to join the fighting before the war ended, he purposefully flunked out of school and promptly joined the ranks of the enlisted Marines.Upon reporting to boot camp in San Diego, Sledge was introduced to his Drill Instructor with this eye-opening greeting: \\"If any of you idiots think you don't need to follow my orders, just step right out here and I'll beat your @ss right now. Your soul may belong to Jesus, but your @ss belongs to the Marines. You people are recruits. You're not Marines. You may not have what it takes to be Marines.\\"Fortunately, Sledge did indeed have what it took to be a Marine, and he has written WITH THE OLD BREED: AT PELELIU AND OKINAWA, an engaging personal chronicle of the horror of war as seen through the eyes of a young Marine grunt. Though this book is a personal account of historical events, it reads like a novel. Sledge is able to transform the course language of a salty Marine and the brutality of war into unembellished passages whose honesty have a grotesque lyrcism:\\"The situation was bad enough, but when the enemy artillery shells exploded in the area, the eruptions of soil and mud uncovered previously buried Japanese dead and scattered chunks of corpses. Like the area around our gun pits, the ridge was a stinking compost pile.If a Marine slipped and slid down the back slope of the muddy ridge, he was apt to reach the bottom vomiting. I saw more than one man lose his footing and slip and slide all the way to the bottom only to stand up horror-stricken as he watched in disbelief while fat maggots tumbled out of his muddy dungaree pockets, cartridge belt, legging lacings, and the like. Then he and a buddy would shake or scrape them away with a piece of ammo box or a knife blade.We didn't talk about such things. They were too horrible and obscene for even hardened veterans. The conditions taxed the toughest I knew almost to the point of screaming. Nor do authors normally write about such vileness; unless they have seen it with their own eyes, it is too preposterous to think that men could actually live and fight for days and nights under such terrible conditions and not be driven insane. But I saw much of it there on Okinawa and to the me the war was insanity.\\"WITH THE OLD BREED does not concern itself with a the strategic and tactical campaign of the Pacific Island hopping campaign. Rather, it is a a fascinating portrait of an sensitive young man's baptism under fire -- a first hand narrative of an ordinary young man's extraordinary bravery on a few remote Islands in the Pacific Ocean. No W.W.II library is complete without this book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This is the first book I have read about the War in the Pacific as faced by the Marines but what I have heard about this theater previously was put into even more harsh words from a participant (Sledge). This text is definately easy to read, Sledge is not a very verbose person, but this makes the book quite enjoyable and I have had problems putting it down since I picked it up. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the Pacific Theather."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Of the many books on the various battles between the US and its enemies, only those written from participants provide a true insight into the conflict. In fact, usually the best books are not written by those behind the lines calling the shots, but those who were on the front lines. Indeed, I had previously heard of the many atrocities committed by the Japanese on both civilians and combatants, but to hear first hand about what certain US troops did during and after the heat of battle was sadly educative. This book is recommended reading for anyone interested in what the Greatest Generation accomplished and it certainly made me more appreciative for our current freedom in this great country. God bless the USA."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"If your war history reading list is rich with books that take a bird's eye view of combat, try taking a beach assault into hell with E.B. &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; Sledge. I read this book after reading &quot;Wartime&quot; by Paul Fussell who recommends it as the best singular account of the realities of combat. It is a very detailed, gritty account of the war through the eyes of a man who survived two extremely brutal battles. The descriptions of the battlefields he fought in and the wreckage of the aftermath are priceless and hard to find in other history books. This is a great read for someone who has never been in battle or the Marines and wants to know what it's REALLY like. It's also a great warning to those who might want to start a war that will involve someone else's sons and daughters...."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This man exemplifies the citizen soldier of WWII. This kind and gentle man left the comforts of university life and played a roll in the most horrific theater of the war. He didn't let it influence him to the point that he was disfunctional but realized that he had a job to do and God willing, if he came back, he would look at things a little differently. He did just that.Eugene Sledge will always have my deepest appreciation and all those who were with him will have the same. Thank you Mr. Sledge for making the sacrifice and my bed a bit warmer. This is a must read."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"With a little different spin from author E.B. Sledge, \\"With the Old Breed,\\" a personal memoir of island fighting in the Pacific, could have turned into an anti-war tome. Sledge does convey the grinding, often futile nature, tragedy, and dehumanizing impact of war with very little glory. He also vividly describes the gore, filth, and seemingly intolerable living conditions of a battlefield. However, it is all part of the story with nothing gratuitous or unnecessary. It is hard to imagine anybody being inspired to head over to a recruiting station with the expectation of adventure and good times based on this book. There is no sweeping view of entire battles with generals directing armies. Instead, the reader is presented with a never-ending series of small battles with no apparent meaning besides destroying an enemy who refuses to surrender. Sledge fought in the battles on Peleliu and Okinawa, both among the hardest of World War II, which took its toll of his 1st Marine Division comrades one by one. On at least one occasion Sledge remarks that the only way out of the meat grinder seemed to be by death or a wound. However, Sledge's point of view is that of a proud enlisted Marine who does his duty and will not let anybody down, while managing to simply survive. Home and the non-combatant world becomes a dim and surreal memory, but he never ceases to believe in righteousness of the Marines, his nation's cause, the baseness of the enemy, with little questioning of the worth of the privations and suffering he went through. Out of this, came a pride in his service and an appreciation for everything good in life and the best of people. The result is unforgettable and another tribute to The Greatest Generation."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Anyone who believes combat is a visceral experience similar to that seen in the movie 300 needs to read this book. Mr Sledge's book is recommended reading for every enlisted Marine at the beginning of his career. I argue that it should be required reading for every elected representative before they vote to send Americans into combat."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This book delivers exactly what the reviewers say: it's not a grand overview of the war. It's only what one soldier saw through his eyes in two vicious campaigns. A young idealistic soldier heads to combat and 6 months later he is attempting to salvage gold teeth from a Japanese corpse before he comes to his senses. But plenty of other's don't. The brutality of war is vividly brought home here: the atrocities on both sides, the fear of constant bombardment by heavy guns, the friendly fire killings as well as one accidental discharge killing a best friend in the company. The survival rates here are so low it's amazing more soldiers didn't lose their minds. What this book covered that I have never seen before is the horrible conditions in the battlefield which he provides such as the stench of rotting dead bodies for days. In addition to describing this so well he also adds details of basic human bodily waste while tied to a foxhole which you must now live in for days in the rain and mud of Okinawa or the heat and coral of Pelilui allowing no ability to bury this waste. Covered for the first time are descriptions of moving equipment and supplies to the front line as well as the deadly stretcher duty of wounded soldiers with bullets flying. Maybe the most terrifying story is an open field crossing with Japanese machine guns at the end setting up a killing zone allowing about a 50% survival rate but with no other choice.In summary this is just a powerful story that needs to be read. It's neither sexy nor filled with Patriotic fervor. It's about soldiers in the worst possible conditions and the 20 feet in front of them that will determine whether they survive. And it's absolutely a chilling, must read."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"they need to read this. What an unassuming, straightforward account of two of the Pacific Theater's most terrible campaigns. Even more, what an account of life for the combat marine. Flies in c-rations, maggots on your clothes, sleep deprivation, and the sacrifice of men for their fellow men - it's all in this account. Never does Dr. Sledge, who was interviewed by Studs Terkel in The Good War, glorify himself in any way. He simply focuses on the daily struggle to survive and keep one's sanity. These were men who had a job to do, and they did it as well as they possibly could in sub-human conditions those who did not experience it could not believe. It's well-written in a down-to-earth style one might expect of a biology professor. The irony of a man who faced the dead every day returning home to study and teach about life is typical of men who went through his experiences.This is a fine read about men at war against the Japanese, the elements, themselves, and the struggle to maintain sanity. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"With the Old Breed does for World War II's Pacific Theater what Stephen Ambrose's Band of Brothers does for the war's European Theater. The difference is that Eugene B. Sledge lived through the battles he describes in this outstanding memoir of modern war. Sledge's detailed, emotionally wrought descriptions of the horrors of the World War II battlefield are reminiscent of Norman Mailer's novel, The Naked and the Dead. His firsthand accounts of ferocious combat on Peleliu in the Caroline Islands and then on Okinawa leave the reader breathless.Sledge's Marines of Kilo Company, 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines (K/3/5) of the storied 1st Marine Division are as tough as they come. Their exploits are the stuff of legends, and through their incredible courage on Peleliu and Okinawa they honor the precious legacy of the many combat Marines to come before them.The kill-or-be-killed actions of human beings essentially reduced to animals struggling for survival on a tiny coral atoll against a ruthless, fanatical and, yes, even suicidal enemy is difficult for most readers to stomach, much less comprehend. Yet, we find ourselves reading on if for no other reason than to root for the young enlisted Marines who shoulder the heaviest load in this fight. These remarkable Americans demonstrate yet again why they are collectively known as our country's Greatest Generation.Sledge's portrayal of a vicious, man-on-man fight in the South West Pacific to wrest control of a chain of seemingly insignificant islands from the desperate yet determined Japanese is at once both haunting and captivating. One alternately feels revulsion at the atrocities committed on both sides and empathy for the young Marines struggling to survive. Many barely out of high school, these 18 and 19-year-olds are thrown relentlessly into the meat grinder that was part of Admiral Chester Nimitz's Island Hopping counteroffensive. They journey from the innocence of youth into an early manhood spent 'across the sights of a rifle' or kneeling behind a mortar tube.We witness these young men participating in frontal assaults on Peleliu against an entrenched and well-equipped enemy whose capable use of machine guns and indirect fires (artillery and mortars) steadily reduces K/3/5's ranks. We see Marines desperate to dig fighting positions in virtually impenetrable coral rock... hugging the 'deck' as enemy artillery and mortar rounds bracket their positions.The Marines' steady attacks are contrasted with their brief defensive stands at night. As darkness descends on the dug-in troops so do the Japanese. The Marines find themselves in frenetic, bare-fisted fights in foxholes against a crazed, marauding enemy with fire in his belly and a rifle with razor sharp 18-inch bayonet in his hands. As we attempt to grasp these men's hellish existence on Peleliu and their struggle to defy the odds and leave the island in one piece, we are left to contemplate the utter senselessness of war... and those shocking conditions that would reduce man to his basest instincts.In addition to his account of the fight for Peleliu (referred to as the 'Peleliu Campaign'), Sledge relates his experiences during the fight for Okinawa ('the Okinawa Campaign').The Okinawa Campaign oddly begins quietly as the invasion is largely uncontested. Remarkably, given the island's proximity to the Japanese mainland, the Marines initially do not encounter the same 'chaotic maelstrom' that they experienced on Peleliu. Instead, we readers are treated to descriptions of an idyllic, almost serene, Okinawan countryside and occasional encounters with a few friendly Okinawans.But the calm the Marines experience belies what awaits them in the deep and dangerous recesses of Okinawa's system of interconnected ridges and draws. Much to K/3/5's horror, on Okinawa the Japanese have perfected the defense in depth and interlocking fires that characterized their defensive tactics toward the end of the war. And they bring to bear all the might of an increasingly desperate empire intent on sealing off their homeland from the Allied onslaught.The Japanese suck the Marines into kill zones and proceed to pick them apart through carefully targeted machine gun and rifle fire. As the casualties mount, the men of K/3/5 realize they will not have an easy time of it on Okinawa after all. The ensuing weeks find these men in a no man's land feeling Hell's fury as they face off against the bulk of the Japanese Thirty-Second Army.We readers wonder how the men of K/3/5 keep their sanity and how they are willing to continue slogging through the mud and filth to engage their merciless Japanese adversary. What is even more jaw-dropping about Sledge's experiences and what leaves the reader absolutely awestruck is how these fine, young Americans manage to continue their frontal assaults against an enemy occupying all but impregnable defenses. Amazingly, many a young Marine rifleman leaves the relative security of his foxhole on Okinawa and runs full tilt into a hailstorm of bullets and shrapnel. And falling in behind that Marine is yet another Marine! Unbelievable!While many are casualties on both Peleliu and Okinawa, it becomes obvious as one reads Sledge's story exactly how others somehow survive. Quite simply, they stay close to the 'Old Breed' - those combat-hardened, veteran Marines who have dedicated their lives to the Corps... some of whom cut their teeth at Belleau Wood in World War I... and many of whom fought on Guadalcanal, in Cape Gloucester (New Guinea) and in those many other battles in the Pacific that have inspired the legend that is the United States Marine Corps. Many of the 'Old Breed' form the vanguard of attacking Marines and set the example for the raw and inexperienced recruits.We realize then that many of the new troops fight on because they yearn to join the select few - the genuine article, authentic U.S. Marines... and the very pride of the Corps. Men such as Captain Andrew A. ('Ack Ack') Haldane and Gunnery Sergeant Elmo M. Haney, veritable demigods among American fighting men, assume almost mythic proportions to the younger members of K/3/5. Sledge and those like him internalize USMC lore and aspire to be combat Marines who serve selflessly and valorously... and who reflect the finest traditions of the Corps.As Sledge points out without a hint of humor, men like Haldane and Haney are not 'born of woman, but are issued to the Marine Corps.' To receive the approval of men like these is to finally join the ranks of the few, the proud...Sledge nearly bursts with pride when he hears 'the simple, sincere personal remarks' of a veteran Marine after his (Sledge's) actions on Peleliu. The veteran Marine offers the following comments to his young comrade:\\"But I kept my eye on you on Peleliu and by God you did OK; you did OK.\\"While the veteran's comments seem modest, Sledge goes on to say that he \\"carried those words in [his] heart with great pride and satisfaction ever since they were uttered.\\"With the Old Breed is an extraordinary tale of man at war and will forever remain one of the most authentic, vivid stories of an enlisted man's experiences on the front lines ever told. Sledge's writing is characterized by great depth of feeling, honesty, and clarity. The realism with which he depicts the battlefield enables the reader to practically experience for himself the sights, sounds, and even smells of battle.With the Old Breed, however, is about much more than war and the depths of man's inhumanity. Throughout his memoir, Sledge liberally sprinkles humorous anecdotes and subtle musings on the bonds that form between men fighting for survival while exposed to the nightmarish conditions of modern combat. So, With the Old Breed offers a deeply meaningful and enduring commentary about devotion to duty, loyalty, and brotherhood.Ultimately, though, Sledge's message is really much deeper even than that. As horrifying as his experiences were on Peleliu and Okinawa and despite his decrying war as \\"brutish, inglorious, and a terrible waste\\", Sledge acknowledges that we as Americans are sometimes called to sacrifice for our country and for those many freedoms we hold dear.Freedom is not free!As The Old Breed is fond of saying, \\"If the country is good enough to live in, it's good enough to fight for.\\"A Classic!"},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"One difference between Band of Brothers and \\"With the Old Breed\\" is that in Band of Brothers at least there is a \\"Band\\" left at the end. My father was with the First Marines and made it past the first few days on Peleliu. A major regreet for me was that he never said anything substantial to anyone about the canal, the cape or Peleliu. He would never volunteer information and for a long time I didn't know enough to ask. By the time I did, that world and time no long existed to him. Evidently books like Sledge's are the only rare accounts of what happened on the ground. Few people could relate the horror the First marines went through. I was a corpsman in Nam and realize want words can't relate, but Sledge does an admirable job."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Wow!!! Sledge eloquently exposes the misery and ultimate madness of war. We owe much to our brave soldiers. All politicians should read this book to gain a sense of the sacrifice that our soldiers,past and present, have endured."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This was another book that was assigned by my college history professor. This book was a very easy read and I was compelled to not put it down. Unlike Sajer's book, this one was historically accurate and when the author could not remember a certain place or name, he said so in the book. His accounts of the battles of Pelelieu and Okinawa are gruesome and gives the reader a sense of the feelings and fears of combat. I am a combat veteran as well, and it stirred up feelings I had forgotten about. This is an excellent book and it would make a great addition to any history or military book collection."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Frequently I am disappointed by things that are given glowing recommendations and then fail to live up to the hype. This book, however, not only lived up to the rave reviews, it went far beyond anything I had expected. I can honestly say that With the Old Breed is the BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ.I am fortunate that I have never had to face anything even mildly resembling what Dr. Sledge suffered through while serving his country. I have read much military history, but this book slaps you in the face and punches you in the gut with its stark realism and brutal honesty. We all know that warfare is messy business and that infantry combat tries even the toughest soldiers, but this book shows the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual struggles of the riflemen for what they are---fatal for many, crippling for most, and approaching the unendurable for all.I simply cannot comprehend the fear, suffering, exhaustion, hunger, thirst, wounds, and death that the soldiers and civilians of the WWII generation (of all nationalities) lived through. Our modern world truly owes them well more than we acknowledge. I am grateful to Dr. Sledge for enduring the unendurable, and for passing on to us his experiences, so that we can try to stop the same kinds of things from happening again."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This book is an overlooked classic, a gutwrenching page turner that will haunt you for a long time. As Paul Fussell states in the introduction, &quot;Readers of this book will find it hard to forget, and they will not easily brush away its troubling revelations about what the modern world periodically requires its boys to do and to suffer. &quot;Sledge's memoir as a Marine in the Pacific, barely out of his teens like so many others, spares no punches in describing what a battlefield looks like littered with the incredible waste of youth. It is an unedited version of the horrors and heartbreak of war told with simplicity and compassion from someone who actually lived through it. You will fully understand why so many veterans still cannot bring themselves to talk about their experiences. The fact that on Okinawa alone over 26,000 men suffered from mental and emotional breakdowns is a sobering testament to what war can do to a man.This book should be required reading for our younger generations. Why our schools are not insisting that our youth remember those who sacrificed their future so we could have ours, learning what the high cost of freedom is, and reflecting and learning from the stories of these brave, humble men is bewildering.It is interesting to note that the author put pictures of himself at the end of the book, not, as others normally would, at the beginning; a sign of his modesty.God bless the Marines and all those who sacrificed so much - We owe all our fighting men a debt that can never be repaid. Let us not ever forget."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"The best actual battlefield account I've ever read. Arrogantly called the best account \`by an enlisted man' on the back cover reviews Sledge's account transcends any attempt to classify it, in my opinion. Haunting, the reader will probably have night and day mares like those who fought in the battles Sledge describes so graphically.I was traveling around the Eastern Sierras last fall and used a Laundromat in Big Pine, CA. I noticed a USMC flag in the corner and engaged an unlikely short, spare old man around the place if he were a \`Gyrene'. He was. I asked him about his war experiences and he told me he had been a 1st Marine Division Scout on Peleliu and Okinawa, had been wounded and spent 2 YEARS IN THE HOSPITAL UPON HIS RETURN. I immediately recognized him as being one of America's Greatest Generation and I thanked him for serving - I said it to him several times as it did not seem to be registering. Bob did assert Sledge wasn't actually one of the \`Old Breed' as he had not served in the Cape Gloucester battle but I pointed out his title was \`With the Old Breed' and that calmed Bob down.I bought and read the Sledge book a few weeks ago and drifted by the Laundromat and looked up Bob. I gave him the book. It brought tears to his eyes to see it and I showed him the list of the very few who had survived in Sledge's company. Bob said he was sure he knew several of them and said he might get a hold of Sledge himself through the 1st Marine Division Association. Bob went to his place and got out his hard bound copy of \`The Old Breed' from which Sledge's work is named. Bob said he would get a new pair of reading glasses. I will drift by in a few weeks and he hasn't I'll offer to read Sledge to him.an excerpt from my continuing adventure journal5/29/2007 9:34 Memorial Day - Or an exercise in applied ontology....I'm at \`the office' now, my friend Chris's garage in Big Pine with my computer set up on her workbench, sitting on an old box, surrounded by dogs and cats who I have to guard against walking on my keyboard looking for pets while I'm typing. Not wanting to go in the house to use the potty I grab the mountain bike off the wall and cycle down to the Mobil station. While there I thought I'd cycle by Bob's and thank him for serving in WW 2. He was out on the sidewalk in his electric chair with the US and Marine Corps flags on the back sticking up over his oxygen bottle. I asked him what he was doing and he said, \\"Oh, just watching the world go by\\" as heavy southbound Memorial Day traffic passed. I said to Bob, \\"Happy Memorial Day, Bob. Thank you for serving in World War 2.\\" Tears welled up in his eyes and he just said thank you. I asked Bob if he had gotten any reading glasses yet so he could read the book I gave him but he said no. He was due to get a ride down to the VA hospital in Long Beach in a while where they would make some up for him. He told me of another Marine buddy of his who had died recently who was 83. I said to Bob, \\"Well, we're all getting older you know.\\"update - Veteran's Day 11/12/2007 I stopped by to see Bob yesterday after camping in the desert nearby. I flagged him down on his electric chair with the oxygen bottle on back flanked by the US and Marine Corp flags which flutter patriotically in the breeze when Bob is on the roll. I had my new girlfriend from LA with me and we thanked Bob for serving and making our current freedom and prosperity possible. When asked about \`The War' - the Ken Burns series - Bob liked it but pointed out two errors - the two lines of Marines walking toward each other was from Tarawa not Okinawa and one other shot had also been mis-captioned.Carolyn asked Bob if he and his compatriots got together for reunions - Bob replied \\"there's no one left.\\" Like most of the \`Old Breed' Marines Bob is tough. After moving to California in his 60s or so Bob pretty much lived in the backcountry of the Sierras - both by choice and necessity. He got a Pacemaker some time ago and went backpacking again and the pack straps wrecked the Pacemaker so Bob had to make an emergency trip to Long Beach to get another one.Now 83 Bob said he will be spending 3 months sometime this winter '07-\`08 at the Long Beach VA to have his rotator cuff worked on. His last name is Cox and he's originally from Coney Island if anyone is in the LA area and wants to check the VA and stop by and see him when he's \`in attendance'. Bob is one of the survivors of the last war America won before our military was high jacked by the incompetent desk jockeys in Washington who failed to prevail in Korea, Vietnam, and now Iraq. Bob reminded us that of the 253 men in his company that assaulted the ridge at Peleliu only 16 returned."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I am a big military history buff. My fascination with the subject (and history in general) is that I try to put my self in the eyes of the people who were experiencing history at that time. This is a story of war - the horrors and heroics - through the eyes of a boy less than 20 years old. EB Sledge volunteered to join the marines and fought in two of the bloodiest campaigns against the Japanese - Okinawa and Peleliu. He is not a professional writer as this book was originally written as memoirs for his family and his wife convinced him to publish. However, this book is regarded by many as one of the best books written on war. The book begins with him in boot camp to his refitting to a base to his first campaign as a \\"newbie\\" to the second campaign as a veteran. It shows the horrible side of war many of us will never know. It shows men breaking and loosing their minds. It shows the inbred hatred of the Marines against the Japanese and vice verse - something written very little about. US troops did not have the hatred against the European foes like they had against the Japanese. The Japanese stopped fighting a war to win and one to ground the the US down by simply killing as many troops as possible. Corpsman and stretcher bearers were routinely targeted. This books leaves the reader with the full understanding of honor and the esprit de corps. It shows how intimate a bond is felt between brothers in arms. It shows the reader what is it like to be on the froward lines for months and the horrors of being shelled and watching your closest friends die before you. It shows the loneliness and isolation and the desperation of wanting to die. It put me right in the midst of a war without ever having been in one. After reading this, my hear goes out even more to soldiers who have given their lives, their sanity, and their sacrifice so that me and you have our freedom. In context, this was a breed of men that most youth could not comprehend. And hopefully never will have to. This was the most realistic gripping book I have read in a long while. I could not put it down. For anyone who is a military history buff - put this on the top of your list."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This is a gripping account of combat on Peleliu and Okinawa during World War II, without embellishment, without literary flourish. The narrative is simple, unadorned, raw. Sledge--a \\"fugitive from the law of averages\\" who survived some of the Pacific War's bloodiest battles--doesn't allude to Hemingway or Remarque, doesn't reference past wars (except fleetingly in discussing the martial tradition of the Corps); he's not interested in connecting his experiences to the ancient line of wars and warriors. Instead, he describes combat as it was, as he saw it and participated in it. Sledge takes readers onto those bloody islands--the relentless fighting on Peleliu, the stinking hell of Okinawa.Sledge stresses over and over again that war is a waste, \\"a terrible waste.\\" Young bodies are ripped and torn apart; young men are struck down in their prime and stripped of decades of potential life. Mentally, it is a waste, too. Exposed to brutal combat, civilized men quickly become savage themselves and, for example, pry gold teeth from dead--and, on at least one occasion that Sledge mentions, from wounded and still living--Japanese. There are many other moments throughout the book where the reader winces. And yet, while war is not glorious, there are qualities that men can show under fire, that shine brightly in comparison to the brutality: love, loyalty, bravery, esprit de corps, compassion. Sledge stresses those, too.This is not an antiwar book, though. Sledge entered the abyss of war, endured hardships, confronted death, saw men torn down. He knows war is not pretty, not fun, not romantic. And yet he also knows that it is sometimes necessary and that, as citizens, we must sometimes sacrifice for our country. He concludes: \\"With privilege goes responsibility.\\" So it does."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Out of all the war memoirs I have read in my life, this ranks as #1. Not only was Eugene Sledge an American hero and a damn fine man, he is an unbelievable writer. This is a MUST read."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"With the old Breed is one of my most cherished books. The son of a WWII vet I crave to understand what happened during that time. Mr. Sledge puts everything into perspective. His portrayal of the battles are real and not sensationalized. He does not present himself as a hero and shows the realities of war.Wonderful read that I could not put down."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"E.B. Sledge's Autobiography of his experiences in WWII is excellent. He takes you from boot camp to war's end and doesn't spare any of the horrid experiences he encountered along the way. There is no Hollywood point of views to be found anywhere in this great read. Just a man expressing the experiences he shared with his brothers and the bond that could not be broken, regardless of how horrible of a situation they found themselves. I highly recommend this to anyone that enjoys WWII history pieces."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Somehow I never read this book in the past even though I had always heard of how good it was. After watching HBO's mini series The Pacific I decided it was time to finally purchase this book. Definitely one of if not the best book ever written about WWII. Sledge along with the rest of his fellow soldiers are true American heroes, this is their story and what they saw and experienced. Keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire book."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This was a wonderful book, and an excellent account of Marines fighting in the Pacific during World War II. I bought the book (and several others) to read in preparation for \\"The Pacific,\\" the HBO mini-series. After reading \\"The Old Breed\\" I'm now afraid that I will be disappointed in the mini-series when it comes out on DVD in November! The book was a first-hand account of basic training as well as the subsequent battles and island-hopping in the south Pacific."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Author E.B. Sledge has written a very compelling account of his experiences as a US Marine during the latter part of WW2. Recounting his time from Recruit training at the US Marine Corps Depot in San Diego and later when he is assigned to the 1st Marine Division and joins them at Pavuvu in the Russell islands group, the story traces his participation in the horrific battles on Peleliu and later Okinawa.The embarkation and move to Peleliu involved travel in hot and uncomfortable troop ships and the author describes this life with a flair for detail and allows the reader to almost feel the discomfort first hand. He describes coming ashore on Peleliu as a form of hell on earth as the defenders met the invading marines at the water's edge. The loss of personnel as the battle progresses inland continues, as the final toll was some 8,769 personnel killed, wounded or missing, with the Japanese experiencing almost 11,000 casualties from the battle. After Peleliu, Sledge returned, with the survivors, to Pavuvu to recover and receive reinforcements before the invasion of Okinawa.I was moved by this book, it is an accompaniment to books such as 'Helmet for My Pillow', by Robert Leckie. This book is the front-line experiences of hitting a beach, engaging in dreary work parties, such as the ones collecting rotting coconuts for disposal away from bivouac areas and also the constant discomfort of living and doing battle in the South Pacific. From burning sun to knee deep mud, plus dealing with various jungle animal nasties to a determined and well-entrenched enemy to whom surrender was not an option. As the story of Peleliu and later, Okinawa, unfold from the author's account, the reader experiences the transformation of a young man who has experienced the mounting savagery of close quarter combat. He describes struggling off an AMTRAC, to sitting in a hole in a dark jungle, with various unnerving night sounds from animals, to a knife-wielding enemy soldier who tries to infiltrate the defensive perimeter of the Marines. Then there are the conditions, they exact a terrible toll on personnel from infections to sickness. Sledge describes removing his socks one day to discover the socks also removing the skin on the soles of his feet and the putrid smell of his socks being so bad he simply buries them to get rid of the stench.In summary, a well written account of one man's experiences in the Pacific during some of the most horrendous battles of the war. While many of these moments are filled with horror and destruction, they should also give a resolution that the world must move forward and not revert to the loss of life described in this book. This book was written from the perspective of a man who survived some of the most savage fighting in World War Two and is book from the front line. Well done, E.B. Sledge!"},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Until this book, I had not read any personal accounts of war other than Pres. Theodore Roosevelt's account of his charge up San Juan Hill. But this books shows the true face of war as only an average grunt stuck living every day in the trenches can tell it. There are very few boisterous adjectives or adverbs in this work. Instead, the narrative tells about the war with little passion (in a glorious or vain sense), which makes it all the more remarkable and all the more real. You almost feel as if you were living the war through Sledge's eyes. Thus, this book, with it's black and white words, pictures, and descriptions has succeeded where so many war movies have failed: making the reader truly understand the meaning of the phrase \\"War is hell.\\" A classic not just in war lit. or memoirs, but in general, this book should be read by everyone and its conclusions on the barbarity, brutality, senselessness, and (sadly) the necessity of war considered by anyone thinking of joining the armed forces."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"\\"Old Breed\\" is perhaps one of the best on-the-ground accounts about World War II combat I've ever read.

This is an excellent book by Sledge. It tells the true horrors Marines in the Pacific saw and the fear they felt in plain, blunt terms. This is one of the best memoirs written by anyone about any war and I would recommend it to anyone, not just people who enjoy history."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"As a young man, Eugene Sledge joined the US Marines \\"to do his bit\\" in World War 2 and because of his choice of arm, he was sent to fight in the Pacific War against the mighty and tenacious Imperial Japanese Army. \\"With the Old Breed\\" describes his experiences in two of the nastier campaigns in that theatre, Pelelieu and Okinawa (and was one of the references for the HBO mini-series \\"The Pacific\\").We (in the UK) are perhaps more used to hearing of the European war, in which the combatants treated each other (for the most part) with a good deal of respect, even chivalry. Admittedly the truth may differ somewhat and the non-combatants were dealt with with rather less regard, but we generally consider the European war to have been a \\"civilised war\\". There was nothing civilised about the Pacific war. Lives were thrown away on both sides for posession of tiny coral atolls with a reckless abandon that matches the waste of the Great War. It was fought with a savagery and hate that beggars belief and Sledge pulls no punches in describing the horror; witness the scene is where a fellow marine removes the gold teeth of an injured Japanese soldier. This is not a comfortable book to read.Neither is this a military history. There are notes at the end of each chapter that add a little context, but Sledge wrote the account from the point of view of a private soldier, working from a battle diary that he kept in his pocket bible. He had little or no idea of the big picture and in most cases he had no idea of what was going on, full stop. His perspective comes from over the sights of his carbine; all he can see is the wall of his dugout, the bodies of friends and foe scattered around him. All he can hear is the rattle of rifle fire, the screech and crash of artillery and the screams of the dying. Sledge fully understood his position in all of this - as cannon fodder and no more - but he also understood the horror and waste of what was happening around him and he conveys the brutality and futility very well indeed.Reading some of the other reviews, however, you will see him described as a great writer, even to the extent that he is compared with Robert Graves. I have not read Graves but I am certainly not convinced that \\"With the Old Breed\\" counts as great writing. I don't want to dwell on the point, but the prose is awkward, unpolished, even clumsy in places. It was clearly not written by a professional, or even particularly experienced writer. Does this detract from the story? No, not at all* (or at least, not much), but unfulfilled expectations of literature do detract. However, these shortcomings do lend the story a certain honesty that you won't find inDispatches(a book that I have come to detest for its smug self-importance), a naiivety that you wont find inAll Quiet on the Western Frontand it is, perhaps, better for it.In the end, this is an eye-opening, gut-churning and deeply humbling account and it is well worth a read.* Perhaps, when we remember wars, we should take off our clothes and paint ourselves blue and go on all fours all day long and grunt like pigs. That would surely be more appropriate than noble oratory...

Also, it is on the Commadant of the Marine Corps reading list."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Following December 7, 1941 a lot of young men in this country enlisted in the armed services. They did so for the best of reasons. The awful fact is that war is fought by young men. When the politicians of the world cannot solve problems through diplomacy it is the young men who pay. Many pay with their young lives. The generation of young American men who fought in WW II have mostly gone to graveyards. Many of these men are my heroes. So many went off to war and never returned. That is so sad to contemplate. Pfc E.B. Sledge, a young man from Alabama, enlisted in the USMC and later found himself in some of the ugliest fighting in WW II at the battles at Peleliu and Okinawa. Sledge does not glorify war. He tells the ugly truth from the point of view of an enlisted mortar man. He details the horror of war with his recollections of days spent in fighting holes with all the heat, the rain, the stench (dead bodies and human excrement) and the killing. Not a pretty picture. He documents the waste of human life. He doesn't really comment on strategy (tactics) or the politics of it all. He just tells the story from the point of view of a Pfc who views and participates in all of the madness of war. He makes a point of saying that it is the sensitive soul that really suffers. A sensitive man that gets through a war is forever scarred. Of course all are scarred in one way or the other. Pfc Sledge was a survivor. He did his duty and despite his involvement in heavy fighting with 3/5 of the 1st MarDiv he returned home. Without medals of valor but he did return home physically intact. He survived and lived to tell his tale. It's a tale well worth reading if you have an interest in combat. We lost so many men in WW II and I salute each and every one of them. I would especially like to thank and honor two old Marine vets. Two who were part of the Old Breed. Two men I had the honor of knowing: Forrest Ray Kennett and Wallace Reid Potter. Both were involved in heavy combat (Ray at Tarawa and Wally at Peleliu) but they both made it back home. Both passed away in May 2009 in their 80s. Good men. May God always bless them.

Novato, California: Presidio Press, 1981.Started Section: May 14, 2006Finished Section: May 15, 2006With the Old Breed - At Peleliu and Okinawa by E. B. Sledge is a very important book at many different levels. It is like the Bible, there are lessons and messages throughout that speak to the past, the present, and to the future. It can be used to explain or support almost any argument that deals with human conflict and why men fight, have fought, and will probably continue to fight.First, it is amazing that the book ever written. Most combat veterans from the major wars in the 20th Century, especially at the level of those on the front line, have refrained from telling about what combat was really like to those who did not share the experience. Civil War veterans were more likely to write and share their experiences than those of WWI and WWII.Historians and the public are most used to get their information on how life was like on the front line from novels which were based on real or imagined experience. These novels really did not deal with the minute by minute, hour by hour, day to day life and death on the front lines. Sledge deals with the reality of going to the john during combat:Added to the awful stench of the dead of both sides was the repulsive odor of human excrement everywhere. It was all but impossible to practice simple, elemental field sanitation on most areas of Peleliu because of the rocky surface. Field sanitation during ... combat was the responsibility of each man. In short, under normal conditions, he covered his own waste with a scoop of soil. At night when he didn't dare venture out of his foxhole, he simply used an empty grenade canister or ration can, threw it outside of his hole, and scooped dirt over it next day if he wasn't under heavy enemy fire.This book is the bottom up view of war. This memoir deals with group and individual survival, not grand strategy and the interaction of many players. Sledge is vaguely aware of things that are happening while he was on active duty but the prime mission of Sledge and front line fighters for eternity is to come back alive with as many of your friends as possible. The corollary of this is that you have to either destroy your adversaries or achieve what is preferable, their surrender as quickly as possible.War in the Pacific was almost entirely new to the American fighting man and American public. Americans had no real experience in fighting on this scale before against non Europeans. The closest thing that they had experienced and it was not well known was in fighting Philippine insurgents who wanted their independence at the end of the Spanish American War. The American Indian was different of course but the memory of fighting them was fading and the fighting had not been on the scale of World War II in the Pacific. Many historians and people use Sledge to show how prevalent racism was in our fighting the Japs, a word that will remain with all of those who participated or experienced this war from afar. The Japanese are those people with whom we now share common goals and aspirations because our cultures are much closer now than they were during World War II.This author does not see the alleged racism in our fighting the Japanese/Japs in World War II. I see something that goes much further back into the history of warfare which is the desire of the fighting man to have to fight as little as possible, a condition that minimizes the loss of life on both sides. The preference of the \\"ritual\\" battle where one side knows in advance that they can not win, engage in minimal fighting to maintain a sense of honor, and then surrender under terms that are mutually acceptable, even if onerous to the losing side. Victors over a vanquished enemy often were the most vicious when the victors had suffered many unnecessary casualties. Sledge and his front line compatriots showed this resentment in fighting an enemy whose goal is \\"to inflict maximum losses on the American forces. The tactics turned Okinawa into a blood bath.\\"Another reason why this racism may be overblown, especially on the part of Sledge, is the fact that he was from the segregated south. His family had also fought for the Confederacy during the Civil War. I did not find any of this type of Black Racism in Sledge nor did I find it transferred by Sledge to his Japanese adversaries.All this being said, both the American fighting man and the American public transferred America's Black Racism to the Japanese by their perception of Japanese behavior and American propaganda. They were different and their Bushido Creed and Emperor worship supported their contempt for those who would not fight to the death, for them surrender was not an option.Neither Sledge and his men nor the Japanese military on the front line were interested in the fact that extremely high American casualties might result in a negotiated peace settlement more favorable to the Japanese than Unconditional Surrender. This is left to the policy makers whom are not a part of Sledge's world will make these calculations.Sledge's book also gives the reader insight from the Japanese side of the conflict. This is not the purpose of the book but it is a subtle message shown in the book. It ties in with Sledge's many comments on the waste of war in terms of lives lost and destroyed. The Japanese have the advantage of terrain and fortifications against the Americans who have to come to them to settle the issue in combat. The Japanese have their version of \\"Live Free or Die.\\"Victor Davis Hanson rates With the Old Breed by Sledge as the second most important book in his listing of \\"The definitive books on the battles of the 20th century.\\"There are some brilliant memoirs of the savage battle for Okinawa, but E.B. Sledge's is by far the most haunting. Sledge, who landed with the Marines on both Okinawa and Peleliu islands, describes in matter-of-fact prose how the superior discipline and bonds between fellow Marines overcame the often brilliant fighting of the desperate Japanese, who hugely outnumbered [if they had come out of their entrenchments to fight the Americans on the beach. This numerical advantage would have been meaningless and very suicidal in face of American Naval and Air superiority.] the Americans and fought from impenetrable subterranean concrete and coral-covered gun emplacements. \\"With the Old Breed\\" might serve as an antiwar ode, but the book ends by reminding the reader how well the U.S. was served in its hour of need by rare men such as his own--men that Sledge thinks it may well need again.It is interesting to see how other writers, historians, and pundits have used Sledge's book since the end of World War II. Studs Terkel's, \\"The Good War\\": An Oral History of World War Two (New York, 1985) uses Sledge's work to show that WWII was a \\"Good\\" War while Vietnam is a bad one. The internet also can give the reader the chance to hear Sledge tell his own story in his own voice. As you listen to him, his book becomes more real. It is hard to believer that this soft spoken man, now a PhD, did what he did and he was not alone. It is his voice that speaks for many others [http://www.studsterkel.org/gwar.php].Although some can see Sledge's work as an antiwar tract, Hanson and others use Sledge's book to show that Americans have put themselves in harm's way for the good of their country. As Sledge himself says, \\"They did their duty so a sheltered homeland can enjoy the peace that was purchased at such a high cost. We owe those Marines a profound debt of gratitude.\\"The author Paul Fussell has caught the fact that \\"Sledge wrote this memoir less for strangers than to tell his own family what his war had been like.\\" Paul Fussell not only wrote the current introduction of the Sledge's book in 1990. In it, he also shows how the book can be used to justify the immediate use of the Atomic Bomb against an enemy who would not surrender. The Marines and Army had used flame throwing tanks to clear the enemy from their entrenched positions in the Pacific. Sledge and the front line fighters were happy that Truman used the Atomic Bomb for the same purpose against mainland Japan.Paul Fussell has latterly found fame verging on notoriety for his mordantly witty yet deeply serious dissenting position on two of the determining military issues of the age. In the first place he dissents from the widely credited if often unexamined propositions enunciated by A. J. P. Taylor and propagated by Studs Terkel that, \\"Despite all the killing and destruction that accompanied it, the Second World War was a good war.\\" For Fussell, who was there, it was nothing of the kind. \\"It was a war and nothing else, and thus stupid and sadistic.\\" In the second place he dissents from any condemnation of the decision to drop the bomb in 1945, a dissent memorably registered in the title essay of his most recent collection, Thank God for the Atomic Bomb. In the early 1990s both positions have a tendency to surprise. Conjoined, they are positively shocking--an effect one suspects Fussell himself has taken some pains to achieve.Alex Danchev also drives home the point about the fact that fighting for your country is neither immoral nor futile.The book also loses the argument. Eugene Sledge for one is perfectly clear. In a passage not quoted by Fussell, his memoir concludes with the thought that, though war is indeed \\"brutish, inglorious and a terrible waste until the millennium arrives and countries cease enslaving others it will be necessary to accept responsibility to make sacrifices as my comrades did.\\"Sledge's full quote is:Until the millennium arrives and countries cease trying to enslave others, it will be necessary to accept one's responsibilities and to be willing to make sacrifices for one's country -- as my comrades did. As the troops used to say, \\"If the country is good enough to live in, it's good enough to fight for.\\" With privilege goes responsibility.Sledge's book should be required reading for all courses that deal with foreign policy questions, World War II in particular, because it takes these issues from the cerebrum to the smell of the foxhole where wars are fought. The book is a call to all future policy makers to do more than their absolute best either to prevent a war from occurring or to be prepared to end it quickly if one needs to be fought so that others will not be filled \\"with anger at the war and the realization of the senseless waste.\\" This required reading should be accompanied by a required 3 to 4 page book report as well as class discussion. Once this has been achieved, students will have a much better understanding of the implications of how they feel foreign policy should be conducted.After reading Sledge, it would be interesting to see how many students would still want Sledge and his men to be on the front line landing on a beach on mainland Japan."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Why should you buy another book about World War II? The genre is chock-full of bad writing, poor research, and sanctimonious historical drivel about what a wonderful, perfect, unambiguous, justifiable war it was that made the world safe for democracy. Moreover, at first glance, \\"With the Old Breed\\" looks like it's going to be another rally-round-the-flag memoir trumpeting the victory of the righteous white man over the imperialistic Japanese devils.As one of the books upon which HBO based its series, \\"The Pacific,\\" this book merits reading--absolutely--if you're also watching the series and want to get some background on the characters involved in the television production.By the end of page one, your skepticism and reluctance at reading another WWII memoir should be completely dispelled. This is a beautiful, terrible, moving, sad, and gentle account of why no war is ever right, or ever justifiable, or ever worth the cost, and its author speaks from the first person of having been forced to do the slaughtering with his own hands.The power of this book resonates on many levels. First, Sledge simply refuses to analyze the big picture. No ponderous thoughts about Japanese world hegemony or the perfidy of Pearl Harbor, no snapshots on what was strategically at stake if the U.S. had lost the Pacific...just a step-by-step slog through the madness of carnage and murder. Sledge begins with the bright and familiar stories of volunteering, going through boot camp, and then shipping out. You are gradually brutalized with each passing phase, as was he.A second source of the book's power is the way Sledge takes readers from boot camp to the final victory on Okinawa. He literally walks you through the slog of an infantryman in the Marine Corps. No detail is too insignificant, because these details reveal the awfulness of killing people. And although combat junkies will revel in the \\"real\\" battlefield depictions of rotting flesh, maggots, and enemy soldiers blown to bits, those interested in the human descent into what Sledge calls \\"the meatgrinder\\" will find far more of interest in the non-combat stories that Sledge peppers throughout the book.He pokes fun at a new commander who brags about what he'll do under fire, only to wilt in terror at the first shelling. He writes with profound sadness at the death of his friends and, most movingly, at the pointless death of the Japanese. He remembers two marines getting into a fistfight over a range card with a woman's lipstick on it, and reminisces about the kindness of navy Seabees who let tired and hungry marines eat in their hot chow line. For a man who has been permanently disturbed by his experiences in combat, Sledge's basic kindness and warmth fill this book as he notes examples of friendship, kindness, heroism, and above all, humanity in the most depraved environment imaginable.Sledge would be a war hero if he believed in war heroes, which he clearly does not. What's most interesting about the title is that the \\"Old Breed\\" were the marines of legend, men with whom Sledge felt honored to have served. Yet he never seems to recognize that he is the epitome of the Old Breed: courageous, professional, selfless, tough, and dedicated to the job of efficiently killing people. His modesty is astonishing.Also moving in this book is his constant attention to and remembrance of the terror and fear of combat, mixed in with the exhaustion and drudgery of being in the infantry. The mud, the rain, the heat, the backbreaking labor carrying ammo and supplies, the open sores, the rocky coral surface: all of these details make the toughness and brutality of the job something that a reader can imagine. He captures in far fewer words, but with equal force, Norman Mailer's terrible journey carrying casualties back to safety in The Naked and the Dead Sledge repeatedly singles out the corpsmen and fellow marines who had to repeatedly face enemy fire as they went out onto the battlefield to retrieve their dead and wounded, often becoming casualties themselves.Unlike Paul Fussell'sThank God for the Atom BombSledge's memoir, to the extent that it justifies the Pacific war at all, does so obliquely and gently. If you can read through this carnage and terror and waste, and consider that the waste was many times greater on the Japanese side, you will reach what I think is a fair conclusion: the Japanese were wrong to murder so many of their own in such a pointless war.Finally, despite his use of words like \\"goddamned\\" and \\"ass\\" when he reconstructs marine conversations, Sledge is very southernly gentlemanly in his writing demeanor. No crudity, and a notable absence of the real profanity used by soldiers and marines underscore the strong notions of politeness that emanate from his upbringing as the son of a well-to-do physician in Alabama. When I first read this book fifteen years ago, I was moved by it. After re-reading it on my Kindle, if anything, I'm even more moved today. You will be, too."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This is hands down the best combat oral history ever written.Dr.Sledge tells of his experiences on Peleliu and Okinawa,written from the diary he kept during these island battles.He is proud to be a Marine but there is no sugar coating of the horrors of combat.His family had originally encouraged him to write the book as a catharsis to help with his PTSS but it turned into the best first hand account of the Pacific fighting ever written.He was an extraordinary man and I wish I could have met him before he died.Five stars is not a high enough rating for this book."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"If you are a person who is a big fan of history, war, blood and gore, you will love this book.

If this book were a movie, it would have 5 stars and would be rated R for blood, gore, and language. Sledge fought with the Marines in some of the biggest battles of World War II, Peleliu and Okinowa. In Peleliu he saw many gruesome wounds and deaths. Peleliu made him tired mentally and physically. In Okinowa it rained a lot and it was really muddy. In Okinowa people lost their lives and many were wounded. E.B. sledge described the action very well. He also talked in depth about the campaigns that they did.

Yet I have to say that not all WWII stories can match the genuine, touching, and brutally honest rendition as Eugene Sledge has captured here. As a Private with the Marines during the Pacific invasion, Sledge has put together a truly masterful book. It took him over 40 years to get the nerve to finally write down the horrors of his experience. But I promise, if you are a WWII enthusiast that craves first-person encounters from real front-line men (not officers or war writers), start off with this one by E.B.

EB Sledge is to be commended for being able to go back into his painful past and give us this outstandig account. My own father fought in the Pacific, 3 purple hearts and 3 bronze stars. He only talked once about his experiences to me, and that very briefly. He was an infantry 1st Lt. 25 years after the end of the war, he said he keeps seeing pictures of the men in his company who died and he keeps thinking what he could have done to save them.

Sledge's accounts, however, are not fiction...he describes how he miraculously lived through te Peleliu and Okinawa invasions...his brilliant and graphic descriptions allow me to feel that I was there with him and also experienced the brutality of these battles. That, as he would agree, is impossible, as no one could appreciate the plight of the Marine infantry man \\"grunt\\" who has not experienced combat.As a former Marine (non-combatant during Viet Nam), I realize,(or at least think that I realize) the huge difference between my role (teletype operator) and the roles of the \\"real Marines\\" who fought the war.

This is a hard-hitting, no holes barred treatment of two of the bloodiest Pacific campaigns in World War II. The author lived through them and he has spared no punches in retelling what happened on the islands invaded by the Marines, and held to the death by the Japanese.It shows how ordinary American youth can be turned into hate-filled almost zombies, capable of committing the most heinous atrocities on both living and dead enemy soldiers, in retaliation for what was done to their buddies.

The life of an infantry marine, the gruesome encounters with the Japanese, the weather conditions, the funny and sad memories, everything is so descriptively depicted.As a 22 yr old optometry student (with not much knowledge of the Pacific War battles) - this book is very enlightening and easy to read for anyone. Highly recommend to gain more knowledge on what the soldiers actually experienced in the battles of Peleliu and Okinawa."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This is a well written, contemplative review of the personal experiences of a WWII marine who participated in many of the most significant campaigns in the Pacific Theater. It is not the \\"grand strategy\\" of the commanders of large forces on the ground, at sea or in the air. It is a personal account of what an individual marine endured as those plans and strategies were carried out. A great read written by a man who was part of the \\"greatest generation\\" with some clue as to how he and his comrades were irrevocably changed by their experiences."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This is a great book and makes me have even more respect for the guys who fought for our freedoms.

I would say that it is virtually impossible to ever put into words what it means to be a Marine, to survive combat, and describe the pride that goes along with earning the title. But if there was ever a book that came close to painting the right picture, this book is it. It is not only a testament to the Marines, but more importantly it is a testament to all those who have defended this nation and had to endure the horrors of combat....Sledge's firsthand account of his time in the Marines is truly why we have the saying...\\"(America is the) Home of the free, because of the Brave.\\""},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"After watching the HBO series The Pacific, I was intrigued by the men who lived through it.

Of all of the memoirs that I read in that class, this one is by far the best. Sledge gives a gritty and heart-felt account of the hardships and struggles that the Marines faced on the Pacific front. I highly recommend it as a book everyone should read."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"As a child growing up in between wars, it is always hard for me to understand what happens to a man put in the inhuman field of combat. &#34;Sledgehammer&#34; conveys the horror, the futility, the insanity of war without glorifying the senseless violence found in many other accounts. He thinks, he feels, he tries to understand from a grunt's eye view. No mock heroics or sensationalism, he helps you to see how difficult it was for anyone to endure the camoaign and emerge sane and human. Above all he conveys the binding sense of camaraderie that kept these boys together and won the war. Although not a new book, the pain, the curiosity, the humor and the sadness come through as if yesterday. It should be required reading for our kids."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Best war book ever written. I had just finished the Manchester trilogy on Churchill--to read this was a stark contrast to the political machinations during WW2.

Well done Marine!"},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I am about 35 pages from completing this book and it has been one of the best reads I have ever experienced. I watched the Pacific HBO series which led me to purchase the book and am very glad I did. Like always the book is far better then the very well done series. I highly recommend this book if you have any interest in any war scenarios but especially the Pacific theater during WW II. This book very much makes you think how petty your daily problems may appear compared to what these extremely brave men have been through. Since it is a memoir the reality is much more clear. Buy this book you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand what it was like to prepare, fight and survive two of the toughest battles in all of World War II.

My copy was an older edition, not the one offered for sale here."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I watched the HBO Series, The Pacific and was interested in reading the underlying biographic texts of the characters. This one was simply fascinating. It is certainly true that Sledge gives what some might call a dispassionate account of the war, but the narrative is fascinating. I have recommended this book to several people, especially for those who want to truly understand what the Marines experienced in that time period. The rules of engagement may have changed since then, but the emotions this man experienced are probably universal. There are some horrific descriptions of man's inhumanity to man, but he presents the information because it truly is necessary for an honest account. A most read for every American History buff."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I am moved by this book. I am a Marine and can relate in a way to Eugene Sledge.

Very personnal, very vivid so much so trhat yuou can almost smell the gun smoke along with all horid smells of war. Whow!"},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Over the years I've collected maybe 40 books relating to the war in the Pacific. I don't know how or why I overlooked this one, maybe the title, but I would rate it one of the top three in terms of describing the dirty side of combat. The only two books that I think come close are Tenozan and Munda Trail. To be honest I, like so many others, completely overlooked the battle for Peleliu thinking it just one of those side skirmishes. Of course there's lots of print concerning the really big battles like Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Iwo Jima and Okinawa but the battle for Peleliu has to rate up there with the worst of them.So many of the books tend to be tactical or historical in nature with few details of what it's really like to grovel through the mud in close combat and the horror of the battlefield right down to the maggots. Sledge wasn't a reporter or journalist or even very skilled at writing but he took good notes and constructed from them this eye-opening account of battlefield reality."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"A compelling and moving story of WWII in the Pacific. I recommend it to anyone who wants to better understand the sacrifices made by the Greatest Generation to preserve our freedoms."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"A first hand account of the Marine life of E.B. Sledge. So descriptive I felt I was in action. Deglorifies war yet makes you understand the deep emotions of the ordinary soldier. If you are a history buff like me this is a must read account of the invasion of Peleliu and Okinawa. You'll be as shell shocked as I was after Sledge's accurate depiction of war. It will give you insight even into today's soldiers. 5 stars!!!"},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"An outstanding un-varnished view of war though a young Marine's eyes. Every president and member of congress should read this book before they send our children to die in limited wars in foreign lands for our special interests."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I bought this book the same time i ordered The Pacific. I started the book before I started the miniseries and was about 150 pages in when I started the DVDs. I remember watching the pacific and recognizing things pulled from Sledge's book. I finished the miniseries before the book and was able to recongnize clips from the film in the book. I must agree it is long, but it is worth it. It took me about two weeks to read the entire book. The book accounts for what these men went through in the two campaigns Sledge served it. I loved this book and would like to thank Sledge for his service and his book."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"EB Sledge volunteered for the Marines, was trained as a mortar man, and shipped out to the Pacific in time to participate in the campaign to take the little-known island of Peleliu. He went on to participate in the invasion of Okinawa, and finished his service as part of the US occupation forces in China.Sledge's account provides a rare glimpse into what it was like to be an enlisted man fighting in the ground war in the Pacific. He does an outstanding job of describing the bonds that form between fighting men, the way they come to completely depend on each other and the bitter anguish of loss they feel when their friends die.While this book does definitely fall into the genre of military history, it also fits into that of biography, and psychology of war. Sledge does not wax poetic, but is able to explain in clear, simple prose what it was like for him. He describes the battles, the weather, the challenges of tropical climate, disease, and mental stress suffered by front-line riflemen in the marines.As I read on and on, it became increasingly inconceivable that men could survive, much less fight, under such dreadful conditions. Yet, Sledge helps us to understand how they were able to keep going as they fought an enemy that was so different in philosophy, culture, and tradition from them that they truly could not understand them. Yet, that was their lot.This is an absolutely top-notch account of marine ground-pounders of WWII.5 stars all the way! Thanks for the insights!"},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"The book reminded me of Herbert Werner's Iron Coffins and Guy Sajer's The Forgotten Soldier. All are written in a remarkably sensitive manner."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"E.B. Sledge's memoir of this brutal war experiences ranks among the greats of the genre, including Goodbye to All That, by Robert Graves, Memoirs of an Infantryman by Sigfried Sassoon, Undertones of War by Robert Bluden. Sledge was probably too sensitive to face combat; it's a wonder he did not crack. His scarifying book is difficult to read, even for someone like me, who has lived in peace because of the fighting men like Sledge endured. Written with a strong voice, Sledge takes us through his training through the end of the war, detailing the various men he encounters under the most difficult of circumstances. A great American classic. By the way, the HBO series The Pacific softpedals this book to some degree."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Sledge presents a great insight into the Pacific War as a marine at the sharp end in two campaigns. Reading this book is a better view of the story than the TV documentary \\"The Pacific\\" which features part of this book."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This was a pleasure to read from page one to the end. I read at night after getting in bed and several times, I had to force myself to put this down cause I had to work the next day. I'll often go to bed at 11pm and read a half hour, but with this I found myself up on work nights at 2 or 3am. Thankfully, I finished it in just a few nights. I'll have to start this on a friday night next time I read it, and I fully intend to read this again. Not because I really enjoyed the subject matter, but, it truly is delivered that well.I suppose I could relate to Sledge insofar as I think we share a lot of common personality traits. I must believe this book portrays his attitude accurately, and I fully agree with his feeling toward the incomprehensible waste, how that would fester into hatred. And how the miserable conditions would labor on you after such a long time in them.Imo, Sledge really comes across as the average you or me who got stuck in a war and simply wants it all to end. It's a very captivating book, and by any standard, this is a great piece of literature."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This book was amazing! The first hand account of a young marine and Peleliu and Okinawa is filled with spectacular detail. This book is the closest thing you get to combat with out being there."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I have not served in the military, and so must learn about the experience the easy way, by reading. I've read a number of narratives of combat in the Pacific during WWII, and in my opinion this is by far the best of them. Some other reviews have commented that this book is \\"too long ... repetitive ... lacks literary merit\\". I also found the book repetitive in places, and it could have used a bit of editing in this regard. However, I absolutely disagree that it is too long or lacks literary merit. A book can be highly polished in the literary sense, yet fail to convey impressions and emotions effectively. This book is very competently written overall and succeeds superbly in conveying the exhaustion, fear, misery, horror, and sometimes humor of combat. In some cases, the repetitiveness in the book reinforces as a perhaps unintended literary mechanism the repetitiveness and tedium of the battles Sledge describes. What also come across very well are 1) the personalities of the Marines Sledge served with, showing the best and the worst of human behavior under stress, and 2) the command structure of the Marines, the esprit de corps, and the necessity of obeying orders without question (usually). Surprisingly, Sledge comments in several places on his and other Marines' respect for the abilities of the Japanese enemy as soldiers, despite absolute loathing of them. Finally, in several places, Sledge remarks on the utter senselessness of war and chastises politicians and diplomats for failing to prevent it. In this sense, it is a powerful anti-war book and is recommended reading for all national leaders who have not served in the armed forces yet have the power to send others into combat (or prevent the same). This is one of the most memorable books I've ever read: it is one of those rare books that changes the reader. In addition, it is a superbly good read; I couldn't put it down. I'd give it 10 stars, if this rating existed."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I read this book some time ago, before the HBO mini-series that relied heavily on this book. If you are looking for a book that will give you an historical account of the marines in the Pacific, this book is not for you. If you want an accurate account of what it was like to actually be there in the nightmare that was the war in the Pacific, then you have come to the right place. Pfc Sledge wrote most of this book as it happened. It was taken directly from the daily journal he kept during the war and reflects his personal experiences of battle. There is no attempt to romanticize or glorify war, nor does he seek to embellish the role he played. Although the events he described are historically accurate, this book is meant to be experiential rather than historical.Mr. Sledge takes us from his life before the war, through basic training, and then through the battles in which he participated. Unlike others who reviewed this book, I found it neither repetitious nor too long. It is only as repetitious as war itself. To me it is essential that the book be as long and detailed as it is. Although Peleliu and Okinawa were as intense as Tarawa, they did not end in 76 hours, like Tarawa. They went on for weeks, and in the case of Okinawa, for three months. Both these battles are a testament to the incredible endurance and comittment displayed by all those who fought, bleed and died for their contry, both American and Japanese.If you want a feel good book about the war in the Pacific that is an historical chronicle, essentially devoid of the emotions that make war as horrific and real as it is (like \\"The Pacific\\"), then this is not the book for you. If you want an accurate,raw and reaistic depiction of the war in the Pacific, then this is the book to read. If there is a true classic that came out of the war in the Pacific, this is the book. It is as much a classic as the Civil War classic \\"Company Aytch\\". I have read probably too many books about the marines during WWII, and, to me, this is the best of them. Also, Eugene Sledge has been cited by more writers on this topic, including Ambrose, than just about any other author. Kind of says something."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"E.B. Sledge had that rare gift of transforming the hellish conditions he experienced as a Marine mortar man in the PTO into everyday language. Through his prose,...one can feel the stifling heat and humidity...... visualize the ghastly sights of torn bodies blown apart only to decay in the tropical sun,...and yes,...smell the stink of the lifeless Marine and Japanese combatants. The book is a gripper. Truly,...Sledge brings to life what General Sherman once said, \\"War is hell.\\""},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This book is essential reading for any young man who thinks it will be \\"cool\\" to join a branch of the military.

I read \\"The Pacific\\" first, three times back to back. After getting to know the characters, Sledgehammer, Sidney Phillips and R.V. Burgin, I purchased their books. I finished \\"You'll be Sor-ree!\\" over two evenings and I am now reading \\"With the Old Breed\\". I can certainly say that I feel like I have a better idea as to the hellish experience our troops faced during WWII. Sidney Phillips, as well as Eugene Sledge, recount thier experiences in different ways, Sledge with a reserved and refined style of writing and Phillips with more boyish humor. As I read thier stories I find I have developed a great respect for all of those who served and I wish I could have had the chance to meet them and express my thanks.I am surprised how much of \\"The Pacific\\" was taken directly from each of these books. I have been disappointed a few times because I was reading the exact same story word for word. However, I am still enjoying the reading and turn each page with anticipation."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I was in awe of this book the whole way through it.

Sledge as he enter the war and survives, unlike so many of his comrades."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"As a spouse of a veteran marine, reading this book gave me a total new perspective of War, and a lot of respect for our servicemen from yesterday and today. The sacrificed lives, the will to survive, the chaos that war brings to humanity, definitely confirmed that in war there are no winners. The author describes his experiences in Peleliu and Okinawa to details, chocking at times, amusing at others. Mr. Sledge was an extraordinary Marine who throughout his experiences in combat related in his book, show us that even in the midst of despair, the spirit of the Marine Corps values and training prevails."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"My children always mocked me for refusing to buy a Japanese car. If they would read this book they might understand why an old Marine might feel this way."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Not sure of what more to add over most other reviews. If you like this genre of war, and it was something that I was interested in after watching the HBO series PACIFIC, this book brings it together in a whole new light. Sledgehammer's account of the brutality of the Japanese soldier in these battles in par none, and brutal in the highest of senses. Some of his prose is extremely good but simply written, and draws the reader right into the middle of the action."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Another example of why it was called the \\"Greatest Generation\\". This book shows what all those men fighting in the Pacific endured during their war. Sledge offers an amazingly personal view of his war and its effects. Really, really excellent book. I am very disappointed that I had not heard of it until the series \\"The Pacific\\" used it as a story line."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"As good as it gets. As horrific as it gets. As sad and noble as it gets. A review printed on the cover says that With the Old Breed comes close to being a masterpiece. It IS a masterpiece, though thoroughly lacking any pretense or desire to be \\"a masterpiece.\\" I bought it because I watched what is certainly the best mini-series to ever be shown on television, The Pacific, and this book went far beyond expectations, revealing the mini-series to be more Hollywood-ized than I would have expected. This book simply tells it like it was, and like war still is---insanity, a disease, a blight, a failing, a sick test of what it means to be a man. Through Sledge's eyes and his simple eloquent language we discover that in such a situation as war the test reveals those who win and those who loose to be less than human and more than human at the same time. Many other documents or diaries of war are written by people who simply cannot write, trying desperately to cling to that vision of the soldier as both noble and savage. Or it is written by a \\"writer\\" who is just blowing us with metaphors and flowers. Or it is edited to death. Sledge, because he is simply the soldier, reveals what that sorry vision truly means and entails. It means we loose the best of the best generation to madness and futility. It means we slaughter the innocents and guilty alike, indiscriminately in the fog of battle. And, by inference and recent history, in a country like ours has become over the past 50 years, that we ARE the enemy. We have forgotten the valiant and the lost and have turned into the very sort of enemy we fought in the 2nd World War. This book reveals what we have lost as well as the price it took to save it only temporarily. We are no longer innocent. Dwight Eisenhower was the last great President and his words about the Military Industrial Complex in his farewell speech I watched on TV as a child were not spoken by someone duped into reading the speech without knowing its meaning. His words were a true and accurate warning from the generation who truly sacrificed for good to the generations who are now fighting for greed. Blessings on those men who fought what is so ironically called The Good Fight. But there are no blessings for those who fight for oil companies and international dominance. If you read this book you will see the truth of the irony of war written by someone who was not a writer, but a human being who became more than a writer in the process. Hollywood screwed it up a bit, but also pointed me to this book, which I deeply appreciate. Lecky's book, Helmet for My Pillow, is also an amazing testament and certainly well written, but With the Old Breed avoids the pretense of the \\"writer\\" and is, by that very mechanism, powerful and deeply moving, respectful and intensely human."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Sledge's memoir is clear, stark and poignant, driven by the plainness of oral history -- and made tragic by the author's inability, after years of what must have been living nightmares, to understand the why of what happened to him. To be fair, we shouldn't force our warriors to try to be the final word on why they went to war. The job of Sledge and his countrymen -- including my own father, a Marine almost killed at Peleliu -- was to fight, and fight they did. He hides almost nothing of the Marine combat experience, drawing from notes almost obscene in their lack of sentiment (one chapter is titled &quot;Mud and Maggots&quot;). When time stretches in the hellish foxholes of Okinawa, Sledge's is the hollow wandering thoughts of every young man prepared to die under orders.And he never knows why -- other than knowing that any Marine would be willing to die for his buddies. In combat, that's certainly enough. But it's clear his abiding anger against the war, against Japanese (&quot;Japs&quot; even today, to him), against futility and horror, has never been able to rest. If this was indeed &quot;The Good War,&quot; in Studs Terkel's phrase, why are men like Sledge still fighting it?I highly recommend the book, and so does my Dad. (Curiously, it has one false note, and it's one shared by most of the Marine memoirs: They can speak in endless detail about corpses, but they can't bring themselves to swear. Marines in Sledge's book will shout, &quot;Get back, you fool!&quot; Why memoirists avoid cussing while sparing no details on maggots eating dead soldiers is a mystery.)"},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"As a former Marine, I was totally taken back at the conditions our WWII vets had to endure.

I ALSO HAVE THE HBO SERIES, \\"THE PACIFIC\\" WHICH I HAVE WATCHED TWICE NOW AND I'M GOING TO WATCH IT AGAIN.....FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS NOW I HAVE TOLD MANY PEOPLE THAT I THINK THAT EVERY YOUNG MAN AND WOMAN RIGHT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL THAT THEY SHOULD SERVE 2 TO 4 YEARS IN THE MARINE CORPS. THEY TAUGHT ME TO HAVE PRIDE IN MY COUNTRY, RESPECT, AND LEADERSHIP ABILITIES THAT YOU WONT GET ANYWHERE ELSE. I BECAME A PLATOON GUIDE IN THREE YEARS AND ALSO GOT MY E4 STRIPES IN THREE YEARS. THAT LEADERSHIP TRAINING I GOT HELPED ME TO BECOME THE PRESSROOM FOREMAN WITHIN SIX YEARS. I WORKED IN COMMERCIAL PRINTING FOR 38 YEARS AND WAS IN CHARGE OF 28 TO 30 MEN. I CAN THANK THE MARINES FOR THAT.SLEDGE HAD SO MANY DETAILS WRITTEN DOWN THAT HE KEPT THROUGH OUT HIS SERVICE IN THE PACIFIC. THAT IS AMAZING THAT HE WAS ABLE TO DO THAT AND GET THROUGH WITHOUT BEING WOUNDED OR KILLED. HE WAS TRUELY LUCKY. USING HIS NEW TESTEMENT TO ME MEANS THAT GOD WAS WITH HIM ALL THE TIME.I KNOW THAT I GOT AWAY FROM MY REVIEW IN PLACES, BUT IT IS SUCH A GREAT BOOK. I'LL BE READING IT AGAIN.

As a college student I am always looking for cheaper books, so this has become one of my new favorite websites."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Best first hand memoir of WWII and written with excelllence."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Firstly, i must make clear my undying support and utter respect for all of the Allied soldiers, underground combatants, displaced persons, populations affected (all over the world) by the war effort, as well as the nearly hundred million fatalities caused by WWII.Please bear this in mind while i criticize a book, not the man, his efforts, unit, the Marines, the US or the Allies.This book has only reached bestseller status because of the HBO series \\"The Pacific\\" (\\"Band of Brothers\\" in Asia).Eugene \\"Sledgehammer\\" Sledge, a bonafide war hero who fought on the front lines in some of History's bloodiest battles, is nothing if not honest when he says that he wrote this book as a family account of his experiences in WWII. The book has little literary merit: it lacks style, the narrative is at times confused and, more often than not, repetitive.The author conveys his feelings regarding war in general and the specific battles in which he bravely participated in. The book is a confused and confusing narrative of the conflict in the Pacific (which reflects, as the author wanted, the state of things on the front lines), seen from his very specific point of view. It could have been a fantastic essay or short 50 page account with no loss of ambience or information.It is nevertheless important in that it shows the meat grinder's putrid innards with gory detail. This book is a must read for students at military academies: officers will get precious insight into day to day frontline conditions and the psyche of the common soldier.Once again, I profess my deepest respect and gratitude for the selfless efforts of men like Private Sledgehammer."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This book was OK. There were several boring parts. It was certainly not the 5 star book that everyone raved about. Band of Brothers was much better by far. I was disappointed in my expectations of it being a hard to put down book."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"E.B. Sledge's memoir of the Okinawa and Peleliu campaigns was vaulted from relative obscurity to Dreamworks heights by the recent HBO television series, \\"The Pacific\\", whose producers (Spielberg, Hanks) relied in large part on this book as foundation material. Its author conforms perfectly to the modern stereotype of a young man of the \\"Greatest Generation\\" at war: simple, honest, moral, duty-bound and patriotic. No nuances are acceptable, allowing, of course, for religiously motivated and humble American moral qualms, which can be occasionally voiced about the necessity of killing. And so it is with this book from first to last pages. Note that this is a review of the memoir itself as a literary effort, not my commentary on the justness of the cause or on the character, competence, motivations, dedication of the serving personnel, the author's character or anything else.As in \\"Band of Brothers\\", Sledge's story begins with an idealistic young man from a quintessentially American small town background who ardently responds to the call of duty, in this case by abandoning Officer Candidate School and volunteering for Marine Corps combat training. After the usual \\"hard love\\" tour in boot camp, the self-described ingenue Sledge is sent to the Pacific for an uneventful and boring interlude: this juxtaposition sets the scene as it was before descending into the inferno. Sledge's campaign notes, reportedly written inside his ever-present New Testament were, in his later years, transformed into a newer testament, one which supposedly was prepared to depict the horrors of war for his family circle: learn ye well from my experiences as many veteran warriors have warned! The memoir circulated to great acclaim (at least amongst military history buffs and fellow Greatest Generation soldiers) and took final form in this book.Once on Peleliu, Sledge emphasizes, virtually ad nauseum, the slime, grime, general nastiness, unfavorable terrain, miserable weather, lack of sanitation, smells, ever-present fear of death and unrelenting fatigue that were the combat soldier's lot. Curiously absent from all this are any meaningful insights into the character or motivation of any of his confreres in the foxholes. Judging from this book, his contacts, friends and acquaintances are uni-dimensional and startlingly lacking in insight In fact, they display none at all. They are stereotypical models of rectitude. Their complaints are mostly trivial, annoyingly vague and phrased in such a way that nary an eyebrow would be raised if their dialogue was repeated verbatim at a Daughters of the American Revolution tea party or a church social. Presumably, by juxtaposing sterile and occasionally daffy dialogue to stark violence, Sledge is trying to make a point (\\"When good people are forced to do Bad Things\\"), for surely it begs credulity to imagine that anyone (then and certainly not now) could avoid using even a single epithet or Anglo-Saxon curse when expressing the misery of combat life. This is in especially glaring contrast to the dramatic and excruciating depictions of combat violence which lard almost every page. This makes for an almost Hollywood wartime movie ambiance and is quite distracting. Sometimes, the author's repetition became frankly tedious. However, in this case, the \\"Hollywood\\" depiction (\\"The Pacific\\") is much more nuanced in its depiction of the Marines, it explores, develops and places characters in an interesting and believable context and it makes for much more believable storytelling.I was perplexed by one aspect of the campaign as Sledge portrays it: evidently, there was an abundance of rear-echelon troops who lazed about and made occasional forays to the front lines in quest of battlefield trophies, this while front-line troops were decimated by fatigue, disease, wounds, death and inadequate nutrition. If this is, in fact, an accurate depiction, it amounts to criminal abuse of combat personnel. As before, according to Sledge, aside from the occasional, laconic gripe, the combat Marines seemed to placidly accept this manifestly wasteful and unfair situation. And, as before, \\"The Pacific\\" portrays the matter much more convincingly.Allowing for all that, this book (and the TV series) will hopefully focus public attention on the Pacific Theater. Lacking the dashing evil, sophisticated urbanity, great hair and nifty uniforms of the Hollywood Nazis, the battle against Imperial Japan (an entity equivalently evil in comparison to the Nazis) deserves more attention and its veterans more sympathy and acknowledgment. Hopefully, this book will contribute in some measure to that laudable goal."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This is a pretty well written book with some very good descriptions of combat, however I was unable to overcome a feeling that Sledge managed to avoid the serious front line combat the riflemen were going through. He always seemed to be behind the line lobbing morter shells while the other Marines were pinned down on the front lines. I don't mean any disrespect because I'm sure there were cooks getting killed on these islands. Just an observation"},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This book was extremely well thought out and written.

Sledge writes like Hemingway with his short, powerful sentences. If anything, he is understated as he recounts his experiences as a Marine infantryman in the Pacific campaign. Man's brutality to man is given its full measure in \\"The Old Breed\\" and the reader can feel the physical toll extended combat takes and an almost gravitational pull into the abyss of dehumanization.This is a must read for those contemplating a deliberate role for American women in infantry units and those that support the infantry in the thick of combat. Sledge, perhaps better than any other author, shows us that war is hell."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I am a big fan of &#34;Sledgehammer!

His 1,000 yard stare down with the 'shave-tail' is a one of the few parts that will allow you to smile, or sigh with relief for a few minutes, knowing that they men he fought with did not have many opportunities to relax, breathe easily or escape the cannonade and screams of death and dying."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"An amazing memoir of WWII, with reflections of life and war that will make you think for a long time coming.

It puts into words the real hell of war, you can almost imagine what these kids went through.

Anyone who has questions about military experience or the price of freedom should read this book. This author is so gifted that I felt as if I actually went through the experiences along with those men he described. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"To say that this story is powerful doesn't do it justice. The author's descriptions of his experiences are void of self promotion or drama. The horror's he depicts as a marine corporal are hard to imagine. Consider that his unit had 256 men at the outset, but after Pelilu and Okinawa only 26 had not been \\"hit.\\" Consider also the title \\"With the old breed....\\" when in fact none of them had turned 21 yet.The contrast of the conviction of these men set against the mainstream of American men today is vivid, particularly as to their personal commitment to the values of their country. It moved me. Pelilu was hot, hardscrabble and dusty while Okinawa was taken in the midst of a monsoon. Both were deadly dangerous as told in this simple tale of war. As John Keegan said, this book will be a classic."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"In 1943, the young Eugene Sledge flunked out of a Marine officer training course. He and the other washouts in his training cohort were then assigned to become privates. After training, he became a mortarman in a line infantry company in the Marine 1st Division, joining his unit just prior to 2 of the most brutal engagements experienced by American soldiers in WWII; the invasions of Peleliu and Okinawa. By great good fortune, he survived unscathed when his company suffered the equivalent of 150% casulties over the 2 campaigns. Written originally for his family, this is an artless and direct accounting of Sledge's combat experiences. Sledge's account describes scenes of true horror alleviated only by the comradeship he found in his unit. As a description of how combat can bring out the best and worst in humanity, this plainly written book is unmatched."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"The author, who quit a slot in an officers training program to fight as an enlisted Marine, has given us a powerful memoir of his experiences fighting in two of the toughest battles of the Pacific War. Slegde (called \\"Sledgehammer\\" by his commrades) manages to evoke both the stench, fear, stress and horror of combat, together with the \\"everyday\\" heroism of the men forced to endure such hell. Sledge doesn't gloriy war, but he does glorify the human spirit of its survivors. I have read a handful of books on combat experiences and this was one of the best. An excellent source for those who want to understand both the highest and lowest extremes of human nature called forth by one of the most brutual conflicts ever fought by American troops."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This is one of the best books I've read about the battles in the South Pacific during WWII. Mr. Sledge writes with all the detail a reader needs to put you smack in the middle of the gory and horrendous combat our boys experienced. Its raw, graphic and dirty, but true. I could hardly put it down once I started reading. This should be a \\"must read\\" for every high school and college student in the US. Then they would know what the \\"greatest generation\\" went through to keep this country and the rest of the world free and safe from tyranny."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This is probably one of the most realistic works I have read. It is a absolute must for anyone attempting to understand the Pacific Campaign, what our men went through and what they did for us. I have read this one twice and plan a third reading soon. This is the sort of history they should be teaching in our schools rather than some of the meaningless stuff now presented. This is certainly one work you can get your teeth into. Highly recommend you add it your your collection! Thank you Mr. Sledge."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I was amazed at what I was reading. Not for the facts of war, which were crude enough and don't need any more telling; I was amazed at how well this man could write. The fact that he could take notes during that action, that he could reveal so openly and humbly his thoughts and fears, his human nature. I believe he didn't go insane thanks to his writing.The importance of this book, what makes it the best book of its genre, is the honesty and humbleness of this man.More than glad for having read this book, I am glad for knowing that people like Sledge have populated this Earth. God bless Sledge."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"\\"With the Old Breed\\" is a first-hand account of combat against the Japanese at Okinawa and Peleliu. Actually, I never heard of the Battle for Peleliu until I read this book. But, this battle and the one for Okinawa were fierce battles against an enemy very willing to die for their cause. Very few prisoner were taken.Overall, I thought this book was excellent. Lying in foxholes at night waiting for the Japanese to infiltrate must have been horrific as was the constant shelling. There was 2 weeks of rain on Okinawa and mud and trench foot, etc. And then there was the stench of rotting bodies. The most memorable moment in the book for me was when the author was ordered to dig in along a ridge. First, he found maggots. After more digging, he realized he was digging through a dead Japanese soldier!"},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"My generation was late even for the Vietnam war. So when we want to understnd war, we ar indebted to authors such as E.B. Sledge, who describe in vivid detail what it was like to live through the &quot;meat grinder&quot; of battle. It is too much to say I envy the soldiers who fought in the battles of Peleliu and Okinawa, described in this book. The author's descrition is too true-to-life to admit such a comment. But it is not too much to say that one comes to admire the sacrifice and courage of men who fought these battles. Mr. Sledge's book is a great gift to those who never have had to put their lives on the line for thier country -- it informs and humbles us. I expect this book is also a great gift to those who have endured the crucible of battle -- it articulates their common experience."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"'With the Old Breed' is a powerful first person account of Dr Sledge's experiences fighting in the Pacific. This book varies from most military pieces in that the larger view of the war takes a back seat to the daily personal experiences of the fighting men on the ground.Dr Sledge's detailed writing drags the reader into the fighting hell the Marines faced in the Pacific theatre during WWII. It follows his experiences from training through to his first experience of battle in Peleliu to the final capture of Okinawa. He manages to drag the reader into the World of the fighting Marines - from the horror delivered by war and the fanatacism of the Japanese enemy, to the brotherhood only experienced between men fighting for one anothers survival.I would recommend this piece not as a definitve historical account of fighting in the Pacific in WWII, but rather as a moving personal account of one mans experiences on the frontlines. A must for any military historian."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I have been an avid reader of World War II publications for over ten years. My father served in the South Pacific at the War's end, and rarely speaks of the horrors of his experiences in World War II. Eugene Sledge recalls two of the most horrific battles American Marines fought in the Pacific Theater of Operations. What these men faced every day is almost incomprehensible. Having grown up in a strong Catholic family, I know all about Purgatory, Hell, and the Eternal Lake of Fire; Having read &quot;With the Old Breed on Peleliu and Okinawa,&quot; I truely believe those men who fought in either of those two campaigns could write a book on those places mentioned."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I write this review from two separate perspectives. As a graduate of West Point, our training with regard to wars and individual battles focused on the larger picture and never quite got into the nitty gritty of battle such as Prof. Sledge's book does except to state that this or that battle was especially brutal. From Prof. Sledge's words, you can hear the artillery and mortars and bullets above and around you, you can smell the rotting remains of friends and enemy alike, you can see the incredibly horrid conditions these boys who became men in a short period of time withstood and you can feel the fear of the Marine as he waited for his orders to attack or waited to repulse the next enemy infiltrator in the night. Incredible imagery. This book should be read by all young men and women who wish to be in our military, especially those in our service academies and ROTC and OCS programs who will lead these soldiers and Marines into battle, for all wars will be won on the ground by the individual. As a son of one of the men of K/3/5 on Peleliu and Okinawa, I'm in awe of what my father experienced and accomplished and lived thru and of what all men of similar combat experience have done. Nick Kasun never talked much about the brutality he endured and now I know why. It would have been too painful for him to verbalize and relive. This book is a must read for all who really want to know what our guys did for our country in combat from someone who lived it for two of the most brutal battles of the South Pacific. TV and the movies can't give you true combat conditions for one reason: not many would be able to hold down their popcorn or snacks after seeing the true version. I applaud and honor Professor Sledge and the men of K/3/5."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I ordered With the Old Breed from Amazon after watching Ken Burns' work on World War IIand seeing the first installments of Pacific on HBO. Eugene B. Sledge is featured in bothproductions. Sledge's treatment of the war in the Pacific hit home for me because my fatherserved as a Seabee in the Solomon Islands. This book is very honest and reflects the horrorsof war and what human beings are capable of under extreme conditions. This book should be mustreading for all Americans who so easily send young men and women off to die in war. The book bolsters myconviction that a draft is needed when the president declares war. If every young man and womanwould be eligible to serve and die to defend our nation, the Senators would be much less willingto see their \\"Senator's Sons\\" go off to war. Perhaps we would begin the task of finding other meansshort of violence to work out our differences."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This should be required reading for all politicians making any decisions about war.For every citizen, in fact.I read it with frequent, moist eyes.The first hand account reveals the real uselessness of war...far different than the \\"grand\\" historical overview.Now I know why the REAL soldiers in combat never wanted to talk about what happened to noncombatants.How could one believe that such inhumanity even existed?I am humbled by the sacrifice these people endured."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I wanted to read this book for a particular personal reason. My mother's cousin died on Peleliu. I only know him as an ever fading photograph of him and my mother sitting on the steps of my mother's home. It was taken just before he was deployed. My mother often said he was charming and one of the favorites of the family. I think he was her favorite. They must have been pals when they grew up. My mother was too close to ever answer questions, and I once asked my aunt what happened. The family didn't know much. Apparently he was advancing in the lead of his unit within a ravine when he was struck directly by an artillery shell. My aunt told me it was particularly anguishing for the family that little or nothing of his body remained to be returned. The loss was never forgotten, because each trip through the family album would stop briefly at that picture with my mother reminding me of her \\"charming and funny\\" cousin who had perished in \\"The war\\". While I have read general descriptions of the battle, what I had never read was a personal account. Throughout Sledge's description of the Peleliu battle, I was anxiously anticipating to see if my mother's cousin might figure into the story. He didn't, and it is not likely Sledge might have witnessed his death among the many deaths. However, Sledge's description of his own experience better clarified for me what any marine experienced in that battle. I don't think we can possibly understand the sacrifice without accounts like those of Sledge. However they are few; many others who might have written accounts didn't survive. Consequently, there is a certain preciousness to the rare firsthand view provided by Sledge. This is a military history where one cares much less about the battle than the people. A historian cannot tell us about what the men felt. Only those who have been there can draw the human picture, and you can tell by the even tone, there is an almost detectable reluctance to revisit the events, but Sledge reveals much. I think if you are looking for a firsthand account of fighting in the Pacific, this is excellent, and I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I have read over 30 persoanl accounts of cambat in WWII and this one has to rank at the top. If anyone can read this account and not thank God for the USMC then they place no value in their freedom. The vivid accounts of sheer terror are beyond description. You must read it to believe it. I usually read about the war in Europe but after this book it is obvious that the fighting in the Pacific took brutality to another level. Thank you E.B. Sledge for your service and this wonderful book."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Eugene B. Sledge enlisted in the Marine Corps on December 3, 1942 although he was a freshman at Marion Military Institute. He explains that he quit college because he was \\"prompted by a deep feeling of uneasiness that the war might end\\" before he could get overseas. But his parents wanted him to become a military officer, so he compromised by signing up for the V-12 new officer training program. That put him in a comfortable classroom in Georgia Tech, with boring teachers, detached from the war. At the end of the first semester, Sledge was one of ninety men (half the detachment) to intentionally flunk out of school in order to be allowed to enter the Marine Corps as enlisted men. They wanted to serve their country immediately.With the Old Breed walks us through boot camp, Sledge's training at Camp Elliot, further training at Pavuvu, and then into the battle of Peleliu. I was struck by Sledge's maturity, bravery, and almost unqualified respect for those in his chain of command. How different from so many 18-19 year old men today! Sledge paints a vivid picture of the horrors of war, providing a clear context of the larger scale troop movements and progress while also dwelling on the relationships of the soldiers, the details of daily life (from wet socks, to enjoying scavenged Japanese rations of sea scallops, to \\"field sanitation\\"), and countless anecdotes of incidents showing the bravery of the men and their devotion to each other.In no way does Sledge ever glorify the war. He describes it eloquently as \\"brutish, inglorious, and a terrible waste.\\" The stress the men endure and the atrocities they witness slowly--or in some cases quickly--dehumanized many of them, to the point that some were guilty of atrocious acts, like looting the gold teeth of a still-living Japanese soldier. Sledge does not spare readers the misery of their surroundings, the terror of being constantly under barrage by machine gun bullets and enemy shells, or the despair at the senseless loss of life.I was awestruck by the fact that as miserable and fearful as he was in battle, he never once expresses regret. There is a sense that despite all the misery and futility the war was still necessary. But what seemed to motivate Sledge was not the abstract principle of protecting the American way of life. It was the comradeship and commitment he shared with his fellow marines, the knowledge that they were going through this together as friends and that each of them would die to save the others. Still, his quite, underlying patriotism comes out on the last page of the book, where he writes: \\"If the country is good enough to live in, it's good enough to fight for. With privilege goes responsibility.\\"The book is a page-turner. Written in a calm, almost detached way, Sledge's memoirs are surprisingly engaging and even suspenseful. I read it very carefully, not wanting to miss a word, feeling as though I was experiencing the war along with Company K (though thankfully without the maggots, flooded foxholes, or constant threat to my life)."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This was a wonderful book. I do not know much about the battles of the Pacific Theater. Sledge did an amazing job of not getting too technical but still describing the battles and misery of the soldiers who foughtPeleliu and Okinawa.

So many young men who gave their lives at Peleliu and for what."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Incredible bravery, tremendous mental stress, Sledge takes you from the beach landing to the ultimate defeat of the Japanese on Peilulu and Okinawa. The price these brave men paid for protecting our country in those darkest times is truly remarkable. Every American living today owes these soldiers who served in the Pacific and European theaters the utmost respect and thanks. Not many of these WWII vets are still with us, but every time I meet one, I am going to make sure I thank them for their service.We owe our modern day veterans the same respect and gratitude. A big thankyou to all service men and women! You folks are #1!"},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"To understand, really understand, what war is about, listen to William Tecumseh Sherman, the great Civil War general, and E.B. Sledge, a real life marine in the Pacific Theater of WWII.Sherman said, \\"War Is Hell\\" and Sledge describes that hell in suprising, intimate, sometimes gory detail. It's not pretty.If you want to think about the glory of war, go rent a John Wayne Movie--\\"the Sands of Iwo Jima\\"or \\"he Fighting Seebees\\" would be good ones--but if you want to know why Sherman said, \\"War Is Hell,\\" and what war is really like from the soldier's point of view, read this book.Gripping, graphic, sobering and at times inspiring--but not in the way you think.This book deserves a 5-Star plus rating...and to say that men like Sledge are a part of \\"The Greatest Generation\\" does not do them justice."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I purchased this book after watching \\"The War\\" on PBS. The author Eugene Sledge is one of the people featured in this film. This book is like none other I have ever read on WWII. It is so down to earth and very moving at times. Eugene graphically brings to the reader so much detail of war, some of which I have never heard of before. This book isn't about strategies,politics,or leadership. It is about one young marine who wrote down his personal experiences,feelings,and hopes. It helps you understand what the individual soldier went threw while fighting on islands like Peleliu,Okinawa,Iwo Jima,and the like. I am so glad he turned his memoirs into this book."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This is one of the best books, of any genre, that I have ever read. What a profound new respect I have for combat veterans. With crisp, unadorned prose, Sledge describes what it was like to be a Marine in the Pacific during WWII so vividly, that on more than one occasion, I found myself hunkered down in the chair, my shoulders tight and my teeth clenched. If reading about the battles on Peleliu and Okinawa can make me that tense, I cannot begin to fathom how the Marines and soldiers actually in the fights did not crack up. And, in Sledge's honest telling, many did. Unlike a lot of books where ALL Americans were noble and heroic, Sledge does not pull any punches. His description of a Marine in a fox hole who loses it one night and can't be made to shut up is haunting. I imagine many scenes in the book will stay with me.My brother is getting a copy of this for his birthday. Highly recommended - even if you think you don't like \\"war stories.\\" If you're human, this is worth reading."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"if you want to read what it was like to be a \\"grunt\\" slogging through the WWII Pacific island battles, this is the book for you. Sledge was a grunt and proud to be a grunt. He did not know the bigger schemes. He was not responsible for decisive group moves - he did what he was told and hoped and hoped to get out alive. From some one who experienced something that I never will, a very good read. I found it hard to put this down.I'm very grateful to Mr. Sledge for his efforts both during the war and in the telling of it."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This is one of the best first hand accounts of a little known battle in the Pacific. While almost everyone has heard of Okinawa which was a great success for the Marines despite heavy causalities the disaster at Peleliu was something different. Peleliu was a vicious and protracted fight for the marines. The hard fighting that would take its toll and Sledge recounts it with stunning clarity. It is hard to find good accounts of World War 2 and this is one of the best. This book is an honest and clear account and is a must have for any World War 2 buff. This was part of a military history class that I took and if anyone is looking for a book that can show the horrors of World War 2 as well as the triumphs this is the book for you."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"As an old Marine, I have been turned off by many books claiming to be \\"authentic\\" accounts of combat in various wars. \\"With the Old Breed\\" is probably the best I have ever read. It paints a vivid picture of a hard fought war through the Pacific Islands, as seen through the eyes of a Marine Private (and later Corporal). Some scenes are very graphic, others are left ot the viewer's imagination. What the reader comes out with is a deep appreciation of the young men who endured this form of terrible combat, often with very high losses in both killed and wounded. It is another reason to thank those who served so valiantly to preserve our freedom.While none of the battles in the book took place on Iwo Jima, the campaigns of Peleliu and Okinawa are yet other examples of the unique quality attributed to WWII Marines -- \\"uncommon valor was a common virtue.\\""},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"You only have to read Sledge's account to appreciate the awfulness. Not for the faint-hearted. The death toll on both sides in both battles was horrific and, as in every war, included a great number of civilians. Military historians assure us that the battle for Okinawa was absolutely necessary. Accounts differ as to the necessity of taking Peleliu."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"As far as one can get in a book this one gives you the essence of combat. The best and the worst."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I have read many books about WWII, both fiction and nonfiction. This effort is without a doubt the very best from the foot soldiers' point of view.

A definite &quot;Five Star&quot; book."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I first saw and heard Dr. Sledge describing the experience he had with trhe old Breed on the History Channel.. I waited three months for the book to get here. I read the book, and then the other reviews. This book left my heart so shocked and my mund so full of appreciation that I know that I cannot add enough words to the graditute I owe the men that went through what most Americans will never know. It has already been said. It can't be said with more sencereity, or in a more compassionate way. To Sledgehammer, I say, I only wish so much that I had had the privledge to have known you personally."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"An excellent account of personal experience.

Didn't serve during WWII but have served in every conflict since Viet Nam and he nails some of the experiences. HIs descriptions of what you see, hear, and smell are dead-on. Good book and it's on the list of required reading for Marines - and anyone else."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I first read this book some years ago, when it was out of print but still recognized by many as a first rate journal of man and war. I trust the HBO series will keep it back in print for many years to come. Sledge tells his story with a deep sense of humility and respect. The violence and terror of Peleleui and Okinawa are palpable through his unembellished prose style. There is no literary enhancement here, no exaggeration, because none is necessary. It leaves readers to marvel at the good fortune of the United States, to be defended by ordinary men who are called upon to engage in extraordinary and dehumanizing acts of selflessness."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I have read alot of accounts about the pacific war,none surpasses E.B. Sledge. he says it all when he said \\"you dont know what it was like unless you fought in the battles, even the soldiers in rear areas a short distance away dont know\\".every student should read this book in school, then maybe when they grow up an become politicians they wont send our boys off to war.plan for the worst an hope for the best."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This autobiography is graphic without being obscene so be prepared. Eugene Sledge tells it exactly like what it was to be a front line U.S. Marine fighting the Japanese in the Pacific theater during WWII. The sadness, despair, honor, fear, courage, and the personal hardships endured are all described in vivid detail."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"The 1981 Presidio hard cover edition is a very sturdy binding of this book. My copy has held up well to nearly 19 years of being stuffed into suitcases and helmet bags, dropped, dog eared and underlined. Early in its life I lent it to a number of people in my squadron and later to my children, so who knows what abuse it has suffered. It appears to be printed on high quality paper and is barely discolored despite its hard usage. In my opinion it is a very good buy if you can find a copy."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I'm about half way through the Kindle edition of this book and have to say it is excellent. There are moments when you are brought into the battle so vividly you almost want to find a place to hide. The descriptions of the thirst Sledge and his fellow marines experienced are real and painful. The battle scenes are haunting. If you are interested in the Pacific Theater during WWII please read this book."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I would highly recommend this book about WWII in the Pacific. Sledge has a remarkable way of writing that makes you feel what he felt."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"It would be a foolhearty attempt on my part to attempt to add any superlatives not already offer by other highly favorable reviews of this book.

Downright amazing! a true telling of the hell he and others went through during the war. He tells it how it was, no matter how horrifying.Its an easy read, and a book you can not put down till its finished. Then you have to pick up, and start reading it again.I know he's passed but thank you Mr. Sledge, and all veterans."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I never would have read this book if it were not for the HBO mini-series \\"The Pacific\\". I have my BA degree in history, served five years in the Marine Corps (F 2/11, 1stMarDiv), and spent one year in Okinawa. Sledge tells the battles of Peleliu and Okinawa like it was and how life in the Marine Corps still is! I often side that I would have hated to have fought on Okinawa. Well, after five years with the Old Breed (1st Marine Division), one year on Okinawa and very limited combat during Desert Storm, after reading \\"With the Old Breed\\", I know (as best as one could) just what that fight was like. Eugene Sledge \\"Sledgehammer\\" is what is best about the Marine Corps and being a Marine. He IS a Marines Marine. I am proud to have served where Sledge and his Marines spilled their blood so that the WORLD could know freedom. Semper Fi Mac!"},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Without a doubt one of the finest books to come out of WWII.

Once read, never forgotten."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"How anyone can rate this below 5 stars is beyond me. Sledge's captivating account of his time in the Pacific takes the reader to the front lines of battle. This book is as real as gets without having been in combat, and Sledge's delivery is flawless. The fortitude and tenacity these soldiers showed in the face of the atrocities of war is astonishing. Definitely one of the best, if not the best, first hand account of WW2 I have come across. \\"God Isn't Here,\\" by Richard E. Overton is also an excellent read if you enjoyed this one."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"The most realistic war description. Must read. Paints the same picture as the first 40 minutes of Saving Private Ryan."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This is a great read for anyone interest in World War II and our Marines in the Pacific. It told of the gritty everyday fear and the deprevation of such war fighting. It tells of the fear and the hate for the enemy on both sides of the conflict. It is a terrible way to solve a one nations problem with another. It is very well written and is extremely interesting."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Eugene Sledge's work makes me wish there were a higer rating than a mere five star. The writing is clear as spring water and the author does not flinch. I also wish that reading such raw memoirs would be required for men who send young men to war. The author strips the glory away and leaves the gore and filth of real war for us to behold. In my opinion Eugene Sledge deserves a medal for the agony of soul he must have endured in this labor. He could not have done it for his own glory.He shows himself in a no-nonsense manner, without the slightest hint of boasting, giving credit to others when it is due. He is also not afraid to blame culpable parties, even if they are senior commanders. In summary, there is not enough that I could say that is good about this book. It is an excellently written work that should be read by every officer candidate and every candidate that seeks an office high enough that it maght place him in the position of having men's lives in his hands. You will hardly be able to put this book down, it is that good."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I have generally found that it pays to read reviews before buying on Amazon; that's what makes this such a great community. So when I read nothing but rave reviews about \\"The Old Breed\\" I had to give the book a try.Wow.I have read many first-hand accounts of War II, and have interviewed many who were there. This book is indeed a rare jewel. Honest, well-researched, interesting... and hard to put down. Few books put you there- really there. This one does. Thoughtful, and with the right mix of pathos and resignation known only to a seasoned combat veteran. There is no way I could do the book justice in a review like this. A must read."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"One of the most compelling books I've ever read on World War II. A very personal and accessible window into the hell that is war, and the unique hell that was Peleliu and Okinawa. An absolute must read - should be placed alongside classics such as The Red Badge of Courage, All Quiet on the Western Front, The Killer Angels and The Longest Day."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"An amazing view of the war in the Pacific. It's horrific, not in the language but in the details of life on the front line. Digging a fox hole though a battlefield graveyard, yuck!And I'm currently reading \\"Ship of Ghosts, The Story of the USS Houston, FDR's Legendary Lost Cruiser, and the Epic Saga of her Survivors\\" and in that book the Admiral complains that the men have been driven to their limits by a 21 hr on watch detail with only coffee and ham sandwichs for meals! The marines of the 5th would have killed for a ham sandwich and stone cold coffee! Weeks in the mud & rain, not a measly 21 hrs on watch! I guess it's all based on your perspective, still though they come off sounding like whiners.Another good reason to read this book is as an uplifting perspective on your own life. How good you really have it, even living under a bridge in a cardboard box would be better than the hell holes those fox holes were.What also comes through loud and clear is that while there is no pity for the soldiers he kills, there is respect. And in someways this is an anti war book. No one dies in glory for their country in this story. And with the ratio of deaths of the Japanese vs the Americans, it's amazing that they held on to the last man.The other clear message, is that this war was won by killing the enemy one at a time. Yeah occasionally they shelled some group of soldiers but most of them died with a last single bullet finding it's mark. What a dirty business."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Hearing Eugene Sledge's words during Ken Burns' \\"The War\\" really put the hook in me. This book is the best personal account of combat experience I've read. His eloquent and direct style gives the reader a sense of the effect that the horror of war has on combatants. Anyone interested in military history and how war affects those closest to it will find Sledge's book enthralling."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"One of the most powerful books I have read on the Pacific war. This is the gunsight view of the war written by a very gifted writer."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I was first aware of this book when it was published (without little or no fanfare) in 1981. A few years later, Sledge was interviewed by Studs Terkel for his Pulitzer Prize account, \\"The Good War.\\" Since then, his book gathered steam. Paul Fussell singled it out in his book \\"Wartime,\\" and John Keegan said in his book \\"The Second World War,\\" that the book was \\"haunting.\\" Now the book is regarded as a classic and rightly so. I read it in 1995 and while Sledge's prose may not be as polished as a professional writer, it's his total honesty the keeps you going. To me, this was the best kind of writing, it's written from the gut. It also seems like a personal excorcism, a way to purge the demons and tell people of what he saw and what we, our country lost in this war.Ken Burns was right to select Sledge for his documentary, \\"The War.\\" Though the extracts they use makes Sledge seem bitter. Reading the book it seemed to me that he was proud of his service, but haunted by the terrible things he was forced to endure.Also, read for what Sledge doesn't say. His friend Sam Phillips (also in Burns' \\"The War,\\") said, \\"We never took a prisoner.\\" Sledge says the same thing. One can only assume the worst in a war where life was regarded so cheaply.This book should be required reading for Political leaders who are so callous to send young men to war so quickly over so little."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Watching the varios retrospectives shown during the 50h anniversary of the end of WWII was fascinating,but what delighted me was seeing Eugene Sledge on televlsion and getting to see what he looked like and what his voice sounded like.I'd read his book several times and it was great actually seeing him.As the cliche goes, I felt like I knew him. I assume that he's passed away because he wasn't on camera during Ken Burns' new documentary, The War,and I felt a real sense of sadness and loss when I realized that he was being discussed but wasn't being interviewed-which made me assume that death had finally caught up with him.Damned shame.He authored one of the finest American memiors of a fighting man.He brilliantly conveyed the pride and excitement that he and his fellow Marines felt on finally \\"making the team\\"and he just as brilliantly conveyed the horror and disgust that a thinking man must feel sitting in a hole in the ground surrounded by rotting bodies and human excrement,waiting for an incomprehensible foe who was eager to die in battle.RIP Eugene. Thanks for what you did for your country."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"A very graphic yet human interpretation of the war. There are some fascinating looks into the darkest recesses of a man's psyche during the most grueling and sickening moments of warfare. Definitely worth the read for any WW2 or war buff in general, as well as any student of humanity."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Sledge was a young, sensitive man who joined the Marine Corp and saw some of the most viscious fighting in WWII. I have read many memoirs of war. This one stands alone as the best. Mr Sledge has the ability to make you feel his pain and terror and show how his experienc transformed him. If you want to see and feel what it was like to serve in the Pacific with the Marines read this book. I've given it to over 7 people as gifts (something I have never done before) and all found it very moving."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Excellent description of battle conditions.

I don't think they have a clue what a price was paid for their freedom ."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Though I've read countless history books, mostly on 20th Century Wars, never have I been transported so vividly to a battlefield. Until Saving Private Ryan came out, WWII was our 'glamorous' war if you will. So many heroic movies were made throughout the 50's and on starring every leading man in Hollywood.Sledges book truly strips the varnish off what the meatgrinder is like. Mechanized slaughter. The stunning contrast between Marines who just want to see their families again and Japanese who, while many surely hailing from simple lives and loving families, resigned to throw their lives away at the highest possible cost to their enemy. The gripping scenes of him stuck in a flooded foxhole with putrid remains around, waiting for orders to be sent into the fray while each sides artillery furiously flies overhead in each direction is one of the most sobering reads ever. Knowing these ordinary guys were out there doing extraordinary things for us is palpable.I was a Navy fighter pilot from '89 to '97 and, though I saw plenty pics of my handywork from two Iraq tours, I never came close to what Sledge felt, being resigned to near certain death or maiming. Ok, the night carrier landings were no picnic. But its impossible to exaggerate how huge a sacrifice so many regular Americans made, yanked out of their quiet lives and thrust into hell against a vicious, clever, well-armed enemy.The scene during mop up ops after the Okinawa battle had ended of the two Imperial officers in full dress uniform, boots polished, charging a Marine brigade armed only with Samurai swords to certain death is so contrary to any Western mentality. We are rightfully trained to make the other guy die for his country. My 94 year old uncle, still living, left his farm in 1941 to fly P-38's in N Africa during the war, returning to the farm when it ended. I thank him often. Though this country seems to be going down an uncertain path vis a vis the economy, immigration, demographics, debt, etc, its more important now than ever to THANK A VET in person while they're still with us."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This book finally enabled me to fill in the story surrounding the tidbits of things my Dad reluctantly divulged about the brutal, muddy, bloody events he lived through as a Sergeant on Okinawa with what the Marines called their Army division, the 77th Infantry Division. Dad received a Silver Star (which, when you read the citation, you would swear is as much deserving of the Medal of Honor as a lot of those citations I have read), and, because his company was so decimated, had to have 2nd Lt. bars pinned on him on the battlefield. He suffered all his life with various ailments traceable to living, eating, sleeping in the mud on Okinawa, never complaining or burdening other Americans to pay him disability, and died in 1981. Dad never lived to see his grandson, Kyle, have 2nd Lt. bars pinned on him at West Point. (Or did he?)."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"The Pacific War was the most horrible modern conflict in which Americans have fought - made so by an unrelenting, fanatical enemy battling in often abysmal locations. The savagery displayed by both sides was mind-boggling, and Sledge pulls no punches in that regard; as he notes, most books on the war overlook the virulent hatred that characterized combat between Japanese and Americans during those dark days. It's no wonder so few of them wanted to talk about it upon returning.This book captures the feeling of the young boy plunked down in the middle of nowhere, not sure what he'd find. What he found was the stuff of nightmares. What those young men accomplished is astounding, and to think they had to come home to a country that regarded the Pacific as a mere second stage to Europe and to families whose only frame of reference for war was Hollywood's irrelevant representation and dry newspaper accounts. Indeed, the Marines wondered if it would take an attack back home to shake them up. So they grew alienated from the homefront and the bonds between them grew. Some tore up their tickets home to return to their companies in the face of more combat. That brotherhood was all they had after being forever changed by the war.Think of this work as a reminder in this post-narcissist age what sacrifice once meant and what a generation had to contend with. Sledge is one of the few to leave behind a truly stunning first-person document of that godawful war, and we should be glad he did - we need to know what was and what might have been. His generation is passing on now, and it's hard to imagine a greater loss that America could suffer."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Everyone who has ever read any of Tom Clancy's glorification-of-war novels should read this terrible, superb book, as an antidote."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I watched \\"The Pacific\\" on HBO recently. It left an impact on me. In the final episodes, I would just sit there in the quiet, after my DVR had ended, unable to contemplate what I had just witnessed as true (albeit sometimes dramatized) accounts of the Pacific theater of war. When I bought my Kindle, my first two purchases were Robert Leckie's \\"Helmet for My Pillow\\" and E.B. Sledge's \\"With the Old Breed\\". Leckie's was a very intellectual approach to writing his account. But of course, he was a writer by major and career. Sledge's account is somehow different...it is raw and brutally descriptive. You really see into the psyche of a soldier torn by basic humanity and unadulterated terror. My gratitude for such soldiers is remarkably amplified with this whole experience of the mini-series and books.As of May 2010, however, please be aware that the formatting and typographical errors in the e-book edition make it very difficult to read. Spacing is off, incorrect characters are used (\\"1\\" for \\"I\\"), and whole paragraphs are misplaced!!!! Yes, the the latter is most offending. There are footnotes in Sledge's text. You click on the symbol and are taken to the footnote. But in 2-3 cases, a paragraph that clearly belongs in the main context was pasted to the end of the footnote. Because when you go back to reading, Sledge is in the middle of a conversation or description that would make no sense had you not read the misplaced text. I've written both Amazon and the publisher. E-book consumers care just as much about these things as do print readers. There is no reason to have lower standards in this emerging format. But I will not poorly review the book for that. Just want to make my fellow consumers aware of the issue."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Not for the faint of heart or stomach, this read is a must for WWII enthusiasts. Atrocoties and kindnesses abound as you follow Sledgehammer through the perils of a mortarman trying to do his best amid deplorable conditions that test his mettle and resolve. Written in plain, everyday language, Sledge describes every facet of war....the good, bad and ugly....and very ugly. The time I spent in Viet Nam during 1968 was a walk in the park in comparison."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"While not specifically an antiwar account, E.B. Sledge's, With The Old Breed presents the horrors of war graphically in all five senses. In this personal memoir, Sledge takes us into the hell of war and the lingering terror inside his own mind. We not only see the devestation, we hear the deafening explosions, feel the mud in our \\"boondockers,\\" taste the rain-soaked c-rations, and most of all smell the rotting corpses of his fellow marines and enemies that litter the battlefield. In one scene, Sledge describes digging a foxhole on Okinawa only to have his entrenching tool pierce the ribcage of a buried Japanese soldier. The stench fills the air and turns loose a horde of maggots from the dead's body. In a sense Sledge is the soldier's Everyman who lays bare the terrible costs of war echoing like cannon fire through the ages. What struck me the most about this autobiography is how so relatively few people in leadership positions can send so many to die for some cause these leaders deem as just. Sledge carried these memories with him throughout his life as a biology professor at a small Alabama college. He passed away in 2001 and is now with the old breed. May he and all his comrades in arms rest in peace for eternity."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I have read Eugene Sledge's With the Old Breed (WTOB) several times, starting back in the 1980's, and I've found it a rewarding experience each time. We see the transformation of the mild-mannered nineteen year old as he becomes a well-trained, then a battle-hardened Marine, known by the deceptively tough-sounding nickname of Sledgehammer. He sees fellow Marines maimed and killed, the ruthlessness of his enemy, who must be answered in kind, and the wearing away of the veneer of civilized life. Sledge describes in uncommonly vivid detail the degrading conditions he and his comrades must endure for weeks on end as they confront a foe who neither grants nor expects quarter. Among the many memorable scenes are the nights on Half-Moon Hill on Okinawa, with constant rain falling, and star shells illuminating the corpses in the hellish, devastated landscape. All of that is certainly memorable stuff, but if that were all there were to WTOB, we would have an excellent memoir, but one better than others only by degree.I find what sets WTOB apart from the rest, however, is the capacity on the author's part for sober and honest self-examination. Sledge tells us bluntly that as his landing craft approaches Peleliu that he is afraid of losing control of his bladder. When he sees his first dead Marine up close, he says he is glad the Marine's mother can't see him. Perhaps the most revealing episode about Sledge is when he is forced to shoot a Japanese soldier at close range, after the Japanese emerges from a bunker and tries to throw a grenade. As Sledge's first bullet strikes the soldier's chest, Sledge sees the man's face \\"contorted in agony.\\" Sledge first feels revulsion that he just killed a man at close range, then shame that he feels that way, given the situation and is glad his comrades can not read his thoughts. That type of self-revelation is rare, and stands in contrast to more swaggering, self-serving memoirs. It may also explain why Sledge, although he breaks down a few times, sobbing, he never becomes unhinged, and is able to continue under the most appalling conditions during his time in combat.In a recent edition of Military History magazine (Nov/Dec 2008), the writers were polled to each give their top-ten best military history books of all time. When the results were tallied, the name of Eugene Sledge stood next to those of Clausewitz and Thucydides. No less a military historian than John Keegan has called WTOB, \\"one of the most arresting documents in war literature.\\" No higher recommendations are needed. But before you read WTOB, do yourself a favor and find a Sledge interview on Youtube, and listen to the audio files of his interview at the Studs Terkel website, and browse the Eugene B. Sledge collection at the Auburn University digital library. Hearing Sledge talk, with his gentle, mellifluous southern accent, and seeing his mild-mannered nature, will give a \\"voice\\" to the narrative of WTOB that will enrich your reading experience."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I never fully understood my grandfather till I read this book as part of a collage class on WWII. He never talks about the war. He has storys of his time in boot camp, and his time in Japan after the war ended, but none during the war its self.I never understood what he went through, or how it made him who he is till I read this book. I knew he was a marine, and that he was stationd in the South Pacific, and I knew a few of the names of the battles he was in, but until I read Sldege's book I had no idea what he had gone through there.I consider this book a must for anyone that has had family in the military, and for everyone else who does not know what our military has done, and continues to do for the American people."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"\\"With the Old Breed\\" is Eugene Sledge's justly famous memoir of his service as a Marine Corps rifleman at the horrendous battles of Peleliu and Okinawa during the Second World War.Sledge writes with a compelling candor, and compassion, of his fellow marines in the some of the worst fighting in the Pacific. His portraits of his fellow marines, both the hardened veterans and the green recruits like himself, ring absolutely true. Sledge's companions in K Company, 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines are a cross-section of humanity, brave and afraid by turns, often humorous, devoted to each other and quite occupied with the struggle for survival. Sledge pulls no punches in describing the no-quarter fighting that prevailed at that stage of the war with Japan, including atrocities on prisoners and the suffering of the wounded on both sides. Sledge is able to capture the small details that make the story real for the reader. Through it all, Sledge is as steady and as matter of fact as a narrator as a man sitting at his own kitchen table.This book is highly recommended as one of the outstanding individual memoirs of the Second World War."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This is not the book to read if you want an overview of the campaigns. Even though there are maps it is hard to follow the action against them (most of the place name sin the narrative are not on the map), but that's ok. This is strictly a graphic account of what it was like to be there, and after reading this book you will probably know more about the campaigns than the author did at the time. Excellent."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Eugene B. Sledge died this week at the age of 78 from cancer. With the Old Breed is perhaps the finest personal account of combat ever written. It should be required reading in every high school in this country. Dr. Sledge wrote this book for his children: it has transcended that, and become a book for all our children."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Author Eugene Sledge served as a mortarman with the 1st Marine Division during the battles of Peleliu and Okinawa. His devasting account of the horrors he witnessed are a must read for anyone interested in WWII. This could be the best personal memoir of combat ever written. If you want a full appreciation of what the generation of Americans who endured WWII combat went through, buy this book now.Sledge takes the reader with him as he joins the Marine Corp, goes through boot camp, and ends up with the grizzled combat veterans of the 1st Marine Division. He takes us through his initiation of combat on Peleliu, a coral island which had some of the worst fighting, up to that point, in the Pacific. Today, there is a general belief that the battle for Peleliu was unnecessary, owing to the advancement of the schedule for the invasion of the Philippines. If this was an unneeded battle, Sledge shows in full detail the horrible sacrifice young Americans suffered.His account of the battle of Okinawa is even more devasting. Where Peleliu was a dry, parched hell, Okinawa is a hell of rain, mud, muck and decay. Sledge is unstinting in exposing the horror and ever-present danger facing those in the frontlines. He shows the casual brutality of combat, and does not turn away from showing the hatred most Marines had for the Japanese. He shows the close bonds that develop between the members of a combat unit, the terror of shell-shocked soldiers, dodging bullets &amp; shells on stretcher bearer duty, the stench of fighting in the middle of human decay, and the loss that is felt when friends die.&quot;With the Old Breed&quot; is mandatory reading for anyone interested in WWII."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Very few authors of books on the war in the South Pacific bring the vivid first hand experiences to light the way Dr. Sledge is able to do. He paints a picture that your mind and spirit is able to see as you read his words. He tells of the funny side of war, if there is one, the emense amount of hard work involved, and the brutality of war as he experienced it. The contrast of fighting on a barren coral rock, as was Peleliu, to the muck and mud of Okinawa is compelling.As I have been a close personal friend of Dr. Sledge for over 30 years, I have heard many times in his own words the accounts of the battles fought on Peleliu and Okinawa. However, Dr. Sledge, in the words he writes is able to bring the battles to life, and involve the reader as if they were there. His story is so much like the man he is, strong, well prepared, confident, a believer in God, and willing to go to war for his country and &quot;kill japs&quot;.Anyone who wishes to gain insight into the nature of the war with the Japanese, and of war in general, needs to read this book."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"My father (now 92) fought at both Pelileu and Okinawa, as did the author Eugene Sledge. Despite the fact that his generation rarely talks about WWII, he was thrilled to get this book and read it straight through.It's not only accurate, it is very moving. A great insider's look at two of the worst battles in the Pacific."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This book is a masterpiece of writing, fiction or nonfiction. You are right there in the blood and mud and nightmare with the soldier who wrote this book. He writes straight from his gut in a way most writers cannot accomplish after a lifetime of writing. This is not for the squeamish or romantic. It is war at its most brutal and it is very up close.I came away from this book profoundly moved by the willingness of the author to tell his story in such a plain, unvarnished way and for his sacrifice and for all the soldiers who were not able to speak. Historically, it is a fasinating look at the ground war in the Pacific, fought by the Marines. Sledge deals in the day to day life of the soldier on the ground, how he had to fight, what kind of rifle he had, what his foxhole felt like, what it sounded like at night. The devil's in these details. We don't hear much about Peleliu any more (can you find it on a map without checking with encarta?) We don't even hear much about the battle of Okinawa. The European theater has gotten much of the attention lately. I don't know why that is, maybe because it's easier to imagine Belgium or France, rather than Guadalcanal or the Solomon Islands.If you have a relative who served in any war, if your father or grandfather was in WW II, read this book for them, and think about what they did."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"My husband perscribed this book to me after we got married so that I would understand what being an infantryman in the Marines was like. I was enthralled with the narrative, and my heart broke for what all of the men went through. I wish this had been assigned reading in high school because my generation really has NO appreciation of what giving your life for freedom means. I recommend this to any military wife who wants to understand her husband better, and to any parent who wants their child to better appreciate the relatively easy life we have today."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Eugene Sledge takes us into the carnage and fear at Peleliu and Okinawa. His first-person account offers as close an idea of the horror of these places as anything I've read. Although he gives due credit to the \\"Old Breed\\" Marines that made up the personality of the units, he also cooly recounts the everyday, mostly overlooked, bravery of the younger NCOs, junior officers and replacements. It rates with the best small unit autobiographies of World War II."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"To say that this book is powerful is inadequate. 235 men of Company K, 3d Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division went ashore at Peleliu in September of 1944. In June of 1945, after mopping up at Okinawa, only 26 of the original K/3/5 made it through. Note E. B. Sledge's integrity as an objective observer of war. Sledge, known as \\"Sledgehammer\\" by the raggedy-... Marines, tells his horrific story without whining or self-pity. Neither is he grinding an anti-war, \\"peace at any price\\" ax. His experience is of the face of battle reduced to its most sickening level. Never mind the position movements on maps at headquarters; the stench of battle prevails. From Sledge's viewpoint, grand strategy gave way to one-on-one enemy action in his sector. Fear and survival exclude swagger. Men in battle persevere to kill the enemy and to support their buddies. Naive expectations fade quickly as maggots infest the dead and torrential jungle rain fills the foxholes. Bloody Nose Ridge and the Shuri Line grind the Marines. The snap of bullets, the whine of artillery shells, and the agonized cries of wounded comrades are the only soundtrack. Mental and emotional fatigue takes a fearful toll, right along with bloody wounds and dreadful field sanitation. Sledge deplores the brutish nature of war, but recognizes its occasional inevitability, humanity's great dilemma. The privilege of freedom carries its own responsibilities. Heed the writing of a fighting man who knows. This book should be required reading for all persons on both sides of the war controversy. ;-)"},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Absolutely AWESOME!This book was required reading in a WWII history class I took one semester in college. Not being much for dry, antiseptic history books, I grudgingly began reading it and my mind was blown.This is no boring, third person, tactical/political analasys. This is a personal account of Hell, told by someone who lived through it. I simply couldn't put it down.Definitely a must-read for anyone even remotely interested in WWII and the human experience with war."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I was a student in Dr. Sledge's zoology class when I was in college at The University of Montevallo. Unfortunately, I did not read his book until several years later, after he had passed away. What a missed opportunity to discuss the fascinating experiences of a true war hero.This book is an excellent first hand account of real combat--describing all of it's ugliness in detail. What I found truly gripping was how Dr. Sledge was able to convey the assault on all of the senses he experienced. It is amazing to me that this gentle man came though the kind of disgusting events detailed here.The book is superbly well written. If you want an in-the-trenches account of the Pacific island battles, buy this book. It will not disappoint."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"We picked up this book after watching The Pacific and it's a wonderful read. I am not in the military, but a military spouse, and it's a wonderful account of what the marines faced in the Pacific during WWII and a great story. I loved the honesty of the ghastly war that the marines faced and while it's not my usual read, I have truly enjoyed reading it. You feel like you know Eugene Sledge as he talks about his journey through the war. It's brutally honest, even the bad, and that's the best part; you respect his truth, even when it's hard to read."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"What a powerful re-creation of his experiences during WWII. I've read many war books, including China Marine, but this has to be the most powerful and gut wrenching of them all. I see one reviewer who said \\"kind of boring\\", not sure what book that person was reading but it was not With the Old Breed.

The gritty details are gruesome but give a realistic sense of what our brave men endured during this horrific war.

What makes me likethis book above other wartime stories, is the naration is storytelling hour by hour of what one guy felt as events happened, not just a typical what happened account.

A story of grit, determination and bravery in the most miserable and dangerous conditions imaginable, told from first hand experience of a true combat veteran of two of the most bloody battles of the Pacific campaign.Clear and to the point, it tells of the horrors faced on Peleliu and Okinawa and the losses against a determined and fanatical enemy who were prepared to fight to the death with a determination seldom seen on the European battlefields.For any student of history on WW2 and the fight to drive the Japanese back to their homeland this book would fit well in their library.. It is little wonder that it was used in part for the background to the excellent mini series \\"The Pacific\\"."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"E.B. Sledge brings the WWII exploits of a US Marine to us in all it's bloody, smelly, shocking, and heart-rending glory. Although today largely unknown, the Palau Campaign and specifically the battle for the island of Peleliu was just as contentious as the later battles of Okinawa (in which the author also fought) and Iwo Jima. Sledge does a fantastic job of bringing the war down to the level of the individual and really puts you in the fox hole so that you can relive the horrors of war with him. Although Sledge often recounts how he hates war and wishes that the jewels of a nations youth shouldn't have to be used as cannon fodder, he is by no means a passifist - he was a US Marine and is proud of his pedigree.This book is a must read for anyone who has ever looked down the business end of weapon, especially those who are or have been Marines, as well as those of us who are simply interested in military history."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This book, published 35 years after the end of WWII, should replace All Quiet on the Western Front as the ultimate anti-war - and horrors of war story. It is more personal as it is real - it is more interesting as it is real - it also takes place in WWII - against the evils that percipitated that war not the power quests that seemed to get WWI going - so maybe it justifies war but it shows the suffering and sacrifices of those actually fighting. An better moving read and more satisfying. In paperback the photos and illustrations are better than on Kindle - I know as I read it on Kindle and bougth the paperback to give as a gift."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"With the Old breed is a fantastic story of the Marines in the Pacific. it should be read by anyone who wants to feel how it was fighting in the pacific theatre during ww 2.

From the descriptions of training and boredom to the horrific examples of human cruelty, this book states all the facts without embellishment.The author moves the reader along a chronological journey bereft of all the bells and whistles that accompany some documentaries in this genre. Embedded in his brevity is a powerful message of heroism (Japanese and American), stoicism and hardship. The author honors his Japanese enemies with stories of heroism and discipline that are quite extraordinary.The descriptions of decomposing corpses in the mud of Okinawa will stay with me forever. The horror that he felt is conveyed in simple, powerful prose and I will not see another war movie or read another historical documentary without recalling his words.The writing style is easily readable and the message behind the story is impressive. War is hell.An excellent book for anyone to read. The powerful imagery might be a bit too much for younger readers, but to not read this book would be worse."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"THE MOST FACTIAL DISCRIPTION OF THE BATTLE FOR OKINAWA WRITTEN IN MARINE LANGUAGE LESS THEIR COLORFUL SPEECH."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This harrowing account is by far the best I have read on the battle for Peleliu. I spent a lot of time on Peleliu when I was working as a diving instructor in Palau. Today, the jungles have overgrown the entire area that was burned and blown into a desolate landscape during the battle. From the top of China Wall, it is hard to find a viewpoint to see the areas where all the intense action was. However, all the artifacts remain. Planes, tanks, guns, live ammunition, and Japanese skeletons can still be found in the caves and undergrowth. Without a book like this, it would be impossible to fully imagine the horrors of battle that occurred in the now peaceful jungle."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Eugene Sledge has written the finest account of Marines fighting in the Pacific that I've ever read. A highly personal, no holds barred story of the horrific fighting they waged against the Japanese on Pelelui and Okinawa. This is a higly readable and epic sweep across the Pacific and to the doorstep of Japan's home islands. The closer they got, the worse the fighting was, and Sledge pulls no punches whatsoever in describing his experiences. I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to know just what the WWII Pacific campaign was like."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I recently wrote a review on the Robert Leckie book, Helmet for my Pillow, which in my view, was a narrative of what he did in the war in the Pacific. On the other hand, E.B. Sledge in his book, With the Old Breed, wrote about what he witnessed in the war in the Pacific. For those readers who want to know about what the Marines had to deal with against the Japanese, read the latter. It is down right \\"chilling\\", and at the same time, a very serious read about Marine combat in the Pacific theater."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Sledge does a masterful job of explicitly bringing to the reader both the horror and heroism he witnessed during the Pacific campaign of World War 2. There is little flag waving or jingoism in his story. It is all about young men trying to stay alive while having to live and fight in unbelievably brutal and hostile conditions. Sledge, as a lowly private in the Marine Corp, gives the reader a front row seat to the extended hell these young enlisted men endured. As an accurate chronicle of the War in the Pacific it would be hard to beat this book. That is probably why both Ken Burns and Tom Hanks used it extensively in their works documenting the war in the Pacific."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Sledge makes no bones about the fact that he detested the war. He detested the barbarism it brought out in men - both the Japanese and the Americans. He details the sights, sounds and smells of war as much as words permit. It's unpleasant and could even be sickening for some. But he tells it as it was. He also describes the life they lived during that time - both on the battlefield and off. There are light moments of humor and comraderie, there is despair and boredom, and there is panic and terror. Reading this book, one comes to understand the great sacrifice these men made and the hell they endured. One also comes to understand how the battles were conducted, from the front lines to the rear echelon. While the \\"rear echelon\\" troops were often disparaged, Sledge takes care not to paint all of such service personnel with a broad stroke. He pulls no punches, but neither does he generalize in his criticisms. He does not inflate himself or draw undo attention to himself and his efforts - he simply tells of his experiences as he saw them, in a spirit of humility and reality, recognizing his role in the big picture.I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in really knowing what it was like. If you're drawn into this topic due to the HBO miniseries \\"The Pacific\\", I would definitely recommend this book. I would not recommend Leckie's \\"Helmet for my Pillow.\\" Another great read I would highly recommend, that explains the naval portion of the invasions isD-DAYS IN THE PACIFIC WITH THE US COASTGUARD: The Story of Lucky 13by Ken Wiley, detailing his time as a Higgins boat driver in the war. It is one of the most riveting and engaging and interesting books I have read regarding the war in the Pacific. Between Sledge and Wiley, you'll know as much as you can know of what it was like."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"As with many reviewers, watching the mini-series The Pacific got me interested in this book, along with Helmet for My Pillow (Robert Leckie). It's always interesting to see how faithful a film is to a book. In this case, the Pacific was very, very true to the book. Author E.B. Sledge (Sledgehammer) was able to keep a diary of his experiences and published it in 1981. Because the mini series used this and Helmet for My Pillow as part of the foundation of the story, the two books have been often compared to one another. The authors are very different people, the styles naturally differ. Sledge is much more matter of fact and those facts are gut wrenching. He also wrote his tale long after the war, his narrative style is straight at you, but almost detached. Leckie is far more poetic with purple phrases and imagery. The experiences of both Marines were the same - horrific and brutal. To put it in context, those who got the \`million dollar wound\\" were considered lucky. Their war was over, at least physically.Sledge writes of Boot Camp, battle, R&R;, more training, more battle, attrition. It's hard to comprehend numbers such as being one of 26 survivors out of 1,500 men. Rain, heat, mud, hunger, anger, fear, bone weary fatigue and the ever present stench of dead, decaying bodies - how do you go on? Only the training and bonds between the men enable them to take the next muddy step, wipe maggots off of each other and kill others.This is not a book for the faint of heart. It does not glorify war; on the contrary, it shows wars waste, carnage and denigration of the human spirit. The only good to come from war are the bonds formed amongst those who fought, who accepted the burden for others who did not and could never understand. As Sledge points out, if a country is worth living in, then it's worth dying for. With privilege goes responsibility\\". With The Old Breed shows that and much more. An excellent book, if there were a 10 star rating, it would get 10 of 10."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"When I was in Mobile recently, I visited the city museum and saw a photograph of a young marine in his dress uniform. That marine was Eugene Sledge. I was curious why his picture was in the museum and learned from the staff that his book, \\"With the Old Breed\\", was Dr. Sledge's account of several Pacific battles he participated in during WWII.I bought the book and must agree that it is probably one of the best personal histories of the Pacific war ever written. War is cruel and grotesque and Dr. Sledge lets the reader know just what it was like.

The Poetry is in the pity.\\"Wilfred Owen (1893-1918)Despite being a veteran of the victorious Allied powers, Sledge does not tell a story celebrating the triumph and heroism of the American Marines over the defeated Japanese soldiers. The dominant theme running through the narrative is one of brutality and survival rather than heroism. This comes as no surprise given the hellish conditions and terrible odds that the Marines in the Pacific campaigns face in surviving the battles. The combat veterans reckon that they are unlikely to survive three campaigns and statistically, the odds of Sledge emerging alive from his two campaigns are close to 1 in 10. It is nothing short of a miracle that he sees the end of the war physically unscathed and is in the company of the rare few in his unit who are not awarded the Purple Heart for injuries sustained in battle.Unlike the HBO's mini-series The Pacific, which draws on Sledge's memoir as one of the sources, the account does not highlight the heroism of soldiers at war. The narrative focuses instead on vivid details of the sheer physical, psychological and emotional torture that Sledge experiences and observes in his comrades-in-arms. In both campaigns, he recreates the lurid details of the battlefield: the heat, cold, disease, death and stench of uncovered decomposing bodies littering the very grounds that they are entrenched in for days and weeks of battle. The details are so vivid that the reader is not only able to visualise the scenes but also able to touch, smell and taste the putrefaction that comes with war. However, the memoir is not just about the savagery visited on the soldiers, but also recounts the soldiers in acts of savagery. Both the Marines and their enemies commit atrocious acts of barbarism: the former using their issued Kabar knives to extract the gold teeth from fallen Japanese soldiers (and the Japanese soldiers need not even be dead); the latter severing the genitals of dead Marines and stuffing it into the mouths of their decapitated heads. Although not explicitly stated, it seems that the account recalls and revises the oft quoted adage \\"war brings out the best and the worst in people\\" to \\"war does not bring out the best in soldiers, it brings out the worst in them.\\"Sledge's memoir is reminiscent of the poetry of Wilfred Owen who famously prefaced his poems with a critique of war. In fact, the sentiments expressed in prose resemble the lines of Owens's Dulce et Decorum est with the exception of the final verse. Owens' final line in the poem criticises patriotism as political propaganda, but Sledge is no politician and does not dwell on the politics of war. He is a Marine and as a Marine he does not question the \\"whys\\" of war, but only carries out his duties with honour and to the best of his ability. There is no doubt that Sledge is proud to be a Marine and has no love lost towards the Japanese soldiers whom he detests as savage enemies whom he would kill with little hesitation. In fact, he firmly believes the duty he owes to his country as a soldier, stating that \\"If a country is good enough to live in, it's good enough to fight for.\\" He does however criticise war and how it ravages the soldiers, both American and Japanese, who fight it. His assessment of the two campaigns, indeed towards all wars, is aptly captured in his own words \\"War is brutish, inglorious, and a terrible waste.\\" Therein lies the existential conundrum that permeates his account: It is right to fight for the country although war (or the fight) is in itself wrong."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I've read enough histories and analysis of WWII and wanted to get a view of what it was like to actually be in battle. I got more than I bargained for in this book. In a very well written, simple and straightforward style the author conveys exactly what is was like to live through the terror and carnage of these two battles. I highly recommend this book for anyone curious about what being in battle is like. Some other books I sampled were so poorly written I couldn't get through even a few pages. They were bad amateur authors trying to be poetic and just sounding silly or injecting some half-baked philosophy. Thankfully, E.B. Sledge stays away from all that and sticks to the subject, a good exposition of the effectiveness of simple and clear language. But be prepared - he pulls no punches and the subject matter is not pleasant."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I first became acquainted with some of these characters in \\"The War\\". The series produced by Ken Burns . That is how I heard about E.B. Sledge.This book is the best book I have ever read about the Marines at War. E.B.Sledge was there. There are no Gung-Ho, Hollywood type Marines in this book. This book is about the average American boy who wanted to fight. Sledge tells all about the horrors he went through with his company. Some of Sledge's comrades are encountered in the T.V. series \\" The Pacific \\". This book has served as a reference for the series. If you can't stand reading about what these young men went through from \\"Boot Camp\\" to Okinawa then don't buy the book. This is also a great history book on WW ll."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I have an uncle who survived the Okinawa campaign. Of the 30+ men in his platoon, 10 lived, he alone came thru unscathed. He only talked about his experiences once. That was right after he came back in the 40's. He has related that carrying a flamethrower isn't a fun job, but no details at all about his service. I can understand now why he has been tight-lipped about it. It was a horrific experience.I got the book yesterday in the mail. I couldn't put it down until I finished it last night. The descriptions were excellent. I was there.I have been a student of WWII since elementary school. I was fascinated with the advances of technology that occurred then. This book put a face on war that I don't ever remember seeing in the 35 years that I've studied that time period.

Gung Ho, Sempre Fi"},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This book moved me. Written by an undecorated Marine grunt 35 years after the two miserable WWII island campaigns he took part in--the little known, but fierce battle in Peleliu and the well known, and even fiercer battle in Okinawa.I am fascinated with what our ancestors endured for the sake of this country and our freedom. And I mean the teenage common soldier and sailor in the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, WWI and here, the Pacific theatre of WWII. This is among the best at bringing home the reality of war--the horrors, the drudgery, the camaraderie, the misery, the exhilaration, you name it.What stands out in this account is the author's vivid, detailed memories of numerous, often ghastly, sometimes humorous, incidents that occur on the front lines of every war. And he tells the stories with such modesty, honesty and economy you can't help but be drawn in. It's obvious why these experiences colored the rest of their lives.Thank you Sledgehammer for writing this invaluable first hand history."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I have read a number of books on WWII, both historical and personal, and this is without a doubt my favorite of them all.

But there is no way that televsion and special effects can capture the pure and absolute horror the Marines faced on Pelileu and Okinawa like E.B. Sledge does in this book. The Japanese soldiers were formidable enemies. The Marines, Sailors and Soldiers literally had to fight for every yard on the battlefield. Reading this story made me truly appreciate the high cost the United States military paid for victory in WWII. E.B. Sledge shows just how much the human body can endure when it has no other choice.

I've read quite a few, from multiple POVs and multiple conflicts. Still, Sledge beats them all.I would give a summary of the book but better reviewers have already done that, I'll just mention that the descriptions of life on the frontline, of combat with a fanatical enemy and in two staggeringly gruesome battles of the Pacific War are all top notch. There is one part of the book involving souvenir hunters that is just so disconcerting. The scene was in the mini-series The Pacific and it was not nearly as harrowing.Concerning the audiobook:I usually end up getting used to and enjoying most audiobook narrators and that's what happened with this one. I think the narrator (George Wilson), an older gentleman, is who is the type of narrator usually sought out for these types of books (Beyond Valor, Hell in the Pacific, Cutthroats, Code Talker and Quartered Safe Out Here all feature older narrators, the latter being the best and by the author) but I think these books would benefit from having younger or less-older sounding narrators. This is probably best exemplified by the narrators of Helmet for My Pillow or A Rumor of War or even Beyond Band of Brothers.tl;dr: I'd still give the audiobook version 5 stars."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Unbelievable insight into a challenging time in America's history.

It was quite shocking how little had changed in tactics and conditions. I am sure things in Afghanastan would not have altered that much either. No matter what technology it is the infrantryman who takes the toll.This is described in fantastic detail by Eugene Sledge and I was especially taken with his accounts of how morality disappears once killing starts, and how attrocity begets attrocity.An extremely well written book."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Well written.

Not a historical sweep with a tactician's view of the consequences of campaigns. This a story written by a PFC in the trenches.

As in all good books, you keep turning the pages and when its over you wish there was more. You wonder how his return to civilian life went, but he does not go into detail about that.

Sledge tells us of the real face of war and focuses on some aspects we never think of when reading about battles, such as life in the rain and mud in Okinawa, or the smells and noises of battle, the stripping of enemy dead, and most of all the fear and moral decay of frontline troops.

The other two being William Manchester's Goodbye Darkness, and Robert Leckie's Helmet for my Pillow. War is ugly, messy, misery and a terrible thing, but the courage and sacrifice of the warriors is the beauty of it all. It is utter madness that muddles the mind, yet brings clarity of thought to a razor's edge. It dulls one's sensibilities yet heightens the senses to maximum perception. With the Old Breed is gritty realism, that will assault one's reality with the true nature of combat without philosophical metaphors. It is love, hate, disgust, kindness, sympathy, revulsion, and understanding wrapped in the simple prose of one who has seen the utter madness of combat up close and personal. Mr. Sledge graphically brings the sounds, sights, stink, and corruptions of the battlefield to the written page and slaps the reader in the face with the reality of it all. At times it is revolting but yet it is ALL true. The ambivalence of combat is the true mystery of its schizophrenic nature: To be drawn to it and repulsed at the same time its mystique. To use Mr. Paul Fussell's own words, \\"It is about the mystique of killing to avoid being killed, torturing to avoid being tortured.\\" The front line is both a place of passion and madness. As Mr. Sledge said, \\"[combat] made savages of us all. We existed in an environment totally incomprehensible to men behind the lines...\\" And so it was at Peleliu and Okinawa, where Mr. Sledge, \\"tasted the bitterest essence of war, the sight of helpless comrades being slaughtered, and it filled me with disgust. Furthermore, Mr. Sledge opines, \\"We were surrounded by maggots and decay . Men struggled and fought and bled in an environment so degrading I believed we had been flung into hell's own cesspool.\\"And yet, \\"War is brutish, inglorious, and a terrible waste. Combat leaves an indelible mark on those who are forced to endure it.

Thank you E.B. , our country was blessed to have you and those like you ."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This book is a compelling first hand account, from a U. S. Marine private's view, of the hourly and daily horrors American Marines suffered when in battle in the Pacific during WWII. Frankly, I am surprised anyone could endure the strain, both physical and mental, imposed upon these American soldiers. After reading this relatively short, but detailed book, you will reach several conclusions: first, the Pacific campaigns were absolutely hellish; second, the Japanese WWII soldier was fanatical and bestial--virtually devoid of any humanity; third, after Okinawa, the U.S. was absolutely right in using the atomic bomb to end this war; and fourth, we can never repay the men (primarily U. S. Marines) who made the sacrifices necessary to conquer the evil that was Imperial Japan.The book is centered on two battles, Peleliu and Okinawa: the former fought in 100 degree heat on a coral island lacking any shelter or cover, while the latter was fought in mud on a battlefield reminiscent of trench warfare in WWI Flanders. Both battles were fought against a determined, merciless, and barbaric enemy who fought virtually to the last man and were more than willing to sacrifice their individual lives if they could trade it for the life of but one American. For example, on Peleliu the Japanese committed approximately 11,000 soldiers to the battle and only about 200 surrendered, yet of that number approximately 180 were Japanese sailors, or civilians forced to assist the Japanese. The rest died to a man. The price for their lives and this miserable island was approximately 1800 American dead and another 8000 wounded.The book explains the Japanese strategy of \\"defense in depth\\" adopted after the fruitless banzai charges of Guadalcanal and Saipan. This strategy entailed the construction of mutually supportive tunnels, caves, and other defensive positions that the Japanese defended in a prolonged, organized retreat. Essentially, they knew they could never win these battles, but hoped, through attrition, to convince the Americans that it was too costly in blood and treasure to conquer Japan. E. B. \\"Sledgehammer\\" Sledge lets you experience what fighting against this strategy was like as he watches his friends and comrades die day after day during these long campaigns. He especially relates, in an immediate manner, how taxing the fighting conditions were--intolerable heat, knee-deep mud, the constant stench of decaying bodies and the innumerable flies and maggots attracted to them, the poor food, undrinkable water, malaria, dysentery, constant rain, and filth each marine had to endure in wresting these islands from the Japanese. Yet that is only the beginning, for the true horror was the Japanese themselves. Nightly they sent out raiders to try to infiltrate American lines, willing to die just to kill one American in his foxhole. Every night these marines were shelled, and everyday they were forced to move out against an enemy who would never surrender and wanted only to kill them.You are left with an unshakable belief of this war being worse than hell itself, worse than anything you can imagine. The stories of discovering the mutilated bodies of fellow marines, and the cold-blooded nature of the enemy, explains why this enemy had to be defeated and why these marines had absolutely no pity for them. And once you read the nature of the battle for Okinawa, and learn how the U. S. was forced to sacrifice over 12,000 of its young men to kill 110,000 Japanese who refused to surrender in a battle hopeless for Japan from the start, you should have no reservations about the wisdom of using atomic weapons against Japan. If they were willing to fight like this for an island hundreds of miles from their homeland, you realize they would have fought even harder for their own islands and homes."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I enjoyed reading this book so much I finished it in less then a week. Parts of it are featured on a PBS documentry called \\"The War\\" (Or somthing like that), anyhow, the book gives all the reader could ask for; loss, comraderie, and the absolute brutality of war. It is my favorite first person account I have read so far, although William Foley's \\"Visions From A Foxhole\\" is exceptional as well. If you were ever curious about a Marine's combat life, read this book, and if you have already read this book, go out and thank a veteran, or current soldier for what they have done for you so that you should never have to experience the horrors of war with your own eyes.

When the author describes why no prisoners were taken by either side, you've already read so much that it makes sense."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"It took me over fifteen years to read this book. During my sophomore year in college \\"With the Old Breed\\" was listed as required reading in my modern US history course. As I remember it, the \\"Autobiography of Andrew Carnegie\\" was also required, and when I read that cover-to-cover only to discover that just one question on the mid-term addressed that book, I decided to blow off reading the memoir of WWII Marine private Eugene Sledge. In hindsight, I'm glad I did. The guilt of having not read the book (not to mention my shock and consternation to find many questions about the memoir on the final) kept it on my bookshelf and a volume that I resolved to read eventually.Thus, I had the opportunity to read this unforgettable story in my mid-30s, with all of the \\"wisdom\\" had I gained in the intervening decade-and-a-half, and in the midst of another American war, rather than as a nave 19-year-old in the fat-and-happy post-Cold War years.Simply put, this memoir is mesmerizing. In the introduction to the paperback volume by the incomparable Paul Fussell, Sledge's writing is described as so honest, so unadorned that it allows the reader to peer into the horrors of modern combat like looking through a pane of glass. Fussell is absolutely correct.What makes this memoir so powerful and unique is the mixed perspective that Sledge brings to his experience in Company K, 3rd Battalion, 5th Regiment, 1st Marine Division in the Pacific Theater in 1945. On the one hand, Sledge is undeniably anti-war. The experience of combat described by Sledge is horrifying and an utter waste. Never once does Sledge contend that the Marines are engaged in a necessary and just war against an Imperial Japan that attacked his country and committed unspeakable atrocities against fellow Americans, as well as innumerable others. His commentary is reminiscent of Jonathan Shay's \\"Achilles in Vietnam,\\" a brilliant and original take on the effects of close order combat. Sledge and his fellow Marines in the Pacific could care less about the surrender of Nazi Germany or the death of Franklin Roosevelt in the spring of 1945. All that matters is Company K and what their next assignment will be. The most critical question on their minds is whether or not to drop their gear when given a break on a forced march or keep it on in the event that the break is cut short.On the other hand, for all of the terror and waste of combat, Sledge is clearly a proud Marine, a man who in the twilight of his life still signs his letters \\"Semper Fi.\\" He praises his drill instructor for the hardships he was forced to endure as, he claims, it saved his life when he was confronted with the nightmare of modern war on Pelileu and Okinawa. Sledge's descriptions of his experiences in the Pacific, especially in Okinawa, are unsettling. The putrid smell of rotting flesh, the constant rain, lack of sleep, maggots and flies in the millions, Japanese shelling and nighttime infiltrations, psychiatric breakdowns of fellow Marines, it reads like an additional level of Dante's Inferno.The penultimate paragraph of the memoir sums up the themes best:\\"War is brutish, inglorious, and a terrible waste. Combat leaves an indelible mark on those who are forced to endure it. The only redeeming factors were my comrades' incredible bravery and their devotion to each other. Marine Corps training taught us to kill efficiently and to try to survive. But it also taught us loyalty to each other - and love. That esprit de corps sustained us.\\"God bless the United States Marine Corps."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"After seeing E.B.Sledge on the History Channel's 'Hell in the Pacific', I was taken by his straightforward and honest approach to the extremely unsavory task of war.I was saddened to learn Mr. Sledge passed away in 2001.If you are interested in war history his book is very well written and easy to follow. I read 'Helmet for my Pillow' by Robert Leckie as well.Mr. Leckie's book is also very good but written with a lot of obscure words which made it a little harder to follow. Perhaps just a sign of the times when his book was written as opposed to Mr. Sledge's book which was written in the early 1980's.Mr. Sledge's book, like Mr. Leckie's, does not use foul language, but Mr. Sledge's book spares no graphic detail otherwise. Mr. Leckie's book usually refers to the horror of war but only gives a few graphic examples.Not that gore determines the quality of a book but it is easier to empathize with Mr. Sledge's daily existance.Also, after hearing Mr. Sledge speak and his southern drawl, I could visualize him speaking the words he wrote in his no nonsense approach.'With the Old Breed' is an excellent book and needs to be read by any WWII historian."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Omigosh. As a former Marine, even though I never saw combat, Mr. Sledge made me feel right at home. I was amazed to see the similarities between WWII Marines and my Viet Nam-era peers. It took me back to my time and I know he was telling it like it was.I've read so many books about various wars, including the Pacific Theater in WWII. I've also read several histories of the Marine Corps. This was the first book I've ever read that told it plainly from the grunt's point of view. I couldn't put it down.With the typical book about the War, you see the campaigns, the strategies, the successes and failures; but they're all at the highest level. All those books left me asking questions about the details of how things are accomplished.For example, one can talk all day about the strategy of island hopping, what the strategy of both combatants at Okinawa was, how many troops were involved, etc. But I've always wondered about the many details of making the thing work. How did the ammunition get into the rifleman's hands? How did they get their food? What about personal sanitation when bullets are flying over your head? How and when were units rotated in and out?While the individual grunt doesn't see the intricacies of the entire chain of supply, he is involved in carrying the ammo to his unit. He does care about eating. And he must take care of himself.This book provided a point of view that really helped me to understand these and so many other things that heighten my understanding of what it must have been like to be a ground combat Marine in WWII (or any war, for that matter).I would highly recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This is the best war memoir I have ever read.

Grandson loved it too and son-in-law gets it next. I liked it for all the same reasons others have mentioned: Sledge's clear, direct style (one hesitates even to use the word \\"style,\\" the book flows so organically), his decency and courage, his honesty (he gives his \\"worst of thoughts the worst of words\\"), his abhorrence of the necessity of this or any war.

I was a teenager in 1944 and E.B. Sledge could have been one of the guys I went to school with. None of us who didn't actually go to war, could appreciate the horror the soldiers endured. I'm sorry there was no television then. The nightly news programs on radio were only 15 minutes long, but we all waited to hear the grim news every night. I remember all of the mothers and girlfriends of soldiers were terrified when it was learned that her soldier was being shipped to the CBI (China, Burma, India) or the Pacific.This book is a view of WWII that doesn't spare us the awful details of what actually happened in these battles."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Sledge's well-written memoir deserves it's reputation as one of the best memoirs to come out of the pacific theater of the Second World War. Anyone with the slightest interest in military history should read this one. Sledge pulls no punches regarding the grim reality of his experiences while still avoiding a completely cynical attitude and retains his pride in a job well done."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"E.B. \\"Sledgehammer\\" Sledge has written a classic memoir about his time in the Pacific during the battles of Peleliu and Okinawa. Serving as a mortar man with K company, 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines, 1st Marine Division, Sledge and his fellow Marines faced the horrors of war first-hand.From the terrible invasion of Peleliu, in which Sledge and his comrades faced terrible enemy fire during the invasion, to Okinawa, where the invasion was virtually unopposed, Sledge and his mortar crew did their duty day in and day out. Throughout the book, Sledge describes his personal account of each battle. The Marines were beset with disease, thirst, hunger, and a violent enemy who refused to surrender. It soon became apparent that the only way for Sledge and the Marines to defeat the Japanese was to kill every one of them. Sledge and his mortar crew formed an effective fighting unit. Time and again, they laid down heavy and accurate fire on enemy positions.Aside from describing the horrors of war, including the death of his beloved commander, Capt. Andrew A. Haldane, Sledge also describes his own personal feelings about the war. He's not ashamed to describe how he felt when he received a letter from home telling him that his beloved dog had died, or the feeling of sadness and rage he felt upon finding out about the death of Capt. Haldane. Sledge describes his time in combat on Peleliu and Okinawa in a unique and personal style rarely found in other books.Perhaps what I found most interesting was how Sledge's feelings toward the Japanese grew in intensity and hatred. He describes what he felt like the first time he killed a Japanese soldier and how he felt some remorse afterward. However, as he became more \\"hardened\\", those feelings disappeared, especially after seeing how the Japanese killed so many of his fellow Marines.This book is a fine piece of military history. Revived by his inclusion in HBO's series \\"The Pacific\\", Sledge's testimony will serve as a true statement to what the Marines really faced against the Japanese. Written more like a novel than a work of nonfiction, \\"With the Old Breed\\" is recognized as one of the top books on World War II battles. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Anyone who, like me, watched and enjoyed the Hanks/Speilberg series 'The Pacific\\" should obtain and read this book. Apart from anything, it will show them how closely the series followed the truth of this personal history by one of the principle characters, Private Sledge.It is quite shocking and although I have had a lifelong interest in military history, I have never before taken such an interest in the Pacific campaign. It must surely rate as the most brutal, bestial, and shocking conflict in human history.It was absolutely 'medieval' in its brutality, conducted with modern weaponary.The simple and understated report of events experienced by the author make it all the more shocking. Little wonder the number of (Battle Fatigue) PTSD cases on Okinawa was over 20,000!You won't regret buying this book"},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I began reading Eugene Sledge's personal memoir after I received it as a birthday gift from a friend. I am a big World War II buff, and am proud to have knowledge of all the major actions and events that took place. As a result, I went into With the Old Breed thinking that I knew it all. Boy was I wrong. Yes, Sledge depicts two of the bloodiest battles in the Pacific Theatre, Peleliu and Okinawa, but he goes far beyond that. From describing the constant fear of being killed at night by Japanese infiltrators, to grimacing in fear under enemy artillery fire, and to bear the sight of dead Marines, Sledge truly reveals the horrors of combat. One of the main accomplishments in his writing is proving that combat is much more than a simple John Wayne movie. It is a test of will that can push any man to the limit, no matter how strong he may be. Sledge's story is also one of friendship and camaraderie, forming strong ties with his fellow marines who will risk anything to save their buddies. This is also a story of hate however, and Sledge does an excellent job pointing out the fact that the Marines were not the sophisticated soldiers of western society, but often times sink down to the level of their own adversaries. Sledge's war was one where anyone was a target on the battlefield, even stretcher bearers and medics. The Japanese were a ruthless enemy, and Sledge time and time points out that the only way to defeat them is to \\"root 'em out one by one.\\" The most remarkable part of the memoir is Sledge's transformation from a scared recruit wading ashore on Peleliu to a combat veteran who came to the realization that war is not pretty, and that he has to do unspeakable things in order to survive. Read this book as a testament to all Americans who died fighting in the deadliest conflict in human history."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"After watching The Pacific on HBO I had to buy Sledge's and Leckie's books together. They were so very different but equally brilliant. The Pacific could never do justice to what these men went through. This is an credible read and maybe more incredible is that Sledgehammer wrote this book so many many years after the fact. Amazing. hat is equally fascinating, to me at least, is that I went back and read EVERY review that was written before 9/11. The reviews were totally glowing with so many WWII buffs stating that this is the greatest book they had ever read about the war etc, etc. I saw at least one \\"lest we not forget\\" reference which was so popular after 9/11. Amazing stuff."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This is a extraordinary story of how normal guys become Marines and defeat the well prepared and well trained Japanese.

What a price these Marines paid for our freedom; therefore every American should read this book and hope we would answer the call as Sledge and his fellow Marines did."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"How do you explain the unexplainable? In \\"With The Old Breed\\" Eugene Sledge goes well beyond any expectation a reader might have about not just the experience of combat but its effects on the men who were duty bound to participate. Having known several WW II combat veterans, I now understand the origin of the common quality they all possessed; one I never could identify but that markedly set them apart: uncommon courage. Each horrific experience Mr. Sledge recalls caused me to ask myself, \\"How did he do that?\\" and to say, sometimes aloud, \\"I couldn't have done that.\\" Ultimately I regretted that Mr. Sledge and his comrades-in-arms faced such horrors; it was senseless, but I am ever so thankful to him and all the others who were willing to do it. The other regret the book caused me was that I had not ever taken the time to thank the men I knew who had faced these dangers and made these sacrifices.

This book is by far the best first-person account of battle I have ever read. It recounts, with vivid horror, the experience of being shelled day and night for months; the animal sounds of two men fighting to the death in a foxhole; the misery of sleeping in the mud and rain for two months; US Marines using their KBar knives to knock gold teeth out of the mouths of still-living Japanese soldiers; the hundreds of dead bodies, all infested with maggots, rotting all around you for weeks and nothing to be done about it as the action was continuous; the Marines turning into animals, rather than men, in their treatment of the wounded and dead Japanese.You will most likely not read a more horrifing and vivid account of battle.And in the end, \\"Sledgehammer\\" keeps saying how it is all such a waste of life, and for what?

Ken Burns leans heavily on Eugene Sledge's account of war, and that tells me that Burns at least knows genius writing when he reads it.Sledge may be the best writer from the 20th century that most people have never heard of. His language is harrowing and detailed and does not spare any details about the chaos and misery and ineffable singular experience that is war. I truly believe that he lived through Peleliu and Okinawa, so he could compile his writings and share them with the world.

The weather and terrain alone would have been an extreme hardship, but the combat was so brutal and unrelenting that it's a miracle that anyone survived. The Japanese would not surrender - they had to be killed to the last man, and this took an enormmous toll in casualties by the Marines and Army forces. Mr. Sledge does a great job of describing in detail what it was like to be there.The photographs are printed on plain paper, and the maps could have been a little better, but those are very minor complaints.If you have any interest in WWII combat in the Pacific, this book should be on your reading list."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I can't add much to what has already been written except to agree that this is an incredible book. I've read it seven or eight times, and each time I'm impressed at how good it is (my wife read it and was equally impressed). If I could only have one book in my library about the personal experience of combat, this one would be it.I first read With the Old Breed in the early 1990s and was so taken with it I knew I had to speak to the author and tell him how much I enjoyed it. I tracked Dr. Sledge to his home in Alabama and gave him a call. We had a great conversation, with him filling me in on many details not in the book. I sent him a copy of the book to autograph, and when I got it back, I found that he had not only written a nice inscription, which I will always treasure, but had also annotated many of the photographs with his comments. I was deeply saddened to read of his death in 2001. He was an incredible man."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"With the Old Breed started out as a chance for a grandfather to share with his children and grandchildren the experiences that he had during World War II in the Pacific theater. It ended up being one of the most gruesome, but also most realistic, documents on the war ever written. The detail captured in With the Old Breed by Eugene B. Sledge, is unmatched by any other author, and he should be commended on such a truthful accounting of his fighting as a United States Marine.He starts With the Old Breed at basic training where he enlists and then flunks out of officer school to get to the front lines quicker. In hindsight, one might think it was a bad decision, but the way officers where being picked off in the Pacific by Japanese gunmen, it might have been the better decision. Located in San Diego, his training allowed him to be taught by some of the best instructors in the United States, getting him ready for what lay ahead.His first stay in the Pacific was at Pavuvu, where he received more training specific to the Japanese, and was finally sent to Peleliu. Thinking it was going to be a fast battle like that of Tarawa, Sledge was quickly introduced to the horrors of island fighting that would characterize the War in the Pacific from then on. A month later, Sledge was a battle hardened veteran, surviving the front lines, reserves, etc. without an injury.It was then back to Pavuvu for some more training, work detail, and the much needed break from the front line. His next stop would be Okinawa, still considered the largest amphibious assault of World War II and the largest land, air, and sea battle in history. Sledge was one of the many troops circling the waters in an amtrac prior to the assault, and spent 3 months on the island fighting, delivering ammunition, and on work detail through the horrid rain and stench of dead bodies.Finally, with the dropping of the atomic bombs and the surrender of the Japanese on August 15, 1945, Sledge's journey through the horrors of the Pacific had finally come to an end.Sledge's account of the war is unlike anything I have ever read. He makes light of the stupidity, horror, stench, atrocities, jokes, hatred, and everything else in between. But he writes in a manner that is simple and easy to understand, without flowery language to smooth out the rough edges of war. And even though he experiences many atrocities at the hands of the Japanese and many stupidities at the hands of his US officers, Sledge still writes with an open mind, never pinning problems on one person or lumping together a group of people through his experiences only. He writes specifically stating throughout With the Old Breed that these are his experiences only and that they might not reign true for the rest of the soldiers. I respect that aspect of his document more than any other. Not really a problem but something to note when you begin reading this document: it was hard keeping track of where Sledge was positioned while on each island, but the maps of each area helped tremendously as references. I do have to warn readers that the book can get gruesome at points, but such is war and the truthful accounting of it.Some of the stories I enjoyed reading about include the basic training lesson about guns, the Marine who tried to crap at night, and the guy stuck between a rock and a hard place with his wife and Betty. I was horrified by the stories of the scavengers, especially the one trying to get a gold tooth with his kabar, the soldier who assisted a Japanese woman with her pain, the time when Sledge nearly had to dig a hole in a spot with a few too many maggots, and the slide down a wet and muddy hill that left many Marines vomiting.As I write this review, I can still feel the stress, smell the stench and imagine the utter horror of being on the front lines while the Japanese are bunkered up in the mountains and hills. Yet my imagination cannot even fathom half of what the Marines and other military personnel went through in the Pacific. I can only read about it. So I would like to thank those who went through this experience for me and the rest of the United States, because who knows what our future would have been like without you.To anyone considering reading this document (I call it that because of its validity to the War in the Pacific), do not hesitate to buy it and find it as part of your top shelf of books to read again. Everyone enjoy!"},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This is one of the finest narratives of modern combat ever written. The author was a young southerner who enlisted in the Marine Corps in the months following Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. Sledge was sent to the South Pacific, where the United States was taking back a seemingly endless chain of tiny coral atolls. The implacable enemy - who almost never surrendered - was dug in deep and had to be rooted out through air, naval and artillery bombardment, small-arms fire and even hand-to-hand combat. The islands were hot and humid and the conditions the marines lived under unfathomable. Through courage, grit and dogged determination, the marines prevailed, but none of them were left unscathed. Sledge, who went on to the quiet life of a biology professor, writes of the Pacific War from the point of view of the infantryman, eye-deep in the blood, muck, mire, courage and comradeship of combat."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"&quot;With the Old Breed&quot; chronicles Dr. Sledge's life as a Marine in the Pacific Theater of World War II. The book is divided into two sections describing the campaigns that Sledge took part in: Peleliu and Okinawa.Sledge's writing style is straightforward and his descriptions are vivid. The thing that impressed me most was his ability to convey the mindset of himself and his fellow soldiers throughout the war. The progression of fear, horror, confusion, disgust, and resolve are all described in a way that you will understand exactly what he felt.Sledge gives just enough coverage of the high-level progression of the campaigns to give the reader context for the story he is telling. At first I wished for a more complete description, but I came to realize that this information was rarely available to the soldiers at the time. To include it would detract from his objective: to show what war is to a front-line soldier. \\"With the Old Breed\\" accomplishes that objective better than anything else that I have read.As an aside: I would recommend skipping the Introduction.

With The Old Breed was different, a first hand account of the guys in the mud, stench of dead bodies, barbarism of the enemy, harrible casualty rates,etc.. Could not put it down."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Eugene Sledge makes the brutal war in the Pacific come alive in the pages of his story as an enlisted Marine facing life and death in the Pacific. Many of today's Americans seem to have forgotten what real war is about. This book will reveal war in all its ugly details. Believe me, after reading this book, you will have an even greater respect for \\"America's Greatest Generation\\" as exemplified by Eugene Sledge and his fellow Marines. This is a poignant account of the hell and brutally that the US Marines faced in the Pacific."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"If you have ever wondered what it was like during battle on a Pacific Island in the Second World War, read this book. Eugene Sledge is direct to the point with a no holds barred first hand account.This book should be required reading for every politician."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Unquestionably the best account of any of the island battles in the Pacific against the Japanese in WWII. Sledge takes you to the foxholes and tells you how it was, blood and glory, maggots and filth, rotting bodies and mud, endless machine gunnings and bombardments, unbearable heat and numbing cold. It's all there, and you'll wonder how anyone could keep their sanity through it all, much less write a book about it. Outstanding."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Volumes upon volumes have been written about the European theatre of operations during WW II, but it is difficult to find good books about the Pacific. That's a real shame considering the hardships and horrors endured by the men who served in that theatre. With the Old Breed was recommended to me by a college student who read it as part of a history class assignment. I don't know how this book managed to hide under my radar for so long, because it is absolutely outstanding. Too often, books written about a person's combat experiences are poorly written, but this plain-spoken book neither tries to be something it isn't nor falls short of good writing standards.I think what makes this one of the most unique personal accounts of war that I've ever read is Sledge's approach to telling his story. Nothing fancy, no poetic prose, and he doesn't engage in self-aggrandizement or philosophizing. It's just one veteran's very candid account of his experience during training and then later as a grunt in the Pacific theatre. Sledge tells it like he saw it, with no sugar-coating. His only real motive for telling his story in the first place seems to be that he had a story to tell and he felt like it was important enough to pass on to later generations. The reader will detect no attempt on Sledge's part to seek praise or admiration, despite the fact that he himself obviously suffered significantly and witnessed countless others who suffered far worse still. What the reader will get is an absolutely unimpeachable, through, and detailed account of what happened on Peleliu and Okinawa. No matter how much you know about World War II, this book will still take you on a breathtaking journey. Anyone who reads this book will have a new appreciation for what soldiers went through while fighting the Japanese during WW II. It is an essential part of any WW II buff's book collection."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Devasting account of the Pacific campaign as fought by the U.S. Marines in WWII. I say forgotten because I, like many Americans, have always seemed to focus on the European campaigns, probably because so many Americans are of European ancestry. Once I started reading about the Pacific War, I came to realize that it was,if anything, more brutal than the European War. Eugene \\"Sledgehammer\\" Sledge recounts his days in the 1st Marine Divsion (The Old Breed) fighting (and remarkably coming out unscathed) at Peleliu and Okinawa. Personally, I had never heard of Peleliu, but after reading this book, I believe it was one of the toughest and most brutal campaigns of the Pacific War. Fighting on a coral island (which made digging foxholes impossible) near the equator (110 in the shade)against an enemy that knows only kill or be killed. And the water brought to the island had been contaminated by motor oil, making many Marines sick if they drank it. Mr Sledge tells his story in a matter of fact narrative that truly makes you realize the horror of these battles faced by American boys. Truly these men were our GREATEST GENERATION."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"With the Old Breed, by E.B. Sledge is the best personal account of combat that I have ever read. It is brutally honest, as Sledge does not gloss over the horrific nightmare that is war.After reading Slede's book, it is no small wonder that 26,000 Americans lost their sanity in the Okinawa battle alone. He spares us none of the gory details, yet he delivers this true account in an eloquent style that gives the story even more impact. Sledge does not only desribe the fight against the Japanese,but also the mental battle raging within men on the front line, as he himself fights to remain sane amid the filth, fear and misery that were the battles of Peleliu and Okinawa.It is at times moving, and at other times stomach turning. At all times though it is extremely riveting, and I found that this book was very hard to put down. One can also not put down this book without a profound appreciation for the young men who went through the worst kind of hell for their country."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"&quot;With the Old Breed&quot; works on two very different levels. One is an outstanding first-hand account of the campaigns for Peleliu and Okinawa from the perspective of the United States Marines. The second, which is what makes this book so special, is the tale of the of fear and abject horror that those young Marines had to deal with.&quot;With the Old Breed&quot; isn't just about two military campaigns in the Pacific, it's about the emotional &quot;campaign&quot; that each soldier had to fight just to keep going. With an unflinching pen, Sledge takes the reader on a descent into the maelstrom of lead and blood that was these campaigns. The reader feels the terror, the cold and heat, the filth, the sorrow...and is also offered a glimpse of the extraordinary courage those young men showed.&quot;With the Old Breed&quot; is a superb, moving account of men in combat. It is a must read for anyone who knows the operational history, but not the personal history, of WWII."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"A must read for WWII history buffs and those that want to know what it was really like to be in the front lines in the South Pacific. The fact that he is not a professional author makes the story more genuine and endearing.

Its so well written you almost feel like your there. Read this book, you wont be sorry."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I read this book originally because a deceased, beloved, former summer neighbor of mine fought with the 81st Infantry on Peleliu and I was interested in knowing more about that battle. What I discovered was a book that described more perfectly and powerfully the horror of war in all its most \\"awe-full\\" reality. Sledge makes the reader relive that horror along with him as he describes the conditions and minute by minute circumstances he and his brethren endured, as well as the intractable resistance of the Japanese. Iwo Jima as pictured in \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\", and Afghanistan as described by Marcus Luttrell in \\"Lone Survivor\\" are powerful and important contributions that every American should read to understand the lengths to which our finest young citizens will go to preserve our way of life. But \\"With the Old Breed\\" is equally a must read...and should be required reading in every school in this country. It gives genuine meaning to the expression we so casually repeat that \\"war is hell\\". It is, as Sledge describes it."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"A remarkable book; the author's first-hand account of the battles of Peleiu and Okinawa.

Probably the best of the books on the war in the Pacific Theatre"},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Very good retelling of an infantry mans life in the Pacific. Not myopic in the least as many other memoirs are. Worth every penny and you will read it more than once."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This book is not character driven, like say Band of Brothers. Published in 1981 or so, this is the most brutal description of war I have ever come across. This is a recollection of battles that were fought under conditions that the human mind can not even conceive. One excerpt talks about the rain on Okinowa and how the Japenese bodies were just bulldozed under dirt and mud and one solider slid down into the pit where the bodies had been buried for a few days and was among the bodies and he emerged covered in swollen maggots. A scene out of a horror movie. The book is an unbelievable description of war, no friendlies here, at least in the European theater every once in awhile you came across a friendly village in France or Italy. The two main battles described were Pelieu and Okinowa. If you get a chance check out the mini series the Pacific. The mini series can't do justice to the book but does a good job."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I never served in the military but I had the privilege of visiting Peleliu twice during the late '60s while living on Guam Island. While viewing what in the '60s had reverted to jungle-covered mountains--except for the remaining 'live ammo' signs in the jungle, pristine beaches and exploring old Japanese caves still holding evidence of the war, I tried to imagine what the war must have been like in the mid '40s. Nothing I ever imagined came close to what E.B. Sledge records in \\"With the Old Breed at Peleliu and Okinawa.\\"He writes with skill and objectively records what it was like to live on the front lines day after day as an infantryman in unbelievable conditions.

I deeply respect the fact that no one who hasn't experienced combat can really understand what it's like. If you're a veteran, my comments don't apply. But for a civilian like me, this book comes the closest to giving an idea of how awful it was. Just to think about what these men did, and what they endured to get it done, runs a shiver up my spine. An incredible story."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This book deserves that sixth star. It should share the spotlight with the likes of Iron Coffin. E.B.

The conditions that these guys lived and fought under were appalling,I always felt that the bulge fighting was tough, but the island fighting seemed like endless misery both from the elements and the fighting.I think comparisons with the Band of Brothers are not fair in the sense that BoB was a combined story of an entire company, a lot of personalities,events and the like making it a richer narrative,Sledges book is the perspective of one mans experience and observations and is more gritty as a result.This book gets five stars in my opinion."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I read several book about \\"the war\\"; this gave me a different feeling.

At the same time.Eugene Sledge classic is written in simple unassuming language.The stories are tangible, real, and honest. The un-interfering and corroborating footnotes make the book also reliable as a reference.The reader must be aware of the back-to-back brutalities, told with simple, unsophisticated, direct language.

In telling the history of the Peleliu and Okinawa campaigns of WWII from the grunt's perspective, E. B. Sledge recounts how the brutality of war erodes the moral standards of both friends and enemies. He does not preach; he simply observes with regret.His book is particularly timely with the US having a large number of battle weary troops returning home from war. The adjustment back to civilian life takes time and understanding. The service member who comes home is not the same person who shipped out a year or two earlier."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Very good read.

I liked the book."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This book lives up to all the praise it has received from reviewers such as Paul Fussell.

A Marine whose brother died there, first told me about the battle and loaned a copy of this book. I found E. B.

Semper Fi Sledgehammer."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"In this moving personal account of his experiences as a Marine in WWII E.B. Sledge shows war as the horrifying, bloody, often pointless, mayhem that it really is. Young men and women enamored of glory and bravery should be required to read this book. By describing his experiences clearly, candidly and graphically, he shows the reality of war.

Very thought envoking and allows your imagination to actually bring the scenes to dreadful life. However hard to believe there were no cussing Marines! Considering I only know a couple who don't during peacetime.Not sure I would agree with the opinion of one reviewer that the author must still be living the war due to the graphic nature of the telling. I believe this is more of a reflection on the quality of the Marine training of the time. Clear and concise was the emphasis and the book clearly reflects as such."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"E.B. Sledge's With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa is, simply put, one of the best war memoirs ever written. Sledge paints a compelling and often horrifying picture of what it was like to be a young Marine fighting in the Pacific theater of World War II. From his first day at Marine boot camp, to the last hours of the epic battle for Okinawa, Sledge eloquently expresses what it was like to be a young man thrust into the brutality of the most destructive war in human history. With the Old Breed is nothing less than a classic of war literature"},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"My generation was late even for the Vietnam war. So when we want to understnd war, we ar indebted to authors such as E.B. Sledge, who describe in vivid detail what it was like to live through the &quot;meat grinder&quot; of battle. It is too much to say I envy the soldiers who fought in the battles of Peleliu and Okinawa, described in this book. The author's descrition is too true-to-life to admit such a comment. But it is not too much to say that one comes to admire the sacrifice and courage of men who fought these battles. Mr. Sledge's book is a great gift to those who never have had to put their lives on the line for thier country -- it informs and humbles us. I expect this book is also a great gift to those who have endured the crucible of battle -- it articulates their common experience."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I finally got around to reading this wonderful book. Like many others, I was lead to it by Paul Fussell's \\"Wartime.\\"I have gained a new appreciation for the history of the Pacific campaign and will undoubtedly read more.Sledge's account is a little tedious at times as he makes an effort to nail down historical details of troop deployments, which are important but not particularly interesting to the average reader, but it hardly detracts from the impact of the book.If an expanded edition of this book were published with better maps and perhaps an expanded introduction by an historian I would surely buy it. Fussell's introduction explains a little bit about how Sledge actually managed to keep notes in combat, which I found interesting and would like to know more about."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I ordered a set of six WWII books from Easton Press. Among them was this one, \\"With the Old Breed.\\"The other five books were good. This book was incredible.No adjectives are really worthy of what this book describes.Having no picture of the author this book made me form a mental picture of the Hammer. A heroic marine faced with indescribable horrors. I pictured a young, robust he-man type.I turned the last page of this stunning account and there before my eyes was Sledge. A boy who looked as if he just walked out of a high school yearbook.A boy.Really made me think of who really fought this war. Young men...... Boys.I recommend this book to anyone who can read. Riveting from beginning to end.Wow!"},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This is perhaps my favorite first person narrative of a soldier in combat. I think that I've now read this book at least four times and gave my beloved copy to my son before his combat deployment to Iraq. Dr. Sledge captures and narrates the stress of combat along with the inner struggles to maintain a level of personal dignity under conditions which go beyond the level of human endurance."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I recently finished The War, a Ken Burn's documentary series on World War 2, which was excellent, and my ears pricked up when he mentioned a book by an enlisted Marine, E. B. Sledge, this is my response to that book, With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa. In fact, the library offered me a 2007 reprint with the endorsement of Ken Burns. The documentary mentioned that Sledge suffered from PTSD for most of his life after the war, though his book barely mentions his post-war life, excepting a few mentions of nightmares. His book, although highly valuing the esprit de corps of the Marines and the love for his fellow soldiers, wants us to know the depravity of humanity which he witnessed in the Pacific theater in two significant battles in which no quarter was offered by the Japanese and was barely offered by the US, since most Japanese offering to surrender used it as a ruse for suicide missions. Sledge is honest about his hatred for his enemies even though he seems to be a man of faith, and this intrigued me.After his thorough training as a Marine, in contrast to those later recruits toward the end of the war, he and his squad were settling in for their last night on a rear base before heading out for the invasion of Peleliu. He writes,\\"It was hard to sleep that night. I though of home, my parents, my friends - and whether I would do my duty, be wounded and disabled, or be killed. I concluded that it was impossible for me to be killed, because God loved me. Then I told myself that God loved us all and that many would die or be ruined physically or mentally or both by the next morning and in the days following. My heart pounded, and I broke out in a cold sweat. Finally, I called myself a damned coward and eventually fell asleep saying the Lord's Prayer to myself.\\" p. 50Unlike Louis Zamperini of Unbroken, see my earlier book response. Sledge enters the war with faith and finds it challenged. Throughout his most stressful periods in the two great battles of Peleliu and Okinawa he mentions holding onto his courage and sanity by praying the Lord's Prayer or reciting Psalm 23. He seems to have retained his faith, as \\"damned\\" is the dirtiest word used in the book. Even when referencing SNAFU, he defines the acronym as Situation Normal, All Fouled Up. Sledge does not need to enhance the shock and horror of war by quoting the paint blistering expletive tirades of fellow soldiers, in fact, they would distract from the terror that Sledge presents in an almost technical and analytic way.Like Zamperini, who saw angels in the sky and heard a voice from heaven, as he drifted around in the Pacific Ocean, Sledge also heard from God, directly and audibly. After confessing his terror, and the shame of it, to an officer during the Pelelieu campaign, he was reassured.Fear dwelled in everyone, Hillbilly said. Courage meant overcoming fear and doing one's duty in the presence of danger, not being unafraid....Suddenly, I heard a loud voice say clearly and distinctly, \\"You will survive the war!\\"I looked first at Hillbilly and then and then at the sergeant. Each returned my glance with a quizzical expression on his face in the gathering darkness. Obviously they hadn't said anything.\\"Did y'all hear that?\\" I asked.\\"Hear what?\\" they both inquired. p. 91I think it is brave of this modern writer to casually mention his supernatural encounter with God. This heavenly promise did not give him anything extra in the midst of his campaigns, but let us know that his survival, his evasion of the law of averages, was more than skill or luck, it was divine. He never mentions this encounter again, but notes repeatedly the diminishing odds of not getting hurt as he spends more time on the front line.His faith did not prevent him from becoming the killing machine that his training had prepared him for, physically, but not spiritually. He describes his internal turmoil after killing a Japanese soldier in close range who almost released his grenade at him and his friends before shooting him.\\"The soldier collapsed in the fusilade, and the grenade went off at his feet.Even in the midst of these fast-moving events, I looked down at my carbine with sober reflection. I had just killed a man at close range. That I had seen clearly the pain on his face when my bullets hit him came as a jolt. It suddenly made the war a very personal affair. The expression on that man's face filled me with shame and then disgust for the war and all the misery it was causing.\\" p.117He will not celebrate war, because there is nothing to celebrate. That does not mean he believes the war wrong, but there was nothing good about it either.\\"I had long become used to the sight of blood, but the idea of sitting in that bloodstained bun pit was a bit too much for me. It seemed almost like leaving our dead unburied to sit on the blood of a fellow Marine spilled out on the coral...As I looked at the stains on the coral, I recalled some of the eloquent phrases of politicians and newsmen about how \\"gallant\\" it is for a man to \\"shed his blood for his country,\\" and \\"to give his life's blood as a sacrifice,\\" and so on. The words seemed so ridiculous. Only the flies benefited.\\" p. 146War was brought to the United States by the Japanese and the US responded. What the Japanese lacked in materiel and soldiers it made up for in tenacity and ferocity. Their culture did not tolerate those who surrendered, all were expected to fight to their deaths, and the battles only ended when all the Japanese were dead, which is why the US expected a million casualties if they invaded the main Japanese island and chose the atom bomb instead. Certainly US soldiers who fought on Okinawa welcomed the news of the big bombs being used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.Sledge was horrified as the sight of Marine dead who had been desecrated by the Japanese. More than once they found soldiers who had their sexual members cut off and stuffed in their mouths. Of course, he wasn't the only one traumatized. While he channeled his rage into hatred of his enemy and loss of any compassion, others went to further extremes. Speaking of his senior officer in Okinawa,\\"Mac was a decent, clean-cut man but of those who apparently felt no restraints under the brutalizing influence of war - although he had hardly been in combat at that time. He had one ghoulish, obscene tendency that revolted even the most hardened and callous men I knew...If he could, that \\"gentleman by the act of Congress\\" would locate a Japanese corpse, stand over it, and urinate in its mouth. It was the most repulsive thing I ever saw an American do in the war. I was ashamed that he was a Marine officer.\\" pp. 198-199How little things have changed in light of recent video from Afghanistan of AMerican soldiers doing similar things to dead Taliban.Sledge wants to disabuse us from any romance about war. He speaks of the flies that grew so fat on the corpses around them that they couldn't fly. He speaks of the smell of rotting human flesh that filled his nostrils for weeks at a time during stalemates on Okinawa. Although he notes the many acts of courage by his friends he also doesn't want us to remain ignorant of their tragic deaths minutes or days later. Their great deeds did not provide them divine insurance. Their aspirations did not either. As Sledge realized early on, God loves us all and the meat grinder of war gets everyone. In light of what Sledge experienced before and after the war, I wonder if he considers the KIA's the lucky ones."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I was a little skeptical of the praise this work received, especially since it was written so many years after the author's experiences. But now I will sing the same praises. This book reveals just why such experiences were so vivid in the author's mind when he wrote it. Sledge's accounts are real and engaging; I had great difficulty putting the book down when other priorities called. I also appreciate Sledge's use of notes throughout the book to further explain items without losing the flow of the actual text."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"An honest and very well written memoir from an enlisted marine who fought on the first lines in the WWII Pacific island battles of Peleliu and Okinawa.John Master's memoir, \\"The Road Past Mandalay\\" covers the Burma war against the Japanese from the British side (and is a great book), but Sledge's \\"With The Old Breed\\" is better, since he was at much greater personal risk and describes the psychological effects of this long exposure. It's the best personal military account that I've read."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This book is about the WWII. We were watching a program on TV & this book was named so I looked up on Amazon.com to see if we could buy it was it was published about 50 years ago. It is a Christmas present for my husband and I can see him not putting it down until finished. My husband is looking forward to reading it. Thank you Amazon.com for having this book in stock."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This is an epic memoir about the author's time with the 1st Marine Div (K Co, 3rd Bn, 5th Marine Regt) on Peleliu and Okinawa. In a word, it is outstanding! It is a true war memoir in that it is virtually entirely about the authors combat experiences. The first 40 pages or so recount his basic background and then his training. The next 100 pages are entirely about the combat on Peleliu. The next half of the book is almost entirely about Okinawa. There is combat on virtually every page but it is never overblown. There is a great deal about the front line conditions, digging foxholes, being thirsty, being miserable, about living beside the dead.Most of the text though recounts the authors involvment in combat. At times there is a breathtaking story on every page. Some of these I'd read them before - they were so momentous they'd been selected in others peoples books as quotes. Many of these are not for the faint hearted. Sledge spares no one in terms of the awfulness of many of the events. His view that the war was an awful waste is very strong and he has chosen to detail things like they were to prove his point. He is also concious though that regardless of this the war had to be fought. He is exceedingly proud to have been a member of the 1st Marine Division. He also had a great hatred of the Japanese, given what he'd learned of them in combat. He comes to the conclusion that \\"To defeat an enemy as tough and dedicated as the Japanese, we had to be just as tough. We had to be just as dedicated to America as they were to their emperor.\\" (Pg 156) A very profound observation for a 20 year old to make.Above all, one is left with his deep sadness about buddys lost. His unit landed at Okinawa with 235 men, received 250 replacements and departed only 50 strong. The fighting before Shuri is ferocious and it sickens him. We read of Japanese infiltration at night, mutilated bodies and mistakes by fellow Marines that cause 'own' deaths. The idea of a terrible waste is revisited again and again. As is the authors disgust and fury towards the Japanese in the way they fought the war.This book has been described as a classic and I agree. Another reviewer compared \\"With the Old Breed' to Sajer's 'Forgotten Soldier'. Given the scope of Sledge's writings and the revelation of his deepest thoughts, I'm inclined to support that. This book is one of the top three memoirs of war that I have ever read. Very Highly Recommended!"},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Wow. If you want to read a book from the soldier's point of view: this is the book. Loved it."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Without a doubt, this is the most engaging war memoir that I have ever read.Sledge has no literary pretension nor ambition of any kind, so what he creates is something akin to Remarque's inimitable All Quiet on the Western Front.With the Old Breed reads like a novel because of the brutal honesty with which the narrator, Sledge himself, relates his experiences from a profound Humanism--a genuine, and not inchoate, Humanism. This is direct story-telling: in first person and terrifyingly candid, untarnished, nor emended by the passing of time. (The book was first published in 1981.)A young man, who climbs out of \\"the Abyss\\", to use Sledge's description of the Peleiu and Okinawa campaigns, survives with his humanism intact if not generated to greater empathy.Read this."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Sledge's account of his time as a young soldier fighting in the Pacific is heartbreaking and harrowing.

I respect his judgement in things like this, so I read it, and as usual, the kid was right on. This is, frankly, the best memoir of war I have ever read, and I have read every one I can find.I'm going to keep this short. I'm a veteran of two wars, 35 years apart, and never went through anything even remotely like what Sledge describes. His descriptions of his experiences lets me know in no uncertain terms what his generation went through, and the crap us baby boomers suffered in our wars (bad as it was) ain't ca ca compared to it.One example: On Okinawa, in their foxholes, they had no place to put their feces, so they just tossed their waste out of the foxhole. Mounds of human waste combined with rotting corpses must have made for a smell the likes of which few humans have ever experienced.They didn't sleep, too much noise and stress, with the constant threat of Japanese infiltrators at night keeping them on edge.As I read this, the inhuman, unbearable conditions our Marines lived through (and died under) came home to me in a stark manner, once and for all, raising the hair on the back of my head, in a way no other account of war had ever done. That is the power of Gene Sledge's work. Simple, stark, and hitting to your very core. His description of the utter sorrow and dejection the loss of the beloved \\"Ack Ack\\", their Company Commander, had on his unit brought tears to my eyes.Read this superb work. You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"\\"With The Old Breed\\" has been cited as a top 10 historical rendering by several historians. HBO did the \\"Pacific\\" based (in part) on this story of EB Sledge. Victor Davis Hanson writes a compelling intro in this edition. I simply never got around to reading the book until now. The book is far more than can be rendered on TV. This is one of those rare 'all-nighter' or 'no more than 2 day can't stop reading' books for the historical reader.Sledge's work is a fascinating 'at the shield-wall' view of the horror of war and it's rendered from the gut of mankind's most ancient roots in war, and to evolve with \`modern' WW2 weapons. The transition from civilized man into primeval warrior is superbly rendered by Sledge. How does it happen? What is it like? How does it affect the humanity of the survivor? Was it worth it? Sledge slides deeply into his psyche to understand a mystery in it all.There are so many stunning stories here that the historical reader will be overwhelmed. There are many quotes that come from this work. I found one notion that I'd not seen regarding Sledge's questions in regard to why the Japanese just kept on killing when all hope of victory was long gone. Why would the last man standing continue to kill people when all hope was lost? The European war was not of this nature. There are few examples in modern warfare, excepting ensured death for surrender, to explain it. Try as the individual Marines might to avoid slaughter, the Japanese warrior required and demanded extermination to stop killing people. This strangeness is as incomprehensible to Sledge as it remains to me.For those that might honestly desire to search for the meaning of the A-bomb to bring this war to end, this is a mandatory read. There aren't any other histories that I've read that are remotely like its narrow and stunning perspective. Sledge's questions will haunt your thoughts for sometime."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Never spent much time reading books, but this was a exception.

After the war, and many tortured years of nightmares and struggle to return to a normal life, he became a professor of science.

The fact that he and other Marines endured not only the combat but the extreme conditions without completely losing their minds is amazing. His writing style is clear and concise and he describes day to day issues (like how they relieved themselves, living with rotting corpses) not covered in other memoirs. I would recommend this book over Helmet for my Pillow. Helmet is also well written, but spends much more time describing their time on leave in Australia and what they go up to, rather than their time in combat and the conditions.Teenagers today should have to read this book to understand what men and women in their teens and early twenties endured and sacrificed for their Country during WWII. Most people will never know the brutality of a war like the Pacific, which (like Europe) was essentially fought by regular people from all walks of life."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This is an amazing memoir. It is honest, heartfelt, and at times gut wrenching in its portrayal of war in the Pacific. Sledge is a gifted writer.

It is incredibly gory in its detail, but so is warfare."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This is a brutal, horrific first hand account of combat on Peleliu and Okinawa from the experience of a front line Marine. Better than Tregaskis in my opinion. Read this book if you want an insight into the motives of modern man in front line combat and what inspires such bravery and fortitude as the troops engaged in combat in the Sth Pacific in WW2.Very difficult to put down I imagine this would be a valuable companion for a historian's tour of the two Islands concerned.I dare say this would be worthy of a read for someone contemplating joining a combat unit, even in today's world."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Simple outstanding E.

Reading his words will bring you to the brink and have you hooked.My father was a Marine who caught the tail end of WW2 and fought in Korea. Just this last year has he been able to talk about it.

Sledge's first-hand experience and understanding of youth lost and manhood discovered during war is truly terrifying. He illustrates the gloomy environment of death; the ear-pounding and eerie sounds of suffering and dying men, the foul stench of death, and the bitter taste and experience of men - brave yet afraid during combat. Their sleepless night in cramped, waterlogged, infested fox holes with the Japanese just one heartbeat away from death.Sledge writes about their fears and trepidation and of heir bravery and camaraderie -- or brotherhood. The brotherhood these men had for one another is what got them through those horrible times. . . . Sledge describes the emotional pain he and his comrades felt at the loss of one of their brothers-in-arms. All readers need do is read a chapter, put their heads back, close their eyes, and he or she can visualize what these brave young American soldiers went through to defend America.If there was a Pulitzer Prize for personal memoirs it would surely go to Eugene B. Sledge for his book, \\"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa\\". It should be required reading in all American History classes. His book serves as a reminder of the contributions and sacrifices made by these young men. . . ."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Without doubt, the finest first person account of battlefield life that I have ever read.

Sedge USMC veteran of WWII Pacific War is the Best, Most Profound, and Important Description of the War Experience ever written. It is highly readable. The reader sees the images, imagines the odors and feels the emotions; critical for a description of war.How do men survive this environment? They don't. Even if they do not suffer physical injury they all psychologically suffer terribly. To quote from the book, \\"War is brutish, inglorious and a terrible waste. Combat leaves an indelible mark on those who are forced to endure it. The only redeeming factors were my comrades' incredible bravery and their devotion to each other.\\" ... \\"Until the millennium arrives and countries cease trying to enslave others, it will be necessary to accept one's responsibilities and be willing to make sacrifices for one's country - as my comrades did.

Does this quote sounds like a clich&eacute;? It is not. The quote is heart felt and real.While we as individuals may or may not agree with the diplomatic and military policies of our country, we must never, never give anything but respect, honor and compassion to the members of this country's armed forces when we as a country ask them to go into harm's way for us.

When 51 of the 53 give the book 5 stars and the other 2 give it 4 stars you know that this book is exceptional. I especially liked the fact that Sledge conveyed the horror of war without finding it necessary to give a tape-recorder-like expletives-not-deleted account of the language of the combatants, or to describe their sex lives. James Webb, who wrote Fields of Fire, would have benefited from reading this book.

This account provides a ground-level narrative of just what that experience is like. Later in life he becomes a research scientist, and the book is written very matter-of-factly, from that kind of detached observer viewpoint. Yet the humanity comes through powerfully; the descriptions are vivid and detailed, confirmed by historical research, making the story that much more compelling. If you've ever wondered what combat is really like, this is it: week after week of grinding fear, friends dead and maimed, inhuman acts performed daily by ordinary people. The author describes it as a pestilence on the human landscape, like a vision of hell. I'll go out on a limb and recommend that every American should read this book or one similar, to have a taste of what the common soldier may experience while serving the interests of the nation."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I was fortunate enough to serve in W.

It's not just the combat, but more so the stresses of unrelenting heat, humidity, decay, exhaustion, fear, etc. I think taking a bullet through the head would have ended up the easy way out, it was those who survived that in some respects had it the toughest. This country can never fully repay these Marines. Hopefully, they all found their peace with God."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This is one of the most intimate and exceptionally written books about combat I have every read.

Between the equatorial heat, cement hard coral landscape, intense relentless enemy fire, dead and rotting enemy bodies baking in the sun, bad K rations for food that is made worse by the smell of gunpowder, sweat, human waste and rotting bodies, and the 75% chance you will either be killed or wounded, you somehow can't leave his side as the reader or it would somehow be dishonorable. Through Sledge's storytelling you grasp a real sense of what \\"team\\", \\"core\\" and \\"band of brothers\\" mean to a Marine. It is the absolute best recount of war that I have ever read. We as the next generation of \\"free\\" Americans owe it to the men and women who fought for our freedom to read this book."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Having seen Ken Burns films on WWII and his mention of this book, I decidedto read it.

It makes forexciting reading, if you're inclined to know what war was like then, andprobably what war is still like for men and women on the ground now. Read it!You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I recently read this book for the second time. As others have noted, this is by far the best American memoir of the Pacific Theater. While Sledge's narrative style is straightforward and plain, there is a sensitivity to the work that is not found in other American war memoirs. Sledge was a good Marine, and understood that Japanese brutality had to be answered in kind: he had absolutely no compunction about killing the Japanese and often expresses an extreme hatred towards them. His descriptions of what he witnessed are often horrific--the picture he paints of \\"Maggot Ridge\\" on Okinawa is nothing short of a hellscape. And yet a central theme in the book is that in the midst of all the brutality of Peleliu and Okinawa, one had to try to maintain at least a modicum of sensitivity and human compassion. That, I believe, is what makes this such a remarkable record of the war.I had the privilege of talking to Dr. Sledge about a decade ago, and he was a true gentleman--courteous, kind, and very generous with his time. Indeed, my overwhelming impression was that he was a very gentle person. Perhaps that is why his memoir is so haunting."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Sledge has detailedWith the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawathe war in the Pacific at a level I have not seen before.

This veteran is Jack Vargo, PFC with the 1st Marines.(or maybe the amphib force, I'm not sure.)I was a little unhappy with the Okinawa portion because I was stationed there from 1961 to 1963 ( and ,incidentally made my first mission into Vietnam on 2 Jan 1962) and saw many of the shore battery positions and walked the coral bottoms of the cliffs where so many Japanese and Okinawans committed suicide by jumping off.In support of the book, Jack commented that Sledge had definitely got the facts right. Particularly the part about the flies clinging to you so thick that you had to scrape them off.Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone for its historical basis and it is now in my library in that section.Sincerely,R.P. TaylorMAJ (ret) USA"},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"That Mr. Sledge's book is a classic, among the best of war memoires, is widely acknowledged. It is about time it also was fully admitted into the canon of American literature. This book should be mandatory reading in college level American lit surveys. Mr. Sledge is an unpretentious storyteller, but an utterly masterful one. He has a consistent eye for the perfect detail. And it is not just the horror and the pity that grabs you, but the moral and intellectual honesty, above all the decency of spirit that informs his desperate attempt to make sense of his experience.The book nicely divides itself into two parts: the first, Peleliu, deals with the narrator's experience of fear and confusion; the second, Okinawa, deals with his revulsion and disgust, the first part takes place on burning hot coral, the second in cold mud. But the whole book is characterized, more than anything, by a Mr. Sledge's love: for life, his fellows, for a special commander, and for his corps and country. You want authenticity? Real authenticity, not the fake &quot;authentiticy&quot; served up by so much of the literature of confessionalism? Read Mr. Sledge."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Author E. B. Sledge enlisted in the Marines on 12/3/42. Ultimately a member of K Co, 3rd Battalion, 5th Regiment of the 1st Marine Division, he went ashore with the Old Breed on Peleliu and Okinawa. This memoir of his time in training and combat was originally written to help his family understand his war. The result of his efforts is among the most vivid descriptions of the horrors of war that this reviewer has encountered. The necessity for taking Peleliu was questioned during the war as it is now. MacArthur was of the opinion that Peleliu was necessary to protect his right flank during his invasion of the Philippines. Given the then weakened state of the Imperial Navy and the destruction of much of the Japanese air power after the taking of the Marianas, the necessity of taking Peleliu is widely questioned. The island quite possibly should have been bypassed. On Peleliu the Japanese employed a change in tactics. No more would the enemy attempt to defend the beach. From this point forward, and at Iwo and Okinawa, they would employ a defense in depth based upon mutually supporting, fortified positions. Utilizing the natural terrain, Japanese engineers constructed pillboxes, gun emplacements and strong points in caves, depressions and reverse slopes, often connected by tunnels. There was no one main line of defense and they fought until the last position was taken by force. Because of the invasion of Normandy three months earlier, little press was given to this little understood and under-reported island battle. Incredible as it seems, the Old Breed, the 1st Marine Division, suffered twice as many casualties on Peleliu as the 2nd Marine Division did at bloody Tarawa. Sledge lets us see through his eyes the horror of moving through an open field in a vain attempt to take Bloody Nose Ridge and the ultimate reduction of the Umurbrogol Pocket. &quot;Each day&quot;, he tells us, &quot;brought some new dimension of dread...I witnessed some new, ghastly, macabre facet in the kaleidoscope of the unreal.&quot; From one hell to another, the 1st Marine Division again encountered the defense in depth at Okinawa, the last amphibious invasion. This action utilized the largest invasion fleet ever assembled in the Pacific. On Peleliu the digging of foxholes and burial sites was impossible due to the coral surface of the island with little or no soil. The enemy dead were everywhere, bloated and covered with maggots. The stench of decaying flesh and excrement was unrelenting. On Okinawa, the situation was worse. The precise and constant shelling by the enemy often prevented the moving of American dead as well. &quot;When enemy artillery exploded in the area, the eruption of soil and mud uncovered previously buried Japanese dead and scattered chunks of corpses...the ridge was a stinking compost pile. If a Marine slipped and slid down the back slope of the muddy ridge, he was apt to reach the bottom vomiting...horror stricken in disbelief while fat maggots tumbled out of his muddy dungaree pockets, cartridge belt, legging lacings, and the like. It is too preposterous to think that men could actually live and fight for days and nights on end under such terrible conditions and not be driven insane.&quot; The reduction of Okinawa took 82 days and Sledge suffered the same ghastly nightmare for many, many years. The dream was always the same: going back into the line on Okinawa. Peleliu and Okinawa were taken but at a high cost. Total American casualties for both islands were 7,613 killed and missing and 31,807 wounded. The 1st marine Division alone suffered 14,191 men killed, wounded or missing. &quot;What a pitiful waste,&quot; Sledge wrote, reflecting on the death of an unknown Marine teenager. Reading his book, one is compelled to ask the larger question but is grateful that the invasion of the Japanese home islands became unnecessary."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"E.B. Sledge has written a first hand account of the island hopping campaign against Japan with the flair of a historian and the brutal reality of one who was there. This theater differed so much from the battle against Germany, and Sledge does a wonderful job of relating the hellish aspects of these battles, while showing the day to day operations of Marines against not only a fierce and deadly-cunning enemy, but also how the tropics, with it's intense heat, disease and lack of cover contributed considerable casualties themselves. This book graphically recalls the almost inhumane suffering of the Marines against a completely committed and suicidal enemy, and the enormous sacrifices these men had to make, without ever once straying into a patriotic and flag waving history lesson. His descriptions are vivid and unforgettable, such as when he trudged up a hill and saw what remained of a dead Japanese machine-gunner. &quot;He sat bolt upright in the firing position behind the breech of his machine gun. Even in death his eyes stared widely along the gun sights. Despite the vacant look of his dilated pupils, I couldn't believe he was dead. Cold chills ran along my spine. Gooseflesh tickled my back. It seemed as though he was looking through me to all eternity, that at any instant he would raise his hands, which rested in a relaxed manner on his thighs, grip the handles on the breech, and press the thumb trigger. But he would rot, and the brass slugs would corrode. Neither he nor his ammo could do any more for the emporer.&quot; This is but one of many excellent descriptions of battlefield hell. Maggot covered corpses bloating in the sun, hand to hand fighting with special night infiltration squads, even a column of soldiers who charge at port arms across 300 yards of open field in a suicidal display of bravery, it's all here. This book will not disappoint."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Sledge's book is a must-read for anyone interested in WWII battles against the Japanese. No words are wasted trying to impress the reader. Instead, this is a first-hand account of an enlisted soldier's harrowing battle experiences. It does not get any more personal and straight forward than this. The maps in the book are not very good, so I turned to the internet. I Googled every mountain, island, ship name, etc. for an immersing reading experience. You can even use Microsoft's Flight Simulator to fly around the islands."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This book was required reading for a class, and I am glad that it was. Gripping, vivid, detailed accounts told in an anecdotal style that pull the reader into the story of what it was really like to be at Peleliu and Okinawa.For those interested in battle tactics, equiptment and military strategy, this book may not be the best choice. While there is some mention of necessary details, the real meat of this memoir are the descriptions of day-to-day life: conversations with fellow Marines; witnessing acts of heroism, bravery and sometimes stupidity or carelessness; the moments of nerve-racking waiting before battle; the sights, sounds and smells of being on the front line.This is a must-read for anyone who has even the slightest interest in the Pacific battles of WWII. As a student, I hate to admit that I normally skim through material, taking note only of important points. But I read this book cover to cover, and then read it a second time.Fantastic!"},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"In this book you will follow the Marines in their battles on both Peleliu and Okinawa. This book is not intended to give a full grasp of the entire Pacific campaign. It is also not about the strategies involved for the taking of the islands.It is a book told from the perspective of the Marines and Soldiers that had to endure impossible conditions and hellish experiences. This book is not for the faint-hearted. It is graphic and gruesome, so the reader should be prepared for that.I first read this book while doing training maneuvers in my infantry company. It made me laugh at the futility of what we were doing. Nothing we trained for would have prepared us for the conditions these men endured.I also think that this is a good book for people wanting to understand the rationale used for the grave decision to employ atomic weaponry and end this war hastily. This is not advocation per se of this form of warfare. It is just a way to get into the minds of the people responsible for preventing more U.S. fatalities."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Although the cover and the title may not sound that eloquent or poetic, make no mistake, Sledge's elegy stands along perhaps 10 other wartime biographies written this century. He not only recounts war and the charnel houses of these two battles, but does it in a way that is both extremely moving in a prose style that is very reminiscent of the Robert Graves' WWI \\"Goodbye to all That\\" or WWII's Farley Mowat's \\"And No Birds Sang.\\"Sledge, who is not a professional writer like the above gentleman but writes, in my opinion, equally as well. As such Sledge has written the quintessential experience of the Marine in the Pacific War. it is one of the best, eloquent, haunting, and poetic reads I have every come across, and more than most war memoirs it is very, very scary.I think that one should be able to read through it quickly. I also liked it cause I ended up clawing through the jungle in the Horseshoe region on Peleliu and seeing nothing but gun positions, caves, and small human shaped holes in the coral landscape with Sake Bottles and used and unused cartridges in the holes.I took this book to Peleliu in 1998. The Jungle has mostly come back and there are few tourists on the Island, and none off the very few trails. The caves are littered with broken Japanese Army helmets, some rusted badly, others with the green in good condition.One can see nothing but jungle cleaved coral. After passing the usual \\"squid pots\\" (what the Japanese called the small coral caves and holes the dot the island), I was suddenly standing on an old oil drum, now rusted the same colour as the brown moss of the jungle. Then another drum.... rows of drums filled with coral. About at least 50 of them lined to a depth of three of four-deep covering the entrance to a coral cave. The front of the drums were torn and shredded by large calibre fire -- probably .50 calibre I surmise by the size of the holes. Despite its layers of armour I could not help but think that the Marines probably knocked the position out early, though it would have done them little good,as this position was covered by innumerable others.Sledge describes the caves and squid pots all up to the top of the ridge. Day after day the Marines in Sledges unit went into this horror. Okinawa was Peleliu magnified 10 times -- and they were dehumanised by the entire experience to a degree that those who have never, perhaps today few ever can, experience such a degree of fighting.It should be noted that the Marines and, later, the Army siezed the ridge after 4 months of fighting. 10,000 Japanese soldiers and about 2000 Americans died on this island 3 Miles Long and 1 mile wide. I came across their bones --- femurs, skull shards, and shredded bodies all over the island. All along I had Sledge's book to keep me dark company.And so I recommend you the book. In the same way that Robert Graves kept me company in my wet soujourns to Vimy Ridge and Ypres in Belgium, so too did Sledge keep me company in that hot hell in the South Pacific."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"As I found outshortly after I first read With The Old Breed...Gene Sledge and I were in the same replacement draft which joined the 1st Marine Division on Pavuvu, British Russell Islands, but were in different units in the division.

Coinicidentally, I was a stretcher bearer supporting Company K, 3d Battalion, 5th Marines, Gene's outfit but I didn't know that until long after the war.

Sledge, a Marine PFC who landed on Peleliu andOkinawa, details the violence and brutality of these two battles sorealistically that it is a disturbing and haunting book. Peleliu wassupposed to last 3 to 4 days, but went on for 2 months and cost theMarines 1,262 dead and 5,274 wounded. The statistics from Okinawacontain a action, and 26,221 neuropsychiatric &quot;non-battlecasualties.&quot; At Peleliu, Sledge &quot;had tasted the bitterestessence of war, the sight of helpless comrades being slaughtered, andit filled me with disgust.&quot; Peleliu was a jagged coral islandwhich caused cuts and tears on contact with human flesh, and there wasa lot of such contact. &quot;It was almost impossible to dig aprotective foxhole in the rock.&quot; Once inland one's senses wereoverwhelmed by the sight and smell of corpses filled with maggots,human excrement on top of coral everywhere, dysentery, rottingAmerican and Japanese rations, huge flies, knee deep mud, rainstorms,tropical oven heat, snapping bullets, and exploding shells. More thanonce Sledge saw a Marine slide down a ridge into rotting Japanesecorpses to find himself covered with maggots and vomiting from thesmell. Peleliu was an &quot;assault into hell;&quot; the landscape&quot;hell's own cesspool.&quot; After the landing, with Marinessuffering from heat prostration, even the water came from hell --itcame in old oil drums, and the oil residue caused the troops to retchin the broiling sun. When Sledge sees his comrades cutting gold teethfrom the Japanese--some while they are still alive--he is disgustedand sickened. But war, Sledge notes, made savages of them all, andone day Sledge finds himself bending over a Japanese corpse with aknife to cut out gold teeth. A corpsman tries to dissuade him, firstwith one argument and then another, finally succeeding by pointing outthe threat from germs involved. Relentlessly, Sledge and his comradesmove steadily forward, forward into the &quot;meat grinder,&quot;losing more and more men to injury and death, the grim&quot;inevitable harvest.&quot; The sight of dead Marines who had beentortured and mutilated by the Japanese hardens Sledge and his comradesagainst the enemy. Sledge tells of the terror of walking across anopen field facing Japanese machine gun fire while at the same timereceiving friendly fire from the rear from a Marine tank. But therewas something &quot;Artillery is hell,&quot; and of all the terrors,&quot;the terror and desperation endured under heavy shelling are byfar the most unbearable.&quot; Sledge learned to steer clear of anyand all second lieutenants, who invariably did not know what they weredoing and were highly dangerous to the troops. Sledge made twoamphibious landings on Peleliu and one on Okinawa. The rulerecognized among the troops was that if you made more than twolandings you had used up your luck. Even so, Sledge was one of lessthan 10 in his company of 235 men to escape alive andunwounded--thereby beating the &quot;mathematics of death.&quot;(&quot;Statistically,&quot; Sledge tells us, &quot;the infantry unitshad suffered l50 per cent casualties in the two campaigns.&quot;)Dr. Sledge, who is now a college biology professor, writes: &quot;Waris brutish, inglorious and a terrible waste. Combat leaves anindelible mark on those who are forced to endure it. The onlyredeeming factors were my comrades' incredible bravery and theirdevotion to each other.&quot; From Sledge's viewpoint, Peleliu andOkinawa were very close battles. His experience showed him that thesuccess of the Marines was grounded on their discipline, esprit decorps, tough training, the ability to depend on one's comrades, andboot camp, which developed an expectation to excel, even understress. Of all the books on combat, this ranks in the very highesttier. Reading it is an experience--a new and terrible experience--ofwhat Marine infantrymen went through during and after an amphibiouslanding in the Pacific in World War II. Without Marines likeDr. Sledge, who put their arms and legs and lives on the line in thesesavage battles, history would have taken a far different course. I,for one, am profoundly grateful for what he and his comrades did, andwant to thank him for what he endured. We owe him and his comradesmore than we realize."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"\\"With The Old Breed\\" is a stunning eye witness account of one Marines trip from Boot Camp to the South Pacific during World War II. Sledge writes an autobiographical and historical account of his own experiences as a member of K Company, Third Battalion, Fifth Marines, First Marine Division. Coming late to the war in 1944, Sledge \\"only\\" participates in two of the famous 1st Marine battles - Peleliu and Okinawa. Throughout his account he speaks of his training, the closeness of combat and the horrors of war.After initially enlisting in the Marines in 1942, Sledge enrolled in Marine ROTC but like may others in his class, he felt the call of the war and after a semester he went to boot camp. It was here that he got his first taste of Marine training. By this time the Marines had plenty of combat veterans who had been rotated home to fill the ranks of instructors. The effect of having veterans train the newest can be measured by their initial survival in combat. The instructors prepared Sledge and his peers well with tough, realistic training - training that would keep them alive in the first days in combat. His state side training was followed up with more once he reached the Pacific and a healthy dose of iron discipline. Again, the hard training paid off for Sledge. Later in the war the Marines ran out of time for proper training and integration of new troops. The result was dead Marines, to new to know what to do. Training and discipline were the difference between life and death in the initial days in combat. Sledge received and absorbed his training and went home without a scratch.Though Sledge does not specifically address it, I was struck by the closeness of the combat he faced. Peleiu was a only 12 square miles - 6 miles long by 2 miles wide. Given that the average artillery piece of the day could range more than 6 miles, Peleiu was a division sized knife fight that lasted 30 days. 30 horrible days of almost non-stop fighting. Even when sent to the \\"rear\\" artillery and snipers were a constant danger. Okinawa was more of the same but on a larger scale. 60 miles long and between 2 and 18 miles wide, the Americans put a Field Army up against more than 100,000 entrenched Japanese. The vast majority of the island was covered by indirect fire and snipers were again a constant danger. Multiple Corps fought side by side where the island was barely 3 miles across. That anyone survived let alone prevailed through 80 days of bullets filling the air is amazing.Unlike many military writers who only saw combat in pictures, Sledge was there. He writes a Marines thoughts in Marine words. And unlike writers who wax poetic about the intense experience of men under fire, Sledge repeatedly calls warfare what it is - a waste. A waste of men and material. A destroyer of lives and land. The only good he finds in his service are the friendships that were born and continue. Okinawa is an \\"abyss\\" and he tells of a battlefield so littered with dead that pieces of flesh fly with the shrapnel and mud flung by exploding artillery and mortars. He recalls a friend tricking him into not pulling the gold teeth out of a dead corpse by warning him of germs. Only later does he realize that his friend was trying to save his soul not his health.When old men sit and decide to send young men to kill and be killed, they should be forced to read Sledge's words. War not only kills but also justifies killing. There are times and places where there is no other way. Times when the greater good can only come from the horror of war. But those times are few and I doubt someone like Sledge could find many after seeing first hand what war does to both those who die and those who survive."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"When reading about historical events, one must consider the source. Dr. Sledge is an excellent source on the subject of Marines in combat in WWII. Dr. Sledge was really there at Peleliu and Okinawa, and on the front lines. No post-war historian could possibly describe the realities of combat with the accuracy of one who was really there. This book is a treasure not only because of its accuracy, but because it is so rare. Bookstores today are full of first-person accounts of Vietnam War veterans, but similar writings by veterans of WWII are extremely rare. If you want to read a generalized, sanitzed version of combat in the Pacific war, pick up a typical history book. However, if you want a definitive description of young American Marines fighting the ghastly horrors of combat-the worst reality of war-then this book is a must read. In my opinion, books such as this should be mandatory reading for high school students, so that they might have some understanding of how many Americans have fought and died to preserve the freedoms they now enjoy."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Three veterans of the First Marine Division have written accounts of WWII in the Pacific. E.B. Sledge in this book, William Manchester in &quot;Goodbye Darkness,&quot; and Robert Leckey in &quot;Strong Men Armed.&quot; Sledge's book gives an honest, plain spoken, first hand account of two horrific campaigns. He pulls no punches in describing the brutality and the horror, but he doesn't dwell on it. He merely describes it in a matter of fact fashion.Leckey's book (&quot;Strong Men Armed&quot;) doesn't dwell on personal experiences, but gives the vast panorama of the Navy/Marine Corps island hopping campaign, and helps to put Sledge's personal memoir into the context of the whole war in the Pacific.Manchester's book (&quot;Goodbye Darkness&quot;) reads something like the out-loud ruminations of a mental patient working through unresolved issues on the psychiatrist's couch.Leckey is a noted military historian who has written a number of very good books on the subject. Manchester is a noted author, and of the three has the most recognizable name. Sledge, however, although not a professional writer, is the First Division alumnus who has written the best book on the Pacific War. (Leckey runs a close second and Manchester a distant third)."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"With the Old Breed is the best memoir I have read on the Second World War. After a brief chapter about his introduction into the Marine Corps, Sledge brings us with him into the fetid, humid hell that was the Pacific theater. Sledge, a mortarman with 3/5, 1st Marine Division, graphically details his experiences at Peleliu (a pointless battle) and Okinawa.His tales are moving and brutal. In one account, his vivid description of digging a fighting hole only to find the rotting corpse of a Japanese soldier 2 feet down literally made my skin crawl. Elsewhere he recounts the bitter personal brutality that was all too common between US Marines and Japanese soldiers. After reading this book, you will understand what Sledge meant when, in the introduction he writes, &quot;it has been a burden to retain this story.&quot; We should be thankful that Sledge decided to share his burden with posterity, lest we forget the awful price paid by all who were involved."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Dr. Sledge wrote that in the slaughtering days of Peleliu there was no sound -- no sound because there was ALL sound, deafening assaults on the ear's physiology. Of the 9000 Marines who landed on the island's shores, 1 out 7 were dead within 24 hours. Ocean water was dyed red to 4 feet out. On shore, and weighted down with 90 pounds of survival gear and weaponry, men ran and fired and fought in 110-degree heat, with no water to drink. And that was only the beginning.Accounts of organized slaughter abound, from Thucydides' &quot;History of the Peloponnesian Wars&quot; to the Civil War's &quot;Andersonville,&quot; from Leon Uris's factual writings shaped as novels to Canada's Farley Mowat in his 40-years-after-the-war eloquent memoir &quot;And No Birds Sang,&quot; and to Larry Heinemann's wrenching exposures of Viet Nam. All these writings are unspeakably moving, and when we close the covers, we think we understand ... until we come across a book like that of E.B. Sledge.The accounts of Dr. Sledge touched me immeasurably of their own accord but also because I once loved a casualty of that South Pacific island's horrors, who, unfortunately, never quite found a way back to normalcy. I was too young and self-involved to comprehend. As he continued his fateful journey into alcoholism, my own soul stiffened and I left that tortured man.Twenty-six years later I sought out Dr. Sledge, and after some time found a way to reach him. His words, in a letter to me, ought to be shared. Dr. Sledge wrote that his physician father offered advice that put Sledge \\"on the road to a postwar life of happiness and success.\\" Some of the advice was this: \\"Don't ever feel bitter or sorry for yourself. You served your time in Hell, but you survived.\\"Survive he did, and well. Dr. Sledge went on to earn degrees in science and to become \\"Uncle Eugene\\" to his friends on the Alabama campus where he taught biochemistry and zoology. &quot;Science was my salvation,&quot; he told me. &quot;When combat memories bore down on me I lost myself in a difficult problem [in science].\\"Read his noble book. In honoring him, we honor all who have served, and are now serving, the ideals of our country."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I read the old copy of this twice. Imagine my surprise when my son sent me a blown up photo of the cover and I am staring at my father aiming his weapon as I remember him when he was young! He fought at Okinawa and out of his entire battalion only he and five others came back (& wounded at that). When I was little after the War, and Daddy was drinking, he used to describe some of war's horrors to my mother and his friends when he thought I wasn't listening. He would talk about a man named Sledge who was nicknamed, \\"Sledgehammer.\\" Although my father kept his sense of humor about some of war's crazy happenings, he never recovered fully and drank when it became too much. He lost all of his buddies in battle. When Daddy died in 1981, I thought, \\"Well, he is with them, now.\\" Sledge's accounts exactly match my father's from the late 1940s."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Sledge's writing is without guile or artistic embellishment. He tells his view of the battles simply and clearly and he reveals all the horror, brutality and waste of war. For those unfamiliar with how vicious the fighting was in the Pacific, this is a great primer. Many know of the bloody fight for Okinawa and there is much personal detail here on that battle. Few know of Peleliu because it turned out to be of little strategic value. Even so, one month of fighting cost the Marines & Army nearly 10,000 casualties. The battle was important to the Marines in that they learned to adapt to the new, more lethal tactics the Japanese tried there.If you are looking for a novel or a historical text, this is not the book for you. If you want to become more intimately familiar with the nature of the fighting in the Pacific, you will not find a better book."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I don't think I could add much more than what has already been said. This book is an absolute masterpiece. Alone, the description of the lay of the land on a war-infested island is worth the price of admission. What an unbelievable time period in this great nation's history. And, if I may politically editorialize a bit, it amazes me how many weak kneed \\"patriots\\" in our society today decry our collective losses as we keep the monumental battle \\"over there\\". Meanwhile (and I know it is not fashionable to talk \\"numbers\\" but...) we have about the same total losses in the so-called \\"War on Terror\\" (War on Islamo-Fascism is what it should be called, if we were not all so successfully cowed by the \\"mainstream\\" media) as they had on this now-little remembered battle on Peleliu. Go amongst your fellow creatures today, and ask how many of them have heard of \\"Peleliu\\"! Is anyone getting the point here, as far as cost-benefit analysis?Note that there does, throughout this book, tend to be an underlying anti-war sentiment by Sledge. Not in the sense of self-preservation mind you, but more a sense of \\"what are we doing here?\\" But, he also seems to be resigned to the fact that in this monumental battle against Japan, he and his comrades are but little cogs in an immense wheel. And, most importantly, he doesn't shove his political views down your throat. Mostly he is just reporting, in a matter-of-fact prose of the times that couldn't possibly be more effective.Get this book and read it.

In one scene, Sledge describes digging a foxhole on Okinawa only to have his entrenching tool pierce the ribcage of a buried Japanese soldier. The stench fills the air and turns loose a horde of maggots from the dead's body. In a sense Sledge is the soldier's Everyman who lays bare the terrible costs of war echoing like cannon fire through the ages."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Top notch first hand accounts of war are hard to swallow. These men are heroic. These Pacific WWII battles were bloody and ruthless. The soldiers were put through tremendous stress of every kind. They went up against a fanatical, well equipped, disciplined Japanese army. They performed in ways that make us so very proud and leave a giant frog in your throat holding back the wave of emotions so justly provoked. Sledgehammer is a private in the Marines. Considering what he's asked to accomplish and endure he is amazingly humble, unjaded, self-effacing and yet fully capable of describing the battles, his own actions and those of his \\"brothers\\". He is equally classy in NOT indentifying by name those soldiers whose actions in battle are shameful but he does not hide it from us either.We have some really beautiful (trying to find the appropriate word) accounts of the Vietnam War and some new writing recently on Korea but first hand accounts of a realistic nature about WWII, particularly the Pacific theater are far fewer. One reason may be the extreme trauma that the men went through has made it much harder to explain and express.Mr. Sledge finally had this published in the 1980's. He has continued to reach new readers now for almost 30 years. It's a well paced, deeply compelling personal history. He reflects on his actions. He explains everything in gruesome detail yet he somehow does not lose his humanness, maybe innocence that is almost impossible to believe he retains. He's remarkable and we're richer for the book he's written."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"In reading many WWII memoirs you come to find a certain trend of honesty, one that usually has no indication of self bravado or puffing up of one's feathers. With Sledge's With The Old Breed you find the absolute best of all the WWII memoirs, Pacific and European. Even though I knew what to expect I was still blown away by the straight forward honest account of his time spent battling against the Japanese.Right from the beginning you see how he traveled from boot camp - having purposefully failed OCS in order to fight \\"the japs\\" - and over the Pacific to fight at such hellish battles as Peleliu and Okinawa, arguably two of the bloodiest of the whole war. You see his candor as he describes his first beach assault, feel his fear as he cowers in his foxhole as the awesome power of Japanese mortar and artillery pummels the land around and decimates the Marines. You never once doubt whether this was really what happened, knowing full well that his account is true to the letter.You see he wrote this not to gain notoriety or money, he didn't embellish in order to get it published easier. He wrote down a true and accurate account, warts and all: fear, desperation, helplessness, anger. You see all of it because he wrote his memoir with the intent of giving his family an account of what he went through. Why would he not want to give his family the truest and most accurate account possible? So we benefit from his desire to add his chapter to his family's history. Additionally he adds italicized sections to indicate where he was breaking from his memoir to add the historical background to what happened or was going to happen, as well as asterisks to add a little more detail. Both additions do nothing to diminish his memoir and detract from the honesty, and instead show how much he wanted his account to be read as his account, and not memoir infused with history.What we have is perhaps the greatest Pacific War memoir ever, and quite possibly the greatest WWII memoir ever (hard to say because the two theaters of operation were so strikingly different, but from what I have read Sledge's is the most real, honest and heartfelt). Without a doubt I would recommend this to any and all.5 stars."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"To prepare myself for the HBO Series The Pacific I obtained a copy of this novel and was shocked at how horrible this war front really was. A vivid account of E.B. Sledge's Pacific wars and brutal imagery to paint those gripping strugles you almost feel like you are there next to Sledgehammer. Based off of notes kept in secret written in his bible gives you personal views of what went through this soldiers mind in the toughest of battles. Leckie's Helmet for my Pillow subs nicknames for the soldiers in his novel Sledge uses actual names so if and when you compare the journals of Sledge to the HBO The Pacific you want be disappointed. Sledge's use of imagery in his telling almost makes you feel the mud on your skin, the smell that hangs in the air, and feel the hoplessness of each battle.

It is not about tactics, operations, or strategy, but about what life was like for for men in front line units in the Pacific, the dangers and the depravations they faced. This book is important because of the perspective it can give the reader.Though its focus is almost entirely on one small band of men (the men of Company K), it provides the reader with important context for understanding the world. Most obviously it gives one a window into what it means to be solider and the \\"face of battle\\", how war brings out the best and the worst in human kind, how disease and stress can be as deadly as bullets and shell fragments, and how dehumanizing the whole experience can be. Reading this first hand account makes these statements more than cliches, it makes the personal cost of war tangible in a way third person accounts can not.Although I suspect this wasn't the authors goal, the book also provides those of us in the post baby boom generations an important perspective that can help us make sense of the arc of history from World War I to 80's. During the World Wars hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people had similar experiences, it must have had a profound impact on how they approached the world, which in turn must of have shaped the inter War and post War periods. Before reading this account I wasn't able to really appreciate how World War I lead to an increase in nihilism or the pain Vietnam War protests must have caused some veterans.

Sledge recounts the horrors of the war in the Pacific in his memoir With The Old Breed. Dr. Sledge, who was a professor of biology at the University of Montevallo in Alabama for almost fifty years, wrote his book for his wife and children so they could understand what he had endured in combat. His wife realized the importance of his book and convinced him to publish it. It is considered to be the best memoir written by an enlisted man from World War II, and some have even put it in the same cannon of literature as The Red Badage of Courage and All Quiet on the Western Front. It is equaled only by the memoirs of President U.S. Grant.A native of Mobile Al, Sledge served in the Marines from 1943 to 1946. After boot camp in California, he was shipped to the Pacific. In his memoir, he admits that as his ship was nearing Peleliu, he was so frightened that he was afraid that he would lose control of his bladder and then the other men would know he was a coward. One of the biggest miseries faced by the men was the filth they were forced to live in during combat. Drinking water was too precious to use for bathing and brushing teeth and Dr.Sledge said it brothered everyone he knew.It is an important part of the stress suffered by the men on the battledfield that has not been given much attention by historians or even discussed in memoirs written by veterans. While he watched men die around him, Dr. Sledge survived the war. He was only twenty-two when the war ended but he would never be the same again. There is a picture of Dr. Sledge at the end of the book that was taken in 1946 after he had returned from duty in China. It is of a handsome man in full dress uniform with eyes that are much too sad and old for one so young. As World War II fades into history and passes into legend and myth, first-hand accounts like E.B. Sledge's are vital to understanding the sacrifices made by millions in defeating one of the greatest foes in human history."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This book is about combat. Nothing more. It is horrifying. It is well written. It is too well written. If you read this book, you will understand combat. Not \\"war\\", but combat. That's Mr. Sledge's goal. He wants the rest of us to understand the horror of combat. This is the best book on combat by an American combat veteran. The only combat book that is better is \\"The Forgotten Soldier\\" by Guy Sajer, a German soldier on the Russian front during WWII. Both of these books will make you cry like a baby. Read them back to back & I promise that you will have nightmares."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I read this book for a class titled \\"World War II in the Pacific\\". I can honestly say if I hadn't read this book, the class would have had less of a personal impact on me! When I was done reading it, I gave it to my grandpa who fought in WW II. He served in the Army and assaulted Utah Beach on D-Day with an artillery battallion. I wanted to give him an account of the \\"Pacific side\\" of the war from a soldier's viewpoint.This book tells truly haunting and chilling tales of real battle conditions. The author does a great job of describing the various places he served and those with whom he served. These are characters and places that become more and more real to the reader as the book progresses. Sledge spares no details in describing the true nature of the battles for Peliliu and Okinawa. It's almost as if he's experiencing the battles again when you read his stories. You can feel the pain, despair, and disgust at what he sees and experiences around him.This book is a must read for anyone who is a WW II history buff or even veterans themselves. The combat techniques and battle fields have changed so much since WW II that one can read this and realize how different 21st Century combat really is. I highly recommend this book!!"},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This is a timeless work. I have read recent, exhaustive treatments of Okinawa, which are very worthwhile, but the Old Breed transmits a flavor of the real experience of battle that is lacking in other works."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I've been a student of military history for 50 years and have read countless books and almost all of the classics. This is the best book to describe all the aspects of hell that combat entails. A must read."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I can only say that this is possibly the best book on war I have read..... EVER!"},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"December 29th, 1980, I arrived at the same Marine Corps boot camp which welcomed EB Sledge nearly 40 years before. With the Old Breed (WTOB) makes it perfectly clear why the stress and hardship of the Marine Corps boot camp experience is necessary. Thankfully, my generation was spared the subsequent horror that Sledge and his fellow marines witnessed on the islands of Peleliu and Okinawa.Unlike other WWII books, WTOB truly brings home the misery and insanity of the Pacific theater slugfest. Death is imminent on nearly every page. The broken, shredded, mangled bodies of friend and foe are always close at hand. The filth, the stench, the mania of combat are unapologetically laid bare. There are passages so unforgettably gruesome that any romantic view of warfare is crushed beyond recognition.WTOB reads as a personal journey through hell from which EB Sledge emerged against extraordinary odds. One marvels that he wasn't emotionally scarred beyond recovery. These were impressive men, iron-willed warriors, all of whom deserve our undying gratitude. We benefit from their unbelievable bravery and would be mistaken not to read this book. 5+ stars."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"The late Mr Sledge 'hammer' wrote this compelling and often brutal account of his experiences during the grim and bloody battles on Peleliu and Okinawa. He was one of a scant handful of Marines that made it through both battles without a wound. His first hand account draws the reader into the daily routine of Marine life but also splashes mud and blood into your face when he lands on the two contested islands. Although a 60mm mortarman, he shared many of the same brutal conditions the infantry did: enemy snipers, artillery, personal misery, mud and incredible filth. Sledge writes in a straight forward style and a few times, he himself mentions that we was confused and puzzled about just where he was during advances and barrages, bringing this story to an even more personal level.One of the best WWII related memoirs you will read, right up there with 'Storm of Steel' and 'Goodbye, Darkness'. Powerful, gripping, head-shaking and amazing are a few words to describe his experiences amid slashing shrapnel, Nambu bullets, artillery fire, carrying loads of ammo and hauling wounded Marines in knee-deep mud. Some scenes are horrific and brutal, just as they happened to him and his buddies. Well worth reading and you will not soon forget his book.Sadly, Eugene Sledge passed away in 2001."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"There are so many reasons to pan a book like this, writting, viewpoint, historical accuracy, but this book gets 5 stars in all catagories. So true, so full of action, so sad, so much to say. My true interest lies on the Eastern Front between Germany and Russia, but this was so good it is my favorite of WW2 in spite of the subject matter. Wow."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I have told people that war is the Second worse thing that could happen to a human. The first? Slavery - which is the battlefront against Hitler's National Socialists and the Imperial Japan in World War II.That's where this story takes place. I have read few books that convey the realism and horror of war so well, without reservation. This is one.Eugene B. Sledge, an Alabama boy, heads into War in the Pacific as a member of the U.S. Marines. He lands with the famous 1st Marine Division - 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines. His training was concentrated and intense - but still nothing prepares one for the onslaught of Pelilieu. He was a vet when he hit Okinawa where the fighting got even tougher. The image that sticks with me about Okinawa is a Marine who has to head back to get ammo. He slips in the mud and slides down the hill, rising to discover that he was covered in the maggots uncovered by his slid that were gnawing away at the dead bodies in the mud. This Marine, inured to death and destruction, is rattled badly. That image has stayed with me to understand the horror of this generation's sacrifice and their quiet acceptance of Duty.By the time Sledge hit the hell of Okinawa, he was a combat vet, still filled with fear but no longer with panic."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I really can't say anything better than has already been said in the previous reviews. This is a horrific, and at the same time, fascinating read. Sledge tells it like it was and holds nothing back. The descriptions of the blasted battlefields full of dead is something you won't forget. His descriptions of the fighting conditions will make you thankful for dry clothes, hot coffee and fresh socks every day after reading this. Should be required reading in schools today - an important gift from someone who lived in the horror of war."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Sledge describes the ferocity and hatred and horror of the Pacific war on Peleliu and Okinawa. What he has to say is very consistent with the experiences of veterans that I have known concerning the unrelenting toughness and brutality of Japanese soldiery they encountered. Where pertinent, he inserts interesting remarks about command relationships, lists specific units involved, and describes enemy equipment. His is one of the few books to mention psychological casualties and possible ways for men to cope when thrust into the inferno. His book is unique in convincingly describing the emotional enormities of getting shot at. His observations include many \\"pearls\\" about functioning in combat. The work also forms a bulwark against the kumbaya generated lately about the war against the Japanese in those days. It is an important account and one of the best reads in military history."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"My grandfather was an infantryman in Germany in WWII and in trying to gain insight into his service, I read several books on the war in Europe. Later I picked up a copy of this book seeking comparisons between the war against Germany and the struggle against Japan.I'm glad I did because this outstanding book is hard to put down. Sledge is graphic and truthful of his experiences in a truly hellish war. But what struck me as being a bit different than some other similar books is that \\"Sledgehammer\\" as he was called, does not use any profanity or embellish anything at all. He doesn't need to.He is instead very humble and matter-of-fact, realizing that the truth is more than enough to draw you into the carnage, brutality and the waste. His message is that yes \\"war is hell\\" and a tragic waste of good men, some of whom were still just as much boys as soldiers.These guys were trained to kill. There was no choice either, you killed or were in turn killed yourself. After terrible months enduring the crippling heat, disease, incredibly rugged terrain, a fanatical and brutal enemy, the constant sickening stench of death and seeing their friends slaughtered, they finally prevailed.You'd think then they would be sent somewhere to recover from the living hell that was Peleliu and Okinawa...maybe to Hawaii for some much-deserved rest. But instead they were ordered to bury the rotting, maggot infested enemy dead! It's an unbelievable story.Sledge's book will give you the most sincere appreciation for the men who have given so much so we can enjoy the freedoms we all take for granted. In reading it, I realized the war on both enemies was terrible. Yet, a German would surrender while a Japanese soldier would very seldom ever do so. I think when you combine the horrible battleground conditions with the fanaticism of the Japanese soldier, it's obvious the war in the Pacific was even more hellish. (Don't worry Grandpa, I still think you had balls the size of cantoloupes to do what you did in Germany).For a perspective on the war against Germany I'd recommend \\"You can't get much closer than this\\" by A.Z. Adkins and \\"Taught to kill\\" by John Babcock. Both of the above are also truly outstanding books.The next time you are having a bad day and need a little perspective in life, pick up a book like \\"With The Old Breed\\" and re-set your prioritys and values a bit.In so doing take a look at the obituries in your local paper and you realize there aren't many of these great men left. My grandfather has been gone for years and Sledge passed on in 2001.For many, it's too late to say \\"thank you\\"."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I just finished reading this book and I am blown away. Let me first say that I am somewhat of a WWII history buff and enjoy reading all types of books related to this topic. This is a firsthand account of the fighting on Peleliu and Okinawa by a Marine in the 5th Division. I read with rapt attention as Mr. Sledge described the absolute horror of combat and war in general. In all the books I have read about the war, never have the details of battle and emotions of the combatants made so clear to me. The author also did a masterful job of describing the abysmal conditions faced by the Marines on these islands. Through the authors writing it was clear that the Marines in combat had a special bond between them and their courage under these conditions was nothing short of amazing. They were regular young men thrown into the fires of Hell, many died but for those that survived they would never be the same. Even if you have a passing interest in WWII or if you just want to read an amazing book, buy this book. You will not be sorry you did."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Dr. Sledge's memoir of the fanatical resistance of the Imperial Japanese Army at Peleliu and Okinawa is awe-inspiring and humbling. His writing is very easy to understand and left me more deeply indebted to our nations Greatest Generation. His reminicenses focus on the terror of war and how he and his fellow Marines prevailed in conditions that were more horrible than my imagination can comprehend. Historical writings like this should be mandatory reading in high school so that our present and future generations may better understand the freedom we enjoy was paid for with the blood of the bravest of Americans."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I love this book! My grandmothers brother fought along with these men as a marine in WWII. He and men like E.B. Sledge are the reason I earned the title of UNITED STATES MARINE many years ago, 2nd AAV Bat. 2nd Mar.

It gives one a greater appreciation for what service men and women have to put up with. A great book is a book that gets its point across, and this one surely does.What I will remember most is a picture at the very end of the book: after the story's description of terrible conditions, exhaustion, friends being killed, and Japanese atrocities, there is a picture of the author titled \\"Author at the end of the campaign.\\" Good grief, he is just a kid. I don't think I will ever forget that picture."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This is the finest personal war memoir I have ever read, made more significant by the kind of Pacific campaign Sledge and his Marine comrades had to endure.

GREAT!"},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Only the &quot;The Triumph and the Glory&quot; rivals this fine book as a timeless account of men at war. Mr. Sledge has recorded the eternal valor of so many of our young men on the pages of this book, I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This book, of course, is based on Sledge's notes taken during the campaigns on Peleliu and Okinawa. (They remind me a little of Manchester's descriptions of Okinawa.)There is no elegant prose here, nor any description of the larger issues involved in the war. He's not Hemingway. Every Japanese bullet \\"snaps\\" or \\"whines\\". But you can hear those snaps and whines, just as you can smell the dead Japanese body that Sledge runs into while digging a foxhole on Okinawa, and just as you can see the fat maggots tumbling out.Sledge may not be one of a kind -- as author or man -- but he's rather special. He quits a program that keeps him in college on his way to becoming an officer, in order to become an enlisted Marine and reach the war that much more quickly. He gets used to seeing his buddies cut gold teeth from the mouths of Japanese soldiers.Yet he's disgusted when an officer goes around urinating into the mouths of the corpses. And wherever he is, he has an eye for nature. Raindrops splashing around a Marine corps remind him of \\"water babies.\\" He's distracted on a patrol by egrets. On Okinawa, when he crosses a clear stream with clean pebbles on the bottom, he thinks about salamanders and crayfish.Sledge survived the war and wound up a professor of biology at a quiet friendly Southern college. One could hardly have wished for a better life for a man who has been through so much.A warning, though. If anyone believes that shooting a wounded, fleeing enemy soldier in the back in battle is revolting, he shouldn't read this book because here it happens all the time."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I would recommend this novel to anyone past, present or future Marines. It is stirring account of the island hopping campaign of world war II."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Excellent read. If you have any one who wants to know what fighting in a war is like - have them read this book. A book I will read again."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"As a narrative piece on the daily life of a marine foot-solider in the Pacific in WWII, this contribution by E.B. Sledge is unparalleled. The reader is exposed to the minute details and horrors of island and jungle warfare, and the effects of the carnage on the soldier's mind. One is left with the senselessness and futility of war, with so many lives blown into oblivion fighting for their country.As this account is told from the perspective of an enlisted mortarman, I found that you never fully saw the bigger picture - often times the author would be supporting the advance with mortars from the rear, and would only find out what happened second hand when the fighting was over. Being a junior rank as well, he was never privvy to the strategy and macro view of the actions the company was taking part in - time and time again, they just did what they were told by their NCOs as they moved from one place to another.That said, you will find details mentioned in the book that are often omitted from other historical accounts that paint broader strokes. The writing is rich in detail, unassuming presented with no pretense and one can't help but be drawn into world of the author."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I first learned about E.B. Sledge, nicknamed Sledgehammer, from the book, The Pacific, and the HBO miniseries of the same name. For years I've had an unexplainable interest in everything military and particularly WW2. I've watched innumerable movies, documentaries, history channel episodes and such, but not until I read this book did I realize that I never understood what our infantry men had to endure during WW2. Sledgehammer writes prose that is straight forward and easy to read. You quickly find yourself seeing everything vividly as he experienced it. I should warn you that this book is not for the faint at heart. It is an honest first hand account that describes in vivid detail many horrors of war - but if you want to understand what it was like to serve in an infantry unit as Sledgehammer did during some of the most brutal Pacific campaigns of WW2, this book is a must read."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Eugene Sledge's account of his service with the 1st Marine Division on Peleliu and Okinawa is simultaneously inspiring and heart-wrenching. To read of what these young men endured and accomplished in the faithful service of their country, with the perspective of 60 years of hindsight, is occasionally overwhelming in its poignancy and intensity.Sledge served his country well, both as a Marine in WWII and subsequently, with the publication of this classic account of men at war. It is an account that will endure and will remain indelible in the minds of all who have read it."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This is a book that should be read along with Robert Leckie'sHelmet for My Pillow: From Parris Island to the Pacific. Sledge covers his experiences prior to volunteering for the US Marine Corps, boot camp, and the battles he experienced in the pacific war. One difference between this book and Helmet for My Pillow: Leckie's book came out in 1947, while Sledge's book came out in 1981. So, I thought Leckie's writing reveals how close in time the war was to him, while Sledge's book reflects the reality of the war that was embedded in his memory. Also, Sledge missed the early part of the Pacific War, while Leckie missed the latter part. Both are excellent books."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Inspirational, showing true power of human spirit, and its ability to overcome even the worst hardships of war and post traumatic thoughts. Sledge shows the true heroes of our past, average men, put in extraordinary positions."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I enjoy first-hand accounts of what the war was actually like, and this is the best book I've read along those lines. What comes across after a while is that there are just no words to adequately descibe the feelings, emotions, and sights that these men had to come to grips with and endure. It is also very good at describing what it's like to hump ammo and supplies through the mud as part of the day to day routine of a frontline Marine, and having to forgo sleep and food for days on end if you wanted to survive. Things like that, that are never mentioned in other books or movies, are what make this book unique. You definitely won't be disapointed with this well written personal account of hell on earth. I've given 2 copies as gifts since reading it."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"E.B. Sledge's \\"With the Old Breed\\" is an outstanding and unforgettable book. Sledge writes in such a unique style that is so easy to read and keeps you turning the pages. The descriptions of his experiences are utterly vivid and give the reader a glimpse into the horror, fear and confusion that war actually is. The dedication and bravery of these many veterans is truly unbelievable. These guys are genuine heroes. Any reader who has never endured combat will develop a different opinion of what war is really like and will discover in themselves a new found honor and respect for those that served this country in such an unselfish way. \\"With the Old Breed\\" made it clear to me that there is no way to ever fairly repay these veterans for the sacrifices that they personally made in maintaining the liberties and freedoms we so casually enjoy in the United States.I cannot recommend this book highly enough!! Read it and you will understand."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"He has a nice touch to his writing style, kept amazing records and knew when to detail things out.

Basis for the television mini-series, \\"The Pacific\\"."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"The book, \`With the Old Breed' by E.B. Sledge, is a descriptive book describing the stink, gore mud and maggots of the dead littering the battle fields of the USA Pacific Island campaigns; the strategy of island-hopping all the way to Japan. Most books on the WWII do not describe in detail the stink and hamburger-red flesh littering a battle field - especially after a day in the hot tropical sun; this book does.Sledge was a newly minted Marine when he entered battle on the island of Peleliu (Pel' - e - lu). The battle for Peleliu has not received as much attention as say Iwo Jima, but was every bit a vicious battle. Sledge survived the Hell Hole of Peleliu .Sledge was again sent into battle; Okinawa, April 1945. The Japanese by that time had given up the Banzai charges used earlier against the Marines. They had retreated into numerous mountainous caves on Okinawa. The Marines fought uphill into murderous fire from Japanese weapons; carnage does not describe the gore of cave battles. By the first of August,Okinawa was in US hands. Sledge survived. On the 8th of August, the US dropped the first A-Bomb. Japan Surrendered 15th August 1945."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This is a wonderful book written by an extraordinary man who fought in WWII for our freedom. This book was used is some part to make the HBO miniseries \\"The Pacific\\", which I also highly recommend. I had a hard time finding this book at book stores, so I tried Amazon, and sure enough they had it! It was very reasonably priced and was delivered to me very quickly by Amazon."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Eugene Sledge's memoirs is everything you want to know about the battles at Peleliu and Okinawa - and more. He gives such insight and detailed information from a first-hand point of view that you literally FEEL that you're on those islands with him, fighting by his side and seeing all the death and gore and blood with your own eyes. That's how great his narrative is, that's how real the book feels. He doesn't over romantise or sugar-coat his battles, he delivers them as raw as possible as a person who's been there and done that. It feels raw, and it feels real.This is truly an astounding book and everyone interested should read it! You'll even feel bonded to the men of K/3/5 and have a sense of esprit de corps, which is so often emphasised by Sledge in the book."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"If you are interested in the day to day life of combat infantry then this is the book for you. It has nothing about strategy of the war. It is a personal account of life on the front lines in the most brutal battles of WWII. It is an excellent read. I could not put it down."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"There were so many positive reviews here, and over 400 oveerall, I had to check this book out; and I'm glad I did.\\"Sledgehammer\\" may have lived to tell the tale but you can feel the mental strain it put on him for years and years. At least he was totally honest about everything, which seems to be the main selling point of the book.This is as real account - which includes a number of topics rarely addressed in other WWII books, movies and documentaries. When it's over, you almost feel exhausted even though the experience was strictly vircarious....and you get an incredibly clear picture of the horrors of war and what it can do to men."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This book encapsulates the great hardships that American soldiers endured to protect \\"WORLD\\" freedom.What our troops went through to help liberate Europe and the westernPacific from brutal,tyrannical invaders was noble in every way and no apologies are required, as some would suggest. Mr.Sledge is very clear in his condemnation of war, yet is highly cognizant that it was the stubborn nature of the fascist Japanese empire that led to far more human suffering than was necessary tobring the conflict to an end. It was obvious from the huge loss of life on Guadalcanal and Okinawa that the A-bombs prevented even more senseless suffering and dying had we had to invade the Japanese mainland by conventional means.An excellent book from start to end."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"With the Old Breed by E.B. SledgeThis book is rated at almost FIVE STARS with over 400 ratings. I am not sure what I saycan matter if that doesn't convince you this book is a must read. Nonetheless, I willtry to explain from the common man's point of view why this book is a page turner.I usually list the 2 best things and the 2 worst things about the book and I willcontinue that here.The Best part about this book1) It was written completely by someone who was at the war. THis is his experiancewithout the bigger picture reference or that attempt to convey anything else but hisview of a war that everyone has heard about but few know details about. He allows thereader to experiance it thru his eyes and he does it as if the reader is a good friendso he pulls no punches.2) He tells the story with little emphasis on how he felt about things afterwards. As anavid reader of history books, I usually prefer the ones that are first person to get afeel for the war and then the broad analyzing books for a look at the strategy. I am nota fan of the 1st person books that get side tracked by a interjecting of the authorsopinion of the strategy. It seems to take away from the 1st person feel of the book. Itell you that to tell you this, With the Old Breed has non-of that. It is a straightshoiting book about what it was like to fight in the island hopping campaigns of thePacific. Even the debate of the Peleliu battle is addreessed by simply stating it is apoint of disagreement. Sledgehammer (EB Sledge's nickname) never gives his opinion, onlyhis experiance. I respect that.Now the Worst part of the book1) It ended. Seriously, the worst part of the book was that it was over. I felt like Ihad just started it when it was over. I wish he had written more about certain timeslike on his trip form the US to the war aboard the ship. This time period received fewpages, while I appriciated what it did say, I wished this topic and others were exploredmore deeply.2) The one thing that did make me want to skip some pages was when the mundand detailsdragged on every now and then. This only happened a few times and it is to the credit ofthe author that this is the only thing I could say was remotely negative about the book.This book is really a classic piece on the Pacific Campaign thru the eyes of a frontlinecombat soldier."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I haven't read many books lately that make me want to keep reading - this is one of them. For me, I finished this book in record time. The last book I read took me well over two months of airports and Sunday mornings to complete and it was pretty good. This one I actually took time to read, that's how engrossing it was.What Sledge does with his memoirs is simply tell a good story. He doesn't gloss over things or embellish, he merely tells his version of what happened to him and his buddies during several hard fought yet forgotten battles in our history. He also tries to impress upon the reader the foolishness that war is full of glory - it isn't - just a lot of killing on both sides for reasons some would say are rather foolish. Sledge was profoundly changed by the war and you can see that in his writings. I am saddened that this man lived very close to me when I was in Birmingham and I never knew he existed. I wish I had as I would have liked to take to him before he left us.Like many new readers, my introduction into WWII history was strictly the European front. It's funny because my dad served in the Army and fought in New Guinea during the war but his lack of speaking about it and Hollywood's lack of coverage led me to brush it off. My interest was piqued by Flags of Our Fathers and went from there. I was amazed at the Japanese sense of war and honor and what a terrible foe they must have been. God help any like Sledge and Dad who had to face them. If you're looking for history from the viewpoint of a foot soldier this is your book.If you're Army, like me and Dad, you'll be a little upset at the lack of respect Sledge seem to give the Army by failing to capitalize their name as opposed to always using a capital \\"M\\" for Marine. Call it picayune but at first I thought it an oversight then it started to irritate me very much. The Army fought just as hard and had just as much \\"esprit de corps\\" as any other branch of the service. All due respect to the Marines but they don't have any lock on greatness. At any rate, you won't be sorry if you get a copy for your library."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Frequently called a classic, this book uniquely presents war from the foot soldier's perspective. For those of us who have never served, it describes in detail the revulsion of war. Many works tend to glamorize the battles, but this does just the opposite. So much so that at times, it seems that Sledge, who never rose above Private, concentrates too hard on showing the horror of war. Yet that obviously was the reason for his book and in that he succeeded. R.V. Burgin, another NCO who was also in the same company as Sledge, found him to be too hard on Officers. The book is obviously written from a strong point of view that war is nasty, brutal and life in it is usually short. It is hard to disagree with that. I would recommend this book only to serious students of WWII as the casual reader will be disenchanted."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"If you read only half the book you have read the book. It is a day-to-day, battle-to-battle account of part of WWII in the Pacific. The raw and valorous emotions and acts in the face of fear are graphically shocking, deeply depressing and, except for some behavioral mishaps, proudly honorable.This is almost a diary--yes, the author forbiddenly took notes--that carries you into battle, causes you to flinch, and fills you with empathy for the survivors of these hellish battles and grief for the honorable dead.The pattern of the book tends to unfold repetitiously and predictably. Nevertheless, the writing style draws the reader along at a fast pace. The print is tiny, so bump that 300 pages to 600 for some other books. The only real negative I have of the book is that most of the pictures could have been left out since they are either so poorly reproduced or very war-time generic."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This is a great book for those who enjoy military history.

Eugene Sledge gives a very accurate portrayal of the difficulties he had while serving with the Marines during the battles of Peleliu and Okinawa while with the 1st Marine Division. He adequately writes about the struggles we had with both the Japanese troops and the mud during the rainy season on Okinawa. I also read Sledge's story about his time served in North China following WW2. A worthwile read about a young man from Georgia who dropped out of college to enlist in the Marines for the war in the Pacific during WW2.

Covers a lot of ground. The author's affinity for hyperbole is irritating, leading me to think he wrote with a thesaurus in one hand and a dictionary of obscure references in the other. There are words in this tome that I have never seen or heard."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I highly respect Eugene Sledge and his service to our country. Read that sentence again, please. Sledge was not in a rifle platoon, which I should have realized and thought more about as I began reading this book. I found myself more often than not wanting to read about these campaigns from the perspective of a man in a rifle platoon. Most of the time Sledge was one to several hundred meters behind the assault platoons...supporting them....doing his job. The point of this review is to convey this point clearly to those who might be disappointed as I was. I have nothing negative to say about Eugene, his writing style, or the structure of the work. Ultimately, I found this book a little boring, more an account of front line living conditions, instead of front line action. I will be attacked by Sledgeites who will call me insane and state that Eugene was on the front lines. Again, I would only make the distinction that he was not in a rifle platoon, thus he had a different vantage point as a mortor man. I should have understood this better before I read the book, but was persuaded by the many 5 star reviews and failed to do my research."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This is an incredible CHRONOLOGICAL account of the Pacific War,A CLASSIC, and Eugene is an INTELLECTUAL man of Great Modesty ...This Book is the \\"REAL DEAL \\" Sledge pulls no punches ...it's Brutal ...it's honest ...it's War like you've never read before ....MANS TOTAL ANIMALISTIC FEROCITY .....Only the AMERICAN MARINES could have fought and WON this War ...no other Country had the Primal Urge for Victory like the U.S.A....True the Eastern front was Savage ...but a Conventional Land Battle is no comparision to Seaborne Warriors Landing on Secured Beachheads and fighting for every grain of Sand inch by inch against an Enemy who had NEVER tasted Defeat in the whole History of there Country ......for the EMPEROR there GOD ....BUSHIDO....KAMIKAZE....BANZAI CHARGES ...it's all in this MASTERPIECE ."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"The purchase was quick easy and quick, Thanks Amazon.My husband has wanted information on the Battle for Okinawa as his great uncle earned a Purple Heart there in April of 1945."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I've been wanting to read this book since The Pacific debued on hbo. E.B. Sledge \\"Sledgehammer\\" is a great writter and he nailed EXACTLY how we Marines think. His descriptions are so vivid, you would swear you were landing on Peleliu with him. His words are great, it can be a tear jerker at times but that makes it great. I'm sure E.B. Sledge would be happy that another Marine thinks highly of this book. I actually thinking about reading it again. Semper fi Sledgehammer!"},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"E.B. Sledge wrote what has to be the finest all around memoir of the human experience in war. Because of his research, combined with his own experiences, it has become one of the classics to come out of WWII and of warfare. I did not read this book until watching The Pacific. His descriptions of all he experienced are so vivid I felt as though as was in the foxhole with him. I myself have experienced heat, rain, mud, fear, monotony, and relief. But every time I read accounts like this, I realize how lucky I really am not to have felt all of this to the degree and extremes as the WWII Marine did. Truly great Americans and warriors! Along with Mr. Sledge's personal experience is the great military history that is gleaned from following the campaigns from the \\"grunt's\\" perspective. Even better than Storm of Steel."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This novel is the most humbling literature I have read. Sledge is a simple man telling a remarkable story. This truly is a perfect depiction of what is most certainly the greatest generation. No added details for \\"flash,\\" so while reading this novel you know Sledge based every sentence on his horrific memories. This is a novel every American should read."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I read this book as one of three. I enjoyed watching the HBO/Playtone series \\"The Pacific\\" this spring. So, I read this book, plus two others to get more of the story. It is always difficult to get a feel when we only get one episode a week for 10 weeks. The books help. The other two are, \\"I'll Stay With My Boys\\" (about Medal of Honor winner Sgt. John Basilone) and \\"My Helmet for My Pillow.\\" All three were used as a basis for the series and all three are excellent. After reading all three I will never ever complain about hardship again. These men that fought for our freedom and to defend our country were more than men. They were heros that endured hardships that we will never know about."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"After watching The Pacific I, like many others I suppose, obtained Sledge's memoir to learn more about the Pacific war, particularly the struggles of the Marines. The decisive battles of the Pacific war were fought mostly between aircraft and ships and finally sealed by the actions of a two bombers. Most people know of these events because of the spectacular film footage that has been presented but other than the Marines taking beachheads, the film coverage of their campaigns inland was fairly skimpy. It's understandable. Compared to the tank battles on the Russian front, land campaigns in Europe, massive bombing runs on Germany and the associated dogfights, the struggles of the Marines just didn't rise to the same photogenic level. In fact, most of the action seen by the Marines was close-in combat, sometimes man on man, and always terrifying. These were small unit actions that just didn't lend itself to the needs of the film makers. A disservice to the young Marines who fought and died for their country under the most gruesome of conditions. Sledge's memoir corrects this historical injustice. His relating of the campaigns at Peleliu, particularly Peleliu, and Okinawa are as fine and compelling as any memoir of WWII. To read this account is to understand why the Marines are what they are."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I am not a big book reader, but I decided to read this one after only seeing 3 episodes of \\"The Pacific\\" on HBO. I have not seen the entire HBO series yet.I could not put this book down. Reading Sledge's story of what happened in WWII is truly unreal. I have always appreciated and respected the heck out of all of our Veteran's, but after reading this book, I have developed an extreme new appreciation for the sacrifices they made for us. The simple gruesomeness of the war is something that people couldn't even imagine if they wanted to write a fictional story of the war.I think everyone needs to read this book whether they enjoy war novels or not, because I think everyone needs to know what these men went through. Obviously I have never been in war, but from reading this book, there were a few nights that I literally had nightmares...You will be happy you bought this book."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"You want real combat, read this book.

Sledge's spare recounting of battle, from his point of view as a combat Marine in the Pacific during World War II, is utterly unsentimental and matter-of-fact. Pure and simple, it is the finest tome on the subject that I've ever read."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Eugene was a true American hero and patriot. In his book, Eugene provides a firsthand account of what it was like to be on Peleliu and Okinawa, nothing like I have ever read before. He had a baptism in fire and lived to tell future generations about his World War II experiences. He came from a unique generation, a generation that put it all on the line for me, my family and future generations. It is because of men like Eugene, we are the recipients of inherited freedom.

Based on his personal notes taken during boot-camp and the South and Central Pacific battlefields, it is a most revealing and moving description of the horrors, filthy and senselessness of war.I liked it very much and strongly recommend it for those who are interested in the bibliography for HBO's The Pacific TV series, in which the latter was partially based."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This is the best memoir I've ever read. Highly recommended for those who want an honest insight into combat and a perspective that may alter how you view life in general. \\"China Marine\\" complements this book and is also highly recommended."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"A casual perusal of the several introductions reveals what this book is about: two hellish campaigns of a Marine Corps unit in the Pacific War - Peleliu and Okinawa, written not by a general, a journalist, or what have you, but an enlisted man who fought with the front line troops.I wasn't sure the book would be my cup of tea, but one of my daughters had given it to me as a gift so it went on my stack and was eventually read. That was fortunate, because \\"With the Old Breed\\" conveys the nature, horror, and yet valor of war as poignantly as any I have ever read. The closest parallel I can think of is the battle scenes in the Iliad.Nicknamed \\"Sledgehammer,\\" the author survived both campaigns without being killed, wounded, or driven beyond the bounds of sanity. He was one of few that could say that. The story he tells is gripping, vivid, and fascinating. I couldn't put it down.The cast of characters includes wonderful officers and dreadful ones, grizzled veterans and replacements who had no idea of what it would be like when the \\"stuff hit the fan\\" (some adapted and survived, others perished quickly). And the fanatical savagery and ingenuity of the Japanese foes is conveyed as well; clearly, suicide missions are not a new invention. If only to survive, the U.S. Marines developed their own form of savagery.My maternal grandfather was a Marine Corps officer, and although I don't remember him there was a saying in the family that I absorbed as a child: \\"Don't kid the shock troops.\\" After reading this book, I can better appreciate what this means."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This book is a highly commendable account of intense warfare. To his credit Eugene Sledge demonstrated noteworthy diplomacy on many subjects where there are mixed opinions. This was particularly evident when he cited historians perspectives on some of the more debatable objectives of the Pacific Theater of War, such as taking Peleliu. Sledge also provides excellent insight into how morality can be skewed by heavy combat. I found him to be a respectful narrator, which no doubt was constructed by a fine upbringing and good education. It is imperative for all of us to remember that the sacrifice American military personnel made in the Pacific, was greater than any other country. This phenomenal effort was well told by Sledge, and his memoir is an honourable record of his personal experience, and that of his many comrades who gave their lives for the protection of freedom.Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author"},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"There are many other great reviews of this excellent book already in place, but having finished it, I felt moved to write my own. I can only imagine how horrific it must be to serve on the frontline in any war. Some books convey that horror better than others. Guy Sajer's iconic account of WW2 German army life on the Russian front,The Forgotten Soldier, is without doubt one of the best. But this book can stand proudly, four square alongside it.The author, Eugene Sledge, kept illicit notes of his experiences on the islands of Pelelieu and Okinawa, and later used them to write this book. Written in an unassuming but compelling way, it lays out in horrifying detail the depravities of modern war, and the depths to which man can stoop when surrounded by utter carnage. Those with weak stomachs, stay away. I still have some of the images that I read about engraved in my mind's eye. Yet the book is not just about violence. It's also about the comradeship and love that the soldiers felt for each other, and the humor they used to help them survive.It's an incredible read. I heard about the book because of the HBO miniseriesThe Pacific. I'm currently reading another book, written by a contemporary of Sledge's, Robert Leckie.Helmet for My Pillowis another absorbing read, although it's written in an entirely different style. Like other reviewers, I've also wondered why there aren't more accounts of WW2 by British soldiers. I've read the brilliantRailway Manby Eric Lomax, but not seen much else. Thanks to Amazon's lists, I've recently come acrossFirst Light, an account of the Battle of Britain, by Geoffrey Wellum, a former RAF fighter pilot. I aim to read it soon, and hope and expect that it will live up to the American books.Ben Kane, author of The Forgotten Legion."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I loved Band of Brothers, and eagerly looked forward to its companion mini-series, The Pacific. But I found that fine follow-up presentation overshadowed by this riveting, absorbing, exceptionally well-written account of what it was like to fight as a Marine in the Pacific. \\"Sledgehammer\\" authored, for me, an unforgettable book describing the hell of war from the perspective of soldiers mired in mud and constant rain, fighting for their lives and country, enduring an interminable battle for island territory. Eugene Sledge brings you right to the battlefield, and shares the courage, bravery and incredible spirit of the Marines, page after fascinating page. A very highly recommended book if you're interested in the Pacific theater of war."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Riveting and right on target as to what a Marine in combat experiences. As our World War II veterans are passing on daily, this book can't help but make you stop and thank all of them in your thoughts for the sacrifices they made so we can live in our USA today."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"When I graduated High School in 1980 WWII vets were mostly guys in their late 50's and 60's, a little younger than my grandparents. Now as they vanish from the scene what a privilege it was to come alongside one of those great men and here his story first hand via my very 21st century Kindle. Although I was never in combat and served in a Corps 30 years removed from that great war, I recognized his descriptions of Esprit de Corps, drill instructors, training and discipline."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Sledge's description of what he and his fellow Marines experience in the Pacific fighting the Japanese is one of the best autobiographies I have ever read. This is the real story and horror of war, not the dressed up versions you see in the usual Hollywood movies. This book gave me a new appreciation for men and women who fight our wars. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"A Southern gentleman wanted to serve in World War II after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. He joined the Marines as \\"cannon fodder\\" but became a skilled and highly trained mortarman who survived the war physically, not so well mentally. The latter took time. Sledge's training was in the old-school manner: abusive, tough, and as honorable as the Marines of the 'old school/breed.' In one of his own footnotes re: training, E.B. Sledge wrote: In the postwar years, the Marine Corps came in for a great deal of undeserved criticism, in my opinion, from well-meaning persons who did not comprehend the magniture of stress and horror that combat can be...Men must be trained realistically if they are to survive...without breaking mentally and physically (p. 41).\\"E. B. Sledge's book is a memoir of the war from a regular, enlisted man's view--giving it much credibility nad poignance as he watches the war slaughter good men who might have contributed much to society and the world had they not been called to duty or enlisted to keep the world free from authoritarian regimes. He kept notes in his battered New Testament, encased in a plastic bag taken from a Japanese soldier who had died. He struggled with the cruelty he witnessed, the degradation of fellow soldiers on both sides; and his book is as much an indictment of war as was All Quiet on the Western Front. Sledge went on to contribute greatly to our world by earning higher degrees and teaching at the University of Montevallo, AL. A fellow Mobilian am I; as well as a teacher...and even though Dr. Sledge indicts war, he ends with this profound statement which I believe is the thesis of his work: \\"Until the millenium arrives and countries cease trying to enslave others, it will be necessary to accept one's responsibilities and to be willing to make sacrifices for one's country--as my comrades did...With privilege goes responsibility.\\"One more thought: The war in Europe generally receives all the press, used in the movies, and so forth, but the battles in the Pacific were just as horrible against an AXIS power as the more well-known European war. Mobile, AL, contributed much to the war effort, particularly in terms of ships--it was even the subject in movie houses in a twelve minute news report called War Town. Between New Orleans and Mobile, much of the machinery of war was built and launched--e.g., the Higgins boats which figure prominently in the story. Today, in New Orleans, stands the National D-Day Museum which covers not only what happened in Europe but now has a new wing devoted to those who served in the Pacific Theatre. Sledge's two books, the works of Robert Leckie and several others provided the basis of Hanks/Spielberg's HBO film, The Pacific, and Ken Burns' The War. I highly recommend all of these."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This book is worth your time. One man's horrifying experience as told from the front lines of WWII Pacific war battles. With the Old Breed by E.B. Sledge is a rare glimpse into what the war in the Pacific was really like for the Marines who fought there during World War II. Told in an unflinching, no holds barred narrative, E.B. Sledge gives the reader a front row seat into the island war fought by US Marines. It is nothing short of brilliant, extremely honest, and as heart and gut wrenching as one could possibly stomach. Many war memoirs and narratives are told from the perspective of officers and, most specifically, colonels and generals. E.B. Sledge speaks from the perspective of someone who actually fought in the war, the beach assaulting, front line U.S. Marine. With the Old Breed has been recognized by the U.S. Marine Corps as a solid example of what actually happened at Peleliu and Okinawa. It is endorsed by several upper echelon Marine officers, and has been used in the training of officers.If you want to find out what it was really like to have waged the Pacific Campaign of 1942-1945, you need look no further than With the Old Breed. It is more than a memoir, it is actually a historical reference. Throughout the book Sledge supplies us with photos, footnotes that give added detail, and additional comments by Marine Corps leaders who were there. But the book does not come across as a text, it is told from a personal perspective, from someone who actually experienced two intensive campaigns, face to face with the enemy night and day. The fear, the over-bearing, all encompassing fear is related to us in terms any man or woman could understand, brilliantly conveyed.Reading With the Old Breed along with Robert Leckie's Helmet For My Pillow will give you an additional and worthy reading experience. Both men volunteered for the U.S. Marines and were proud to have served in the war as Marines. But both men took away a very different and negative experience of having been in the war. Reading the two books back to back gives an interesting glimpse into what it must have really been like. Sheer terror comes through in both books. Both books were also used by the producers to weave the triad experience of three different Marines from the beginning of the Pacific war until the final day."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"I have wanted this book for some time.

Straight talk about the conditions for a Marine private."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"E. B. Sledge wrote one of the best war memoirs to come out of WWII, or any other war. Not as \\"intellectual\\" as William Manchester's more literary \\"Goodbye, Darkness: A Memoir of the Pacific War.\\" But perhaps more powerful for its more simple, straight forward, narrative.I recommend both books for anyone wanting to better understand \\"what it was really like.\\" But I believe that Sledge's presentation of the Okinawa campaign gets the reader closer to the real horror of war.On the lighter side, Sledge's discussion of the land crabs and other amenities of Pavuvu reminded me of some of the \\"war stories\\" I have heard from other 1st Mar Div veterans of that famous Marine Corps \\"battle\\" for which no combat ribbons were awarded. And which they \\"fondly\\" recall at every opportunity."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Much has been said about the impact of the film \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" towards bringing the realities of war home to the general public. I must disagree because in the end, the medium of film cannot help but to be stirring; film is by its very nature is \\"sensational.\\" The personal memoir is a much more effective means of transmitting the experience of combat -- the confusion, horror, terror, and sheer filth of it all. WITH THE OLD BREED is unique in that it is a personal memoir written a (very intelligent and introspective) enlisted Marine. There a multitudinous memoirs by officers, and they can't help but have a \\"gung ho\\" flavor to them. WITH THE OLD BREED avoids all that, and focuses on the sheer physicality and brutality of war.I cannot recommend this book strongly enough to anyone who wants to know what battle is really like, and why we should think long and hard before sending our sons off to kill or be killed."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"What a wonderful gift from my loving wife of 42 years, Marilyn. My name is Bob McKnight, I am aged 65, served in the U.S. Army on Japan's southernmost big island, Kyushu, less than 11 years after Japan's surrender. Thanks to brave people like Dr Sledge, I found fewer American soldiers' graves there!This book has touched my very soul. I was riveted to each page by Dr Sledge's gripping, piercing, engrossing words... words that kept slapping me in the face with the realization that these young men were experiencing a living hell!.. And they were doing it so that young boys like me would be able to enjoy a better world when we grew up! I an fortunate to be a native of Florida's panhandle and am quite familiar with Mobile, Marion Institute, Auburn University, Montevallo, as well as The University of Florida (my alma mater) where Dr Sledge grew up and excelled.I recommend this book, not as a 'war' novel, but as a textbook for all young people in the United States. Dr Sledge has taught us 'how' to live.. to grow up.. to deal with adversity and all sorts of unpleasantness.. how important teamwork is.. to love.. to laugh.. to cry.. to accept responsibility.. to strive for success!

I read this book after reading &quot;Wartime&quot; by Paul Fussell who recommends it as the best singular account of the realities of combat. It is a very detailed, gritty account of the war through the eyes of a man who survived two extremely brutal battles. The descriptions of the battlefields he fought in and the wreckage of the aftermath are priceless and hard to find in other history books. This is a great read for someone who has never been in battle or the Marines and wants to know what it's REALLY like. It's also a great warning to those who might want start a war that will involve someone else's sons and daughters...."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"E.B. Sledge tells what it's like to fight, day after day, not knowing if you'll be wounded, maimed, killed at any moment, just going on and doing the worst job in the world -- because it has to be done, because your country needs you. I second the notion that this should be required reading in every high school, to let our youth know how evil war can be -- and how sometimes it's necessary.I've never had to experience anything like the horrors Sledge and his comrades endured.

Highly recommend reading this book."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This is a rivetting read and an insight into the mind of a good young American marine who was very lucky to have survived the war. It confirms my view that the US Army is far more complacent about throwing men into battle regardless of the cost in life. This is in comtrast to the British who, with a fifth of the US population, can't afford to waste humans.The book also makes one question - more earnestly than does the author - the necessity, after the summer of 1945, of invading the islands (and suffering horrendous losses). Some islands could well have been bypassed and blockaded - especially as, by then, the American government knew it was about to unleash the ultimate weapon.I give it four stars bcs it tended to be repetitive."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"Very hard to put this book down.

This story of our Marines giving their all for each other and their country, told with openness, honesty, and without bombast, has affected me in that way not once but a number of times. E. B. Sledge came through the fierce fighting against the Japanese on the Pacific islands of Peleliu and Okinawa, without being wounded although not without the deeper scars only troops who have been in combat can attest to. The book is more a tribute to his comrades and the Marine Corps than it is a history of the war. Sledge tells us that \\"war is brutish, inglorious, and a horrible waste\\". This book is the basis of the HBO miniseries, The Pacific."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"This is a story written by the author who was there. He reveals the story of war in all its gory, not glory."},{"Title":"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa","review":"E.B. Sledge has written a fantastic first person account of his service with the First Marines in World War II and the battles he participated in with that storied outfit at Peleliu and Okinawa. This is an important book for two reasons. First, the American soldier is rendered as a figure due even higher esteem for the hell he endured in Pacific fighting. Second, any notion of war as a romantic or gloried enterprise for those fighting and dying is stripped away entirely.Sledge, inevitably perhaps nicknamed Sledgehammer by his fellow soldiers, left officer candidate school at college in order to take a much quicker route to the fighting via the enlisted ranks. He was somewhat out of character for a typical recruit (though a large number of his ROTC fellows did the same at his school) in that he came from wealth (his father was a physician) and had been exposed to a more genteel form of life growing up than that which characterized his comrades. This did not place any barriers between Sledge and those he would fight and live with for two years in some of the worst hell seen by U.S. forces during World War II. It did, perhaps, give him the desire and ability to keep notes of his experience in the pages of a New Testament he carried with him thus providing the possibility of this important book.I have read many memoires of soldiers from different wars. Perhaps it was easier to see war as romance for those who fought and survived in set piece battles like Monmouth or Gettysburg. Death and destruction certainly reigned at those fields of battle, but at least the troops could count on relief after a brief close encounter with the enemy (hours to a few days). Then it was back to camp where relative safety could be found. At Peleliu and Okinawa, Sledge and his fellow Marines were in constant contact with the Japanese for months at a time saving brief respites in reserve in areas that were often still in artillery range of their enemy.Sledge spares nothing in what seems to be a very accurate description of life during those battles. This includes rotting and maggot infested dead as well as battlefields and foxholes overrun with human waste from front lines that often did not move for weeks at a time. Their enemy, pledged en mass not to surrender, had to be shot, shelled, burned and dug out of caves and emplacements. Nighttime brought even greater stress as the Japanese relied heavily on infiltration tactics where individual soldiers would crawl under cover of darkness toward our lines in hopes of knifing or shooting a couple of Americans in their foxholes before being put down. Thus, sleep did not come easily or in long periods for Sledge and his fellow Marines. No white flag that would cause Japanese soldiers to rise from their bunkers and surrender as a coherent force when it was obvious they could not prevail and were out of provisions could be counted on. Just the extermination man by man of a foe determined to die for his emperor and the resulting increased casualties rooting out the enemy to the last entailed for Americans. Sledge gives the incredible statistic that some 8,000 Japanese soldiers were killed in these operations on Okinawa after American forces controlled the entirety of the island above ground - and many extra American lives were the price of this fanatical devotion to \\"no surrender.\\"I found the book riveting. It is well written, but the detail of the experience Sledge and his fellow Marines endured in fighting for his country is astounding and ought to be read by anyone who thinks war romantic or a high ideal in any way. It is amazing what our soldiers were willing to endure in wresting the Pacific back from the Japanese - they did it with excellent discipline and maintained a fighting edge even when wracked by lack of supplies, constant rain and / or oppressive heat, battle fatigue and the accumulation of wounds, sores and ailments due to lengthy exposure to battle - and always with the knowledge that their foe was not one who could be maneuvered into retreat but a hardened adversary who had to be taken out where they were found at great cost in blood."},{"Title":"The 3 A.M.

This book has been my favorite in all of my collection.Meaning: It's damn good."},{"Title":"The projection of the astral body (Collector's library of the unknown)","review":"Along Robert Monroe's work, this is widely considered one of the classic books on the subject. This book is an interesting read IF you are looking for very technical parascience that discusses nitpicky details about questions such as \\"is the astral body made of etheric magnetism or magnetic ether\\" (note- I made that bit up, but it's really not far off from the approach taken in this book). This book may useful if you are researching historical texts from the early 1900's, perhaps associated with Theosophy and Spiritualism.I personally could not find value in this book, because it is essentially an attempt to look at astral projection from a scientific lens. This in itself is interesting, because in our scientific age many people seem to feel a need to find \\"empirical scientific evidence\\" to justify their ideas about things that may simply be beyond the senses, i.e. \\"extra sensory\\". [if you are wondering why this might be, I would very strongly recommend reading \\"SSOTBME\\" by Ramsey Dukes... look into it]If you find it interesting to read about other peoples experiences with astral projection, I hesitantly say you may find this book interesting. I hesitate because it is a very slow, dry and boring read, and if you simply want to read tales about otherworldly phenomena you may prefer Monroe's books...My ultimate recommendation, though, is to avoid these books altogether and actually try to get some practical experience of astral projection. Why do you really want to read about other people's experiences , when you could be having your own? These books are definitely not very practical, no matter what claims they may make. Their \\"practical\\" elements are primarily based on looking into the different \\"vibratory states\\" your etheric body undergoes during the process of separation from your body. Pfffft. How useful is that? The overly technical and outdated language of this book makes it absolutely pale in comparison to any other information you can get about how to actually astral project (or if you are unsuccessful, to at least have lucid dreams)... there is no shortage of info on the internet and more recent and more practical books are available.HERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF INFO ABOUT HOW TO ASTRAL PROJECT...First of all, it is important to keep it simple, because the more you think the harder it is to project. Ironically, this means that it will be harder to project if you have read a lot about it, because your mind will be clouded by preconceived notions and a bunch of expectations.The most important elements are: awareness, relaxation, and concentration.Start by remembering your dreams every day, by recalling them when you wake up and writing them down in a journal. The more you remember your dreams, the more you will dream (I didn't dream for about 8 years, until I started this practice, which has helped me have at least 3 dreams a day, and usually several lucid dreams every week... now is a good time to point out that smoking pot will make you unable to dream). It is helpful to look over your dreams occasionally, preferably before you go to sleep. Also, before falling asleep try to go over everything that has happened to you throughout the day, because this helps you to increase your memory of your dreams. You will likely notice that you can only remember things you have paid attention to, which leads us to our next step...Pay attention to as much as possible throughout the day. The more aware you are while awake, the more aware you will be while asleep. This helps you have lucid dreams. Try to think as little as possible during the day, instead be aware of your senses... \\"thought is an obstacle to conscious astral projection\\" (a quote from Samael Aun Weor). Meditation is very helpful, but meditation must be carried through your entire day to be effective, so simply be aware at all times. Put down that book and notice the world around you!Then work on concentration, one of the two essential elements for astral projection. Meditation is extremely helpful. In particular, try to clear you mind and be aware of your entire physical body. Being aware throughout the day helps develop this ability. Two meditation exercises that help with astral projection: concentration on your heartbeat (if you persist, you will be easily able to feel you heart beating), and concentration on a mantra. Then, when you are trying to project you can do this meditation...THE BASIC PRINCIPLE UNDERLYING ASTRAL PROJECTION IS THAT YOU MAINTAIN CONCENTRATION THROUGH THE POINT OF FALLING ASLEEP.If you are concentrating on your heartbeat or a mantra, and fall asleep without drifting off into other thoughts, you can astral project.Also helpful, for refining your technique, is visualization. Visualization is an essential tool for any magic, and apparently the astral plane is the realm where most magical work takes place, so you may find yourself interested in faaaarrrrr more than you initially considered when researching astral projection.Very helpful is the ability to visually recall an object in perfect detail, and then to visualize an entire room. This is part of the principle behind projecting to a particular place... so, imagination and willpower are two essential elements involved in astral projection.In lucid dreaming and astral projection, you will discover a lot about your self and you mind. How much of your dreams are projections of your mind (subjective), and how much is \\"actually there\\" (objective)? Does the astral plane (or even our physical world) \\"really exist\\"?One reason this book may be useful is simple... it is easier to astral project when you are determined, and when you are reading about it you may find yourself more determined.Books about dreaming/astral travel I recommend are: Astral Travel and Dreams (Samael Aun Weor), Tibetan Yogas of Dream and Sleep (Tenzin Wangyal), and Realities of the Dreaming Mind (Swami Sivananda Radha)."},{"Title":"The projection of the astral body (Collector's library of the unknown)","review":"This book really is as good as everyone says in their reviews.

It takes a lot of beating."},{"Title":"The projection of the astral body (Collector's library of the unknown)","review":"After reading this book several times and having it ingrained in my consciousness, I am now able to *almost* project while I am semi-conscious. The techniques in this book are very helpful in that regard. Before, I did not have this ability, and until recently, I was not able to see clearly, with eyes closed, so to speak, when I was semi-conscious. I look forward to reading the book again, but I must make a few comments about the style of the writing, and the potential danger of the exercises and techniques:-1 star for the following:1) Muldoon has a somewhat contentious and vainglorious style where he sometimes makes light of other psychic's writings, the silliness of the neighbors, and even of his own Mother. He scoffs at the warnings of psychics who say that projecting one's phantom could be dangerous. I grew tired of the constant admonitions and braggart attitude after a while. But if you want to learn how to project, this is *the* \\"Astral Projection Bible\\", if you can see through the stunts and apply the techniques to yourself spiritually, without all of the hubris.2) One must note, on a related tangent, that Mr. Muldoon himself met an early death due to some sickness (as the editor notes), and was barely able to complete the book. So, while I'm thankful that the book was published, because it changed my perceptions of projecting, and I have no basis in fact in saying that his illness was because of his practice of lowering his bodily defenses so he could project; I am still a bit of a skeptic that it isn't dangerous, and to me it seems like a possibility that he may have harmed himself during this activity and died of a sickness that he caught because his defenses were lowered, possibly due to exhaustion. But again, this premise has no basis in fact.*Summary: Good work; highly detailed; great commentary to start. Better than today's over-refined attitudes and reliance on hypnosis. Only 4 stars for being a little 'too' irreverant--and potentially dangerous."},{"Title":"The projection of the astral body (Collector's library of the unknown)","review":"One of the classic, lots of books after that are just a repeat of what is in it!!!

While these books describe the where, Culture Shock-Hungary supplies the who, what, why and how of the magnificent Magyars.The 2003 New Expanded edition is a joy to read. It's fast paced and lively- a real page turner. It made me laugh out loud several times. The last time I laughed so much while reading a book was when I read &quot;Confederacy of Dunces&quot; some twenty years ago. If this book wasn't part of the Culture Shock series, it may well have been called A Confederacy of Magyars. Read and delight in the sections on Traditions and Values and Image and Self Image to find out.For a foreigner, the part on the Hungarian language, Magyarul, is especially interesting. Having studied Hungarian for a year when I was in the Army and let it slip away because of non-use, the language section rekindled old memories. The study of the enigmatic Hungarian language could well prove to be a lifelong task although it is said that Sissi(emperor Franz Joseph's wife) learned it in no time flat and became the darling of the Hungarians.

Readers are left clues given by the author to help them figure it out. This novel by a proven master (mistress?) of the mystery genre takes a different approach. The sole witness at the scene believes what she saw was a dream, but her later encounter with the murderer draws her into the investigation without her even knowing it. Soon, readers discover who the murderer is, but the race is on for the other characters to make the same discovery, using clues left by the murderer. Do the &quot;good guys&quot; find all the clues in time? You'll have to read it to find out!Not only did I enjoy this mystery novel as a departure from my regular roster of science fiction and fantasy novels, but I also liked the novel as the characters were believable, loveable, and or course, in the case of the &quot;bad guys,&quot; easy to hate.This book is a fast enough and enjoyable enough read for any adult reader, but is also another solid performance by Clark to satisfy her fans and fans of the mystery/suspense drama. Five stars! ** Word to the wary: some themes (abortion, murder, attempted murder) in this book are inappropriate for younger readers, but aren't gory or distastefully presented. **"},{"Title":"The Cradle Will Fall","review":"Mary H. Clark outdid herself when she wrote this one! If you love suspense and mystery, you'll adore &quot;The Cradle Will Fall.&quot; Like in &quot;Stillwatch&quot;, she gives away the killer in the beginning, but that makes it even better! I've read it 3 times and it still makes my heart race when I read it. The main charactor is blind to her obstetrician/genecologist, Dr. Highley's, experiments on his pregnant patients. She has no idea that she is his next victim, until she steps into his operating room.... If you like other Mary H. Clark books,you'll enjoy &quot;The Cradle Will Fall.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Cradle Will Fall","review":"This book was very interesting. When i started it i couldnt put it down. I like the way she keeps you on the edge of your seat and never lets you want to stop reading it! She does an excellent job on the details and its pretty easy to stay on track. I think this is one of her best books!! I just have to stress how well she kept me in this book.. it is full of excitement and you will not want to put it down."},{"Title":"The Cradle Will Fall","review":"This book starts out with a familiar premise: professional woman takes it upon herself to investigate a strange situation. There is a mystery surrounding a well-known gynecologist and abortionist. As the pieces of the puzzle come together, the result is an unusual and gruesome ending. I'm not talking about murder, either. I don't want to give away the ending, but let's just say it borders on science fiction and isn't what you'd expect. If you have a weak stomach, be aware that it's a little graphic. All in all, it's another excellent thriller by the author who does it best."},{"Title":"The Cradle Will Fall","review":"This book was great! Very suspenseful, likable characters. I highly reccommend it!"},{"Title":"The Cradle Will Fall","review":"THE CRADLE WILL FALL IS THE THIRD MARY HIGGINS CLARK BOOK THAT I HAVE READ(THE OTHER TWO WERE MOONLIGHT BECOMES YOU AND YOU BELONG TO ME).

A good story, very suspenseful! The identity of the murderer is known from the beginning which in this case only adds to the suspense.

Clark writes with such detail and keeps you wondering from the beginning of the book all the way to the end.However, I did have to get used to the style she chose in writing this book. (each chapter was told from a different character's point of view)Nevertheless, it was an outstanding book :-)"},{"Title":"The Cradle Will Fall","review":"\\"The Cradle Will Fall\\" by Mary Higgins Clark is by far the best of her first three books. I loved the subject matter and somehow knowing the killer's identity made the book more gripping than in \\"Where Are the Children?\\" (when I had a good idea of the killer's identity early in the book)and \\"A Stranger is Watching.\\"Vangie Lewis is a spoiled, barren woman who goes to a Dr. Edgar Highley--a brilliant OB/GYN--to try and have a baby. Within a few visits, Vangie becomes pregnant. Vangie is never alive in the actual book, though, but is dead by the very beginning. Dr. Highley has just killed her and is taking her to her home to make her death look like a suicide.We soon meet Vangie's husband, Dr. Highley's secretary and a young, widowed woman named Katie deMaio among others. They are all searching for answers. Investigators quickly realize that Vangie did not kill herself, rather someone killed her. Their suspect is Chris Lewis, Vangie's husband. Katie has a feeling that Chris is not the true killer, and her feelings turn out to be right--but not before two other people are killed by Dr. Highley and we learn of more murders that the clever doctor has gotten away with.You will not be disappointed with this excellent book!"},{"Title":"The Cradle Will Fall","review":"THE CRADLE WILL FALL is every woman's worst nightmare! Mary Higgins Clark has taken this frightening idea and woven a tale around a young woman and a villain who creates the most deplorable of acts. This story escalates until the final climax which will leave your heart racing and have you wondering just how much of this tale can actually come true!Some may be asking what could I possibly mean by \\"every woman's worst nightmare\\", well let me give you a few hints without telling the entire story because you really should read this one!The villain in THE CRADLE WILL FALL is an obstetrician-gynecologist who entices women into his care by his track record on fertility. Women come to him with the hopes of fulfilling their dreams to have children. What they don't know is that he is conducting horrific experiments with them. His game begins to unravel when an Oriental child is born to a Caucasian couple. And then the truth becomes public knowledge. Women will empathize with the horror more than men, but I'm sure everyone will cringe at the truth when it is uncovered.THE CRADLE WILL FALL is definitely not one for younger readers and those who are faint of heart. The most ardent mystery lovers will enjoy this book because of it's terrifyingly real content. This is the first Mary Higgins Clark book that I ever read, and I was hooked from the first page. When I finished THE CRADLE WILL FALL, I went the very next morning to get another of her books. It is definitely unexpected, and completely absorbing.

Kathleen DeMaio, an assistant prosecutor, and Richard Carroll, a medical examiner are called to investigate a recent crime scene in which a pregnant woman seems to have committed suicide. They analyze and question several suspects and crime scenes in the case. Through these investigations, Richard realizes that the last person to have come in contact with the deceased woman was Dr. Highly, the victims doctor. Was the crime suicide, or planned murder? Now, Katie, not knowing Richard's conclusions, finds herself in the hospital for surgery. By coincidence, the surgeon is Dr. Highly. What will become of Katie?Mary Higgins Clark is an excellent mystery writer. Her plot is complicated, yet well planned out and suddenly comes together at the end. The story begins a little slow but soon becomes fast-paced and intriguing. Her character's personalities are unique and each one comes to life. I enjoyed the personal relationships that develop throughout the novel as well as their feelings and emotions. Overall, the novel was full of suspense and terror.

The heroine was weak and pathetic. The mystery could have been solved in five minutes if all the people involved had simply talked to each other and the police. It was very annoying watching all the characters stumble through their activities, the people running the investigation clumsily missing obvious clues and botching every interrogation. The concept of the doctor's experiments was far-fetched and of course everything was neatly tied up in the end in a very unrealistic fashion.

It wasn't worth the price"},{"Title":"The Cradle Will Fall","review":"This doctor in the story is quite disturbed, but has excellent taste in food and wine. In fact, I got a warm feeling in my throat as he dined. And a cold one in my stomach as he dragged that poor pregnant corpse across the ice to his trunk. I can see him as kind of glazed over and brilliant. His eyes are dull from frustration, their color darkened from disapointment. It is the act of his art which makes him alive, and the interference of anyone which makes him kill. What can I say?

Not only did it get the detection juices flowing ,but also the survival instincts as well. It might have been better if the killer was not uncovered near the beginning of the book but rather near the end. Every time a new chapter was started there was another surprising turn of events just waiting for the reader. This gave it the suspense needed to hold the reader's attention. Also, changing places and stories each chapter made me want to keep reading so I could find out what was going to happen in one story, and then another story, and another, until I finally got to the end. It would have been nice to find out what happened between Katie and Richard after Katie had recovered from her near death experience, but it was also good to leave the reader making their own conclusions.

When she is in the hospital recovering she looks out the window and sees a man placing a body into the trunk of a car. She cannot tell if she is glancing at an illusion, or if this really happened. When she returns to her daily life, Katie begins her job again. Quickly she starts investigating a suicide, that in her eyes did not seem possible. A man named Richard Carroll, who helps Katy with her investigations, seemed to see a mystery behind the doctor who \\"cures\\" infertile women. These women included the woman who apparently killed herself. Before Richard can tell Katie about his discovery she was going to have surgery by that exact same doctor, Doctor Edgar Highley.These twisted events end up all fitting together, just as a puzzle. The nightmare of a plot tends to make you take a glance behind you to make sure no one is staring you down. If you pick this book up, someone will have to rip it from your hands to get you to stop reading it because you get pulled into it instantly. This is now one of my favorite books, and authors, because Clark lets you see the mystery from all points of view including the murderer.

Though it is exciting, I will admit I was more intrigued by &quot;Let Me Call You Sweetheart.&quot; You should check that one out before &quot;The Cradle Will Fall&quot; because I think the plot is a bit sneakier, and there's a major twist at the end.

I must tell you that I am disappointed by this book. The story, palpable at many edges and creative in the manner in which one character is painted in a bad light, but it fails to really leave you grinding your teeth for more. The Authors fashion is to set up intertwined chapters. Get you to a point where you are just about to guess what is next and then you read what really is next, but across the town or from another pov. That failed in this book. You just assumed what would happen. I dare not tell MHC how to write because I so enjoy her book, but a few parts were just too easy. So easy that the cliff-hanger feel died on me. The young man, thief, who steals the doctors bag. Too convenient. Take out this character and his chapters. He ruined it. Also, the bad, bad Doctor. If he is so cunning and cold, he would not have left the evidence in his trunk for so long.I think this story sacrificed some hard details and symbolism for a fast past edge. Not very fast but enough.All in all, this an okay read, but not her best."},{"Title":"The Cradle Will Fall","review":"I recently purchased this book by Ms. Clark, in an airport, deciding to finally discover what all the buzz was about. It is the first, and last, of her books which I will read, and I am most sorry I spent any money whatsoever doing so. The depth of the characterization is shallower than the thickness of the paper on which the letters describing the characters are written. One knows almost instantly 'whodunit', and why, and the remainder of the book is truly pulp fiction. One Tony Hillerman chapter has infinitely more depth, interest, and truthfulness than this entire attempt."},{"Title":"The Cradle Will Fall","review":"This is one of Mary Higgins Clark's best yet!

Clark uses an element of suspense, foreshadowing, and great characterization to pull the reader into her novel. She also uses dialogue to establish a personal relationship between the reader and the characters.Mary Higgins Clark uses the element of suspense to write an exceptional mystery. The reader watches the case unfold and experiences different twists and turns along the way. The reader feels as if he is involved in solving the mystery. Each time Katie and Richard discover a new clue, the reader remains on the edge. The plot is very complex. She leaves the reader confused in the beginning by only telling little pieces of the story but in the end it all comes together. In the end, she gives more information the reader expects. In the beginning, the novel is hard to get into because the plot is a little dawdling. It picks up soon and the reader is unable to put it down. Her suspenseful writing techniques captivate and intrigue the reader. This novel is a classic mystery but unlike other novels by Clark the reader knows who the murder is in the beginning. Clark still manages to surprise the reader with the details of the case. She allows the reader to know all the details of the characters' lives. She writes each chapter from a different character's perspective. The reader feels as if he knows the characters personally. Clark makes the characters ordinary people so it is easier for the reader to relate to them. The reader enjoys Katie and Richard's blossoming relationship and in the end is excited that they begin a romantic bond. She also uses foreshadowing as a major device in this novel. In the beginning, the reader knows that doctor will murder again and at any cost. She uses foreshadowing to show the reader that Dr. Highly wants to kill Katie because of the risk of her finding out that he killed the pregnant woman. The foreshadowing keep the reader on the edge of his seat to find out what comes next.The Cradle Will Fall was very captivating and keeps the reader waiting in suspense. It exemplifies the perfect characteristics of a classic mystery novel written by one of the greatest mystery writers of all time. Mary Higgins Clark was successful in employing the devices of suspense, foreshadowing, and characterization to create a classic that will be read for many years to come."},{"Title":"He's Leaving Home","review":"The japanese original was edited in 1988 and awarded the renowned Akutagawa Prize(if you don't know the name, maybe you remember the film 'Rashomon' - RyunosukeAkutagawa wrote the book). The translator, Jeff Shore, is professor at the BuddhistHanazono University, Kyoto. The translation has been selected by the Associationfor 100 Japanese books, and a Dutch and German translation are in the making.The small booklet is a consciously simple father's report, whose eight-year old sonsuddenly decides to become a Zen monk. Against the rather halfhearted opposition ofthe family he succeeds and is ordained at an age of 13.A simple everyday story, and yet - it's readable at so many different levels, andat any level you may get so much out of it that it's difficult to lay aside. It'snot even especially pious ore one-sided - you needn't look for criticism, it's theremanifestly, but cautiously - and caution itself is examined again. If not of thepsychology of Zen, then at least of the psychology of monks and monasteries in JapanI've learned more from that booklet than from scientific treatises."},{"Title":"Vikings: Raiders from the North (Lost Civilizations)","review":"&quot;Vikings: Raiders from the North&quot; is a terrific introduction to the culture of the Viking peoples. It is part of Time-Life's Lost Civilizations series. This book goes beyond the stereotypical image we have of the Vikings as rampaging, looting, bellicose pirates to show us the richness of their society.The book treats you to a brief history of the Viking world and the archaeology from Viking sites. This gives you a more balanced view, as we learn about the farms and crafts that were part of their world. Important parts of the book deal with Viking craftsmen such as ship builders, jewelry makers and wood carvers.As with all Time-Life books, this one is richly illustrated with color photographs, maps and illustrations. These let you see the beauty and intricacy of Viking craftwork, from their beautiful boats to the delicate personal effects such as buttons, combs and brooches. The maps and diagrams of archaeological sites help you visual what the text is describing.The book is devided into four sections that outline the rise of Viking culture in present day Scandinavia; the Viking quests for wealth and glory through continental Europe and the Near East; the Viking influence on the British Isles; and the Viking exploration and settlements on Iceland, Greenland and the New World. There are also supplemental sections on Viking ship building, the archaeology of York (Jorvik), the modern search for Vinland and Viking artwork.The book tries to dispel some of the misconceptions and myths about Vikings (eg. Vikings never wore horned helmets) while it tries to give you an idea of the full range of Viking culture. Most people within the Viking culture were farmers, and their story is also told within this book.All in all this is a good introduction to Vikings. If you want a fairly balanced account of Viking culture, I recommend this book.

Color illustrations are simply excellent.There is quite a good map, which does not clearly show the range of the Vikings, but does pinpoint the various locations and settlements discussed in the book.Kathryn Hinds gives detailed and thorough information on the belief systems and mythology of the Vikings, as well as how the people governed themselves. Plenty of myths and legends are included in the book."},{"Title":"Flash 3! Creative Web Animation","review":"I am a computer instructor and web page designer. I have tought many students various software programs. For best learning, a step by step process should be followed and no assumptions should be made about prior knowledge with the software. This book is poorly presented, makes assumptions of prior knowledge, and is hard to read.( Fonts, layout, general feel of the book) I would suggest that NOBODY BUY THIS BOOK until you have read the manual available on the macromedia site. Hopefully, by the time you read it there will be a better book available to you out there."},{"Title":"Flash 3!

Still you may learn more using and reading the tutorials than reading this book."},{"Title":"Flash 3! Creative Web Animation","review":"The book fails to discuss the most powerful aspect of Flash 3, tell target commands.

In conclusion, don't waste your money on Flash 3! Creative Web Animation."},{"Title":"Flash 3! Creative Web Animation","review":"Please, please, read this book BEFORE you consider buying it. It has to be one of the worst references on the subject, owing it's marginal success to the fact that very few (if any up until this date) books have been written about Flash 3.

Creative Web Animation","review":"I was a first time user to Flash 3, but a long time Director user and 3D animator when I tried out Darrel Plant's book on Flash 3. The tutorials on the drawing tools were straight forward, as were the tools themselves. But, when I tried to learn the editing features for animation and scene production from the book, I became completely confused and had to seek help elsewhere online and was successful. Many of the tutorials from the CD have already been completed to such a degree that I found it nearly impossible to go back and recreate the project from scratch. I found I had much more luck using Michael Kay's tutorials from WebMonkey. Kay begins his projects from the ground up and includes many of the shortcuts up front to streamline the learning process. This is a pretty easy program once you learn it. But if learning it is what you want to do, then I reccomend we all try to get Kay to write his own book. In the meantime, I highly reccomend Kays tutorials if you find yourself at wits end."},{"Title":"Flash 3!

Creative Web Animation","review":"I was not really that impressed with this book. While it does cover the basics it does not go into advanced topic such as games or FS. If you are new to Flash or just haven't got much from the tutorials, this book might prove valuable to you. I does not go into complex animations and its animated button section could go into more depth. The Lessons on the CD seem as if they just threw them toghther in order to get the book out. Darrel Plant could have spent much more time writing this one. Why didn't he start writing this while FLASH3 was in production? I mean we had to wait months for this guide to come out and then they kept postponing it. One last thing, on the back of the book it says that Sound Edit 16 trial is included on the CD. I couldn't find it on mine. Overall I think they did not spend enough time developing this book or the CD for that matter"},{"Title":"Flash 3!

I just purchased Flash 3.0, read through the User Guide, visited the Macromedia Web Site, and worked through the Flash 3.0 on-disc lessons. Still, much of Flash's basics seemed obscure to me. Once I opened Darrel Plant's book--and began working through the lessons--the basics started to jell.The book covers importing vector art from other apps such as Adobe Illustrator. It does a nice job covering the Flash drawing tools (make sure to supplement this with Macromedia's on-disc tour of the drawing tools). Overlays and symbols are explained. Frames and layers are clearly covered and &quot;tweening&quot; examples and exercises help the reader understand Flash's animation capabilities.The book finishes with chapters about Actions (Flash and the Web, Button Effects, and Complex Actions), Sound, Delivering Movies, and a great set of Appendices covering transmission speed, HTML tag references applicable to Flash, Browser Scripting &amp; Shockwave Flash Movies, Using Aftershock for automatically generating HTML code, etc.Sure, it may not be on par with Adobe's excellent &quot;Classroom in a Book&quot; series, but how books are? If you're already well versed in Flash, or gleaned all you needed from Macromedia Flash's on-disc lessons, then this book may be a disappointment.Nevertheless, this book was fun to work through and provided much needed information and guidance for this novice.

Creative Web Animation","review":"I only say &quot;supplement&quot; because any author of a book on Macromedia tools must be able to provide something the user can't get for free elsewhere (and this is quite a task, since Macromedia's online documentation is robust, and is updated often).Darrel Plant's book is VERY easy to read and understand. But specifically, allow me to judge the book for what it claims to provide:&quot;... you'll be animating your web site in a Flash! ...&quot; [front cover]No fasle advertising here. Sure, Flash accomplishes a lot in a little time; but this book provides a wonderful overview of navigating in Flash.&quot;...follow step-by-step tutorials ...&quot; [back cover]They should've included the words &quot;easy-to-follow&quot; to this claim.

However, this book DOES get you started in learning how to use Flash and it DOES cover basics. Overall, it was a disappointment. There are many, many tutorials on the net that have &quot;real life&quot; tutorials and people who actually use Flash on their web pages (including me) on a daily basis. if you buy this book , it won't be a total waste of money, but it won't be a great deal either."},{"Title":"Flash 3!

The Index is extremely lacking. Seems like they hacked it out on a kitchen table after too many nights without sleeping.Plus the examples of cool websites is just commentary on them...not a clue is given to teach you how they did it.When will someone produce a book on Macromedia apps that is similar to the Wow series on PhotoShop or the many other books that teach you how to turn Adobe or Autodesk programs into works of art?

I am a traditional 2D animator and looked forward to getting to grips with Flash 3, I just needed a kick start, instead I got a kick in the teeth. Darrel Plant's explanation of how to create a frame by frame animated graphic symbol was wrong. I doubt the author knows much, if anything at all about animation and I was left wondering if he had ever actually created an animated graphic symbol that had animated artwork as opposed to tweened shapes in it. There is a different method to creating these two types of animation but Darrel Plant doesn't appear to know that.I found a lot of his commands wrong. Option-Click on the modify layer button does not lock all other layers (mac version) as stated on page 165, (It's Command-Option-Click).This book will be far too basic to be of any help to anyone who knows anything at all about animation software from Macromedia.

This nicely designed cover is misleading because the contents of this book are disappointing.The books serves well as a basic intro into Flash 3.0. Other than the purpose of a general intro, the books is disappointing. Examples in the book are dated and rather &quot;cheesy&quot; in there graphic appearence and quality.My advice: SAVE YOUR MONEY!There are plenty of well developed website tutorials that offer step by step instructions and beautifully designed contemporary looking flash animations that appear on real websites.Plus, I had an easier time learning Flash from the free lesson files that are part of the free 30 day trial version of Flash from the Macromedia site."},{"Title":"Flash 3!

The remaining human population is mostly scattered across other planets under control of the Vegans. Earth's remaining human population lives mostly on islands, as the larger land masses are still too radioactive to live on. This is certainly a promising premise for a science fiction novel, but I really was not able to get into this one. I could not identify well with the characters, and the plot seemed to meander from one point to another with little apparent end in sight. This book somehow tied withDunefor the Hugo Award, but I'm frankly not sure what the voters saw in it. In my opinion the two books are not even in the same league."},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"From ISawLightningFall.comSo you're cruising Genreville, looking for something unique. You dismiss Best Seller Highway, Bodice Ripper Boulevard and Thriller Trail out of hand as too commercial. You pull through SF Junction and Western Way, Fantasy Circle and Horror Lane, but don't find anything to your liking. You drive and drive and drive until you find yourself in a section of town you aren't familiar with. The asphalt is full of potholes, the surrounding blocks underdeveloped. You stop and consult your map. Ahead is the intersection of Post Apocalyptic Drive, Space Opera Street and Mythic Parkway. You look up, and there, turning cartwheels on the corner, is Roger Zelazny's This Immortal.You can tell Zelazny's first novel is going to be something different as soon as you're introduced to its protagonist, Conrad Nomikos. Conrad is Commissioner of the Department of Arts, Monuments and Archives for a future Earth still reeling from the ravages of nuclear war. Not only does he catalogue the planet's few remaining wonders, such as the pyramids and the Sphinx, he also gives tours of them. But he's picked up a client he'd rather not have, an extraterrestrial of the galaxy-spanning Vegan race named Cort Myshtigo. After Earth immolated itself, the Vegans took over, treating it as a vacation destination for the planet-hopping set, part day spa, part radioactive Outward Bound adventure. Myshtigo wants to pen a memoir of his travels, but a band of resistance fighters think he's up to no good and want him dead. Conrad, though, won't let a client perish, even one he doesn't like. He's had plenty of time to practice bodyguarding, having been alive for hundreds of years due to a freak mutation. In fact, he may be more than merely human.This Immortal has the all elements of a genre gem, but its disparate parts never quite come together. One page has you reading about interplanetary travel, the next about the consequences of nuclear devastation and the next about satyrs listening to Conrad play a shepherd's pipe. The chatty dialogue proves equally disconcerting. Tossing out one-liners about a bestial mob's preferred method of cooking human flesh spoils the mood. Ditto for quips about chewing gum and chipmunks during a voodoo ceremony or discussions of cultural anthropology before a duel. You can't fault Zelazny for his breadth of vision, though, or for his fight scenes, which are cracking good. Still, readers who think this Genreville locale sounds enticing might find Alfred Bester's The Stars My Destination a more satisfying read."},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"This is one of Zelazny's best books, and one of the best works of science fiction I've read. It shares some elements with his other variations on world mythology, but there are differences, too. The Greek myths are alluded to, more than embodied, capturing more of their mood than their specifics. The protagonist is complex and intriguing, even by Zelazny's high standards. It all adds up to a great book, and my paperback is worn enough to prove it."},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"CALL ME CONRAD..THIS TIME AROUND.Rumors abound, but the records that should tell the truth about the man called Conrad Nimikos are mysteriously incomplete. Some say that he once had a different name--that he is the hero who fought the Vegan empire to a standoff. Some even whisper that he has had other names, through time out of mind. But for the moment he is Canrad Nimikos, Commissioner of the Earthoffice Department of Arts, Monuments, and Archives, and incidentally the one man who may have a chance to spare the now-helpless Earth a return engagement with the Vegans..."},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"What can I say--I have just finished reading &quot;This Immortal&quot; for the third time and its every bit as good a read as the first time! Zelazny's style is fast and witty. His characters well developed and intriging. His descriptive nature tart and fast-- Zelazny can describe in one sentence what Stephen King takes to describe in two or three pages. A fast and fun rollercoaster ride, this book remains a classic and anyone who reads this book can see why it tied Dune for the Hugo Award. So what if its not a sprawling space epic--it perfectly sums up the other extreme! And no I will NOT tell you the plot-read it yourself!"},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"The back cover copy confused me so badly I had to go back and re-read the book as soon as I had finished it--it was a great investment. Conrad is a convincing hero--he is willing to sacrifice anything to save the Earth he believes in--including himself and just about everything else he values. He'll even make a deal with the hated invaders--the Vegans--if it will help him. Not that Earth is any great shakes. After the Vegan invasion and Conrad's nuclear terrorism, radioactivity, poverty, and mutation make this an early distopian vision. Zelazny is an awesome writer. Although his Amber novels are currently more popular, and although LORD OF LIGHT may have appealed more to the 1970s crowd, THIS IMMORTAL has to be ranked as one of his best, and as one of the best of Science Fiction from the 60s. It's hard to find but worth it."},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":".....I read Lord Of Light as my first Zelazny read and picked up This Immortal aferwards. I loved each book and am eager to explore his other works. This is a cool quick read......I differ on one point with the reviewers below as to the main characters origins. While many of the hints are toward a satyr, him being called a \\"forger\\" by the Vegan he chooses to protect and due to a few other comments, is he not possibly Vulcan of Roman Mythology (Hepaestus in Greek Mythology).... He was the god of fire and volcanoes, and the manufacturer of art, arms, iron, and armor for gods and heroes. He was born weak (later fairly strong) and crippled and was considered quite ugly...... Just a thought."},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"One of the early Hugo winners, I wasn't sure why it won at first. The style is very different, almost rambling. Conrad is an immortal who's had a bunch of different names over the years but basically really enjoys living, unlike immortals in other books. Earth has messed itself up and a bunch of aliens have bought it as real estate and Conrad is taking one of them around and showing him the sights to help him with a book he's writing. There's not much in the way of plot, which is what turned me off when I started reading it. Not much happens, true. But Zelanzy has a gift for description and Conrad is one of the fully rounded and complex characters ever. There's a definite sense of humor in the book which is definitely welcome considering the surroundings. The situations they tend to blunder into but the plot is more episodic than anything else, and most of the conflicts are fairly interesting. Mostly it's just the way he describes things, by the time you finish you feel you know Conrad, or whatever he wants to call himself. His world is very detailed and the echoes of the Greek myths are there, sort of like lurking in the shadows behind the rest of the plot but it colors the actions of the characters. All in all, a quick read and worth your time if you can find it used. Probably not as well known as his Amber books but something to look into if you want something that's the same and different. Or something."},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"I just found out that \\"Zelazny\\" is considered a spelling mistake in Microsoft's Word and the program prompts me to choose between \\"Delaney\\", \\"Zelman\\" or \\"Zeeland\\". This little discovery shows on the one hand (somehow sadly) the degree of Zelazny's recognition outside SF, but on the other makes him something of an elitist writer, one perhaps able to deliver in a very personal writing style.Boy, how he delivers.\\"Crossing a room can be a time - consuming business: if it's full of people, if the people all know you, if the people are all holding glasses, if you have even a slight tendency to limb.It was, they did, they were, and I do\\".A 170 pages long torrent of this writing style, will give you the extremely rare sensation of your intellect being tickled by the writer's pen while you are reading the novel. I would think of it as something like the Heinleinian tickle X 2.And what about the heroes one might ask?Well, it is the first time I have read a SF novel with a hero so lethal and so human. Consider Halo (the video game) meets James Joyce. Honestly, don't read any further in this review if you don't believe it, go and check for yourselves.And what about the plot?It's a well thought post-apocalyptic Earth, interesting Vega aliens and a captivating storyline spanning three continents.Being Greek myself, I could complain about a couple of oddities (for example, a dinner with kokkineli, Metaxa and Ouzo would rather demand a stomach of titanium), but, you know, that's more like complaining for the sake of complaining.It is strange that This Immortal has not been transferred to cinema, theater, TV mini series, videogames, HOPA games and bobblehead dolls. I am sure that it will some day be discovered and then Zelazny will be upgraded to non-underlined in Word. Not that he (or we) would really care. 5 stars."},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"This isn't Zelazny's best book, but he's such a good writer that even a relatively average book of his is fun, gripping, and to some extent moving. If you've read Zelazny before, this book works through the themes that really seem to interest him - the human-ness of someone with great power. There's enough drama and mature ideas that the book isn't fluff, but it keeps moving and never lets you not be excited."},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"I don't really like Zelazny's writing style (I am apparently immune to his vaunted wit, and at times I feel like he is just trying to show off his literary education), and 1966 Hugo winner \\"This Immortal,\\" AKA \\"Call Me Conrad,\\" is a little slow to get going. The book is also a bit pretentious, ceaselessly bombarding the reader with references to Ancient Greek culture and Romantic poetry, and trying to say something about imperialism, terrorism, and religion. And the characters all seem like jerks.However, the core plot of the novel is good, a violent detective/adventure story, and about 70 pages into its 175 pages it gets pretty interesting and exciting. It is not for everybody, but it is easy to see why its fans are so fond of it. People who think SF can be serious literature, and those who like an adventure story but would like something a little more challenging than the usual thing should certainly give \\"This Immortal\\" a shot."},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"This isn't Zelazny's best and it still surprises me, on rereading, that it gained the Hugo Award for best novel. What this book does, however, is break the ground for his better work which was yet to come.

This Immortal is a slight book but it's worth reading as part of an overview of Zelazny's development as a writer."},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"Art to planetary protection.On the butt-end that is left of Earth a man with a mutation that gives him heightened physical abilities and a lack of aging gets involved in a sneaky plot to do bad things.Amusing, short and entertaining book with assassin teamups and confrontations, albino vampire fighters and really big smart dogs.A rather nifty little Zelazny work, this one."},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"One of Zelazny's finest, this tale continues the author's fascination with mythology and merges it with his Mike Hammer toughness and New Age Haiku style of writing."},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"I always thought Dune was somewhat overated. It's one of the great landmarks of the genre, but it has its flaws. Zelazny's novel is written in a sardonic, but not too cynical voice, is filled with action, and the characters are, in my arbitary opinion, more interesting. Zelazny was one of the great stylist of the genre, Herbert wasn't. Mind you Dune's plot was more complex.

He's a man with a mysterious past that one has to piece together as the book goes along. He is also very symbolic and metaphorical, something that you don't see done often, or well, in scifi/fantasy. Half saint, half destoryer, this immortal is the narrator of a tale of a time when Earth is in dire need... though the &quot;alien invaders&quot; of this novel, the Vegans, come with checkbooks, not guns. My only complaint with this novel is that the other characters aren't as fully developed as Conrad. If this book is never made into a movie, I'll right the bloody screen play myself! What are you waiting for? Order it!"},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"I'm basing this on memories of the paperback I purchased some 20+ years ago, and the refresh from other reviewers.A confusing book, in a way -- but then, all the better Zelazny works have that same confusion factor. One has almost to reread his works so that information learned later can be applied to actions the characters take earlier -- Zelazny does not pander to the reader with lots of explanatory exposition and background, it has to be absorbed as it happens. (The closest is probably the first book of Amber, where amnesiac Corwyn is bluffing information out of the relatives.)However, the above comments should not scare one off from reading this book. It does deserve all the praise it has been granted through the ages.The &quot;correction&quot;: Lest anyone be mislead by another reviewer's mention of J.R.R. Tolkien... LoTR's &quot;Gollum&quot; has absolutely no relationship to the &quot;golem&quot; mentioned in &quot;This Immortal&quot;. In a break from the Greek mythology, so heavy in the book, &quot;golem&quot; comes from Jewish mysticism -- a clay figure of a man, animated by the insertion of mystical hebrew writing (the name of God?) inserted into the clay (I'm not clear on inserted into the forehead, or held in the mouth). The golem being created as a near indestructible, defensive, fighter -- wherefore the link to the cybernetic fighter of Zelazny's book."},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"I recently re-read this after a 20 year hiatus. Good book. I've always found Roger Zelazny's stuff a bit chaotic and somewhat confusing, especially in the early chapters when you don't know what's going on. Now don't get me wrong, I think he's one of the greatest SF writers of all time (especially the amazing Lord of Light and the early Amber books) and his writing style works brilliantly in the context of his other novels. This book, however, is a bit different from those other novels. I was struck by how straight-forward this story was, indeed, how &quot;tight&quot; it seemed. There wasn't a wasted word or phrase. I found it quite refreshing after reading today's bloated epics.My only quibble with the book was that I found the ideas a bit un-original (although they may have been quite unique at the time they were written). Nevertheless, the pacing was perfect, the action was good, it kept my attention and most of all - I wish today's writers would take a lesson from him!"},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"Without having read Prometheus Unbound or knowing as much Greek mythology as Zelazny, this book largely flew over my head.Often miracles would happen to get the characters out of trouble (on at least two occasions I remember off the top of my head). To make matters worse, a lot of the dialog is like machine guns firing, where one person says a single word, the other character replies with one word, and then the first person says another single word. Dialog will go on for pages without any dialog tags. Besides the protagonist, the characters are largely superficial. The love story was not impressive by any means.The only thing I found somewhat satisfying was when I learned what the Vegan's really wanted.So, if you are a master of greek mythology, I heartily recommend this book. Or, if you want to learn more, pick it up. Otherwise, the book probably isn't for you."},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"If I were to pick a single science fiction author who was the essence of speculative fiction in the 1960's it would be Roger Zelazny. And while he continued to produce quality work, it was this period when both his quality and his intensity were at a peak that few authors ever reach. This Immortal (AKA Call Me Conrad) is his first novel (closely tied with The Dream Master). It remains a masterpiece four decades after winning a Hugo award and in many ways it defined the themes that haunted Zelazny's writing for years to come.Zelazny is fascinated with a certain form of divinity - not the kind that 'is and has always been,' but with intelligent creatures that somehow 'graduate' from a more normal, mundane state. In this novel the hero is Conrad Nimikos, a Greek, born on Christmas Eve, one leg shorter than the other, and altogether too much hair. In Greek terms, he was one of the kallikanzaroi, mischievous satyrs who exist to irritate both the human and the divine. Zelazny never tells us how old Nimikos is, but he has lived long enough to have had several names and seen the Earth suffer a nuclear war and start to pick up the pieces.We were saved by the intervention of the Vegans who helped relocate the remnants of Earth's population throughout space and saw to the survival of those who chose to remain. This was a mixed blessing, since the Vegans seems to want to turn Earth into a resort. Nimikos fought that eventuality (under another name) but has merged into the current social framework as the caretaker of the world's antiquities and treasures. Recently married, he is called from semi-retirement to be the guide for a Vegan journalist who might be writing a book, or looking for better places to put a resort, or something equally nefarious. This will be an ill-starred journey, with many wishing Cort Myshtigo (the Vegan) a quick and unpleasant end, as they travel over a world both barren and beautiful, where danger can take epic proportions.And that's the trick of this particular book. Nimikos no sooner leaves his beloved Cassandra when we realize that this is an Odyssey we have been invited on, and everywhere we look Greek legends will appear just in time to cause unexpected torments and provide opportunities for Herculean efforts. Even though this is a story told in wry fashion, Zelazny manages to use it to explore the meaning of grief. Sorrow for lost friends, loved ones, and an abiding sense of loss for an Earth that at the time of its writing was only showing faint glimmerings of it's future challenges. This is a poignant book where Zelazny manages an exquisite balance between attitude and affection.Small wonder that the book has been in print since its writing. Or that a host of other writers will confess to having been influenced by it. The layering of action, myth, and symbol that became a Zelazny hallmark began with this story. And it is hardly an insult to say while many of his books are as good there are none that are clearly better (well, I do have a soft spot for Isle of the Dead)."},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"Humans have reason to hate themselves even more than they hate the Vegans. The Vegans are basically tourists, lingering among the ruins of the last non-radioactive territories on Earth. The historical Three Days of War occurred between human and human, or rather between dirty bomb and dirty bomb. The back cover of &quot;This Immortal&quot; ironically states &quot;Welcome to Earth (Pop. 60,000).&quot; (Later in the text, we learn that Earth's population is more like four million).&quot;This Immortal&quot; (1966) was Zelazny's first SF novel, and it shared the Hugo Award for Best Science Fiction Novel of the Year with Frank Herbert's &quot;Dune,&quot; so it is no lightweight post-Apocalypse adventure story. In fact, I think the best way to understand &quot;This Immortal&quot; is to read Lawrence Durrell's chronicles of the Greek Isles, most especially &quot;Prospero's Cell&quot; and &quot;Reflections on a Marine Venus&quot;---or better yet, read Percy Shelley's &quot;Prometheus Unbound,&quot; which is referred to more than once in this novel.Like Shelley's Prometheus, Zelazny's hero, Conrad Nimikos is mankind's potential savior. Like Prometheus, he suffers and almost self-destructs in trying to save his chosen people (the humans who remained on Earth). Instead of stealing fire from the gods, he sets out to steal back Earth from the Vegans.At an earlier stage in his career (nobody knows quite how old he might be), Nimikos was a terrorist. Now he has lost some of his destructive impulse (his hubris), and sets out to protect the Vegan, Cort Myshtigo in order to discover the alien's true purpose in touring Earth's remaining monuments.The real mystery of &quot;This Immortal&quot; is not so much the Vegans' intentions toward Earth as it is the true identity of Conrad Nomikos. His mistress, Cassandra playfully refers to him as a 'kallikanzaros' (this is where I had to refer to my Durrell), which a Greek term for a little cloven-hooved satyr, who causes mischief of every kind. Conrad is a huge man, superhumanly strong, but he is also incredibly ugly and walks with a limp.Did he at one time have a cloven hoof?Like the kallikanzaros, Conrad is a trickster, and deceives Vegans and humans alike into thinking his previous incarnation, the terrorist leader 'Karaghiosis,' has died in a boating accident.Once more turning to Durrell, we learn that 'Karaghiosis' is a stock character in Greek drama--in fact, &quot;the embodiment of Greek character...based on the idea of the impoverished and downtrodden little man getting the better of the world around him by sheer cunning. Add to this the salt of a self-deprecating humour and you have the immortal Greek.&quot;So Nomikos-Karaghiosis-Prometheus is the embodiment of 'the immortal Greek,' who might or might not be--according to a hint at novel's end, plus references to the kallikanzaros--the Great God, Pan.Conrad himself refers to &quot;Prometheus Unbound&quot; as &quot;Percy B's dud epic,&quot; but then, all of Zelazny's heroes tend to be self-deprecating.Zelazny has succeeded in capturing the spirit of a people and place in &quot;This Immortal.&quot; I think his Hugo was well-deserved."},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"This Immortal is a novel set on post-apocalyptic Earth sometime well into the future. The Earth's total population is around 4 million souls-an apt term as a sizable portion of those left are \\"mutants\\" of on sort or another. Conrad Nomikos, the protagonist of the novel has a particularly interesting mutation-he's several hundred years old and, insofar as he can tell, an immortal.The bulk of the population wasn't killed off in the war-they've emigrated to other planets. What few choice locations are left on earth are owned by an alien race-the Vegans-much despised by those left on the planet.Nomikos \\"leads\\" a movement called the Returnist's-folks who want people to move back so that earthlings can reclaim their planet from the Vegans. \\"Leads\\" is in quotes as Conrad would rather be sailing and, while he actually sympathizes with Returnist goals in general, he nevertheless has very ambivalent feeling about the Vegans in general.Pressed into service as a guide for a very influential Vegan touring the planet, Conrad is buffeted by several forces pulling at him in different directions. Not sure what's going on, he set's out to try to keep the Vegan alive while he tries to get at what he's up to. Needless to say, from here on out the stuff is pretty much always hitting the fan, so to speak.This was Zelazny's first major novel. It is a truly great concept and the overall execution is well done-but it is a first effort. The characterizations are uneven. The story rambles a bit in places, the ending's a bit weak. Nevertheless, the genius that would later dominate the sci-fi world is clearly in evidence here, and my opinion is that to truly appreciate Zelazny's place in sci-fi history, you absolutely need to start here. It wont be his best work you'll read, but it is an essential work. And, on the whole, it's still a classic and a very good story."},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"I guess I should post a spoiler warning here for those people who haven't read these books yet-though I don't think a Zelazny book can be \\"spoiled.\\" I recently reread This Immortal. I was really impressed. Especially considering this is Roger's first novel. It is in a first person narrative-which seemed strange since so many of his books are all written in third person. But anyway, the book itself is incredible. I can see why it garnered so many awards. The post-apocalyptic themes are mixed with alien culture, futuristic politics, Greek mythology, derring-do and even a mystery to solve.It is a great blend of fantasy and science fiction. The main character, Conrad Nimokos, Karagee, etc., etc., etc., is an immortal who may or may not be Pan, Dionysus, or some other figure from mythology (with the shortened leg I kept expecting Hephastus). The supporting characters are all quiet good, and it is interesting given the length of this short novel how much I came to care for these characters and their welfare. Hassan is the noble eastern assassin. Much like Yama in Lord of Light you come to respect and admire him as much as the main character. The two have a long history and are both formidable warriors. Their inevitable duel with slings is a great bit of writing. I love how Hassan insists on calling Conrad, \\"Karagee.\\" Some characters I was initially suspicious of-the Vegan Myshtigo, and the poet Philip Graver, end up as heroic figures.I had a huge lump in my throat, and bits of tears in my eyes, as I read Phil's final words to Conrad. Phil is a particularly interesting study. As a man of \\"half-talent,\\" and more acclaim than skill as a writer, one wonders if Zelazny was doing some soul searching here. There is plenty of that, as Zelazny's pattern of musing over philosophy, religion, politics and art is well established here.As far as the action goes, there is the above mentioned duel, a battle royale between Conrad and a combat robot, a fight between Hassan and The Deadman-- which is cleverly won, and an escape from tribal half-men. Throw in a voodoo ceremony and you begin to wonder how Roger fit it in to 190 pages. But he did, and it reads like a good symphony plays.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"Humans have reason to hate themselves even more than they hate the Vegans.

Zelazny went on to write 50 books, including novels, collections of short stories, and even several collections of poetry, but many of the elements he became so well known for are present here.The protagonist is more than human in many ways--he doesn't age--but with a self-effacing, wise-cracking, self-deprecating sort of humor, a character type that was to become his favorite. The \\"Methuselah\\" trait added a surrealistic quality to an otherwise somewhat cynical, quite reality-grounded, character. Zelazny had the ability to paint quick, incisive but also subtle protraits of his characters in a few telling lines, but also devotes entire paragraphs to describing their psychology and appearance too. And his interest in myth, legends, and ancient history is shown in the many references to ancient Greece, the protagonist being Greek too.That having been said, I had one minor quip, which is that except for the characters of Hasan the assassin and Conrad, most of the other main characters weren't really drawn that well. You didn't really get to know them and they remained obscure all through the book. I found this odd considering Zelazy is usually pretty good with characterization.Similar to his book, Damnation Alley, Earth is a post-nuclear wasteland, a formerly vibrant but now devastated civilization, which the more advanced and peaceful Venusians find fascinating as a case study in primitive intelligence and culture gone wrong. Some of them even want to turn the earth into sort of a freakish post-Apocalyptic resort, such as the visiting Venusian or Vegan scholar in the story.In addition to the above elements, add in a few more imaginative characters, such as a deadly Arabic hired assassin who prides himself on his professionalism and still has his scruples; robot \\"golems\\" that are used as martial arts training partners; mutated, 40-foot long, half-snake, half-crocodile creatures; giant bats; massive earthquakes that sink several islands in the Aegean; and a couple of secret terrorist plots and political intrigues, and you have a pretty good idea of the story. Obviously, Zelazny had fun creating and thinking up all these ideas for the book and it shows, as this early novel still remains one of his finest works, and it was certainly deserving of the Hugo that it won."},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"This Immortal is a good read, with plenty of Zelaznyesque brio. I wouldn't say it's not as good as his other Hugo winning novel, Lord of Light: indeed, by comparison, it seems a bit slight. For instance, I found the ending a distinct anti-climax. It's still a book you ought to read, mind you. It did win a Hugo, in a tie with Frank Herbert's Dune.The storyline concerns Conrad Nomikos, one of about 4 million people still living on Earth centuries in the future, after a Nuclear war, and after the bulk of the population has gone to the stars to work for the advanced, civilized, Vegans. Conrad and some of his friends had years before been involved in the &quot;Returnist&quot; movement, urging people to return to Earth, and resisting the Vegans' moves to buy up the best Earth real estate. Nowadays, the situation is a stalemate, with Earth's exile population preferring not to return, but with the Vegans' not buying any more of Earth either. But Cort Mishtigo, a high status Vegan, has come to Earth to tour some of the ancient sites. Conrad, who seems to have some mysterious past identities that go back a long way, is recruited to guide Mishtigo, and to protect him from assassins. He is in danger because the more radical Returnists believe that his &quot;tour&quot; is a pretext for evaluating more real estate, in advance of a renewed Vegan buying campaign. Conrad is unsure of Cort's motives, and anyway unhappy with the idea of murder. The novel consists, then, of Cort's tour, and a number of well-done battles between Conrad and a variety of monsters and mutants. The fight scenes, and the descriptions of the mutants (based on Greek mythology), are really good. It's only the eventual revelation of the Vegan motives that's a bit pat and anti-climatic.Lest I be seen to damn with faint praise, I should reiterate that this is great fun to read, and very skilled and clever. Conrad is a fairly standard Zelazny hero, wisecracking and self-deprecating. The dialog crackles throughout, and the other characters are nicely limned. Conrad's dilemma is believable: the conflict between his professional desire to protect his client (along with his personal distaste for murder) and his loyalties to Earth and the Returnists against the Vegan domination of Earth is well handled. And the various set-pieces and fight scenes are exciting and original. And the ultimate message of the book, about proper stewardship of our planet, and who deserves to be stewards, is clearly seen, and resolved with irony and honesty."},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"I've yet to be disappointed by Zelazny--after a bit of work, I managed to stumble upon the Amber series in a local used bookstore, and have picked up several of the iBooks(?) reprints.This Immortal is not the exception to the rule; I found myself deeply engaged by the story, I had a hard time putting it down--and yet, I always felt that I was missing something, that the story was operating on several levels, and I was fully aware only of one, while the others I caught mere glimpses of as I read. It is possible, as another reader has mentioned, that it might help to be familiar with certain Greek source material; I can't recall if the Homeric epics were mentioned, but given the comparisons between This Immortal and The Odyssey, I imagine it couldn't hurt.I sense that I'll be returning to this book in the future; as you might imagine, I feel that there is quite a bit more to be found in it than I discovered on my first read. However, if you're looking for an introduction to Zelazny, I would recommend you steer clear and look instead for the Amber novels, or perhaps The Dream Master. Once you're well-hooked, you might consider this."},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"This novel tied for best science fiction novel of the year (1966), splitting the Hugo with Dune. Dune is impressive and expansive. This novel is not on the same scale, but it is very good. Far better than the vast majority of Hugo and Nebula award winners that I have read, in fact.The story follows that of Conrad, an immortal previously known by many other names, one of which was an infamous terrorist. Hence, alternate title &quot;... And Call Me Conrad&quot;. On first glance, it appears to be a standard post-apocalyptic tale of the Earth with a small population (in the low millions) and numerous radioactive areas and mutants running around. A prosperous and highly advanced alien race has taken in any humans that want to leave (turning them into 2nd class citizens hired for menial labour), and they are buying up all the choice land on Earth itself as vacation spots.Those are the nuts and bolts of the story, but they aren't really important. Zelazny has the ability to write intellegent science fiction/fantasy without making the average reader feel stupid, or making himself sound pretentious/arrogant (unlike, for instance, Samual Delany). It is a little confusing at first, but everything sorts itself out by the end - there are Earth factions squabbling, an alien travelogue-writer whose true intentions are unknown, and some Greek mythology thrown in for good measure (because Conrad is Greek, it doesn't come out of the blue). In a lesser book, the profusion of stories would be overwhelming (especially at 240 pages or so), but Zelazny balances them all in a thoroughly enjoyable manner.The end does suffer a bit from some Deus ex Machina plot twists, which robs this book of its 5th star. They are not really that bad, but they aren't very satisfying in what is otherwise a well thought out and interesting tale."},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"The Earth has been mostly depopulated as humans have discovered more sophisticated and comfortable cultures elsewhere in the universe. Much of its infrastructure was destroyed during \\"The Three Days,\\" and most of the mainland areas are still \\"hot.\\" Genetic mutations have caused the birth of creatures previously thought to be only myth. Now Earth is a strange and dangerous place, fit only as a tourist attraction and a vacation spot for the Vegans.But some people still love Earth, including long-lived Conrad Nomikos, Commissioner for the Arts. Conrad hates the Vegans, so he isn't happy that he's been assigned to be the tour guide for Cort Mishtigo, a rich Vegan who may be planning to buy up more of Earth. But even more interesting than Mishtigo's plans for Earth is the nature of Conrad himself. Who is he?This Immortal is a gorgeous novel and Conrad Nomikos makes a great hero, similar to Corwin from Zelazny's later Amber Chronicles. Conrad's love of Earth and, particularly, for his Greek heritage is full of beauty and passion:You will pass, but the hills of Greece will remain, will be unchanged, with the smell of goat thigh bones burning, with a mingling of blood and wine, a taste of sweetened almonds, a cold wind by night, and skies as blue-bright as the eyes of a God by day. Touch them, if you dare... That is why I am refreshed whenever I return, because now that I am a man with many years behind me, I feel this way about the entire Earth. That is why I fought, and why I killed and bombed...I listened to This Immortal on audio (Brilliance Audio) and fell in love with narrator Victor Bevine whose deeply resonant voice captured perfectly the strength and depth of Conrad, the tenderness of Conrad's wife Cassandra, the alienness of the Vegan, the gentle deadliness of Hasan the Assassin, and even the zealous geekiness of George, the scientist whose curiosity and ambition makes him willing to experiment on his own friends, pets, and unborn child.The end of This Immortal wraps up a bit too quickly -- I wanted to stay longer with Conrad on our devastated planet.

The book title had been renamed, which also didn't help me in the process of tracking down a copy. The original title was&quot;...and call me Conrad&quot;.Anywise, although I still like &quot;Dune&quot; better, this book was a good read.The Earth has been destroyed in a nuclear war. Several parts are uninhabitable, and most humans have left the planet to go live on distant moons such as Titan. What's left of the Earth has been turned into a great big Museum.Aliens exist on another world, and use the Earth as a tourist site. (They are blue and are called &quot;Vegans&quot; which was very confusing at first since I kept thinking they were referring to a person who doesn't eat meat or meat products.)Conrad Nomikos is the curator of the Earth Museum. He also used to be known as Konstantin Karaghiosis Korones Nomikos who supposedly was a demigod in Greek Mythology. (I really wish I knew more Greek Mythology before reading this book since there are several references to it which might have had more meaning to me if I was more familiar with the history.) Supposedly he has just been living for centuries but nobody noticed this until now, since he kept changing his name.The nuclear fall out has caused mutations and brought many of the legends to life. There are now centaurs, and sea serpents, and even a vampire roaming about the Earth. And then there are other things such as Conrad's &quot;hell hound&quot; named Bortan which supposedly had just been around for centuries also without anyone taking notice until now.Myshtigo is an alien who hires Conrad to take him on a tour of the Earth, supposedly so that he can write a book. Several Earth groups which favor &quot;Returnism&quot; and want all Humans to return to Earth, want Myshtigo killed since they believe he is just conducting a survey of the Earth to buy it and make vacation resorts out of the whole thing. One of these groups is called the &quot;Radpol&quot;. Conrad used to be the founder of this group, and he needs to decide whether to allow these people to kill the alien, or whether based on a hunch, that he should protect him instead. The future of the Earth may depend on his decision. Due to his telepathic powers (yes, he has some of these to), he already knows that the Alien isn't really writing a book, but his telepathic powers don't work well enough to tell him everything, so there is still a mystery to solve.There is a lot of comparisons between the Earth on a larger scale and Greece, Rome, Egypt (you might even be able through France into this mix, but they are not mentioned). These cities in our life time seem to have died. These were once great and powerful nations who ruled the Earth. Now tourists come to their land and expect them to act as second class citizens and servants who act as tour guides. It seems that if they had a choice, that most who live in these nations would rather tear down all these old monuments which symbolize death to them and use the material to build a new and active living city, and be great once more. It seems the only way they can become great again is to let go of the past. Zelazny does this on a major scale by turning the Earth into a giant museum, then starting to tear down the major monument that remain in it. This was a very powerful message it seemed for a while in this book, but then Zelazny chickens out in the end by not following through on it completely and compromises some of his ideas in the end. He loses points with me here, but at least he gave me a new perspective on the subject.P.S. just a side note for Tolkien fans. There is also a cyborg fighting mechanism in this book named &quot;golem&quot;."},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"Frankly, I cannot remember much about this book. I read it more than a decade ago. It was my first Zelazny book. It made me go on to read more or less the entire Zelazny collection. So, I reckon that &quot;This Immortal&quot; had to be a superb novel."},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"This immortal received the Hugo of 1966, but for the contemporary reader it's hard to figure out why. If it has had it's charm, it's been lost somewhere in these past decades. The plot is shallow and there is no real action (apart from a couple of man-to-man fights which hardly qualifies). The story is full of unused people (calling them characters whould be to much praise) who don't have a real purpose being there. And there are a lot of 'accidental' occurences just when they come in handy (f.i. as a last rescue, or to warn the hero) For as far as there is a plot it lacks cohesion, speed, and direction.As for the possitive side: Zelazny probably should enter history as the first to mention self-darkening sunglasses."},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"I didn't like this book very much. Nor did I feel any sympathy for the protagonists. An artificial alien presence, an unclear and indefinite purpose, a contrived plot. That novel seems to have been hastily written indeed."},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"As one reviewer here said, this book hasn't weathered the decades well since it first came out. However, I still think it's a good book. The sheer imagination that's apparent here overrides most of the problems with coincidental happenings and with undeveloped characters and events. I loved this book in my youth, and I still like it today. It's worth reading."},{"Title":"This Immortal","review":"How the hell did this tie with Dune for the best novel of 1966. If you want to read Zelazny read Lord of Light or the Amber series."},{"Title":"With the Eagles","review":"With the Eagles was a great book, and it was great because this past school year we learned about Latin, Rome, Etc. The book takes place in B.C. 54. It's about Mandorix, an Aeduan, whose parents were killed, and his brother ans sister killed or enslaved. He joins Caesar's army and rises through the ranks gaining respect and the friendship of the lowest decurion to even the great Caesar. There are some great battle narrations, diagrams of roman bases, and tons of latin words and phrases. Have a good time reading it!"},{"Title":"With the Eagles","review":"My father and uncle had this book when they were children, and my father gave it to me when I was in junior high school. It tells the story of a young man whose family was killed by bandits and is left alone in the world. He joins the Roman Legion, serves under Julius Caesar, and has exciting adventures. I reread it many, many times. In the story, virtue (including courage, industriousness, and resourcefulness) is rewarded, which gives it an uplifting message. I recommend the book highly: not only does it have a good story, but the author had researched the ancient Romans extensively and it goes a wonderful job of presenting history and Roman life in a palatable fashion.Fortunately, this is but one book of a series! (The series is called Roman Life and Times, and some of the other books have been reissued-I believe &quot;Swords in the North&quot; is now available in paperback.)"},{"Title":"With the Eagles","review":"My mother gave my my copy of this book when I was about [...]. I thought it was really cool because my grandfather wrote it -- no kidding, I really am Paul L. Anderson's grandson.Then I read it, and I discovered just what a wonderful story it is. Mandorix is a credible hero, and as the first-person narrator he weaves a tale at once compelling and educational. Along with the companion volumes in Anderson's Roman Life and Times series, this book motivated me to study Latin, a pursuit I still enjoy some 50 years after I first read of Gaius Iulius Caesar and Dumnorix, of Quintus Rufus and Carnifex, of the foppish Quintus Cicero and his magnificent stand against Ambiorix.Hmm, I think it's probably about time for me to read it again. If you haven't yet read it, you could order it today and be reading it by this time next week."},{"Title":"With the Eagles","review":"Actually my brother has this book and I read it for the first time about 10 years ago - I've read it twice more since then. Anyway, about the book I thought it was brilliant. It captivated me the moment I picked it up detailing the way it might have been as a young, up and coming soldier in the Roman Legions. It drew me in from the first page - I could not put it down easily. I was there when the main character was playing dice in the camp, I was behind him in the battles. Simply amazing."},{"Title":"With the Eagles","review":"\\"With the Eagles\\", by Anderson is and, has been one of the best books that ever slid its way of the printing presses and into the public. This is the story of a young Gaul (Mandorix), who finds himself left homeless due the treacherous murder of his family.With no homestead left, he decides to join Caesar's legions and within a short period of time, becomes a 1st Centurion with many a great battle tale to share with the reader.I was first introduced to this book by my high school Latin teacher in about 1963. Although I eventually failed the class, much of the \\"Omni Gauli dividindes tress partes\\" and other Latin phrases seemed to ferment in my memory banks. However, I never...never, forgot... \\"With the Eagles.\\" It initially, took me about twenty years to locate a copy of it long before the advent of the internet. In fact, I try to read this book once each year.\\"With the Eagles\\" is truly a classic! It should have been listed as such long ago with other great titles like; \\"Moby Dick\\", \\"Three Years Before the Mast,\\" and others.If, you like good story telling, history, and sometimes feel the need to \\"march off\\" away from it all...you must read....\\"WITH THE EAGLES!\\""},{"Title":"With the Eagles","review":"since no one else in the world has read this book, and no one will ever see this page, I will tell you that this was a good book about life in a Roman army through the eyes of a soldier."},{"Title":"With the Eagles","review":"An amazing book! My father gave it to me, since he had read it as a boy. Knowing Roman history makes it all the better, although I imagine it would still be good without. Definitely recommend!"},{"Title":"With the Eagles","review":"Paul L. Anderson's \\"With the Eagles,\\" appears to be the first book published in his marvelous \\"Roman Life and Times Series.\\"The book inserts a fictional character, a young Gaul named Mandorix, into many of the true events depicted in Julius Caesar's \\"The Gallic Wars: Julius Caesar's Account of the Roman Conquest of Gaul.\\" As in most of Anderson's books, the hero tells his tale in first person.As the story opens, a young Gaul named Mandorix is beset with tragedy and decides to follow in is father's footsteps by joining Caesars legions. Mandorix' adventure starts from the first page and doesn't let up until the story ends. The young warrior encounters many physical and moral trials as he distinguishes himself in battle and advances through the ranks because of his heroism, audacity, and gift for strategy.As winter falls, the legions are short of grain and the subject tribes are restless. Caesar divides his camps and grain stores across Gaul in order to conserve resources and quell any attempts at rebellion. But dividing his forces leaves him open to attack.In 54BC, on the Belgian frontier, a clever, double-crossing chieftain named Ambiorix wiped out a legion and united local tribes to lay siege to another legion camp. Rebellion is in the air and the normally independent tribes are beginning to see the benefits of working together. The situation is grim and messengers seeking help from Caesar are unable to get through the enemy territory. Mandorix volunteers to don native garb and undertake the dangerous mission.The period covered in this story precedes the famous rebellion led by Vercingetorix by two years. (I believe the Gaulish uprising is covered in Anderson's next book, \\"For Freedom and for Gaul\\".\\"). This is a very pivotal time for Rome and the events in Gaul provide Gaius Juluis Caesar with the power and impetus to become emperor.As always, Anderson's writing is elegant and his sense of time and place is gripping. The battle scenes are riveting and Mandorix is both clever and compelling as a narrator.On its own or as a companion piece to \\"The Conquest of Gaul,\\" this novel is a great read."},{"Title":"With the Eagles","review":"I read this years ago when I was in Junior High.

As Paul died in 1971, his granddaughter, Laurie Powers, served as the book's editor and contributed front and end pieces, in which she refers to her grandfather's only published novel,Doc Dillahay, which was originally released by Macmillan in 1949, then republished by Bantam as this SIX-GUN DOCTOR in 1950.As the novel opens, the time is 1885 and the place Yucca City, a cattlemen's sleepy burg in the hills of southeast Arizona. The hero of the story is John, the oldest child of Ma and Pa Dillahay and sibling to brother Billy and sister Sue. In Book 1, John divides his time between taming broncos, serving as schoolmaster in the local one-room school house, and apprenticing in the medical arts with the local general practitioner, the alcoholic but otherwise competent Dr. Ludwig Ledinger. In Book 2, John has graduated from medical school in Chicago and returned home to become full partner in the medical practice of his now-sober former preceptor. And while Dillahay was off getting his M.D., silver had been discovered in Yucca City, which is now an enlarged and thriving mining town.In PULP WRITER, Laurie Powers notes that Paul's DOC DILLAHAY was unsuccessful when measured against the popularity of his many short stories that appeared in the \\"Wild West Weekly\\" (WWW). Fifty-eight years later, one is left to wonder why this was so since both John as the protagonist and the story as a whole are engaging enough, and, indeed, proved most interesting to me what with the author's description of country medicine in the late 1880's, about the same time that my maternal great-grandfather was practicing the same in rural Missouri. Perhaps the answer lies in the nature of Paul's previous success as a writer, which was built on the short story format that, by it's very nature, precluded long and drawn-out character development and necessarily demanded, because the readership was mostly comprised of adolescent and young adult males, an abundance of action and bloody shoot-em-ups. In DOC DILLAHAY (SIX-GUN DOCTOR), the emphasis is on the evolution of John's character and, while the reader learns early on that he's a crack shot, there's no serious mayhem or gunplay until chapter 16 of this 17-chapter book. One could even suggest that the Macmillan title, the simple DOC DILLAHAY, was more representative of the contents than the misleading Bantam title, SIX-GUN DOCTOR. Moreover, the story includes not one but two romantic interests, and the presence of significant female characters was deplored by the male devotees of the pulp shorts, as evidenced by a reader's comment in a letter to WWW that's referenced by Paul Powers in PULP WRITER:\\"Keep the gals out of your magazine - they only spoil things.\\"Perhaps it's not surprising, then, that Paul's sole novel did so poorly with his fans that were accustomed to more sustained and concentrated Guy-Stuff.As a rule, fictional literary westerns aren't my cup of java. I've never read any of Louis Lamour's offerings, and only several by Larry McMurtry, though the LONESOME DOVE series by the latter was of memorable excellence, especially as made into the TV miniseries starring Robert Duvall (Lonesome Dove) in 1989. However, I enjoyed SIX-GUN DOCTOR more than I expected I would, and it gave me additional insight into and respect for its creator, Paul Powers. Also, since Paul spent a good portion of his life in Bisbee, AZ, and I suspect that Yucca City is based on that place, I now have a desire to visit this resurrected old mining town."},{"Title":"Cobalt (Alyson Classics Library)","review":"There's nothing like finishing a great book and knowing there's a sequel, so you can dive back in for another adventure.

But if you haven't read these books, you're in for some great fun. These are, I believe, the best gay detective novels ever written.

Delve into the dark smokey bars along the waterfront and ride the coaster to the end, when you'll need to pick up the rest of the series..Check out the Grant Michaels (author) Stan Kraychik mysteries if you like this one."},{"Title":"Cobalt (Alyson Classics Library)","review":"When these books first came out (80's) I do not remember there being a lot in this particular genre (except for the Brandstetter mysteries - which were much more serious.) Now these humorous gay detective stories seem to be everywhere, but the ones I've read come nowhere close to these gems.Cobalt is the second of 4. The others are Vermillion, Slate and Canary. (Actually, they could almost be the titles of Pet Shop Boys albums ...) Anyway, the Boston/P-town settings are great, the Daniel & Clarisse team is hysterical, the stories solid, and the 80's period --once current with the first publication -- is sweetly nostalgiac.If you want a good, light, comic romp .. get these books. And hold onto them .. they come and go quickly from print."},{"Title":"Cobalt (Alyson Classics Library)","review":"Excellent second book of the Dan Valentine/Clarisse Lovelace series. Valentine is a gay bartender in Provincetown for the summer. (PTown is a VERY gay town in the summer) His best friend Clarisse Lovelace joins him there. They plan to have a nice fun summer there. However people they know start to get murdered and Valentine and Lovelace try to find out who the killer is. Just hysterical. The book reads very quickly and is full of one-liners and characters that had me laughing out loud. The mystery is also very well-done with clues and corpses piling up. Aldyne perfectly captures the feeling of PTown in the summer. This was written in 1982 before we knew about AIDS so the gay men here are very sexually active (but the book isn't explicit). I've read this book at least 5 or 6 times over the years and laugh out loud at it every time. Author Nathan Aldyne is actually two gay men--Michael McDowell and Dennis Schuetz. Sadly Schuetz died of AIDS in 1989 and I believe McDowell passed away just a few years ago. They only wrote four books for this series. All of them are fun but this is easily the best.

It does provide an overview of the principles of minimalism, but I didn't feel qualified as an expert (or even close) after studying it.That said, I appreciated it because it's a collection of papers rather than the thoughts of one expert, and allowed me to explore differing opinions on some of the points of minimalism. Rather than laying out a formula for writers to follow, I thought it encouraged writers to think about the principles of minimalism and why or why not to adopt certain tenets."},{"Title":"Minimalism Beyond the Nurnberg Funnel (Technical Communication, Multimedia, and Information Systems)","review":"I used this book for a class on User Centered Documentation and it was great.

It captures -- powerfully, evocatively, brilliantly, at times frighteningly, - exactly what's really at stake in any proposed negotiated settlement. Straight from the most expert minds in Israel's military, strategic and diplomatic corps. Too much of today's analysis of Israeli-Arab negotiations focuses on superficial side issues, like where will settlers relocate, how can this or that community be incorporated, etc. Meanwhile, we've forgotten why Israel has so vigorously resisted a return to the 1967 borders.Meanwhile, Palestinians have raised many demands over the years, from land to refugee compensation. For its part, Israel has long seemed to respond only with a vague call for \\"peace.\\" Finally, this book lays out Israel's central demand - exactly what it must insist upon - in any final peace settlement. Anyone who cares about the future of the Middle East, Israel's survival, or America's role in the region, must read this book."},{"Title":"Defensible Borders for a Lasting Peace","review":"Israel is a country which faces more security threats than any other. It is the only country in the world whose very existence is challenged by some of its neighbors. It is the only country in the world that has fought five major wars in the past fifty- seven years simply to preserve itself against efforts at its destruction.This situation of threat is not about to go away. One major source of hostility to Israel is Islamic Fundamentalistism. The potential adversaries of Israel are likely to continue working for its undermining even should their be formal peace between them. Egypt for instance has been formally at peace with Israel for close to thirty years. Nonetheless the media of Egypt is one of the most insistently anti- Semitic in the world, frequently calling for Israel's destruction.The present effort of the Bush Administration to push toward a Palestinian Arab state in part of the Holy Land also brings with it little promise of eliminating the Arab effort at Israel's destruction. The major theme of Palestinian politics whether enunciated by Fatah, or Islamic Jihad or Hamas is antagonism to Israel.In this situation of threat and insecurity four responsible Israeli public figures have set forth here what they regard as the borders that Israel can live with . Their claim is that unless Israel has clearly defined borders no real progress can be made toward bringing it to true security .These borders have to be such as to give Israel a reasonable amount of time to counter a surprise- attack of Arab armies. They have to be so clearly drawn as to prevent infiltration of Palestinians from the other side of the border.The case made here for reasonable and secure borders for Israel is a strong one.This document should be read by everyone concerned with understanding the minimal conditions for establishing a secure Israel, and a more peaceful Middle East."},{"Title":"Cleaning and sanitizing farm milk utensils (Farmers' bulletin / United States Department of Agriculture)","review":"This was the first book by Margaret Atwood I read after reading the short story &quot;Happy Ending&quot; in an anthology.A great writer is easily recognisable. All you have to do is to write a few lines of a novel or a short story. You will just keep on reading and feel sorry when you are closer to the end than to the beginning of the story.This collection of short stories shows that Margaret Atwood is a major writer and story teller. Of course, not in the pulp fiction or slimy-sweet sense but you need a curiosity for the inner world of soliloquies and self-observations.However, she does not give us lectures on psychology, but tells us the story and we can live it from the inside.In three of the stories the seeds of her later novel, &quot;Cat's Eye&quot; can be found, which I was inspired to read exactly by them. Short stories can always be a good introduction or lead-in for writer and reader alike."},{"Title":"Cleaning and sanitizing farm milk utensils (Farmers' bulletin / United States Department of Agriculture)","review":"In Bluebeard's Egg, Margaret Atwood weaves her poetic prose though twelve short stories that are as haunting as they are hilarious. Atwood takes the reader on a journey within her characters' minds, using real life for the canvass of her work. While the reader senses almost no movement through the physical world, there is a striking depth and distance traveled in each story.Atwood's characters range from neurotic artists to doctor's wives, all linked by their dysfunctional existence. In &quot;Uglypuss,&quot; Joel, a struggling theater director, goes out for a drink when his estranged girlfriend announces that she is coming over. After a rendezvous of casual sex with an old aquaintance, Joel returns to find his place ravaged and his cat missing. It is in this twisted context where the protagonist asks, &quot;what's the point of continuing, in a society like this one, where it's always two steps forward and two back?&quot;Atwood, like only a handful of other authors, is able to sharply focus her writing while grappling with philosophical issues. Yvonne, in &quot;The Sunrise,&quot; wonders: &quot;if art sucks and everything is only art, what has she done with her life?&quot; All the while, the reader is grounded in sensory details, like Kimberly's &quot;wet pink oyster-like mouth.&quot;In many of the stories, Atwood melts past with present, mimicking the random texture of human thought. The seamless prose carries the reader along, stopping at childhood beach cabins, home economics class, and erotic sexual encounters. These retrospective glimpses are preludes to the hauntingly familiar world that the characters inhabit.With Bluebeard's Egg, Atwood has reached a new plateau in her writing, showcasing complete mastery of the craft. Her prose grabs the reader, poking and prodding until the comical and horrific are somehow inseperable. This is superlative serious fiction from one of the most prolific authors of the genre. END"},{"Title":"Cleaning and sanitizing farm milk utensils (Farmers' bulletin / United States Department of Agriculture)","review":"In the car I always have an audiobook to listen to, and the last weeks I really have enjoyed Margareth Atwood's Bluebeard's Egg and other stories.This is a collection of short stories written by a master of words, and a master of short stories. When Atwood writes she uses no extra words or sentences, she takes us right to the point, and the point in this collection is human beings. Common human beings fighting for their lives. No heros, just plain people like you and me. Every time a new story starts I think, this one cannot be better than the last, but it happend again and again, the story captivates me, and it is all mornings hard to stop the car and go to work - I want to hear just one more sentence, and then one more.My favorite story though is the one that has given name to the collection, Bluebeard's Egg. A well known fairy tale, told and given it's own meaning by Atwood, or may be she just shows us the original meaning of the story. Sally, the main carachter of the story struggles with the puzzle of her life, to keep all the pieces together. The center of her life is her husband Ed, but how can she be sure that she is also the center in Ed's life? No one can write about this, invite us into and let us be in the feeling of the story like Atwood do.Britt Arnhild Lindland"},{"Title":"Cleaning and sanitizing farm milk utensils (Farmers' bulletin / United States Department of Agriculture)","review":"Bluebeard's Egg / 0-385-49104-2This collection of Atwood stories includes:- Significant Moments in the Life of my Mother- Hurricane Hazel- Loulou- Uglypuss- Betty- Bluebeard's Egg- Spring Song of the Frogs- Scarlet Ibis- The Salt Garden- The Sin Eater- The Sunrise- Unearthing SuiteMost of the stories revolve around the superb Atwood device of women in comfortable, \\"correct\\" lives, yet who are unbearably sad and alone. Many of these women have relationships outside of themselves - husbands, lovers, mothers, children - yet, they do not have anyone with whom they truly connect with. Though they devote much of their time, energy, and life to caring for the needs of others, no one else cares for their own needs, particularly their emotional needs.However, Atwood does not limit herself purely to emotionally bereft women - \\"Uglypuss\\" tells the story of a disintegrating relationship from both the male and female points of view, and manages to make the reader both sympathetic and non-sympathetic to both parties.

They are linguists and dilettantes, teasing her with words, causing her to examine who she is, especially in terms of her relationships with them.Ugly Puss - - This is a wonderful story of a womanizer who constantly rationalizes his lies and infidelities and the way his lover is driven to distraction (almost psychotic madness) by his actions and distortions of their relationship.Bluebird's Egg - This is a lovely story - - a tale within a tale within a tale ad infinitum.

The dialogue is real and never stilted. Ms. Atwood's descriptions of her family and coming of age are fresh and different"},{"Title":"Cleaning and sanitizing farm milk utensils (Farmers' bulletin / United States Department of Agriculture)","review":"Upon reading the first few stories, in this collection, I tended to feel in keeping with some of the reviewers who intimated that the stories were lacking in complexity. However, as I began to probe further, and reread some of the stories, I realized just exactly what a genius Margaret Atwood is... Atwood's writing is a painful blend of the comical and horrific, much as life can be. These stories, some of them, made me cry with laughter. The recognition of some of my own inner demons was a little painful, but at least it was vicarious in nature. Such is the beauty of a story.I found that the story &quot;The Sunrise&quot; was one of the most exquisite pieces of satire on the art process. As an artist bleeds themselves onto the page or the canvas, the public laps it up like starving vampires. Vicarioulsy. Sometimes the artist gives too much, more than they have to give, and then must seek out the inspiration, the muse, if you will, in someone else. Yvonne, the character here, states that she gave too much at one time. She used to be an artist's model. Now she has shut herself off, but she needs light and life, which she gets from painting unsuspecting humans, and basking in the sunlight. She's like a hothouse flower. She is an artificial creation which she presents to the world. Only she knows the real truth. If this is a collection of stories about the painful truths lurking behind people's hearts, here is the ultimate.Atwood brilliantly satirizes the whole creative process when she says: &quot;Though if art sucks and everything is only art, what has she done with her life?&quot; The symbology throughout the story is one of blatant vampirism, which only the most obtuse could not see. The creation of art and the sordidness of the art world do suck life not only from the artist, but the viewer as well. Just as some of Yvonne's vitality goes into the young man's collage. Atwood says Yvonne will suck the blood of the tulip until it dies,and that she eats a portion of the souls of her sitters, i.e. her victims. Yes, as one reviewer says, the book is rife with symbology, or apparent symbology, symbols for the reader to do with as they will, instead of being spoon-fed.She pokes fun at the reader and the critic,even before they would have had a chance to read this work, by making Yvonne the artist, a woman who paints phalluses. She pokes fun at how a phallus cannot be seen as a phallic symbol, because it IS phallic, in and of itself. Even the razor blade she calls a 'memento mori'.The most exquisite satire comes early in the story, when she writes that it is boring to be characterized by what you paint. &quot;There was one advantage though: people bought her paintings, though not for ultra-top prices, especially after magic realism came back in.&quot; If magic realism is the use of supernatural elements treated as if they were commonplace, and she is commenting on how boring it is to be taken so literally, to in essence, have no surprises for the audience, as well as making allusions to the whole vampire myth, then this is truly brilliant satire!For those of us who get it, here is a treasure, a gem, that has to be dug for, not unlike buried treasure. The very thing which kills her artist's spirit, or cuts off her cash flow, is a renewed fascination on the part of the fickle audience with elements of the supernatural, the mythical, the mysterious, the inutitive. They want mystery and juxtaposed images that don't have meaning until you look under the surface. Like the young man's collages which drain her into them. It's too late for her to use that ploy herself, and she said so, earlier. For the ones who get it, Atwood seems to be slamming the critics right out of the starting gate. She's having the first laugh, and I think it is infinitely funny!"},{"Title":"Cleaning and sanitizing farm milk utensils (Farmers' bulletin / United States Department of Agriculture)","review":"No one will mistake Margaret Atwood for Alice Munro when it comes to short stories.

I am talking about your basic strategies and how to structure them into a final product. Where does one begin, what do you need to take into account, what to do first, how to approach rhyme, basic tips about melody, chords etc. I found this book to answer these type of questions in a simple and interesting way.The author is obviously a specialist with a very good track record. He taught me how to analyse existing songs to expand my knowledge. No more do I just listen to music, I learnt the skill to expand my songwriting knowledge whilst listening to other songs on the radio or on CD.I have learnt how to decide on a basic structure, how to approach the most important issue of finding a &quot;hook&quot; for your song and refining it to something useful. I have discovered that it is O.K. to rewrite songs, but I have learnt how to approach it. This book has taught me how to make songs more interesting and it has made songwriting a more interesting hobby for me.I think the most important lesson from this book is how to grow from a songwriter that tries to express his/her own feelings to himself/herself and a few close friends, to someone who can express his deepest feelings in such a way that his song could be loved by millions and could become a commercial success.

John starts out with exercises and suggestions about how to get your creative juices flowing. He speaks of using his guidelines as &quot;principles&quot; rather than as &quot;rules&quot;. After all, rules are made to be broken, right? Principles leave one much less constricted and guide rather than hem in. The book is designed with that in mind. There are examples and explanations about types of rhyme, different types of formatting for verses and choruses and even discussion about song dynamics such as changes in meter and density of lyrics. I'm only touching on a few of the *many* fine points raised. He even goes into details on different methods of writing music and talks about how to make the most of a collaboration along with the legalities involved. Mostly, the first section of the book dealing with the creation of the song itself, gets the reader *thinking*. I know from personal experience that I need exactly that when I'm sitting down to write. Where does one look for inspiration and what does one do with it once it's found? The second part of the book deals with the business - and that's where John's true mastery comes out in impressive detail. Having been involved in various parts of the business over a length of several years, he's very well suited to know what will work and what won't (though he's quick to admit there are exceptions to every rule). The business section deals with such gems as royalty questions, publishing issues, when and why to self-publish, how to choose a studio when making a demo and what you can get away with doing at home, and how to go about marketing your music. The bibliography even makes a very handy reference guide to trade magazines, songwriting organizations and other resources as well as many other books on the subject of songwriting. John addresses every point with his humorous, no-nonsense narrative and quite apart from being an extremely handy resource, it's a pleasure to read.

I read every single one of those footnotes that was more than a bibliographical entry, as well. Why? Because Jerome Karabel has taken a fairly esoteric subject and made it interesting, important, revealing, \\"juicy\\" and downright enjoyable.Karabel shows how the current admissions policies of the Big Three (Harvard, Yale and Princeton) came about in trying to restrict admissions by the \\"wrong kind,\\" namely Jews, in the 1920s. He follows the policies, unstated rules, and goals of the three colleges' admission departments to the end of the 20th century, covering outright racism, minority outreach, coeducation, the restrictions on Asians that paralleled the earlier ones on Jews (that never quite went away), and most of all, the search for academically qualified students who were capable of paying their way.Karabel' discovered that the Big Three worried over the number of students with high SATs who also had family income sufficient to pay their tuition. Coeducation was not done in the name of women's liberation but to increase the limited wealthy applicant pool, and also to prevent desireable male students from attending other co-ed schools.As one of The Chosen (Princeton '82), I often wondered why the Admissions Office made the decisions they did. Karabel went into the nuts and bolts of how all three of the college's Admissions Offices worked their way through an increasing number of applications. Why were 6 applicants admitted from my college-prep school but only 1 or 2 from the nearby public schools with four times the class size? Was Princeton still engaging in their \\"Docket\\" game, where all the public schools throughout New York and New Jersey were only alloted the same number of admissions spots as just Andover and Exeter?And I was alternately delighted and shocked to find Karabel had unearthed quite a bit on the gatekeeper to our admissions. John Thatcher was the Alumni Schools Committee rep who not only interviewed every one of 300 applicants from my county, but also was one of the \\"alumni in revolt\\" who joined together to form Concerned Alumni of Princeton. Thatcher served as their pointman on Admissions issues, especially noting the decline of legacy admits.Letters from CAP members to the official alumni magazine suggested nostalgic bigots who could not deal with the influx of Jews, minorities and women to what they still thought of as a private country club. The CAP publication Prospect, distributed to all campus residents, beat those drums for years. It took them almost 10 years to realize that coeducation meant that alumni could have their daughters attend and this could be a good thing. It is unfortunate this book was published right before Samuel Alito's CAP scandal hit the news, as Karabel gives some great background on this group and a similar group at Yale.This is investigative journalism with detailed history, inspired conclusions, and enough context for six different disciplines. Absolutely brilliant."},{"Title":"The Chosen: The Hidden History of Admission and Exclusion at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton (.)","review":"Never met Karabel, though I did admissions way back a decade after mid-century, and know most of the folks he quotes and profiles, and know the issues faced. I saw the atrocities and hints of better paths to social equality, as practiced in the three colleges he uses as a focus. Jerome Karabel, younger a bit than I, has compiled what stands as a full \\"social history,\\" an inside look at how what we prefer not to call a class system (with bias, bigotry, discrimination, even virtues rewarded) characterized our recent past--and continues. Karabel's precise and factual; the good and bad show up in the work of selecting students for a college some while rejecting very strong other students (a pretty crazy practice, justified with much defensive rhetoric). But the good and bad practices have persisted, ebbing and flowing, very bad in the 1920s, not very academically oriented in mid-century, perhaps peaking with the positive movements in the late 60s and early 70s, only to level and then decline at century end.Without indexing \\"Iraq,\\" \\"CIA,\\" \\"WMD,\\" \\"blue and red states,\\" Karabel provides enough material to initiate the needed National Public debate that might push at least one of political parties toward, indeed, a reasonable and enlightened 2008 Presidential Platform.

I was particularly surprised and disturbed by some of the overtly discriminatory policies implemented by persons of substantial education and keen intellect."},{"Title":"The Chosen: The Hidden History of Admission and Exclusion at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton (.)","review":"A skilled editor could have turned this good book into a great one. Given its narrow topic, it could easily be cut in half and as a result, be more effective in conveying its message.OK, enough sniping. This is a thoughtful social history that pokes holes in the fabric of hype that surrounds admissions at elite academic institutions. No, Harvard, Yale and Princeton do not select the best and brightest. Yes, their admissions are heavily biased to the wealthy. The facts presented tell a solid story of institutions that historically and currently have discriminated on the basis of race, religion and class in admissions. Their definition of \\"merit\\" is a floating one that conveniently serves to justify self-serving admissions practices. Historically and presently, these institutions favor \\"dumb sons of the rich\\" (the quote is from 19th and early 20th century Harvard president Charles Eliot).What is most deft about this book is that it makes arguments carefully and precisely without overheated language. Karabel quietly lets the facts speak for themselves. And those facts are damning.The implications of discriminatory practices in admissions are profound for leadership in this nation. Given that presidential candidates, Supreme Court justices, corporate leaders, et al. are preferentially chosen from the ranks of Harvard, Yale and Princeton graduates, the biased admission practices of the elites leads to a country where our leaders are not the best and brightest. They are often simply the children of the well connected and wealthy.This book shows just why you probably find yourself shaking your head in disbelief during presidential debates and asking yourself is this the best we can find? The answer is an emphatic no. For that, we have to assign some blame to the admissions officers and presidents of the \\"HYP\\" schools past, present and (no doubt) future."},{"Title":"The Chosen: The Hidden History of Admission and Exclusion at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton (.)","review":"This is one of the best academic works I have ever read, and worth purchasing just for the treasure trove of research findings mined from the archives of Harvard, Yale and Princeton. Those findings are presented in a manner that would do any advocate proud -- by letting them speak for themselves in a very well organized fashion, Karabel makes them utterly compelling. It really should be required reading for anyone seeking to be a historian, as well as for all secondary schools seeking admission to an elite university (and their admissions counselors).The taxonomy of the book, by era and theme, is the key -- and it is not something that you will want to sit down and read from cover to cover. But it rewards reading in essay fashion, starting with era and issues, most important to you -- and you can move back and forth within it quite easily to follow the threads or themes of most interset to you.I purchased this in Harvard Square as my daughter visited colleges in her senior year of high school -- 30 years ago I attended one of these schools, and found the research findings (the writing can best be described as sufficient and workmanlike) to be like a series of epiphanies that explained much of what I did not understand when I attended. Schools, driven by a class system, now driven by a need for funds and for smart students, caught up in a kind of \\"parallel play\\" in their competition for students. Rank, articulated discrimination against applications of different stripes -- Jews, blacks -- public school kids. Biases in favor of alumni children, or those who could help with funding. For all the good these schools have accomplished, this book, with its fabulous documentation, rips the cover off the fabulous hypocracy that has characterized the admissions process to so many schools, with appropriately deluded alumni. Read it, and conclude, that your own sense of self worth does not (or should not) depend upon where you went, or where your child should go."},{"Title":"The Chosen: The Hidden History of Admission and Exclusion at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton (.)","review":"As a graduate of Harvard College, I can say I am more embarrassed than usual to admit it after reading Karabel's book. Karabel lays out in great detail the slimy admissions practices of the \\"top\\" Ivy colleges. Today's sub rosa selection process was born of anti-Semitism and carried on well into the middle of the 20th century. When I applied they required pictures, just to make sure the \\"coons,\\" as one Ivy official referred to Blacks, got special Jim Crow treatment. Now that era is passed, and the Asians wonder if there is a quota for them. The college officials cry, \\"Goodness, No !\\" Yet they continue to favor the children of the same alumni who were chosen as a result of the now decried previous discriminatory policies. (See George W. Bush). Then they call that \\"fair.\\" After reading this book one will be convinced once again never to believe them. The irony is these colleges deliver only mediocre educations to underclass students."},{"Title":"The Chosen: The Hidden History of Admission and Exclusion at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton (.)","review":"Karabel has created a massive tome of information surrounding the history of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton since the early 1900s. His account is very well researched and provides ample documentation to support his arguments and findings.While reading \\"The Chosen,\\" it become clear how convenient it is to use admissions and selections at institutions of higher education as a tool for creating the cohort of students that the institution wants to educate. At Princeton, the average height of the male class was around 6'2\\", giving rise to the claim of the \\"Princeton Man.\\" It is almost offensive at some of the ways students were excluded or the comments written about certain students in their official file; however, times have certainly changed in the past 100 years.One problem with \\"The Chosen\\" is that Karabel invests a huge amount of time with the admission and exclusion of the Jewish population at the start of the 1900s. This in and of itself is not a problem; but, when one-third of the entire book revolves around one student classification and hardly anything is mentioned about the exclusion of women and African-Americans I start to wonder about the focus of the book. The only reason I can see for this overwhelming focus is that the practice of admitting and excluding certain student types followed the model of admitting and excluding Jewish students which started the revolution of diverse student populations.\\"The Chosen\\" also will provide a better education to many people who still believe that Harvard, Yale, and Princeton are only interested in elite students. This book chronicles the lengths that these schools have gone to in order to diversify and make a more \\"well-rounded\\" student population. In fact, these three schools did not even originally recruit at public schools and now they do a large portion of recruiting at public high schools. This book provides a wonderful historic account of the evolution of the elite three higher education schools in the United States.I highly recommend this book for anybody who works in a college environment or who may have a child who might be interested in attending one of these three schools. I also recommend this book for history fanatics."},{"Title":"The Chosen: The Hidden History of Admission and Exclusion at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton (.)","review":"The Chosen is, simply put, fantastic. This is nonfiction that reads like a novel--a riveting page-turner. I found myself cheering the heroes and booing the villains while learning the history of the United States from a new perspective: the deepest bastions of power and privilege in America. It's all here: from the anti-immigration movement, to WWII, the Cold War, to feminism, civil rights, and the rise of the market ethos. This is the story of how America -and especially its elite--changed over the course of the twentieth century."},{"Title":"The Chosen: The Hidden History of Admission and Exclusion at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton (.)","review":"In \\"The Chosen: The Hidden History of Admission and Exclusion at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton,\\" Jerome Karabel describes the evolution of admissions at \\"The Big Three\\" from one that is based on an examination to one that is now based on a wide range of criteria that permits admissions officers to select applicants who serve their immediate institutional interests. (The \\"opacity\\" and \\"discretion\\" of admissions, in Mr. Karabel's words). At first, this shift in admissions was to protect the WASP ascendancy (\\"the stupid sons of the rich,\\" in Harvard President Charles Eliot's words) against Jews, but slowly over time, driven by three charismatic and powerful reformers who were each responding to particular crises in American history (Harvard's Charles Eliot during the Progressive era, Harvard's James Bryant Conant during the Depression, and Yale's Kingman Brewster during the Civil Rights Eraj, the admissions policies of the Big Three were designed to defend and justify, augment and promote America's free enterprise system that sacrificed \\"equality of condition\\" for \\"equality of opportunity.\\" Throughout this process, the Big Three defended their institutional interests and promoted their hegemony in the American education apparatus at the cost of higher ideals (social justice, intellectualism, equality, education, \\"meritocracy\\"), and the political differences of every one of its Presidents (who themselves were loyal gifted products of the system) came down to how to best defend institutional interests.Towards the end of this meticulous and detailed (to the point of cumbersome and overwrought) history of the evolution of the Big Three's admissions offices, Jerome Karabel argues two interesting points. First, while today's admissions policies are certainly more fair than in the past when these schools stigmatized Jews, refused to accept students in need of financial assistance, heavily discriminated against minorities, and did not accept women, it is certainly not meritocratic in any strict sense. Tradition, institutional interests, and powerful constituencies influence admissions to ensure that legacies (the children of alumni), athletes, and disadvantaged minorities occupy almost half of the slots -- everyone else must compete hard for the rest, forcing parents to fret on the best strategy once the baby is in the womb.The second point is even more interesting. Even if admissions were truly meritocratic it would still be unfair because the word \\"meritocracy\\" is subjective and has been used to disguise blatant social inequality and injustice in America. Besides pleasing its traditional constituencies (the alumni, the faculty, coaches, and feeder schools) the Big Three, to protect and promote their brand, must also be able to recruit and educate America's next generation of leaders, and to that end they focus more on a person's extra-curricular strengths than intellectual capacity (the Big Three have a fastidious fear of intellectuals, whom they assume, often quite correctly, will end up either as academics, alcoholics, homosexuals, manic depressives, or all of the above). The poor cannot afford extra-curricular activities in the arts, music, dance, and theater, and they certainly cannot afford to pay for expensive SAT schooling and college counselling. In this way, the Big Three are not only perpetuating the class divide in America, but also disguising it with the false consciousness of \\"equality of opportunity.\\"If this sounds a bit too Marxist that's because there's definitely a leftist academic perspective running through the book I constantly argued against. Why wouldn't the Big Three engage in self-serving institutional practices, and as private institutions that seek to maintain and expand their brand why wouldn't they seek to admit students from powerful families, constituencies, and groups who will become influential politicians and powerful businessmen? Also, it is still impressive that rather than just decaying and dying these institutions could engage in the continual process of self-invention.I think the book would be much more convincing and powerful if the author added another point to his litany of complaints: the current admissions policies DO NOT serve institutional interests. First, admitting legacies is the university's traditional way of managing its financies, and it's more than just satirical that throughout the book we read how institutions with hundreds of millions of dollars in the bank run into financial hardship when it upsets alumni. I kept on thinking to myself: why don't those Ivy League idiots learn to manage their institution properly? More important, the heavy emphasis on admissions means there's not enough on education: faculty members can complain that the admissions office is not recruiting enough academically-qualified students without considering whether or not there's something wrong with their pedagogical practices.I attended Yale College in the late nineties, and I was struck by how financially mismanaged the university was and how it's possible to graduate from Yale without a solid foundation in reading and writing, which is after all the two hallmarks of a liberal arts education (many of my classmates obviously did not understand what they read, and even had difficulties constructing a coherent sentence). If Yale did not have a powerfully recognizable academic brand and seemingly limitless financial resources, it would also not be a socialist incompetent autarky where everyone was encouraged to live in his own deluded petty world.Despite their problems and failures, the Big Three still continue to play a significant role in American society, and if Mr. Karabel hopes for more equality and social justice then his suggestions on how to make admissions more equitable -- eliminating affirmative action for legacies and athletes, eliminating early admissions, and welcoming the poor -- is not enough. Ultimately, the very power and influence of the Big Three must be reduced, but given their ability for self-invention, the status of their alumni, and their meritocratic image, the probability of that happening is the same of a poor white boy from New York City getting into Harvard."},{"Title":"The Chosen: The Hidden History of Admission and Exclusion at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton (.)","review":"Professor Karabel wrote a very fine book. In it, he examines in great detail the history of preference and privilege at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton. At times, I got a little exhausted with all of the details--but that's only a minor quibble.He writes most approvingly of the 19th century Harvard President, Charles Eliot. Not so approvingly of Lowell, Conant, and some of the other succeeding Harvard presidents. He's an equal opportunity critic of the three colleges scrutinized. He does offer up, approvingly I might add, the gem of a quote from Eliot referring to, \\"The stupid sons of the rich.\\"He details the long history of anti-semitism in the admissions policies of the 3 schools. Additionally, he covers the decidedly \\"unmeritocratic\\" practices of favoring alumni legacy applicants--as well as athlete applicants. He covers the evolution of the treatment of blacks at the 3 schools from blatant, racist exclusion to the present, favored policy of racial affirmative action at the schools. The history is both shameful and hopeful. The very fact that the schools have apparently ended their past anti-semitic and racist policies is most hopeful.However, at the end of the book he briefly covers the one group that is presently the most egregiously mistreated group: poor and working class whites. Apparently, there is little, if any, lower class preference shown for admissions at the 3 schools. The only class preference that is manifested is through the lens of race preference. This is a great shortcoming of the 3 schools. If they truly wish to be viewed by the public as non-elitist schools, they need to provide some sort of reasonable outreach to poorer whites. The poorer white children of Appalachia, the South, the Rust Belt, the Mountain West, etc., are deserving of opportunities to enter these powerfully prestigious schools. They, like most black and latino children in this country, definitely do not have \\"equal educational opportunities\\" commensurate with those of their richer and privileged urban/suburban counterparts.The author believes that these class based discriminatory practices are the most profound and difficult to overcome at these elite schools. It's hardly surprising, given such glaring unconcern, that poorer and working class whites frequently grouse about the indifference of such \\"liberal elites\\" to the working, white poor. They may not always be correct about a whole lot of things--especially the stuff spoon fed to them by the likes of Limbaugh and Hannity--but on this one, there is a great deal of truth to the charge.A very good book, albeit a little long. The only other quibble that I would have with it would be a desire for a little more early American history relating to the 3 schools. I recall having read an account in the last year or so that the early students at Harvard--or it might have been another ivy league school--were ranked not on the basis of academic performance, but rather their family's socioeconomic status. If so, that would highlight their early educational mission. It would also fully explain why an obvious intellectual lightweight, like George W. Bush, would ever be admitted as an undergraduate to Yale, and as a graduate to the Harvard Business School.I'll close this out with some lines from the \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" movie spoken by the great actress, Jane Darwell, who won an oscar for her portrayal of Ma Joad:\\"Rich fellas come up an' they die, an' their kids ain't no good an' they die out.

Karabel skillfully weaves social and political developments in the United States into his narrative about the way three Ivy League colleges responded by modifying their admissions policies. For example, when nativist sentiments swelled around the time of the first world war and anti-immigration movements grew in force, these Ivy League colleges responded by modifying their admissions policies to block \\"undesirables\\" from enrolling. When the civil rights and the subsequent feminist movements made universalism so salient a norm that race and sex discrimination could no longer be countenanced in major institutions, the Ivy League colleges responded again by changing their policies. As a work of organizational analysis, two themes stand out. First, the top leadership of these colleges had a tremendous impact on how they responded to contemporary events. New leaders sometimes made wholesale replacements in their admissions offices, and turned things around very quickly. Others heeded the call of their alumni constituencies and slowed the process of transformation. Second, although he never uses the phrase \\"neo-institutional analysis,\\" Karabel demonstrates that these socially significant organizations were thoroughly embedded in the socio-cultural events of their times. Regardless of what their leaders or their constituencies desired, the Ivy League colleges had to respond, at least symbolically, when their environments changed. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in a detailed and nuanced analysis of the perpetuation of elite privilege in American institutions."},{"Title":"The Chosen: The Hidden History of Admission and Exclusion at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton (.)","review":"For a scholarly written book with a mind blowing topic, this manuscript needed a forceful editor who could have easily chopped it in half. In doing so, THE CHOSEN could have become a mass market best seller, instead of having the limited audience that it now enjoys. It would then possess the influence that it deserves, but will never achieve.The ESSENCE of the BookThis is the unbiased story of college admissions principally at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton for hundred years of the 20th century. There are 557 pages of narrative backed up by 116 pages of footnotes. The book boils down to a confrontation between the Protestant Establishment that seeks for approximately 100 years to limit Jewish enrollment at America's most elite universities. The book covers in detail the feeder schools (Andover, Exeter, Groton etc) which were and are the private prep schools that represented the so called power elite in America.There came a time in America when scholastic achievement achieved by Jewish individuals of Eastern European or Slavic descent completely overshadowed the intellectual achievement of the inheritors of America. Although NOT the product of a CONSPIRACY, an intervention would have to take place to limit Jewish enrollment.America's elite universities as they saw it were in danger of being over ridden by people of enormous intellectual ability but who were otherwise incapable of providing the legacy endowments that the colleges felt they were completely dependent upon. It was further believed that if the Protestant elite decided not to attend the so called Ivy League schools, than the reputations of these schools as the last bastion of wealth in America would be permanently lost.So What To Do?In 557 pages author Jerome Karabel who is a sociology professor at UC Berkeley takes you tediously through each step that each of the Ivy's went through in each of the decades of the 20th century to deal with this problem. Karabel has ferreted out the original studies that the schools did, the internal arguments they went through, the vast efforts they made to disguise the problem, and re-categorize it so that outsiders would not know what they were looking at, if an investigation were undertaken. Public investigations did happen in later years.In essence, admission to the elite schools would no longer be made on the basis of scholastic achievement alone. The decision was made that a new discriminating factor would be used to justify EXCLUSION. It was called then, and it is called now CHARACTER. Now character can mean just about anything, and that's the point. By including the concept of character, and its justification in the Admissions Process, the Ivy's were able to justify just about any selection they decided to make. The concept of character can also be referred to as non-academic criteria, and once you open the Pandora's box that contains criteria like this, just about any student who you want can be given the green light. You can also substitute the word MERIT for character, and again you must ask what is meant by this word. In both cases the word(s) is being used to limit enrollment of what are deemed to be excessive numbers of every class of people but the ones that the universities are desperately seeking to enroll.The Big Three knew that in the end as time marched on, the number of students who could demonstrate high SAT scores plus the ability to pay full commission would be limited. This led inevitably to the schools decades later accepting female candidates not for altruistic reasons, but because they represented another potentially rich source of wealth from which to select. There were also certain children of very wealthy parents that had decided they wanted to attend a school where women were present. It must also be acknowledged that as the century moved on, the initial Jewish problem because the African-American problem, the affirmative action problem, and the Asian problem as well.Karabel's analysis is brilliant, documented, and spot on accurate. His sources are impeccable, and one cannot argue with his thesis. It has been said often for the last 20 years, where have the people of brilliance gone to. The types of people that we saw at the founding of the American Republic, or during the FDR Administration or in the Manhattan Project. The answer is that our Presidential candidates are now an amalgam of the standards that we see set by what is documented in this book. Allow me to give you a few of the insights from this marvelous piece of scholarship:* The whole basis of the new system was to be able to create COVER for the admissions officers to accept or reject whomever they wanted.* It was necessary for the whole admissions process to be perceived by all outsiders as JUST.* During the 105 year period covered by the book, a graduate of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton was President of America for 44 years, and that does not include the second Bush who was a Yale graduate.* Initially at the turn of the 20th century, the elite schools were able to keep undesirables out of the system by demanding a knowledge of Greek and Latin which was not taught in the various public school systems, thus generating automatic exclusions.* Both James B. Conant of Harvard, and Kingman Brewster of Yale who were both Presidents of their respective schools were committed to the concept of merit as a means to preserve the status quo. Brewster's ancestors came over on the Mayflower by the way, a remarkably small social group.* As remarkable in today's society as it sounds, in the first half of the 20th century, the gentleman's C reigned supreme at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton. Grades were considered third in order of importance. Club life was considered primary, and campus activities were second in importance, and then grades.Conclusion:I gave this book four stars only because of the lack of a serious editor who could have worked miracles on the manuscript. Had the book been cut in half, author Karabel would have done us all a favor. As it is, it is a wonderful read for a very serious topic and a very serious book. If you have an interest in this topic, than THE CHOSEN should be number one on your list of books to read, and thank you for reading this review.Richard C. Stoyeck"},{"Title":"The Chosen: The Hidden History of Admission and Exclusion at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton (.)","review":"In my view, this is one of the most important books published in America in the last ten years, perhaps longer. The issue is not merely Harvard, Princeton, Yale and their admission policies, but, at its base, how America came to be what it is. This book makes clear that the elite institutions of higher education have mainly functioned as clubs where the sons, and now daughters, of the wealthy and otherwise privileged can steep for four years while they learn their roles of leadership and social ascendancy. We are playing, in other words, in a fixed game where no amount of \\"merit\\" by some students, however brilliant and dedicated, could lead to admission. The course of this nation, its best jobs and opportunities, have been determined by unseen hands trying to protect the advantages of their class.Why is this subject, so important to our national character, one that has been little commented on before this monumentally thorough work? For one, if you did not attend one of these colleges, negative comments can be seen as mere carping, the whining of someone who \\"wasn't good enough\\" to go to one of the very best schools. Those who go there, in turn, are not inclined to attack the hand that has offered them a pathway to the good life and a leg up on the mere mortals who study elsewhere.The elite colleges hide their admission policies behind the notion of \\"meritocracy\\" when, in fact, merit means anything they want it to mean. Those policies came about only when it became apparent, in the 1960s and \`70s, that preserving elite colleges as fortresses for the wealthy would no longer work. Prior to the latest changes, discrimination on the basis of race, religion and economic background was rampant. Now, it is merely moderated and changed in form. A kid born in the back woods of Mississippi has about as much change of getting into Harvard as he does becoming a brain surgeon or astronaut.It seems fundamentally right, and American, that the best students should have the opportunity to study with the best professors. Yet, who is to decide who is best? This book makes clear that for much of their history, these colleges have served their masters, the Anglo-Saxon elite of the east coast, much more faithfully than the causes of education and scholarship.. Further, as the author correctly points out, deciding on \\"merit\\" inevitably means that almost everyone born to lower economic classes, where the opportunities for education are less and family conditions can serve to prevent academic accomplishment, means that those who are not born to wealth are still left out in the cold.Harvard, Princeton and Yale are among a dozen or so institutions where an undergraduate degree labels its holder as vastly better than graduates of other colleges. This means, quite simply, that someone of equal intelligence and study habits starts professional life a step or two behind someone who graduated from those schools. Is this the kind of system we want in a democracy? In effect, we are condoning a system that rates hundreds of thousands of people second rate.To be certain, the influence of the most elite of our elite institutions has faded considerably. The vast university system in California holds its own, in so far as its outstanding graduates are concerned, with the schools of the east coast. The state university system, with schools like Michigan, Virginia, Maryland and Texas allow students from more humble backgrounds to advance far beyond their parents accomplishments in life. None, however, automatically confers the prestige, and open doors to employment, that four years in an Ivy can offer, unless you consider the state universities' regionalized \\"spheres of influence\\" where graduates are welcomed warmly by employers.This does not make education in America even roughly equal, however. We continue to have a vastly disproportionate number of US presidents from the Ivy League. Even Bill Clinton, with Georgetown on his resume, rounded out his college years by three spent at Yale Law School. In 2000, we not only had two Ivy League men running for president, both were graduates of exclusive prep schools, places where blacks, Jews and others were often turned away and the poor could not afford.Perhaps the most outrageous of the current practices of elite colleges is what I call \\"affirmative action for rich guys\\". Its called \\"legacy\\". It means if you had a parent who attended that school, your academic qualifications need not be as high as someone whose father was a truck driver. Whether you like president George W. Bush or not, legacy (and prep school) is how he got into Yale and, in turn, how he got to be president of the US. There are some people who believe, even today, that this kind of privilege for the privileged is right and the proper way for the world to work. I don't. In fact, our country is founded on the notion that we prove ourselves by what we do, not by who our parents were. The legacy of open pathways for the \\"well born\\" is that of Kings and Queens.Legacy admissions means that hundreds of deserving students are turned away from the Ivy colleges every year so that the son or daughter of a prior graduate can attend. It means that people of merit have to take a back seat to people of birth, just like in jolly ol'England. It means that someone of first rate intelligence and scholarship is labeled second rate by the social aspect of college attendance.This book is the best study we are likely to get about how these three elite colleges came to be, how they grew and how they faced the challenges of change and living up to their grand names. If you are Jewish or black, the book might make you very angry and, I say, you have a right to be. The more important issue, however, is whether we, as a nation, should allow these elite institutions to play a deciding role in picking our future leadership and wealthy classes. I say it is long past time for a change.This is cultural and social history at its best. A back cover blub by Arthur Scheslinger, Jr. cites the book as a study in how the Big Three have democratized themselves. I would argue that it shows, instead, how they have morphed their culture of privilege to mimic democracy while ensuring that their fountains of money flowing from wealthy alumni never cease. That they get away with this, as with past sins, without even strong criticism, much less complete national opprobrium, is a scandal in itself.

No wonder. Near the end of his weighty (711 pages) history of admission - and exclusion - at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton, Jerome Karabel concludes: \\"It is no exaggeration to say that the current regime in elite college admissions has been far more successful in democratizing anxiety than opportunity.\\"In this climate, his tome actually comes as something of a relief.First, it is not a \\"How to\\" guide. There are far too many of those already. The Chosen offers no promise of unlocking a secret formula for entry - though the skeleton key against a black background on the cover is an ominous reminder of how impenetrable the iron gates of these ivory towers have been to so many for so long.Instead, Karabel, a Berkeley sociologist (and Harvard graduate), confirms that the decisions made at these elite universities as to who they will accept and who they reject, are, in fact, as inscrutable as they seem - and have been since the 1920s.It was then that the current system was devised in order to restrict the number of Jewish students on campus - to give these schools, as Karabel writes, \\"the latitude to admit the dull sons of major donors and to exclude the brilliant but unpolished children of immigrants.\\" Admissions criteria were purposefully designed to be opaque, allowing the schools to shape incoming classes as they saw fit.And one of the book's more surprising revelations is how little has changed in the intervening years. Call it tradition.Though the intended outcome has evolved - from admitting fewer Jews to achieving greater diversity - the underlying system has not, much.The movement from objective exam-based criteria to a subjective personalized approach began in the '20s - when letters of recommendation and personal interviews were first used to size-up ineffable qualities of \\"character.\\" They're with us today, as are the personal essay, bubbles to mark demographics, and details of extracurriculars, also introduced at the time.Rather than admitting students according to an academic definition of \\"merit\\" - as the schools had done in the past with subject tests, and as elite universities in countries like Japan and France continue to do - the \\"Big Three,\\" as they were called then, developed a character-based construction of merit.While the traits these schools deemed meritorious have shifted with the times, their base in \\"character\\" has held steady.Princeton, in 1921, valued some of those qualities Cecil Rhodes looked for in his vaunted Rhodes Scholars, including \\"manhood\\" and \\"brutality\\" (assets that graduates of private prep schools like Andover and Groton were credited with possessing in abundance, while Jews, public school students, and, of course, women - admitted by Princeton only in 1969 - were not).In a broader turn, Karabel uses admissions policies as a lens to examine privilege and access in the last century. Within his story of admissions at these influential schools, he shows how a slippery definition of merit has conformed to changing cultural and social values.Xenophobia, anti-Semitism, and the eugenics movement, which marked the '20s, bled into the Ivy League in the form of discrimination against Jews. A push for a version of merit that hewed more closely to intellect coincided with a fear of falling behind the Soviet Union. The Civil Rights movement formed the backdrop against which black and other minority students and women were finally granted entrance.It should come as no surprise that racism long girded much of the discussion behind admissions-office doors at these bastions of white, Protestant wealth. But somehow reading archival excerpts from alumni letters and remarks by university presidents is still shocking.In 1922, to ensure no Jews slipped in, Harvard asked applicants: \\"What change, if any, has been made since birth in your own name or that of your father? (Explain fully.)\\" As added insurance, photos were required. Meanwhile, Yale's student paper proposed its school request photos of applicants' fathers as well.Some six decades later, in 1988, a US Department of Education investigation into alleged discrimination by Harvard against Asian-Americans turned up these notations in applicants' files: \\"short with big ears,\\" \\"seems a tad frothy.\\"Those who work in the field today talk about perpetual political vying: There's the generous alum with a college-aged daughter. The band leader who needs a tuba player. A faltering football team searching for a quarterback. A drop in the yield of Latino students.In the end, no one but the admissions officers forming a given class can truly know what makes someone Harvard or Yale or Princeton material in any year.In Karabel's estimation, the perception that these elite schools have achieved a meritocracy is an illusion. Whether that's the ideal is almost another discussion.The point is, as much as it defies dearly held beliefs about opportunity in this country, that sort of system doesn't exist, and hasn't for a very long time."},{"Title":"The Chosen: The Hidden History of Admission and Exclusion at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton (.)","review":"One of the great rituals and testing grounds of American life comes in one's junior year of high - school when one begins collecting the recommendations, the personal essays, the college- board scores for application to college. The dream of many middle - class American parents is that their children will enter an elite university, and thus have a real leg up on the future.In this pioneering study three most elite universities, Harvard, Yale and Princeton are studied in regard to their admission's policies. And the myth of the complete objectivity of the selection process is seriously undermined. For there are other factors involved in the choice including family 'legacy' and ' money' and these mean that the children of the elite have a far greater chance of being part of the elite than do the children of the 'man- on- the street'.Karabel shows how prior to the twenties admissions was a matter of passing a fairly simple written test. But that when Jewish students multiplied the Admissions people introduced measures to restrict their numbers. The whole complicated business of recommendations, personal essays etc. was introduced for the purpose of keeping the elite universities as Wasp as they could be.However with time 'demands' changed, and admissions policies were generally adjusted to meet the needs of their time. As Adam Kirsch writes in his perceptive review of this book in 'The Sun'.\\"As he takes the story of Big Three admissions through the upheavals of the 1960s, the rise of coeducation, and the controversies over affirmative action, Mr. Karabel insists that the way the universities defined merit always depended on the kind of student body they hoped to attract. When they wanted rich WASPs, merit meant character; when they wanted future Sputnik designers, it meant brains; when they wanted higher minority enrollment, it meant diversity. The only constant, Mr. Karabel concludes, was money: Today, like a hundred years ago, the vast majority of students at elite colleges are from affluent homes. Not unless the class barrier were dismantled could a perfect meritocracy, so crucial to the promise of American life, become a genuine possibility.\\"Nonetheless it seems to me it is clear that 'merit ' does play a considerable part in the Admissions policies of Elite universities. The tremendous rise in the number of Asian students in American Universities comes not because they have alumni parents, or because those parents are of the Fortune 500 , but rather because the young people worked harder, and achieved more.This book is a detailed , comprehensive study of a major issue in American life. And for anyone truly concerned to know how the best and brighest are chosen it is a must read."},{"Title":"The Chosen: The Hidden History of Admission and Exclusion at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton (.)","review":"Focused too much on the top three elite universities in the U.S., this book dissects how their admissions policies and procedures developed and evolved from the late nineteenth century. It's startling to read just how UN-elite their admissions policies were during that time -- they didn't feel they had the choice or duty to seek out the truly gifted, instead they focused on getting the sons of those already wealthy and powerful even if they were third-raters academically. Only 10% of those at these colleges were intellectual, interested in studying, and those were viewed by the college administration as \\"grinds\\" not really useful to the colleges' goals of producing the social and power elite of the country. These colleges were in-grown, taking their admissions people from their own alumni, thus perpetuating the system. When Jews and other outsiders used the increasingly excellent public school system to become academically superior candidates to the sons of the WASP elite, an admissions system focused on legacies (sons of alums), athletics, and 'leadership potential' was developed to avoid admitting these hoi polloi that 'gentleman' wouldn't care to associate with. It's interesting to me that these colleges never simply excluded these 'undesirables' per se, just made it extremely difficult for them to gain admission. They excluded applicants from whole parts of the country, like those from public schools anywhere near NYC, instead, vigorously encouraging those from a handful of elite private schools (who seem to have excluded 'undesirables' for them). Many of the people making these decisions seem not to have been particularly anti-semitic; they seem instead to have felt that admitting more than some percentage of Jews (~15%) would 'destroy' their college's ability to raise money and be where the 'right sort' would go.The book tells its story very well, with massive documentation. I would have liked more about how the Irish and Italians fared (they seem not to have faced very much organized discrimination?), and the sections late in the book on women, blacks and Asian-Americans were useful but not as thorough. There were many fascinating and some horrifying characters and amazing stories about these colleges. It was not stressed enough, I think, that there were other universities which did see their role as educating academically motivated students. MIT, for example, was during this era all about educating the working-class and immigrants for useful technical and scientific careers.Anybody who wants to understand how admission to the Ivy League and other elite colleges got the way it is, and how these three evolved at last into a bit more of real universities rather than social clubs, would find this book fascinating. It's also of interest to anyone interested in fathoming one aspect of antisemitism in the U.S. during this period. It is long, even if the back notes are more or less ignored, but a fascinating read."},{"Title":"The Chosen: The Hidden History of Admission and Exclusion at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton (.)","review":"In this exhaustive study a relatively mundane and narrow subject is brought to light and, amazingly, made interesting and readable. This was a hard task. The question of race and college admissions is one that is of modern relevance and the author here selects the original 'blacks' of American colleges, the Jews, to analyze the question of minorities. Jews came to be represented far beyond their small numbers in the 'big three' colleges in the 1860s and 1870s. The college deans wanted a 'solution to the Jewish problem' and the devised all manner of ways to reduce the percentage of Jews, that had reached some 25-30% in some places. They introduced a number of 'old boys clubs' admissions policies that took schools away from merit based entrance. Hence the first quotas and first affirmitive action.The rest of the book analyzes the struggle for equality in admissions and for women, Jews and other minorities to gain entrance to America's elite schools. But this is more than a book aboutt his subject, this is a book about America. Harvard, Yale and Princeton are microcosims of the nation as a whole. Important people and national leaders such as TR and FDR all passed through these doors. Therefore in studying just the Harvard Crimson one gains an insight into Americana. This is social history at its best from a time when there really was a WASP culture.Seth J. Frantzman"},{"Title":"The Chosen: The Hidden History of Admission and Exclusion at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton (.)","review":"Karabel has written a terrific social history, with a vivid caste of characters and jolting revelations from college admissions files. Starting around 1900, he takes Harvard, Yales, and Princeton through various phases of inclusion, selectivity, and discrimination, to today's modified meritocracy. Applicants to the \\"Big Three\\" and other elite schools now have to jump high academic hurdles, but the schools give special admissions \\"tips\\" to groups such as athletes, alumni children, and minorities. The system excludes most low-income students who don't have the \\"cultural capital\\" to compete (a fact that worried Harvard deans back in the 1960s though Karabel does not make much of that).In the spirit of open disclosure and good manners, I must thank the author for letting me see several chapters before publication; they helped me with my own, related book, AIDING STUDENTS, BUYING STUDENTS: Financial Aid in America. We don't, though, entirely agree.When the universities do try to reach out, Karabel does not always acknowledge it. Starting in 1998, Princeton replaced student loans with grants for low-income students and then all aided students. Karabel dismisses this as \\"hardball\\" competition.He cites Harvard President Lawrence Summers' confession in 2004 that elite universities enroll too few low-income students, while neglecting Summers' simultaneous announcement of a \\"summer academy\\" and other plans for channelling disadvantaged students to Harvard.Karabel says next to nothing about how elite institutions should alter their admissions requirements and teaching. Nor does he give due weight to the huge disparities in primary and secondary schooling between America's middle classes and the poor, making it hard for the poorest to graduate from any four-year college, let alone Yale."},{"Title":"The Chosen: The Hidden History of Admission and Exclusion at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton (.)","review":"I started to write a review about this book but then realised I could not say it better than what Andrew Hacker said in the Journal of Blacks for Higher Education---\\"&lt;EM>... is breathtaking book, built on an acute sense of history, rigorous research, and original insights into how higher education affects and reflects the larger society.

Missing are the current exclusion policies that almost totally prohibit American patriots, Republicans and conservatives from entering these universities. Karabel notes that 35 of the Harvard class of 41 died in WWII as against none in Vietnam of the class of 1970, but interprets this only to mean that the sense of duty and sacrifice in elite universities is in decline.So why is the number of conservatives miniscule among the students of these universities? The answer lies in admission policies. The interviews and essays root out conservative, patriotic applicants and tag them for rejection regardless of academic brillance and scholarly performance. What is wanted is potential international leaders developed from students who will accept European \\"progressive\\" ideas, possibly study abroad or work in international organizations. William F. Buckley would be rejected today by Yale. The acceptable white male applicant will be tall, urbane, athletic, politically correct in orientation, reasonably intelligent, and preferably well-connected. Middle-class and lower-class white males from conservative backgrounds need not apply. If a graduate chooses military service, then the university has failed miserably, either in admissions or during the four years of conditioning.Karabel misses these current issues by a wide margin. Hopefully he will pick up where he left off, discuss the situation of the last twenty years, and give us thoughts concerning the future.

Over the next few years, they seem happy together though Will who studied law was bored. When he had an opportunity to join a traveling troupe, he leaves his spouse and children behind though he sends money and visits infrequently.Will's fame as a writer begins to grow, but on one of his trips home, his boyhood pal, the odious arrogant Richard Quiney, who even tried to boorishly seduce his friend's wife Anne, is murdered. The corpse is found in the Shakespeare garden. The constable assumes Will, being cuckold, killed the man in a crime of passion. Anne believes otherwise and is determined to prove her spouse is innocent. As the list of those with motives to kill the loathsome Richard seems to grow, almost as if the entire town and surrounding villagers had a reason to murder him, the killer watches Anne to insure she does not get to close to the truth.MURDER IN STRATFORD is as much an amateur sleuth tale as it is a historical fiction novel. The story line is told from the perspective of Anne but not just about the who-done-it but her life even before Will courts her. This enables the audience to obtain a full picture of her and much insight into the Bard. Her investigation is fun to follow but takes a back seat to her life's story so much so that Shakespeare lovers and the Elizabethan crowd will appreciate this fine tale more so than those who prefer a pure mystery.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Five Star First Edition Mystery - Murder In Stratford: As Told By Anne Hathaway Shakespeare","review":"Anne, the wife of William Shakespeare, recounts her life with him from their marriage in 1582 to his death in 1616. Her observations mainly center on her relationship with Will since she most often was tucked away in the country town of Stratford while he followed his calling in London. The murder occurs toward the end of the story when an attractive but unpleasant neighbor, Richard Quiney, is killed in Shakespeare's garden. Will is accused of the deed, leaving Anne to figure out who, among all those who held a grudge against Richard, was the real perpetrator.Although we know little about the historic Anne, Peterson illustrates some of the obstacles Elizabethen period women faced. Upon marriage, a wife could not control her own money and property, and girls had little access to the type of formal education available to boys. On a whole, however, the book reads more like a fictionalized history lesson than engaging literary piece. While it is full of interesting details of, for example, the life of company actors and the London theaters, or the schemes of various known personalities, the rich flavor of the time does not come to life. Often the characters use modern or 19th century working class speech expressions. And the insertion of Anne's opinions and her synopsis of many of Shakespeare's plays sound like the comments of an English teacher rather than his country wife.In her short Afterword, Peterson refers us to a book by Ian Wilson, \\"Shakespeare: The Evidence,\\" to find out \\"what's true and what isn't\\" in the story.

I was first introduced to Corrine's book when I started using an insulin pump about 11 years ago. The book is well researched, there is not much that it doesnt contain.

Get ready to start flipping pages, because you cannot search for the term.Shame on you, Random House Digital! Next time, try using a markup language on your source content that allows for multi-channel publishing. Put the tables out as text, not graphics.

So I was very disappointed to find that neither tool was enabled for this book. Turning the Kindle to make the book wider only makes the print smaller, so that doesn't work either.Again, the content of this book is good and very helpful, but the Kindle version is a waste of time unless the reader has eagle eyes and enjoys flipping pages to find specific items."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Food Counts, 7th edition","review":"This book's data on fat and carbohydrates is insufficent for modern diets. It does has a lot of other useful data, some useless data, and is missing a lot of expected products.The biggest problem is the way fat is listed. Saturated fat, unsaturated fat, and trans fat are all lumped into a single number for total fat. This makes the book inadequate for Atkins or South Beach dieters. You can't tell good fats from bad.The listings show total carbohydrates, and dietary fiber, but they don't show net carbs, or sugar alcohols. This is important for dieters and diabetics since many of our specialty foods are sweetened with these substitutes. Of course, the book generally omits diet foods, so this may not matter.There is no information about vitamins or minerals.It does contain a lot of useful information about basic ingredients that are often sold without nutritional labels (for example, fresh meat and vegetables). There's also a lot of information about foods served at chain restaurants, which is useful for deciding to where to go.The bulk of the data seems to have been copied from prepared food product labels. This isn't very useful, since I can usually just look at the package, though it is sometimes convenient. It's even less useful for the obsolete products.A lot of obvious expected products are missing. I can't find any mention of diet soft drinks, diet meal bars, diet shakes, low-carb foods, or liquor. Beer and wine are mentioned, but in poor detail. Beer has only two entries: \\"regular\\" and \\"light\\". If they can devote 4 pages to different brands of fully-sugared soft drinks, they could at least tell us the differences between a stout and an india pale ale. Wine is a little better. They list desert, red, rose, and white. However, I find it difficult to believe a sweet white zinfandel has the same numbers as a dry chardonnay.This book wasn't a complete waste of money, but I still want something better."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Food Counts, 7th edition","review":"I love the complete nutritional values and the quick look-up for so very many foods.

It's 900 pages long, too thick and bulky, about the size of a fat novel. Not exactly portable. Ideally it should be pocket sized. And a hard or laminated cover, maybe with a ring binding, would be ideal.While it has the exact listing I'm looking for three quarters of the time, and an approximate listing most of the rest of the time, it has way too many superfluous entries for branded & packaged foods (which as another reviewer notes always have nutrition info on them anyway) and restaurant menus (which while occasionally useful, since some restaurants don't make their nutrition info readily available, is still just gumming up the book with superfluity.)Another huge peeve I have with it is that while the entries for a particular food can go on for several pages, the serving size information is usually listed only for the very first entry (unless there's an exception) which forces you to flip back - oftentimes several pages - to find the head of the entry. Listing the serving sizes at the top of every new page the item is listed on would be a keen idea.The measurement units also differ from food to food, sometimes from item to item within the same food category. Cups to ounces to pieces. A little confusing. Standardized measurement would be helpful. Having both the Metric (g/ml) and English (oz/cups) values consistantly listed together would be really great, too. Make it easier and clearer, please.Anyway, this is still a useful book. In lieu of a better option (something way more portable, concise and consistent) I would still buy it. I didn't do a lot of research when I got it, and still haven't examined alternatives. I use software now to do most of my nutritional counts. This book is just a helpful auxiliary resource."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Food Counts, 7th edition","review":"how many of us know basic food nutritional values? how many of us know what restaurants and processors put in their offerings and the effect upon our nutrition?while some purist reviewers may balk at having ALL information at their disposal, i, for one, do not. i bought the original years ago and continue to update (as branded and restaurant offerings change or disappear) to this day.my partner uses weight watcher points system and this volume is invaluable. ignore the naysayers, you can never learn or have enough knowledge about what you dump down your throat!!"},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Food Counts, 7th edition","review":"We have been using this book for about a decade, and appreciate that it does seem to include every morsel of food in a supermarket aisle.To consider which foods are BEST for our health, we'd really need to compare, well, apples and oranges. But for this purpose the measurements in this book are wonky: one sort of fruit is measured in ounces, for example, and the next in cups! Sure, I can calculate that comparison, but since it's already on the package, I don't need a book to do that. Please save me the calculation--please list EVERYTHING in 1 oz. portions, and I will do the rest.

It's good for dieters, health buffs, young and old.Whether you are well or ill, the book will help guide youto health or maintain current health. The volume rates bothgenetic and brand name foods. In my own experience, it isimportant to read labels. Sodas can vary from 12 gms. of sugarto 50 gms. of sugar per can. This is a huge variance withdisastrous consequences for people in a pre-diabetic state.The book lists food characteristics accordingly:- calories- protein- carbs- fat gms.- cholesterol- sodium- fiberThe average person needs between 1700-2500 calories per daydepending upon a variety of assumptions. i.e. lifestyle,couch potato v. athlete, height/weight, man/woman , muscle massetc.During the day, the difference between a pie and a smallscoop of peanut butter is significant. The pie has 30 fatgrams ; wherein, the peanut butter has 6 fat grams.These differences have important consequences for dieters.The book is well worth the price charged for purchaserswho intend to apply the contents dispassionately.

She's welcomed and it all seems like a friendly place, but after the master of the house is killed in action, his brother John arrives from England to take over. He latches onto Katie with overbearing desperation and, when she tries to run away, he shears her hair and rips her clothes and keeps her a prisoner. But she quickly thaws and they have fun...then she blows cold and leaves....and then thaws....and then blows cold....and then....well, you get the idea. There's an HEA, but you'll wonder when/if it'll ever happen because our two protagonists are uncommunicative as well as being inexplicably volatile and/or brain-damaged.As far as I can tell, Carol Franz has only 1 book to her credit. After reading this, I can see why. I do have a theory how this got published in the first place: the manuscript crept off the slush pile, clubbed an approved manuscript over the head, stashed the body behind the radiator, and took its place.First of all, the backstory! This book has epic amounts of backstory and exposition, even about people who don't matter. Who really cares what John's (supposed) father's twagic wuv life was before he married John's mother? It had no bearing on the story since we barely see the guy. Even events that are summarized adequately earlier on are then expanded upon later with absolutely nothing new to influence the plot (what there is of it).Second, the lack of historical detail. The Civil War is referred to a few times and serves to bump off some characters, but this might as well take place anytime, anywhere for all the depth it has. The story doesn't stray beyond Seal Harbor and New York City for most of the book, but there's even little detail about the city. The setting is restricted to a fictional fashion house called \\"Forbes Exclusive\\" where the CEO Joel Forbes recruits his workers from a place called the Samaritan Refuge, where unwed mothers have their kids and are provided for on Forbes' dime with lodging and daycare. Maybe such a setup was all true, but it certainly didn't feel like it because the whole story was written so weirdly.One thing you can't fault Franz is her grammar. Wow, is she ever correct. There's a minimum of contractions, giving much of the dialogue a very stilted and robotic feeling as everyone talks the same. Katie, who can't even read or write at the beginning of the story, sounds like the prize student in 8th grade English. And during the long dialogue scenes (at one point John has a 5-page monologue of his twagic marriage), it's excruciating.And then there are lines of dialogue that don't scan well no matter how you hold the book:As John is looking down at a sleeping Katie on their wedding night--\\"Once I would have ripped the covers from her and taken her without giving it another thought,\\" he smiled to himself. \\"I really have changed -- although right now I wish I hadn't.\\"I LOL'd.And as for all the Europey architecture on the front and back of the book? Yeah...you'll be waiting a good long while and even then you won't be seeing the sights because the European phase of the book is mainly restricted to Katie & John's spat which could have been cleared up with John saying, \\"I was late because I was trying to stop a fight.\\" At one point, he even tells himself that's why she's probably angry, but he won't come out and say it. Why? So we can have Katie mad and John baffled and angry for 40 pages. If the whole book hadn't been so inept, I'd have probably been frustrated. As it was, I was merely amused.This is also a book that has two \\"deep\\" moments in their relationship that hinge on baby ducklings. For realz.I know some things make a book automatically DO NOT READ material, and this one has a married hero who cheats with the heroine (though technically his wife abandoned him and he has no idea where she is).Seriously, it has to be read to be believed. I certainly can't do it justice with this review. It's inept, but earnest, and so I have to give it an extra star for the Ed Wood factor alone."},{"Title":"If Not for Love","review":"I HAVE READ IT 10 YEARS AGO&iexcl;I LIKE IT SO BUY I"},{"Title":"Adams : Character in Time : The US Presidents","review":"The plays in the History's Project's &quot;Character in Time: The US Presidents&quot; series are interesting and informative and, above all, very readable.

The writing is quintessential Faulkner, with all particularities of southern dialect and narrative that tries to stay close to the protagonists' mental musings. The story is remarkable and intriguing in that the interpersonal relations between different characters aren neither predictable nor straightforward. In particular it eschews facile delineation between various parties in the war, and no individual fits into a stereotypical category. Sometimes the closest friendships are between those who should be the worst of enemies, and at other occasions those whom you regarded to be close confidants that in the end betray you. These are in fact all too familiar circumstances in most of our lives and in all generations. It's what makes Faulkner's novels so timeless and valuable to read."},{"Title":"The Unvanquished","review":"The Unvanquished is an excellent book, which depicts life in the South during and after the Civil War. The title means &quot;the undefeated or the unconquered,&quot; and Faulkner expounds on this topic. One by one, the characters are defeated by either disillusionment, selfishness, or vainity ,and only one character withstands the terrible effects of the war: Bayard. Faulker does a remarkable job depicting the emotions of Southerners during this time and uses great imagery."},{"Title":"Paper Tangos (Public Planet Books)","review":"Judging on somebody's personal experience is not reviewing the work of that person.To review a book, one must have a working understanding of the subject matter, the time and the circumstances.Anybody familiar with the multiple layers of the tango world in Buenos Aires might understand that many dimensions coexist in the same temporal space without ever intersecting or even come close to share the same circumstances. Thus, the author's confessional style of writing describes her experience among a particular group of left wing militants who happen to make a living teaching tango far away from the mainstream. Add to that the fact that the author carries the deep scar of a sexual abuse perpetrated upon her at an earlier age, and her take on what she experiences in her tango journey is definitely tinted by feelings that most people can't relate to.The book reveals the experience of a group of people connected with each other at a certain moment in time by their acquaintance with the author. Her purpose is fulfilled as she expresses her experiences in an entertaining narrative. To see more than that, to try to patch a history of tango in any way, shape or form, to extrapolate one person's life tribulations into inspirational mantra for anybody embarking on his or her own journey or to consider this book as anything else as the personal experience of the author, would be mistaking substance with symbolism because tango is a very personal matter which should not be used as a prop but as one's own way of life."},{"Title":"Paper Tangos (Public Planet Books)","review":"Did the reviewer and I read the same book, see the same flipbook inside? Thanks to him (and I'm sure he's a him), this book isn't out of print, which I think it soon will be, as the Argentine tango becomes more and more popular, for many of the reasons Taylor describes. It's a dance for the times, and the times require presence and balance, if there are to be any more times. I thought it was a lovely book, that I will reread, as complicated and as poetic as the tango I am only just beginning to learn. I'll bet he hasn't been trout-fishing either, a close relative -- two disciplines of mind and body that require deep attention and grace."},{"Title":"Paper Tangos (Public Planet Books)","review":"An odd little book about a former ballet dancer dancing tango in Buenos Aires. The author describes herself as blonde and beautiful. She marries and divorces an Argentine man, but it's all in the background of her consuming tango obsession. With disjoint time and amost hallucinatory digressions into the emotions brought to the surface by tango, this reads a bit like &quot;Trout Fishing in America&quot; if it were tango instead of trout. There is a flip book built into the pages where a tango turns first into a violent attack and then into sheets of falling paper. This low-tech animation wordlessly caputures the themes in the text."},{"Title":"Paper Tangos (Public Planet Books)","review":"Paper Tango is such a lovely book.

I recommend this book to anyone who wants to strengthen their faith and learn how in adversity to trust in Jesus Christ."},{"Title":"100 Prison Meditations: Cries of Truth from Behind the Iron Curtain","review":"I admire Wurmbrand's compassion and his temerity when his faith is under fire. Wurmbrand's life is a wonderful example of what it is like to die for what you believe. Many of us don't know what it is like not to have the freedom of religion. In some countries, people get arrested, imprisoned, tortured, and murdered for merely saying &quot;Jesus is Lord.&quot;Nevertheless, there are some things that are very dangerous about this book, so dangerous in fact, that it could be a danger to one's faith and salvation. Many Christians will pick up this book thinking that this author will have much wisdom to impart gleaned from his harships. If anyone reads this book without discernment, it could lead them into all sorts of heresies that concern the nature of God, the condition of salvation, and the blood atonement.The book does in fact in many ways read like a poorly written devotional, frequently taking isolated passages and reading them out of context. As with most devotionals, the intentions are good, and the principles taught are often sound, but they are taught using bad hermeneutics. But sometimes the priciples can in fact be very unsound. For example, the author will reason that the Hebrew contains no verb meaning &quot;to have&quot;, and therefore being possessive about material things is wrong. Or &quot;God of Abraham&quot; in Hebrew is really &quot;God Abraham&quot; because the Hebrew contains no &quot;of&quot;. Thus there is no real ontological distinction between God and Abraham or God and Isaac or God and Richard Wurmbrand! Doesn't that sound confusing? Consult with any expert on Hebrew concerning the accuracy of Wurmbrand's assertions as well as their implications.There are numerous references to mystical and Jewish traditions. Some of the stories from Jewish tradition are simply interesting and don't make bad reading at all. But in many other cases, Wurmbrand borrows from occultic elements of Jewish tradition such as the Qabala. For example, Wurmbrand comments on the mystical meanings of Hebrew letters, especially as they occur in the sacred names of God. He'll comment on the significance of the letter Aleph, which, since it is often a silent letter, symbolizes the serenity of God, which sounds like standard Qabala.There is worse. Wurmbrand often goes rambling on about the spiritual significance of poverty and suffering and seems to overglorify it. A few times, he will teach that a Christian is called to a lifestyle of poverty, or that it is wrong to possess money and property, without reflecting on the positive spiritual significance that wealth might have as well. So it seems that wealth to Wurmbrand connotes greed and never God-given responsibility associated with wealth. He goes so far as to call poverty the entranceway into the kingdom of heaven.Many times, Wurmbrand will emphasize oneness with God to the point of confusing intimacy with ontological oneness. Most Christians believe that they will be spending eternity in admiration and worship of their creator and savior. Wurmbrand, however, makes this astonishing statement: &quot;Don't stop at being a second who merely adores and obeys the first&quot;. His emphasis on oneness with God seems to be pantheistic. Yet unlike most pantheists, God still seems to be personal. He seems to reject the bold arrogance of claiming to be God even though that is precisely what his teachings concerning oneness imply. He condemns self-esteem and teaches that the self doesn't really exist. He also seems to teach that becoming one with God is like a drop falling into a bucket. He seems to portray an eternity spent with God as existing outside of time, space and physicality. Wurmbrand does not consider how that undermines the physicality of the resurrection, since eternity is spent in such a resurrected body.Worst of all, Wurmbrand makes this astonishing statement about the blood atonement: &quot;A man who smugly accepts Christ's dying for him and shouts Hallelujah over the innocent Son of Man receiving punishment he himself deserves should be punished more severely than before&quot;. In the context, Wurmbrand doesn't seem to be merely saying one shouldn't look over the crucifixion with a sadistic satisfaction of watching Christ suffer. He seems to be building up a story in which Christ supposedly appears to him while he's in prison and presents him the gospel, which he rejects. Then he says Christ was glad of his rejection and offers an alternative proposal: to suffer with Christ. This once caused me a great struggle because I had once put much trust in the man. Wurmbrand then concludes that the death of Christ was pre-ordained and can neither be refused nor accepted by man, but that one can only choose the privelege of identifying with Christ's suffering. To accept Christ's suffering without identifying with it is abominable, according to Wurmbrand. As sentimental as this sounds, one has to consider what Wurmbrand must mean by identifying with Christ's suffering, and exactly what Wurmbrand is calling abominable. Should the gospel message of atonement really make us comfortable, or is there a teaching saying that we ourselves must suffer? And how unique is the atonement? How does our suffering compare with Christ's? These are all issues that I think Wurmbrand woefully confuses. Wurmbrand seems to give the overall impression that one must become a martyr in order to be saved. And yet even here, Wurmbrand isn't always consistent. In yet another passage, he will use the gospel to bring comfort and satisfaction to a person struggling with doubt.On the whole, I think Wurmbrand's work smacks of mysticism, pantheism, and other dangerous teaching. Also, Wurmbrand contradicts himself, takes scripture out of context, cites questionable sources to proves his point, and presents a mixed bag of messages. Therefore, I would not recommend this book to be read except as a case study in dangerous doctrine. Indeed, it seems from the appearance of things that Wurmbrand is either insane or is not truly Christian."},{"Title":"Matter of Honor H","review":"There have been three novels written over the last five years with the title A Matter of Honor. Eugene Izzi's story under that title deals with Chicago in the throes of racial conflict and features a diverse cast of characters both black and white whose personal agendas intersect in the tragedy of interracial murder and rioting. The central figures, a white homicide detective named Del Greco, brilliant at his job but emotionally remote from an upbringing in foster homes, and his partner Ellis Turner, a black detective with a loving family who has managed to maintain persepctive on race despite facing prejudice daily, are pitted against one another after Del Greco is accussed of racial prejudice and implicated in the murder of a young black who had murdered Del Greco's niece. The complex plot involves a background of black political machination, drug dealers buying influence, crooked lawyers with Mafia ties, a white supremicist organization called the ACK (Ayrian Christian Kinsman), sexual politics among the police, murder for hire, friendship, family ties, and enough quick turns to make the reader's head spin. Ultimately the plot - especially in its denouement - is so complicated and strained as to be unbelievable, but this does not detract from the book's power. The character's, even minor ones, are so good and so believably drawn, that the reader just has to know what happens to them.The book does tend to be somewhat wordy, spending a lot of time probbing various character's thoughts and feelings. But this is handled very well and the information that we get is key to both understanding who these people are and why they behave as they do. This is, despite being a mystery/thriller, a very thoughtful and intelligent book about human emotions and the strengths and weaknesses of the human spirit. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Matter of Honor H","review":"I am still so sad he is gone. I have read all of Eugene Izzi's books and the thought that there will be no more is tragic.

I found the first few sections unnecessary but still interesting reading.There are many SQL scripts referenced by this book and they are only available online (no printed version or CD). Unfortunately, I've had to edit almost every one before I could use it. The problems are various e.g. (1) SQL Server's conformance to ANSI SQL and the way outer joins are written, to (2) they just plain don't work e.g. a temporary 2-column table is populated with the results of a stored procedure that returns 3 columns. This shows me that nobody has actually run the scripts on SQL Server 2005 and that is worrying. I know that once a book is published there is little that can be done until the next edition but the scripts are available online and can (should!) be updated. I also understand that the book was written using a beta version of SQL Server and so changes are to be expected. Again though, the online scripts should be updated. When I am reading a book that says, \\"Includes SQL Server 2005\\" on the front cover, I want to believe that the additional information is well thought out and not just bundled in with other text.The section on page splits seems like it could be important but it's less than one page long and it doesn't tell you how to interpret your findings.The jury is still out wrt how useful this book actually is but I should have a better impression once I have gone through all the remaining sections."},{"Title":"High Performance SQL Server DBA: Tuning & Optimization Secrets (IT In-Focus)","review":"If you're looking for a book about how important good design is (no real suggestions on implementing a good design, just a long talk on how important it is), or a book that covers the basics of performance problem diagnosis, this is the book for you.If, however, you're actually looking for a book that delivers on what the title of this one promises, keep shopping."},{"Title":"High Performance SQL Server DBA: Tuning & Optimization Secrets (IT In-Focus)","review":"I've read Schumacher's Oracle book as well as his articles, and now he's taken that same style over to SQL Server.

Bits of statuary and broken pottery had been discovered through that area for many years. What was unusual, however, was the fact that there weren't just a few statues buried in the ground; there were literally THOUSANDS of them. A whole, vast army of terra-cotta soldiers, horses, and chariots spanned a size greater than 5 football fields, all buried for over 2,000 years.One of the better-known recent events in archeological history was the discovery of the Qin army, buried during the reign of China's first emperor, Qin Shihuangdi. Thousands of life-sized statues, richly detailed and no two exactly alike, were buried by during the first part of his reign. During his life, Qin was on a constant quest to find an elixir of life that would allow him to live forever. Archeologists believe that the army was made to protect the Emperor in the afterlife, should he not find that elixir during his lifetime.A beautiful and fascinating book, \\"China's Buried Warriors\\" is richly illustrated with photographs from the digs. Though they have lost their original coats of paint and are all an earthy brown, each warrior looks profoundly ALIVE, as if he is ready to spring into action at a moments notice. It's almost spooky to see so many determined, read-for-action faces staring out at the reader from the pages.Additional information, such as ancient Chinese history, the system of writing, and theories on how the statues were made is interspersed throughout the book. This information helps the reader who may not be familiar with all areas of Chinese history or archeology. The reader comes away with a profound notion of how long it must have taken to make these statues, as well as unearth them (you cannot simply use a shovel to dig them up, the author reminds us, they must be painstakingly dug out with hand trowels, brushes and small picks).Most books on archaeology leave a reader cold and bored, especially a young reader. What's so interesting about a bunch of clay statues?? \\"China's Buried Warriors\\" clearly is not in the ho-hum, humdrum league of most archaeological writings. The enthusiasm and excitement the author has for the subject is immediate from the very first page, and leads the reader ever onward through the narrative.As a teacher, I've used this book in social studies as a springboard to a great number of topics: China, the past, rulers and emperors, writing, and even death and dying. The text is written clearly and flows evenly from one topic to another. However, very young or beginning readers may have difficulty decoding some of the Chinese words and names.As an introduction or addition to archeology and the study of past human cultures, I can't recommend this book highly enough!! An excellent work!"},{"Title":"Hornes an American Family","review":"An absorbing trip through American history, courtesy of a family of vivid dreamers and high achievers.

Although this book can be used as a stand-alone book it is certainly not best read that way. Basically this is part of a developing series. The first book in the Tibetan series - The Tibetan Book of the Dead, is the fundamental book of the series which describes Buddhist philosophy, psychology and metaphysics. It is the best translation out there and the original! The second book in the series is called Tibets Greatest Yogi Milarepa and is the story of a great yogi who puts into practice most of what we learn from The Tibetan Book of the Dead. It is through the story of Milarepa that we learn more about The Tibetan Book of the Dead. In the story of Milarepa the yogi studies the Seven Books of Wisdom of the Great Path as taught to him by his gurus. Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines, the third book in the series, is an expansion that explains those wisdoms and describes the yoga that is used to achieve them.The Tibetan Book of the Great Liberation is a three act book which ties together everything learned from the other three books. Essentially the start of the book develops a clearer understanding of the metaphysics associated with the first three books in the form of a general introduction. The book then lays out the premise for a type of yoga practice called the Supreme Path or Mahayana, that was created to serve as an INSTANT ENLIGHTENMENT yoga. It is mostly psychological. The middle section of the book is devoted to the guru Padma-Sambhava who brought this yoga to Buddhists in the eighth century. The latter part of the book expounds on that yoga in a full translation.Make no mistake about it. This is the ORIGINAL and best work because this was the man who brought the work to the occident! These texts are ancient and old but have served millions since their inception. The work that Evans-Wentz has done here is substantial if not some of the most important Tibetan Buddhist concepts ever seen by the occident - all directly translated by master gurus whom which Dr. W.Y.Evans-Wentz was a student for years.There is nothing wrong with the translation. Forget those who seek to play down the originals so that they can sell their new version. This book has stood the test of time. It was first published in 1954! The original book in the series was published in 1921! Evans-Wentz was in Tibet at the turn of the century learning under these gurus! He is held is highest esteem by Oxford University for his endeavors!*** The other books in the series are - The Tibetan Book of the dead - Tibets Greatest Yogi Milarepa - Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines - all before this one, the final book in the Tibetan Series. ***"},{"Title":"The Tibetan Book of the Great Liberation: Or the Method of Realizing Nirv=ana through Knowing the Mind","review":"Having returned to this marvelous work recently after an incident in my life required it, I was shocked to be reminded of the disturbing foreword, which detracts from the majesty of the actual work and Evans-Wentz's accompanying interpretations.Without dwelling too long on the foreword, written by Donald S. Lopez, Jr., let me say that it strikes me as one of the most long-winded, derogatory and self-serving forewords I have ever seen in a book; not to mention the fact that the foreword is advertised on the cover of this edition. Donald Lopez insults Evans-Wentz on every page and goes on to tear down Jung, as well.There are genuine reasons for why marvelous works by men such as W.Y. Evans-Wentz stay in print, and they go far beyond the bruised egos of stoic/pedantic academics like Lopez. When so-called Buddhist scholars, such as Lopez and Thurman, project themselves as arrogant intellectuals, it contradicts everything that Evans-Wentz stood for.Oxford University Press should be ashamed for pulling in a voice so anti-thetical to the spirit of this work. The work, itself, is awesome and is hindered only by the hypercritical Lopez touch."},{"Title":"The Tibetan Book of the Great Liberation: Or the Method of Realizing Nirv=ana through Knowing the Mind","review":"These books where written in the following order by the same author. All the books contain a vast use of the English grammar because the books themselves are based on a vast grammar. That vast grammar is the grammar of mind which is vast. This vast use of grammar is used to help the student expand their own mind. Get a dictionary ready. Put the work in. Attain the goal. Then use the goal. It is not worth just attaining it. Nourish it by using it and encouraging it. It is all a lot easier than it looks.(1)The Tibetan Book of the Dead or the After-Death Experiences on the Bardo Plane: Or, the After-Death Experiences on the Bardo Plane, According to Lama Kazi Dawa-Samdup's English Rendering.This book sets up the basic questions for attaining the goal of 'supreme wisdom'. 'Supreme wisdom' is universal and all knowing. It explains everything - past, present, future among all beings everywhere including man, gods, aliens and ghosts etc. You will be able to attain perfect mental health through it. It will also help you to become a perfect person. You can be whatever you want to be. You do this by letting go of some things that prevent you from understanding the truth. This first book sets up the basic questions for attaining these goals by explaining a Tibetan method of thinking that is scientific/psychological/occult/philosophical through understanding the life/death connecting force which will explain all other forces both positive and negative and transitory. It mainly teaches what the transitory is and where you can find the transitory. The goal of the student is to transcend the transitory. Do that and attain the goal.(2) Tibet's Great Yogi Milarepa: A Biography from the Tibetan ; Being the Jetsun-Kahbum or Biographical History of Jetsun-Milarepa, According to the Late Lama Kazi Dawa-Samdup's.This book expands on the first book, which is all you need to attain the goal. This book is a 'story' about a bad person who becomes a good person through learning various 'yogi' practices and studying various Tibetan 'Holy' teachings. It is Milerepa's life story - a great liberator. If you need to learn more about a person who goes through some of the teachings outlined in the first book then this book is an essential companion read to the first.(3)Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines.This book expands on some of the exercises outlined in the second book, which can also be used to achieve the goal outlined in the first book. Although this book may be considered a bit dangerous if used incorrectly because certain yogi practices require flexing the body and sitting still for long periods time - it is certainly one of the supreme books on practical yoga because of its age, authenticity and results. Get advice from someone who has done yoga first if are going ahead with this one. This book is a companion to the second book and the first. There are no yoga illustrations. It is all just described. Get another book on illustrations if you are looking for pictures or even better - get advice from someone who has done it. There is lots of text here that answer many questions that the yogi may have about the yoga.(4)The Tibetan Book of the Great Liberation: Or, the Method of Realizing Nirvana Through Knowing the Mind.This is the final book in the series and expands on the concepts of the first, second and third books by using a type of 'instant enlightenment' mental yoga. Although the goals of the first, second and third books can be achieved by using this final book in the series the first, second and third books are 'instant companions' if you enjoy the results of this one.As the writers set forth in the four books the goal of 'Super Wisdom' can be achieved by using these four books. The most important aspects of all four books in the series is the use of oneself alone to achieve the goals without any recourse to physical or mental aids. This is important. These books will \\"teach yourself everything you will ever need to know\\". Purely pure through the simply mundane.It is a wise choice to buy these books. It is the opinion of the reviewer that it is one time that money is truly well spent in the quest for the wisdom of all wisdoms."},{"Title":"The Tibetan Book of the Great Liberation: Or the Method of Realizing Nirv=ana through Knowing the Mind","review":"This text has now been published as \\"Self-Liberation Through Seeing With Naked Awareness\\" translated by John Myrdhin Reynolds and published by Snow Lion.

Plenty of psychological commentary by Jung keeps the esoteric interpretation well to the fore, something which I feel makes it easier for Westerners to cope with the devotional aspects of such texts.There are probably many paths to the truth. The offerings in \\"The Great Liberation\\" contain a path which is rich in the wealth of imagery and symbolism yet somehow free from the spiritual materialism which often taints \\"Best Practice\\" teachings.If you liked \\"Monkey Magic\\", you will adore the multiplicity of yarns about the life of Padma Sambhava. The Chinese appropriation of Tibet has caused much much misery and suffering. It seems somehow criminal that we in the West may now benefit from the scattering of Tibetan refugees by having access to such wonderful teachings, even as laymen (and in English too).For anyone with even a smattering of interest in Tibetan Buddhist teachings and mythology, I believe ownership of this book will enrich his or her life tremendously."},{"Title":"The Tibetan Book of the Great Liberation: Or the Method of Realizing Nirv=ana through Knowing the Mind","review":"The title text of this collection of translations has recently appeared in a significantly clearer and better-annotated translation, as \\"Self-Liberation Through Seeing With Naked Awareness.\\" Like the other three books in W.Y. Evans-Wentz's \\"Oxford Tibetan Series,\\" it suffers from a dependence on Tibetan translators working at time when few clear guidelines for translating technical terms had been developed, and from Evans-Wentz's own lack of familiarity with Mahayana Buddhism and its various schools. (Which apparently has not prevented it from achieving its own canonical status with some readers; a process not unknown in the history of translations, from the Christian adoption of the Septuagint in place of its Hebrew original, to some Chinese -- and Tibetan -- renderings of Buddhist Sanskrit texts.)As Lopez points out in his introduction to this new edition (part of an end-of-the-century reissue of the series, in which the publisher formally acknowledges over a half-century of additional scholarship), Theosophy and Hinduism are the real points of departure. There is a commentary to the translation offered by C.G. Jung, which is of great importance to students -- but of Jung, not of Tibetan Buddhism. The historical significance, and sometimes impressive literary quality, of the translation series is enduring; its value as a set of primary sources is not.However, a large section of the book is given over to an (abridged) translation of one of the traditional biographies of the *Lotus-Born Guru*, the \\"Apostle to the Tibetans.\\" In western terms, it is a mix of popular hagiography (like \\"The Golden Legend\\"), heroic romance, and supernatural thriller. So far as I have been able to determine, it is the only English-language version of this particular text (there are other Tibetan treatments of the subject, a number of which have been translated), and it makes fascinating reading, simply as a piece of story-telling.The translation of the story has extensive, and sometimes obsolete, annotations which attempt to tie down the places and times mentioned, but which also recognize that portions, at least, are intended to be symbolic or allegorical (which does not mean that the original audience would not have regarded them as literally true, as well). Padma-Sambhava, besides introducing advanced forms of Buddhist Yoga, is supposed to have written, and concealed for future generations, a number of important texts, including, besides the one translated as \\"The Great Liberation,\\" the so-called \\"Tibetan Book of the Dead\\" (Evans-Wentz's catchy, but potentially misleading, title). He also appears as a major character in some versions of the Tibetan \\"Gesar\\" epic.The presence of this fascinating piece of Tibetan literature may account for the interesting fact that Snow Lion, the publisher of the competing \\"Self-Liberation Through Seeing With Naked Awareness,\\" offers this book in its catalogue as well (as of Summer 2003).Those who find this portion of the book interesting will probably also enjoy the traditional \\"biography\\" of a Tibetan holy man, in \\"Tibet's Great Yogi Milarepa,\\" another volume edited by Evans-Wentz. (It is a companion volume in the Oxford Tibetan series). It presents itself as its hero's own account of his progression from black magician (to avenge his family) to Enlightenment. (There are several editions of the translation available; the 1999 Oxford paperback reprinting, uniform with the present volume, including a new introduction, should be in print at this writing.)"},{"Title":"The Siege of Rabaul","review":"The book is an interesting read. I finished it within 2 hours. Although the topic is heroic (and sometimes sad), i especially found the antics of one Japanese pilot in particular, Masajiro Kawato, funny. The author seems to share this same view, and never hesitates to aim barbs at (and debunk) Mr. Kawato's outlandish claims. I think the word \\"mentally unstable\\" was used numerous times to describe Mr. Kawato.I especailly liked the voluminous photos that accompanied the book. Each page has on average 2 photos, and that helped tremendously to tie human faces to the characters the author is relating. The interviews that the author conducted with the survivors was especailly interesting. It is clear that Mr. Sakaida is a fan of Japanese aviation.I would have given the book 5 stars except for the fact that the book did not have an index.

Loaded with pictures and personal accounts, Henry Sakaida has done a great job illustrating exactly how the aerial siege of one of Japan's mightiest bastions unfolded. The Japanese were convinced a ground assualt on New Britain was inevitable and fortified it in anticipation of the \\"coming of MacArthur.\\" But it turned out to be a wasted effort as the Allies simply cutoff and bypassed Rabaul, leaving it to wither on the vine for the remainder of the war without an American having to wade ashore. It's unfortunate that Rabaul doesn't rank among the names of the easily recognizable spots in the Pacific like Tarawa, Gudalcanal or Midway. But this book helps remind you of how pivotal this place was to the war effort. An easy and informative read that will have you \\"Google-ing Rabaul\\" after you finish."},{"Title":"The Siege of Rabaul","review":"The Japanese port complex at Rabaul, New Britain was one of the most-famous Japanese bases in the Southwest Pacific Theater. Heavily fortified by the Japanese, Rabaul was a key element in the Allied drive to seize the Solomon Islands and would be the scene of ferocious air battles. Eventually the Allies decided to let Rabaul wither on the vine but it remained a hot target throughout the war. Noted historian Henry Sakaida relates the Rabaul story in this 1996 volume from Phalanx Publishing.Rabaul was taken by the Japanese in January 1942 and, in turn, surrendered in September 1945. In the intervening years many Allied and Japanese air units equipped with a variety of aircraft would tangle over Rabaul's airfields and Simpson Harbor. Included in this smorgasbord of units were the Zero-equipped 253rd and 204th Air Groups; the IJAAF's 61st Fighter Regiment with Ki-61s; the 958th AG with Jake seaplanes; the P-38-equipped 39th and 80th Fighter Squadrons (5th AF); the 'Black Sheep' of VMF-214; the 'Jolly Rogers' of VF-17; Navy Avengers, Hellcats and Dauntlesses; 13th AF B-24s; 5th AF B-25s; VMF(N)-531 with its Ventura nightfighters; New Zealand Corsairs; and even VK-12, a little-known squadron that flew 2,000-lb. aerial drones against Rabaul. Rabaul was steadily ground down; some surviving pilots and aircrew were evacuated while many other personnel clung on with dwindling food supplies.Sakaida does a wonderful job of relating the Rabaul saga, touching upon many of the different elements, units and personalities that were part of the experience. THE SIEGE OF RABAUL has it all: low-level air strikes; dogfights; nightfighter ops; famous aces like Boyington, Kepford, Blackburn, Sakai and Iwamoto; POW stories; etc. Sakaida tracked down and interviewed many surviving Japanese and Allied Rabaul vets. Their input makes Sakaida's book especially informative and valuable.The book is illustrated with 100 photographs - some quite rare - of pilots, aircrews, aircraft, strike photos, camp life and shipping.All in all, THE SIEGE OF RABAUL is a revealing, well-illustrated look at one of WWII's most famous air campaigns. Air war buffs will enjoy this one. Recommended."},{"Title":"The Siege of Rabaul","review":"I bought Henry Sakaida's book the Siege of Rabaul as soon as I saw it because I was always curious about what life was like on this fortress island after it was bypassed and supplies cut off. I imaged that it was a living hell with starvation and disease. Much to my surprise, though Rabaul, being an active volcanic island, was known for a nasty smell, the soldiers sailors and airmen stuck on Rabaul in some ways had things better than the people in Japan. New Britain was a large island and the Japanese garrison had the opportunity to grow food and fish. Over time, allied attacks grew less frequent and the garrison dug into bomb-proof shelters. Rabaul wasn't a paradise, being stranded on Guadalcanal or New Guinea would have been much worse. Malaria was a problem. Up to 95% of the Japanese servicemen on Rabaul suffered from malaria."},{"Title":"Operation Roswell: The Novel","review":"Kevin Randle's take on the Roswell Incident lends itself well to a sprawling potboiler of a novel. If you read it without an agenda, it is simply fun! If, on the other hand, you try to accept it as a fictionalization of actual events, then you will probably get embroiled in details and miss out on the enjoyment. Personally, I don't know if the Roswell Incident occurred, nor do I care. I have read enough about it and seen enough on TV to have a passing familiarity, so I never got lost in the novel. What I did enjoy was Randle's characterizations of Harry S. Truman and Maj. Gen. Curtis LeMay. Putting two such powerful personalities in a closed room and letting the sparks fly was enough of a hoot to carry the rest of the book--even when I wasn't all that thrilled with the details.For the record, there are two things that bothered me about Randle's research. First, was having a jet fighter in 1947 equipped with air-to-air missiles. Uh-uh. Our only jet fighter in 1947 was the Lockheed F-80 and it was equipped with six .50 caliber machine guns, and a very primitive radar ranging device for the gunsight. At that time, there were rockets that could be slung under a fighter's wings, but they were for air-to-ground use, and didn't enjoy anything near pin-point accuracy. Second, Randle does a fairly good job with a shoot-em-up near the end of the book, but spoils the scene by having the 'reek of cordite' hanging around after the shooting. Uh-uh. Cordite was used for only a very short time, well before 1947. At the time of the novel, the smokeless propellants were light-years ahead of cordite and had a very different aroma.Those nits aside, I liked the book and plan to advise several of my friends to buy their own copy."},{"Title":"Operation Roswell: The Novel","review":"First off, I am not a believer in the Roswell \\"crashed UFO\\" story. There is no doubt in my mind that a rancher recovered some unusual debris from an aerial object in the New Mexico desert near Roswell in 1947. Similarly, there is no doubt in my mind that the source of the debris was a top-secret \\"balloon train\\" flight of Project Mogul, which was designed to investigate acoustical techniques of detecting Soviet nuclear explosions (remember, the Soviets had not yet tested an atomic bomb at the time). All of the recent hype about a crashed saucer and small extraterrestrial bodies found in the wreckage and alien autopsies and mysteriously silenced witnesses is, in my opinion, just that--hype.With that said, I still found \\"Operation Roswell,\\" taken simply as a science fiction tale, to be a good read. I had no trouble \\"suspending my disbelief\\" for the sake of the story. Author Randle does a good job of weaving together factual and fictional plot elements into--mostly--a rousing good yarn. His inclusion of real historical figures, such as General Curtiss E. LeMay and President Harry S Truman, adds verisimilitude, and the other characters are well-drawn, individualistic and interesting. I very much enjoyed about three-fourths of the book. However, I was disappointed with the \\"shoot-\`em-up\\" ending. I agree with another reviewer who observed that Randle apparently had a hard time figuring out how to bring his story to a close, so he threw in an alien attack and some gratuitous gunplay that were in no way foreshadowed. Yes, the ending was a surprise, but not in a good way.Still, on balance, \\"Operation Roswell\\" was a pleasant diversion. You don't have to be a believer to enjoy it. I recommend it if you're looking for an interesting \\"niche\\" science fiction story that nicely integrates elements of the real and the unreal in a reasonably exciting way."},{"Title":"Operation Roswell: The Novel","review":"Warning---Spoilers below!I'm a huge fan of the UFO/Alien novels that have been coming out lately. Read the entire Area 51 series and loved every single book. Operation Roswell had all the key elements in becoming a great book until, I read the last couple of chapters. Disappointing is the least I can say about this story's ending. It was like he had no idea how to complete the book and decided \\"What the hell...I'll make them into blood thirsty Aliens. That would make a great ending and it catch the reader off guard!\\" No cigar, man. I had started to connect with the living Alien and the author was great in expressing how the Alien was feeling while being held captive. I really wish he had made it that they somehow communicated with it before he/she/it passed along. The author never quite explained where the blood thirsty aliens came from. Only the protaganist's speculation was explained. Nothing outstanding came out of the autopsies and I was really hoping for something groundbreaking to them. All in all, borrow this book from the library like I did. You'll be sorry if you bought it."},{"Title":"Operation Roswell: The Novel","review":"As for the truth behind what happened at Roswell, I really have no opinion either way. Although I do like this genre of book, the sort of 'what if' type of book in regards to UFO's, this book failed to deliver completely. It seemed like it was very jagged in its presentation, and above that, boring.Each chapter seemed to start with the same basic intro, and ended on the same. It just wasn't a fun book to read."},{"Title":"Operation Roswell: The Novel","review":"In the summer of 1947, many people claim they witnessed unidentified flying objects soaring in the proximity of the White Sands nuclear testing grounds. The crafts show up on radar. As far as the American military is concerned, the UFOs perform operations light years ahead of anything the US Air Force can execute such as almost instant acceleration and deceleration and on a dime curve maneuvers.President Truman assumes that the desert show is just that a clever hoax as he concentrates on the real menace, Stalin's Soviet Union. However, to ease concern, especially with an election next year, he assigns General Curtis to do whatever is necessary. Fire first and damn the consequences LeMay orders his pilots to shoot down one of the crafts. Soon luck occurs near Roswell as a triangular shaped craft with no wings crashes. Four dead humanoid aliens are inside, but one survived. Truman orders a full cover-up to prevent a public panic even as the craft and its occupants are taken to Nevada where LeMay insures a nuclear weapon remains on stand by alert.OPERATION ROSWELL is a fun and plausible fictionalized account of the famous Roswell incident. UFOlogists and the ET crowd will enjoy this well written action thriller that uses real people to add to the feel of authenticity. Kevin Randle may be a believer, but he insures that doubting Thomas and Thomasina will enjoy the story line yet find the plot quite feasible, making this a novel for anyone who relishes the \\"truth is out there\\".Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Operation Roswell: The Novel","review":"It's pretty well done, if it drags a bit in places. I was reminded while reading of a (possibly apocryphal) story (that she swore really scared her friend) from my ex-wife that a friend of hers got lost at the Pentagon and happened into a room that was supposed to be locked but the door was open - and there in a glass cylinder of fluid was a creature like that described in Operation Roswell (though no mention of the fangs). I saw a UFO once myself when I was 15, walking outside one night with my mother. We saw it together.I spent some time talking once, by accident really, with those two guys who said one of them had gotten abducted while out on a logging crew. Those guys said that inside the ship was nothing at all like the movie.This story. Well, if that's how it really was, ...but that's hard to believe. Sort of a cross between \\"Gremlins\\" and night of the vampires fallen from outer space. Hard to fathom how an extraterrestrial could be adapted to our biology enough to use our blood for meals. And the energy dynamics of growing a living organism are highly endothermic - it takes quite a bit of energy. How could all those replicants have been grown like that? Seriously, the total blood volume of the few people identified wouldn't come close. The creatures seemed to just live on blood. Sure, you had 22 people listed as missing, but even then, that might give enough energy for maybe one critter. Although, who knows - maybe it's a designed critter. But even then, thermodynamics needs to add up somehow.Seems implausible by the end. It doesn't answer how the creatures were killed. The hero watched the underground detonation of the a-bomb from a mile away, and is inside a tunnel that is connected to the complex that got blown? Hmmm. Well, perhaps possible if the blast sealed the tunnel shut, sinced it was circular. But if the hero lived, and the creatures were in the tunnel ahead of them all the way, as described, then the little vampire critter-kids survived too; they were tough little buggers for sure..."},{"Title":"Operation Roswell: The Novel","review":"Kevin D. Randle is known primarily for his non-fiction books dealing with the U.F.O. phenomena (The Crash at Roswell,The Abduction Enigma), but has also written series of science fiction (Jefferson's WarandThe Exploration Chronicles).When I saw that he had written a novel based on the purported U.F.O. crash at Roswell I had to pick it up. Though I tend to think that what crashed was an experimental weather balloon, I still have an interest in flying saucers. I figured since Kevin had both the background research from his non-fiction work and he had a number of fiction books under his belt, the combo in Operation Roswell should really be something.On that, I was disappointed. The story is inherently fascinating. A craft not of this earth crashes outside of a tiny New Mexican town that just happens to be the home of the world's only nuclear bomber group. And though it is fiction, there is the tantalizing prospect that what you are reading might be true!Unfortunately Kevin Randle is not a competent fiction writer. The writing tended to be simplistic and repetitive. For example: *On almost any other base, it would have been impossible to find drivers, that is privates or corporals, who had top secret clearances. But at the home of the only nuclear strike force in the world, many people, because of the 509th's mission, had top secret clearances. It made it easy to find drivers with the necessary clearances.* See what I mean? The entire book follows this pattern. Information is given, then over explained and repeated usually within one paragraph. As a result, the book felt overly long and plodding.What's worse is that while certain things were repeated, details were almost always left out. All those little touches that would have given the book the flavor of the 1940's (things like what kind of car they were driving or what their clothes looked like, what song was on the radio or what have you) were always skipped. As a result, though the story takes place in 1947, you wouldn't be able to tell that if it weren't for the chapter headings and references to World War II. All of the little touches, slang of the time or references to what was then current pop culture that can give the best historical fiction a feeling of verisimilitude with the time they are presenting were missing.Some folks don't like the too much description, but here there was almost none. It was especially unforgivable for the scene of the visit to the crash site itself. This should have been the centerpiece of the book. But even here detail was pretty light. Reading this, I wasn't sure: Were the aliens naked? If not, what were they wearing? These details are important. After all, we are being asked to accept and understand something not of this Earth. We should at least understand what they looked like. Description of the ship was handled a little better.I had this book on my TBR stack for a while and was really looking forward to reading it. But as I got down to less than a hundred pages from the end I was so frustrated with it I considered tossing it aside unfinished.I would consider reading Mr. Randle's non-fiction. I don't doubt he knows more about U.F.O.s and Roswell than I do. But if you are looking for a fictionalized account of that famous U.F.O. crash, I'd recommend Whitley Streiber'sMajestic(and that one's no masterpiece either)."},{"Title":"Operation Roswell: The Novel","review":"Kevin Randle, having examined everything known about the actual Roswell incident in his other books, has given us a fictionalized account in Operation Roswell, using just enough actual people (General Curtis LeMay and President Harry Truman, for instance) to make it seem plausible. At least, to make you wonder if it could have happened this way. What I liked about the book was that it started from a completely different point of view from the usual accounts of Roswell. The whole incident really hit the public when Jesse Marcel went public in the 1970s about the debris field, and about the cover-up, where his military bosses had him pose with a weather balloon, and put out the story that it was only a balloon, not a flying saucer, that had made the debris.But of course, the real story begins long before that, when the craft itself was somehow brought down in the Arizona desert. We also know that \\"flying saucers\\" had been observed by the public and by the military prior to this incident. The author tells the story through the eyes of those who first found the crashed saucer and those who were tapped to investigate the crash. Behind the scenes, orchestrating the investigation, was General Curtis LeMay, who is shown as ruthless in his pursuit of enemies of the US. In his mind, aliens were the worst kind of enemies, and that attitude drives the story. Yes, the President knew about it, but he left the solution in the hands of Gen LeMay.The aliens are interesting and very different from us, but we (and the book's characters) never learn much about them. We don't know where they are from or why they are here. While it's probably realistic to think we probably would be unable to communicate with beings from another planet, the unknowns feel like loose ends in this story. The ending is unsatisfying and while the story postulates that no one ever learns the real truth, it seems unlikely that the violent solution of General LeMay would escape detection.Still, this is an imaginative story line and I enjoyed the book. I recommend Kevin Randle's book about the real Roswell,The Truth About the Ufo Crash at Roswell, for a picture of what we know about the real incident."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"The charcters in this book were dulll and foolish. The first character, Sir Francis Hinsley, hung himself after being laid off form the studios. My second example was Dennis Barlow the young English poet. He came to California to make it big as a poet. That was unrealistic dream that never was going to be accomplished. MR. Joyboy was another ridiculous character. Instead of having confidence in himself and coming out and saying to Aimee he had feelings for her; he hinted to her by arranging corpses to have a smile. Mr. Slump was very underdeveloped. He had dreary dialog and very dissapointing. He gave the bad advice to Aimee to commit suicide. Aimee Thanatogenos was the most feebleminded character in all of the book. She wrote to the Guru Brahmin for advice concernig her love life. She followed the advice of Mr. Slump and killed herself. She was very absurd to follow ridiculous advice. I felt all the charcters in the book lacked good judegment and sense."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"I do not think that this was a very good book.

The author spent so much time trying to create an image in my head that I sometimes got lost and can't remember what the story is about anymore. I like things straight to the point with just a little description on the environment. That's how I like it. Secondly, I didn't like how the book made fun of the funeral industry. I was brought up to have great respect for the dead, so this book offended me very much. But I do have something good to say about it. Other than all of the bad things I have said about this book, I truly enjoyed the story. All of the surprise twists was the only thing that kept me from throwing the book away. Also, I loved the poetry in the book. So to be tuly honest, I guess it wasn't all bad."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"I found the book, &quot;The Loved One&quot; to be very amusing. Although, I struggled to stay focused on the plot and the story the author was trying to relate. I found myself getting frustrated and bored by how descriptive the author was at times, such as the first time Mr. Joyboy entered the funeral parlor. I realize that an author is trying to be very descriptive in order to bring the reader into the scene, although I needed less description and more action to keep my interest.The book was amusing in the sense that it described a very dedicated individual who loved his work. Mr. Joyboy felt that he had to satisfy his customers even though they were dead. I felt the book took a turn for the better when Mr. Joyboy fell in love with the cosmetician (Aimee Thanatogenos). The book shows that all types of people in any possible place can find love.In summary, this book will be worth reading to most people who enjoy a funny descriptive love story.

The beginning of the story does not seem to have any connection to the end where some of the ideas begin to make sense. It takes place mostly at the Whispering Glades cemetery where employees are required to refer to the corpses as loved ones. A man who works there is in love with a cosmetican and shows how he thinks of the relationship by making the corpses smile and look sad before she works on them. And another man who is in love with her also lies about his identity and claims he is a poet by copying love poems and sending them to her. At the end she gets confused and the writer of a local column tells her to kill her self and she does which shows utter stupidity in her character.

Then I saw the problem. I have a Vintage Books edition where the first words of a chapter are in caps. The last word of the first sentence is \\"HAD\\".

I could smell the grass and feel the mist from the morning dew. I could see the tombstones and visualize the different parts of the cemetery. I think that Evelyn Waugh is a good writer because he can describe the features and characters of the people and surroundings. However, I think that the book was not at all as recommended. I think the book was boring. It had no funny lines at all. It was so dry I wanted to get rid of it! Personally, if dealing with a cemetery, I would write about action. The worst part was when Mr. Joyboy took Miss Thanatogenos to see his mom. There was no action taken by the characters with the situation that was going on. My grandmother passed away not long ago. And I find that in dealing with death, you can't find comedy in it unless you're sick.

A sick story about a sensetive topic, death."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"\\"This is a purely fanciful tale, a little nightmare produced by the unaccustomed high living of a brief visit to Hollywood.\\" Thus, Evelyn Waugh begins \\"The Loved One,\\" his macabre comic send-up of Hollywood, the Funeral Industry and Post World War II Southern California with a one-page preface entitled \\"A Warning.\\"\\"The Loved One\\" begins with the usual cast of Waugh characters. There is Sir Francis Hinsley, an aging Englishman who, when he first arrived in America more than twenty years earlier was the only knight in Hollywood, President of the Cricket Club and chief screenwriter at Megalopolitan Pictures. Now in decline, he no longer reads, writes or does much of anything except sit in a rocker, read a tawdry magazine or two, and drink whiskey and soda. He lives with the much younger English expatriate, Dennis Barlow, a poet whose one literary success earned him an invitation to Hollywood where his screenwriting career quickly dissipated. Barlow now works at the Happier Hunting Ground pet cemetery, an embarrassment to his English colleagues in Hollywood. As the actor Sir Ambrose Ambercrombie tells young Barlow, in a sort of recasting of the White Man's Burden in a thoroughly modern context:\\"We limeys have a peculiar position to keep up, you know, Barlow. They may laugh at us a bit-the way we talk and the way we dress; our monocles-they may think us cliquey and stand-offish, but, by God, they respect us. Your five-to-two is a judge of quality. He knows what he's buying and it's only the finest type of Englishman that you meet out here. I often feel like an ambassador Barlow. It's a responsibility, I can tell you, and in various degrees every Englishman out here shares it. We can't be at the top of the tree but we are all men of responsibility. You never find an Englishman among the under-dogs-except in England, of course. That's understood out here, thanks to the example we've set. There are jobs that an Englishman just doesn't take.\\"The stage thus set, \\"The Loved One\\" soon takes off into a dark comic narrative of the American funeral industry. Sir Francis, no longer wanted by Megalopolitan Pictures, is turned out of his office and shunned. Young Barlow returns home to find that Sir Francis, in despair, has hanged himself. Appropriate funeral arrangements must be made.Barlow then embarks upon his adventure in the funeral industry, making arrangements at Whispering Glades, a full-service funeral establishment and cemetery for Hollywood's rich and famous:\\"Times without number since he first came to Hollywood he had heard the name of that great necropolis on the lips of others; he had read it in the local newssheets when some more than usually illustrious body was given more than usually splendid honours or some new acquisition was made to its collected masterpieces of contemporary art. Of recent weeks his interest had been livelier and more technical because it was in humble emulation of its great neighbor that the Happier Hunting Ground was planned. The language he daily spoke in his new trade was a patois derived from that high pure source. . . . As a missionary priest making his first visit to the Vatican, as a paramount chief of Equatorial Africa mounting the Eiffel Tower, Dennis Barlow, poet and pets' mortician drove through the Golden Gates.\\"In a brilliant comic chapter, Barlow meets first the Mortuary Hostess, who explores burial options with him:\\"Embalmment, of course, and after that incineration or not, according to taste. Our crematory is on scientific principles, the heat is so intense that all inessentials are volatilized. Some people did not like the thought that ashes of the casket and clothing were mixed with the Loved One's. Normal disposal is by inhumement, entombment, inurement or immurement, but lately many people just lately prefer insarcophagusment. . . . That, of course, is for those for whom price is not the primary consideration.\\"After choosing a burial option, there is the matter of selecting appropriate garb for the deceased, viewing the various slumber rooms for Sir Francis' wake, and selecting a burial site in Whispering Glades. As the Hostess explains: \\"The Park is zoned. Each zone has its own name and appropriate Work of Art. Zones of course vary in price and within the zones the prices vary according to the proximity to the Work of Art.\\" And the Park is, of course, restricted to Caucasians: \\"The Dreamer has made that rule for the sake of the Waiting Ones. In their time of trial they prefer to be with their own people.\\"Barlow then moves on to the Funeral Director, who, in a brilliant passage of dark comic wit, explains the benefits of Before Need Arrangements to Barlow, trying to sell him on the need for making his own funeral arrangements while he's young.Finally, young Barlow is introduced to the mortuary cosmetician, Aimee Thanatogenos, and the embalmer, Mr. Joyboy. It is here that the real plot begins, for the second half of \\"The Loved One\\" brilliantly narrates an offbeat love triangle among Barlow, Aimee and Joyboy that ends in a darkly comic way that only Waugh could imagine.\\"The Loved One\\" is a short, brilliant, dark, and funny comic novel that represents Waugh at his best. Read and enjoy!"},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"Evelyn Waugh's THE LOVED ONE is a strange and amusing little book, and as he says himself in a prefatory note entitled \\"A Warning,\\" it is, \\"a little nightmare produced by the unaccustomed high living of a brief visit to Hollywood.\\" Dennis Barlow is a one-hit-wonder poet and failed screenwriter forced to take a job selling and effecting pet cremations and funerals at an establishment called the Happier Hunting Ground. Doing so cuts him off form the snobbish Cricket Clubbers of expatriate English society in L.A.--they would much rather pay to send him back to the motherland than have him disgrace them by association.Waugh also takes several good cuts at the vacuity of American life as exemplified by the heartless film industry and the garish tackiness of the Whispering Glades cemetery (complete with piped in sounds of nature)--a place of rest found enduringly beautiful by Barlow's love interest Aimee Thanatogenos. This mortuary cosmetician's name translates roughly as \`The Loved One, who gives Life to Death. No need for subtlety here as far as Waugh is concerned--this is Tinseltown, after all. More fun names: the virtuoso mortician also in love with Aimee is \\"Joyboy\\" and the advice columnist at the local paper who replies to her several entreaties is \\"Mr. Slump.\\"The characters don't offer much to redeem themselves, but that's the point, and Waugh doesn't waste any pages getting it across. Whether you have gone through the process of making funeral arrangements or not, THE LOVED ONE will prepare you for the sales pitch of \\"Before Need Arrangements\\" and various other details you weren't crazy about knowing but that are dealt with in such a funny, hyperbolized way here by Waugh. \\"A Warning\\" recommends that \\"squeamish [readers] should return their copies to the library or bookstore unread.\\" What a silly thing to do that would be."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"In the past year I have gone back to this bookand discovered it influenced my choice of a career in Funeral Service.

I immediately recalled this book and the Pet Cemetery: \\"The Happy Hunting Ground\\" a fictional employer mentioned in these pages. In reflection of my years of funeral service I many times saw LOVE TRIANGLES. The human side of me found me inclined to participate in such excitement. Lucky for me I resisted. So the love triangle thing is timeless! I found this work to be quite fun the second time around as I first read it in the 1970's, a time when few women were in funeral service. If you are not familiar with funeral service the role of embalmer,poet and cosmetologist, continue to this day. This will live on for many more years. These pages are still current today. Be forewarned, the work is a brutal introduction in the details of what goes on in the Funeral Home.Funeral Directors should find this book particularly funny. If you have ever been in funeral service please purchase this book and be entertained."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"The Loved One is a tale of great hilarity, serving mainly as anecdotal work to the body of Waugh's satirical efforts. It is not as polished or well targeted as some of his other works, particularly &quot;Brideshead&quot; or &quot;A Handful of Dust&quot;, though this is largely due to the fact that he is writing about Hollywood rather than the English society with which he was eminently more familiar. With one of the better endings in the top 100 of modern fiction, this book is a must read."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"This marvelous satire looks at contemporary life in Hollywood and sees at its root the absence of a widely diffused, generally understood, high-minded code of manners. Instead, everybody or at best everybody's narrow tribe is its own carver. Consequently, and hilariously, we see installed in highest place the values of Whispering Glades, or those of the Happier Hunting Ground, or of the ungrateful Hollywood studio executives, or of the toadying British expat \\"community.\\" To the gimlet-eyed Waugh, this rampant subjectivism is not true freedom but a kind of modern wandering in the dark. Such a dour vision, though, becomes the source for his high spirited, wonderfully heartless comedy."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"Evelyn Waugh is considered, with Vladimir Nabokov and John Updike, one of the supreme stylists of the English language of the last 100 years. In The Loved One, a long short story posing as a novella, he takes his eloquent style and pits it against a scabrous Hollywood backdrop, rife with hustlers, health freaks, narcissistic actors, ruthless producers, a vast wasteland of moral bankruptcy. The protagonist, Dennis Barlow, is a British poet, who lauded with literary awards in England, moves to Hollywood to make it as a screenwriter. His first project is to write about the life of the poet Shelley but alas the film project doesn't catapult him into Hollywood fame. To the contrary, his imbecilic screenplay outcasts him from the industry so that he has to work at a pet mortuary. When his older friend and once successful screenwriter Sir Francis, also a British ex-patriate, is fired from his writing job and kills himself, Dennis must make funeral arrangments at Whispering Glades where he meets and falls in love with a mentally imbalanced mortuary cosmetician, Aimee Thanatogenos. The woman in turn is in love with the creepy embalmer known as Mr. Lovejoy. Barlow resorts to plagiarizing classic poetry to win her heart with disastrous consequences.All of this ludicrous plot is just a vehicle for Waugh's misanthropic depiction of Hollywood. This is savage satire not for the faint of heart. Mercifully, Waugh ends his jaded novel at less than a 170 pages.If you're new to Waugh, you might start with his masterpiece A Handful of Dust."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"I didn't really know what to expect of this novel since is is thought of as one of Waugh's minor novels. After reading The Loved One, I can't see why this is considered one of the lesser works. The Loved One is one of the most hilarious and true novels I have ever read. Waugh is wise to some of the darker aspects of human nature, and he possesses the ability to open up the readers eyes to that reality.The plot centers on a love triangle between Dennis, Aimee, and Mr. Joyboy. All of them work in the funeral industry in Hollywood which Waugh uses to lambaste the commercialism of our culture and the selfishness and heartlessness that produces it. At times, the novel is hilarious, such as when Mr. Joyboy tries to express his love for Aimee through the smiles on the corpses he prepares, but the novel is always dark. These people are trying to find true life and love, but they are in despair and are unable of achieving happiness.The Loved One is an absolutely brilliant novel by of the the twentieth century's great novelists. Certainly, read his most popular works such as Brideshead Revisited (my favorite), A Handful of Dust, and Scoop, but don't let yourself miss this one."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"I lived in California and have a thing for cemeteries and that could be what makes this one of my favorite books. It's a satire on the American funeral industry and the competition between Whispering Glades a send up of Forest Lawn and the Happier Hunting Ground, a pet cemetery. Very funny, wonderful parodies of poetry."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"Waugh is far and away the most unique writer of satire in the 20th century. His bizarre twists of plots never cease to impress and amuse. The Loved One is consistently entertaining, satirical, and comical. Waugh's superb command of the English language--his amazing ability to turn a phrase just so--utterly astonishes me. It is fun to watch for the constant poetical quotes Waugh satirically weaves into this tale. The Loved One mocks Hollywood, America, and the English all at once. I can not put into words how unique and clever this book really is; the scenes Waugh conceives, the wording he employs, the characters he creates, even the names he chooses, all work to create an entirely &quot;different&quot; reading experience."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"I am a senior in highschool- not for long (4 days left! ) and I chose this book as my finale work to finish up my year in AP English- I had no idea what I was getting into. I read this entire book in one sitting- the complexity of the story forced me to turn the pages. The first few pages are a little hard to follow, but the book grabs your attention with its odd subject matter of pet cemetarys and beuticians for the dead. This book is truly a work that must be read by anyone who wants to understand satire from all angles. I recommend it to you, but beware of its perverted absurdity."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"&quot;This is a purely fanciful tale, a little nightmare produced by the unaccustomed high living of a brief visit to Hollywood.&quot; Thus, Evelyn Waugh begins &quot;The Loved One,&quot; his macabre comic send-up of Hollywood, the Funeral Industry and Post World War II Southern California with a one-page preface entitled &quot;A Warning.&quot;&quot;The Loved One&quot; begins with the usual cast of Waugh characters. There is Sir Francis Hinsley, an aging Englishman who, when he first arrived in America more than twenty years earlier was the only knight in Hollywood, President of the Cricket Club and chief screenwriter at Megalopolitan Pictures. Now in decline, he no longer reads, writes or does much of anything except sit in a rocker, read a tawdry magazine or two, and drink whiskey and soda. He lives with the much younger English expatriate, Dennis Barlow, a poet whose one literary success earned him an invitation to Hollywood where his screenwriting career quickly dissipated. Barlow now works at the Happier Hunting Ground pet cemetery, an embarrassment to his English colleagues in Hollywood. As the actor Sir Ambrose Ambercrombie tells young Barlow, in a sort of recasting of the White Man's Burden in a thoroughly modern context:&quot;We limeys have a peculiar position to keep up, you know, Barlow. They may laugh at us a bit-the way we talk and the way we dress; our monocles-they may think us cliquey and stand-offish, but, by God, they respect us. Your five-to-two is a judge of quality. He knows what he's buying and it's only the finest type of Englishman that you meet out here. I often feel like an ambassador Barlow. It's a responsibility, I can tell you, and in various degrees every Englishman out here shares it. We can't be at the top of the tree but we are all men of responsibility. You never find an Englishman among the under-dogs-except in England, of course. That's understood out here, thanks to the example we've set. There are jobs that an Englishman just doesn't take.&quot;The stage thus set, &quot;The Loved One&quot; soon takes off into a dark comic narrative of the American funeral industry. Sir Francis, no longer wanted by Megalopolitan Pictures, is turned out of his office and shunned. Young Barlow returns home to find that Sir Francis, in despair, has hanged himself. Appropriate funeral arrangements must be made.Barlow then embarks upon his adventure in the funeral industry, making arrangements at Whispering Glades, a full-service funeral establishment and cemetery for Hollywood's rich and famous:&quot;Times without number since he first came to Hollywood he had heard the name of that great necropolis on the lips of others; he had read it in the local newssheets when some more than usually illustrious body was given more than usually splendid honours or some new acquisition was made to its collected masterpieces of contemporary art. Of recent weeks his interest had been livelier and more technical because it was in humble emulation of its great neighbor that the Happier Hunting Ground was planned. The language he daily spoke in his new trade was a patois derived from that high pure source. . . . As a missionary priest making his first visit to the Vatican, as a paramount chief of Equatorial Africa mounting the Eiffel Tower, Dennis Barlow, poet and pets' mortician drove through the Golden Gates.&quot;In a brilliant comic chapter, Barlow meets first the Mortuary Hostess, who explores burial options with him:&quot;Embalmment, of course, and after that incineration or not, according to taste. Our crematory is on scientific principles, the heat is so intense that all inessentials are volatilized. Some people did not like the thought that ashes of the casket and clothing were mixed with the Loved One's. Normal disposal is by inhumement, entombment, inurement or immurement, but lately many people just lately prefer insarcophagusment. . . . That, of course, is for those for whom price is not the primary consideration.&quot;After choosing a burial option, there is the matter of selecting appropriate garb for the deceased, viewing the various slumber rooms for Sir Francis' wake, and selecting a burial site in Whispering Glades. As the Hostess explains: &quot;The Park is zoned. Each zone has its own name and appropriate Work of Art. Zones of course vary in price and within the zones the prices vary according to the proximity to the Work of Art.&quot; And the Park is, of course, restricted to Caucasians: &quot;The Dreamer has made that rule for the sake of the Waiting Ones. In their time of trial they prefer to be with their own people.&quot;Barlow then moves on to the Funeral Director, who, in a brilliant passage of dark comic wit, explains the benefits of Before Need Arrangements to Barlow, trying to sell him on the need for making his own funeral arrangements while he's young.Finally, young Barlow is introduced to the mortuary cosmetician, Aimee Thanatogenos, and the embalmer, Mr. Joyboy. It is here that the real plot begins, for the second half of &quot;The Loved One&quot; brilliantly narrates an offbeat love triangle among Barlow, Aimee and Joyboy that ends in a darkly comic way that only Waugh could imagine.&quot;The Loved One&quot; is a short, brilliant, dark, and funny comic novel that represents Waugh at his best. Read and enjoy!"},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"I really don't know what else to say except that The Loved One is cover-to-cover the sharpest satire I have ever read, filled with tongue-in-cheek plot lines and caricatures rather than characters. That anyone could take the death industry and make it seem so self-important and as normal as something like the automobile industry is sheer brilliance. At less than 200 pages, it's a one day read and a very funny one at that. The only conclusion that can be drawn from it is that Waugh probably didn't enjoy his tenure in Hollywood very much, which may be the biggest understatement I could make."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"Authors often use satire to illustrate specific points and show where changes in society need to be made. Satire is most basically the playful act of criticizing flaws with humor and sarcasm. Satire is a useful literary tool which audiences can identify with and understand easily if used correctly; however, satire is a confusing and often misunderstood literary device if the author is vague and imprecise with his satirical references. Evelyn Waugh uses a great deal of satire in his book The Loved One with the utmost care and accuracy. From his statements on the commercialization of death to his ultimate condemnation of the English aristocratic society, Waugh's skill with satire is a rarity that is seldom found in modern writing. Waugh effectively reproaches those who profit off death and those who act as nobles in the modern world through his use of sarcasm and the dark humor created therein."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"This book is the perfect satire on everything including human existence and death. fantastic how anyone can make the subject of death comical yet leaves you with a tragic feeling!"},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"A slim but likeable sort of &quot;twist in the tale&quot; idea becomes bad dream in fairyland - a short book that makes a big impact. Waugh manages to produce a reversal of his usual style - early on he favoured wistful whimsy cut with vicious nastiness, here the nastiness is occasionally spiced with lyricism (Dennis' first visit to Whispering Pines is beautifully mystical and unreal, as is Aimee awaiting the dawn). I don't know who he appears to think less of, the stupid, ignorant, childlike Americans, who have no idea how to make anything worthwhile of their ease and prosperity, or the callous, snobbish and self-obsessed English who think it should all be given them for nothing. The whole novel has the quality of a wierd, sick dream, with a strong sense of unreality when dealing with Americans giving way to seedy realism with the English, and the ending is almost nightmarish - rather odd that the one time it's been filmed it was all played for laughs."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"The American funeral industry deserves Waugh's satire. What I really want to know, though, is why I can't find a video copy of the movie that starred Robert Morse, Jonathan Winters, and Rod Steiger. Also, the story (and the movie) is an excellent companion piece to Jessica Mitford's expose' of the funeral industry, &quot;Behind the Formaldehyde Curtain.&quot; Amazon doesn't have it. Blockbuster and their ilk certainly don't have it. Who does?"},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"I read this book about a year ago and it was only upon stumbling across it recently that I remembered how brilliant it was. Waugh's subtle sarcasm and sharp wit in this farce create an interesting and quirky plot. I absolutely adored how the story and its odd setting were simultaneously entertaining and intriguing, while criticizing the very foundations of American pop-culture. A definite must-read!"},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"This is the one most strange and bizzare books I've ever read , but its very funny if you like dark humor and crazy plots its a must. Also if you can find the movie version of this book you'll go into a hobo's rant, but beware its really hard to find but worth every search engine dead end ! S.T.F. GR &amp; EW"},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"The subject matter, and the authors irreverent style of writing appears to be a turn off to others who have read and reviewed this book. It strikes me that that is EXACTLY what Mr. Waugh sought to evoke from his readership. He could easily have chosen a more &quot;comfortable&quot; subject and not have matter and not offended anyone. I challenge anyone to read this book and to do so with an open mind. Anyone who truly appreciates satire will appreciate the point of this novel."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"&quot; A tricky yet simple book, mixing irony, love, and death to make this a surprising book. One woman two men, what ending will come of this love triangle. One of Waugh's most prolific books yet.&quot;"},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"This book is perfect. Death, romance, conflict, it has it all"},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"This book is great when taken on a literal level and is quite a good read, although not an easy one. However, if one takes the time to look at the amazing satire employed, thay realise that itis truly a masterpiece. I have found various satirical comments on both American adn English society and I am waiting to read more from Waugh."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"Being a fan of sarcasm, I particularly enjoyed Waugh's novel. Although the book had a slow start, I am glad that I didn't give up on it. I got a lot of laughs out of the plot and the characters. I have never been to California, nor do I know a lot about the 1940's, but I could still see where Waugh was coming from when he wrote this. It is an expression of the shallowness of America, especially in the film industry and the whole Hollywood/L.A. scene. However, we as Americans could also write many novels pointing out the faults of England. I just don't know if anyone could do it as well as Waugh did!"},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"The Loved One was a very interesting book which had it's good and somewhat funny parts. It's questionable though, whether the good parts outnumber the bad. Some of the good parts are when Dennis first meets Aimee' and the times when the book would be describing the parts with Mr. Slump as the Guru Brahmin with his secretary and the other writer. The parts that made me either reread the part over again or just fall asleep were in the beginning when Dennis and Sir Francis were conversing or when Dennis first goes to Whispering Glades. Other parts pretty much just disturbed me. In the long run, the book was well written and it just depends what type of books you like to enjoy this. If your looking for a laugh out loud must read I'm not sure if I would recommend."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"From cover to cover, the book is hilarious. Evelyn Waugh's dry wit will really inspire laughter. Waugh's take on L.A. funeral industry is amazingly funny and creative. His use of location, irony, sarcasm, and a line-up of well developed characters, is evidence of his good writing abilities.Set in Los Angeles, Waugh uses the funniest names for two distinct funeral businesses. First, for the humanly customer is &quot;Whispering Glades&quot;. Secondly, he develops a pet cemetary called &quot;Happier Hunting Grounds&quot;. In a morbid way, these two names will make you laugh. Waugh ironically and sarcastically uses a serious service, the funeral industry, to make a series of funny events that you wouldn't think happens. In one part, Mr. Joyboy, the funeral director of Whispering Glades, fixes a smile on a corpse in order to show his female cosmotician that he likes her.If you like dry humor, sarcastic wit, and great characters, The Loved One is a must read. In fact, I give it four stars and recommend it as a best seller. Waugh hilarious style of writing will leave you wanting to read more of his works."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"Had a hard time finding this book to read for my bookclub. found it paid a penny(more for shipping than book) Well worth it as I didnt have to struggle to find and the book was in great shape. Once again amazon and its suppliers come through like champs."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"Denis Barlow is a &quot;versatile and precise&quot; British poet, his attributes allow him to work in a pet cemetery in California. He loses one of his friends and organizing the funeral he meets Miss Thanatogenous, a cosmetician at &quot;Whispering Glades&quot;, a very particular cemetery. The relationship between the smart poet and his sweet, almost dumb, girlfriend helps to show the hypocrisy of people devoted to the cult of appearances.The cynicism of the poet, his incisive look and revealing insights on the alienation of the other characters are as effective to unmask the Hollywood society of his time as to confront similar realities nowadays. In some way the book is related with Orwell's &quot;1984&quot; and &quot;Animal farm&quot;. &quot;The loved one&quot; is a glance to the banality and fatuity that can punish, as the worst of tyrannies, the life of ordinary people."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"I've got to mention one fact, this book should be labeled &quot;Lullaby&quot; instead of &quot;Humorous&quot;. The beginning of this book was so slow, I had to read it three times before I could make a connection to the second chapter. Also, what kind of guy puts smiles on other people's loved ones in order to express his feelings to the beautician. The plot of the book was extremely shallow because the meaning of the book was to poke fun at the burial industry. The book is a good tool to speed your reading because it is challenging to read, bu,t otherwise, the book is boring and it would be a good remedy for those suffering from insomnia."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"To me the book was okay. But it also made fun of the dead, putting smiling faces on them. Ithought your supposed to respect the dead and let them rest in peace. But some parts of the book was okay. At first I thought it was a love story about someone's loved one. But when I got to read it, it occured to me that the dead people was the ones considered the loved ones and that really got me confussed. So I give it three stars. That means it isn't bad or it isn't good. It just means it's okay. I just think that the tilte should have been something else though."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"This book was worth reading because I found the satire amusing. The idea that the morticians would go through so much trouble just to make a corpse smile struck me funny. Even Mr. Joyboy's name was funny because he acted joyful, just like his name.Another thing I found interesting in the story was that there was not one character that I liked. I would recommend this book to someone who finds irony and satire amusing."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"The novel &quot;The Loved One&quot; by Evelyn Waugh had an unclear and confusing story line. The vocabulary was difficult to understand because they were mostly British terms. The author also wrote too much on feelings and thoughts rather then events and important conversations. The story was not easy to follow. The author seemed to jump around between people and conversations. Dispite all of this the end of the book came together. It finally became a little more iteresting to me. I thought the ending was twisted because both Mr. Joyboy and Mr. Barlow said they cared about Mrs.Thanatogenos. In reality I think they cared more for themselves than for her. Over all though, I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"This book was incredibly boring. NOTHING AT ALL MADE SENSE!!! It's suppose to have a hard-to-get&quot; type of funny but I found nothing in this book amusing. There really nothing much to say. They even misspelled words...on the first page... on the first line!!! Terrible editing!! I would never reccomend it. Who wants to read a book about death that tries to be funny is a stupid way!! Just Ironic!! My advice... Don't read it!"},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"The book was a pretty boring book. It was about cemeteries and I think cemeteries to me would be creepy and it also made fun of the dead. How they put facial expressions on them. And the title of the book should be something else because id someone hasn't read it before they would think it's a love story. Now that's my opinion of the book."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"i didn't enjoy reading this book. i didn't find it to be a satire on either the burial industry or hollywood. i feel the book didn't live up to the reviews on the back of it. it was neither a laugh out loud satire or a vicious comedy. it was also somewhat confusing at times because of the over use of adjectives to describe settings. after reading this book i will probably never read one of his books again, unless required. though slim it read slowly and seemed longer than the hundred plus pages it was. overall i wouldn't recommend this book to any others than his fans."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"I thought this book was not very interesting. It did not keep my attention, and it was hard for me to follow a long. I beleive the author did not explain the book well enough and went into detail on how the characters felt. If I would have understood what happened in the begining I would have got the whole plot of it. Again I did not like the book and would not recommend it to any one."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"I think that this book wasn't a very interesting novel to read. I didn't enjoy it because I didn't understand what the point of writing a story like this was. I also did not like this book because I am not a very big fan of love stories. It was about a woman named Miss Thantogenos who fell in love with two men named Dennis Barlow and Mr. Joyboy. She is confused about which one to marry. It turns out that she asks a guide for advice. The guide tells her to commit suicide. She does this thinking that the guide is real. She dies and neither guy marries Miss Thantogenos.Although I didn't enjoy the book. I did have a favorite character. She was Mr. Joyboy's mother. She was my favorite character because she was always doing what she wanted, and she didn't let anybody tell her what to do. I felt sorry for her when her parrot died.I also did not enjoy this book because when I read a book, usually I finish it in a day or two, but this book alone took me two weeks to read. I was never anxious to pick up the book and read more. Actually, I only picked up the book when I did not have anything to do.In conclusion, I wouldn't recommend this book for anybody to read unless they enjoy reading books about love strories. I give The Loved One not two thumbs up, but two thumbs down."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"I didn't like The Loved One at all. The reason why I didn't like it was because I didn't like the plot, the theme, or the characters. To show why I didn't like it, I'm going to compare it with a book that was really good and that I liked that is called The White Mountains. The plot of The White Mountains had action, excitement, and adventure. The story is about teenagers that traveled through Europe in search of a colony that would help the fight against aliens that had invaded earth. The plot of The Loved One is that Dennis Barlow falls in love with Aimee Thanatogenos, who is already in love with Mr. Joyboy. But then she falls in love with Dennis. At the end, she can't decide who she loves more, Dennis or Mr. Joyboy, so she kills herself. To me the theme of The Love One just seemed to be just dumb. The theme of The White Mountains is that teenagers can be responsible, and we could be the future leaders and the fate of the world could lay in our hands. Now,the theme of The Loved One is that adults can be silly and that they are only thinking about themselves and doing nothing to help our society. Last, the characters in The Loved One never seemed to be real. The characters in The White Mountains showed how strong they were by going across Europe to find the colony while the aliens were trying to kill them. The characters in The Loved One just fought over a woman who they both loved. But Aimee couldn't choose between Dennis and Mr. Joyboy, so she killed herslef. These were just some of the resons why I didn't like the book, The Loved One."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"The characters in this book were poorly developed. I would not recommend this book to younger readers. It would help a lot if you were familiar with the English slang. I think that Evelyn Waugh is a sick person to think of these story lines. Somewhat reminisent of Poe. The book starts in the middle of the story. If you are not some genius, you will never understand what is going on in the book. Near the end it begins to come together and some of the events begin to make sense, but in all I feel that this ws an inappropriate book about a very sensetive issue, death. Two thumbs down."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"&quot;The Loved One&quot; tries to be so outrageous and outlandish that it would become enjoyable, but is instead very un-involved and dull. There isn't a single character that you can like or identify with or help propel any interest in the plot. If I hadn't had to read it for my English class I would have burned it and never felt bad about not finishing it."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"It's hard to give a review of this book. Personally I didn't like it. At the beginning before the book/strory starts, there is a Warning. The Warning states that in some parts it gets gruesome. It wasn't that bad but it did talk about dead bodies in the funeral home, and a persons death. I thought the plot of the story was pretty weird and dumb. I felt the characters didn't belong in that story. Its about cemeteries and then these weird characters come in and their problems don't have anything to do with the book. I'm not sure what the author was thinking about when he wrote this. I wouldn't recommend this book unless you want to waist your time and read something really strange. I say one thumb down no thumbs up because it had it's moments. But I really wouldn't recommend it to anyone else."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"The Loved One has to be one of the greatest pieces that I have ever read! My English teacher introduced my class to Evelyn Waugh, who I thought would be just another boring satirical writer, but to my astonishment I found his book to be funny and dark at the same time. Perfect black humour. I am 16 and I respect peoples' different opinions on this book, but i feel that some can be very ignorant, and they don't know a good book when they read one. This novel is one that should be read the world over to introduce people to the dark side of humour."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"Don't let the length of this novel fool you.This is utterly brilliant writing-a wonderful contrast between engrained snobbishness of the historical English and the bland,trite,intellectually sterile mind of the American.What an indictment on American culture-this book was so purely enjoyable I was grinning from ear to ear when not bent over laughing.Great stuff(and so many reviews!).At 126 pages you can't go wrong."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"\\"The Loved One\\" the novella by Evelyn Waugh caused quite a sensation when it appeared in 1948. This satiric piece which jabbed fun at the Hollywood fascination with the beauties of death at places like the necropolis Forest Lawn spawned a hilarious movie laden with stars, but today the whole enterprise seems rather tame and insipid. The story is a slight one that is simplistic and bare bones in its structure. The same satire written today, I think, would be told with more intensity and would be far more deadly in its sting. Now the ideas have grown pass&eacute; and well-plowed by any number of writers. Nathaniel West covered some similar territory in \\"The Day of the Locust\\" in 1939.Dennis Barlow is a young Brit living with Sir Francis Hinsley in Hollywood, and he works for an upscale pet cemetery called The Happier Hunting Ground. When Sir Francis finds that he's been canned by the movie moguls, he tops himself, and Dennis becomes acquainted with the activities of the Whispering Glades Memorial Park which elevates death to an art form. Working there with the chief artistic mortician Mr. Joyboy is cosmetician Aim&eacute;e Thanatogenos, a non-too-bright girl, who develops crushes on Dennis and Joyboy. Thanatos in Greek mythology was the personification of death.Aim&eacute;e seeks counsel from a newspaper advice columnist who thinks she is a joke. When Dennis pawns off the words of famous poets as his own work, she falls for it. She loses faith in Dennis when she find out he works in a pet cemetery. Joyboy is more enamored of his mother than he is poor Aim&eacute;e. He has become an expert at giving corpses a \\"Radiant Childhood Smile.\\"This is black comedy and satire that doesn't pretend to present real people in real situations. There is little subtlety, and I wonder if it wouldn't have been done in a more biting and more visceral style if done today.I have the feeling that Waugh, the compleat Englishman was not only holding up to ridicule America's fascination with death rituals, but was snobbishly sneering at his American cousins.The characters in the book are caricatures, and the plot can hardly elicit any sympathy from readers. It's a clever plot, but I think the book shows its age. It reads now like a light, breezy story rather than a searing satire. It's a black comedy without a touch of sentimentality or human feeling."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"I picked this book up long ago because a parts of the Doctor Who story Revelation Of The Daleks was inspired by it. Evelyn Waugh's book is a skewering of the English expatriates and Americans in Hollywood, but also that of the funeral business.English poet Dennis Barlow works at the Happier Hunting Ground,a pet cemetery, where services are offered to bereaved pet owners, such as interrment versus incineration, a niche in the columbarium versus the remains at home, and every year, a card sent reading \\"Your little &lt;insert name here> is thinking of you in heaven today and &lt;action befitting animal>\\" That last part might be \\"purring happily\\" or \\"singing in orison.\\" And at a service for a dog: \\"Dog that is born of b--ch hath but a short time to live.\\"When his friend Sir Francis Hinsley, chief script writer at Megapolitan Pictures, commits suicide after getting the sack, he goes to make funeral arrangements at Whispering Glades, where the dearly departed are referred to as Loved Ones. This is where Waugh's depiction of the funeral hostess who comes off as a salesman with a pitch comes in. There's a funny line on the description of someone who had been a month at sea and was only ID'd by his wristwatch. \\"They fixed that stiff so he looked like it was his wedding day. Why, if he's sat on an atom bomb, they'd make him presentable.\\" And the hostess later launches into a speech, trying to sell Barlow onto the idea of making arrangements for himself, using an argument akin to people turning down insurance only to lose their home, get robbed, etc. the next day.He meets and falls in love with Aimee Thanatogenos, a crematorium cosmetician. Aimee though, is enamoured with Mr. Joyboy, the head embalmer who goes out of his way to create smiles on the stiffs he sends to Aimee. Joyboy is pleased with her work: \\"I never have to tell you anything. We work in unison. When I send a Loved One in to you, ... I feel as though I were speaking to you through him.\\" Yet she is torn and writes letters to the Guru Brahmin, a kind of Dear Abby advisory column, over the matter.However, twists of fate occur, leading to tragedy in the end, and leave it to Waugh to leave his tried and true cynical humour.So enter, reader, and be happy to read this cynical laugh."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"In America, we tend to value an acquaintance mostly by his or her productivity or usefulness to us. We tend to compensate for that shortcoming subconciously by mounting extravagent retirement banquets and flowery, overwrought funerals full of ungenuine sentiment. But who says we can't love a person while they are still with us, and why can't we bother ourselves to appreciate our differences and to address them in a kindly and loving way before the end of our time together? Mr. Waugh, I think, says all this in &quot;The Loved One,&quot; but in a much more entertaining fashion. Indeed, you won't even realize it till you're done enjoying the book. I prefer the mainstream British Waugh of works like &quot;Brideshead&quot; or &quot;Decline and Fall,&quot; but Waugh shows he is perfectly comfortable with American material as well in this slim volume."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"Although this isn't Waugh's best (try DECLINE AND FALL or A HANDFUL OF DUST, or even the underappreciated THE ORDEAL OF GILBERT PINFOLD) it is still very good. A note: from one comment I'm guessing the horde of Calif. reviewers were schoolkids reading this for an assignment, and aged around 15. Probably NOT the best audience for the book--they need to grow a little older and closer to death... The fact that some appreciated it is actually heartening."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"Waugh is at his satirical best in this book about happenings of the Whispering Glades Cemetery, which was inspired by his visit to Hollywood and numerous visits to Forest Lawn (the cemetery to the stars) while he was meeting with MGM about the possible purchase of his better-known and more widely-read Brideshead Revisited. He never sold the film rights to Brideshead, but came away with the material that he used for this book, which is a funny look at Hollywood and its goings-on. Hollywood is a fantasy land and that is what Waugh creates with his fictional cemetery. The cemetery makes both The Loved Ones and The Waiting Ones believe that after death they are going to a much better place. People in Hollywood lead perfect lives and I guess they want to believe that when they die it only gets better. Waugh doesn't think that's so. Guess, Hollywood can't make everybody believe everything."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"The disproportionate number of Californians offended by this book is great evidence that Waugh has hit the spot."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"Waugh's &quot;Loved One&quot; is as rich in dark humor as one could imagine. Not content to name some of his characters in a way that would do a Dickens or a Mervyn Peake proud (Joyboy, Slump), Waugh trumps the ace in naming his heroine Aimee Thanatogenos... literally &quot;The Loved One, Bringer of Death&quot;. The novel is for neither beginners nor flat-liners (just couldn't resist!). The film (I have a copy!) was advertised as &quot;The movie with something to offend everyone!&quot; Even Love, Patriotism and Motherhood are not spared.... Joyboy's mother is about as offensively sick a person as could be imagined and the film capitalized on it. Ayllene Gibbons was suitably gross as Joyboy's 'Mum and Liberace was a natural as Mr. Starker, the gay casket salesman. This was my entry to the World of Waugh and treasure the day I ran into it. Well Done!"},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"Quite brilliant satire. Risque choice of subject but boy oh boy what rewards to be reaped. I really laughed hard and heartily and bitingly .

It appears that he had enjoyed this book as did many others. I , however, did not find it as witty and comical as it was made out to be. I thought the reviews over glamorized the book a tad. This particular Waugh novel although slow at the start and hard to settle into, had some especially clever pieces. You could say that this novel is no better than Jurassic Park, for example, but you have to consider the two very different styles, satire and sci-fi, so you can't judge it that way. I, myself, don't have other novels of his to compare this to so I can't say if this is his best. The element of the story that I found most intriguing was the dangerous love triangle involving, Aimee, Mr. Joyboy, and Dennis Barlow. This proved fatal in the final pages of the novel for Ms. Thanatogenos. I enjoyed thoroughly reading parts with the laid-back Mr. Barlow. He reminds me of me sometimes, making the book more bearable. When a reader can connect with a character, it makes the reading experience more pleasurable. I think this book was at the very least entertaining and at the most slightly gruesome."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"The book The Loved One is a book that starts out slow and is very hard to understand. After the second or third chapter it speeds up and is better when it talks about the coroners and people they are dealing with. At first when I was thinking about typing this I was going to say, like most people that it was boring. I finally realized it was a pretty good book when I had finished it. I would recommend this book to many people."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"This story was very hard on its characters especialy Mr. Dennis Barlow who lost his friend and his fiancee .Im not saying that he is the only one to be hit by tragedy inthe novel ,because Mr Joyboy also lost his fiancee who ironicly was also Dennis Barlows loved one.But then of course both of those guys get to live through the story while Miss Thanatogenos committs suicide all because she could not pick between two men to marry."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"The Auther of the book puts alot of details in the book.

So after you read the above sentence if you don't want to know the ending read another review.I think the title not only refers to the dead people at Whispering Glades but Aimee too. I think Aimee is also considered &quot;the loved one&quot; because she is loved by Mr. Joyboy and Dennis. I think if Mr.Joyboy and Dennis both really loved Aimee they wouldn't have kept forceing Aimee to choose one of them. If they really loved her they should be happy with her decision because they wanted her to be happy."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"The book &quot;The Loved One&quot; is a very complicated book to read. It starts in an awkward setting where you would not expect it. The beginning setting of the book takes place on the front porch of Sir Francis Hinsley, accompanied by Dennis Barlow; this setting continues for the first section of the book. When the first part of the book ends, the book's main purpose comes into focus. The death of Sir Francis Hinsley has brought on this topic of the book. It triggers Dennis Barlow to visit the Whispering Glades Mortuary to schedule the funeral. The continuing chapters of the book were on a similar note as this as they deal with a side of the topics that you would not suspect to be joined with problems in a mortuary. It took a clever mind to come up with these out of touch subjects and combine them to leave you with &quot;The Loved One.&quot; Another out of place description in &quot;The Loved One&quot; is the way that they picture Hollywood. Usually, when you think of Hollywood, you think of movie stars, movies, nice Mercedes Benz cars and nice houses, but &quot;The Loved One&quot; describes a different part of Hollywood; a somewhat out of the ordinary description of the city. All in all, &quot;The Loved One&quot; is an excellent book because of the topics that you would not expect to revolve around the characters and the situations surrounding the characters. The setback to the book is that it starts off slow and in minor parts of the book it drags. Other than that is very well written."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"This book is very well written for many reasons. First, it is very lifelike in that when you read it you feel like the characters are real and that these events really took place. The good thing about this book is that just because these specific people and events are fictional, this book still you let you know the harsh realities of life in Hollywood and that everyday these kinds of things happen. People come and go in that industry. When you are felt to have lost step you without every expecting it are kicked to the curb. This book is the kind that keeps you wanting to read more and more because of the continuous drama that leaves you at the edge of your seat.This book also has its down points. Some of those are that the book is somewhat gruesome in the way it depicts death and in the way it commercializes death itself. Those who are weak at heart would find it hard to read this book.This book in some ways is comical. The way the dead loved ones are used as a way to show love and that the way a cosmetician uses the dead loved ones as a type of art. The book is also a good love story. It does not portray love the way most people would like to think of it. The fact of the matter is that most people don't just fall in love and get married and live happily ever after. In a relationship there is deception, anger, and sometimes like in the novel confusion as to what you really wants. Also, this book is really good because relationships can drive people over the edge like some of the characters in the novel. Also, when in relationships you always in one way or another feel a lust for someone else.* In conclusion, I feel this book was very well written and very realistic. *"},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"This novel is truly one of the best books ever written. It is one of the few books that I have read and actually like in a long time.I enjoyed the way Waugh delivers everything you ever wanted in a novel, or at least the ones I like to read and enjoy. He delivers a sense of dry wit and bitter irony that no one else has, or for I have read for that matter. Most of the authors you read today don't write like this anymore and they also don't have the same dry wit and bitter irony that Waugh produces. This novel is truly a timeless masterpiece among all generations. My favorite part of the book was when Mr. Barlow asks Miss Thanatogenos if she's gonna work on him after he dies and she said sure. In the end, Mr. Barlow ends up throwing her in the pet's crematorium. I found it kind of sad how she was always preparing loved ones for their graves and she never got a decent one herself. To me, I find that to be sad. One thing I found disturbing, besides Miss Thanatogenos injecting herself with poison and dying in the mortuary, was the way Sir Francis Hinsley passed away. Just because they fired him at his job for working all that time, he went and hung himself. I don't see why he did that, though, it's not like its the end of the world or anything like that. This novel was truly one that wouldn't let you put it down. My favorite character would have to be Mr. Barlow, he was heroic and very mellowed out. I looked up to him because he could talk to Miss Thanatogenos and look like a stud if he accidently said something wrong or insulting. I would recommend this book to anyone that could handle a good book, with plenty of feeling and emotion. Tis book led me through lots of surprises and twists and that's also what kept me reading. I found the books settings to be quite disturbing, though, because I don't find Whispering Glades (a movie star cemetery) and Happy Hunting Ground (a pet cemetery) to be ideal settings. So overall I recommend this book to a meture audience and I hope all you readers out there find as entertaining as I did."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"The &quot;Loved One&quot; written by Evelyn Waugh was very humerous and ironic They make death sound like a big joke. This novel &quot;The Loved One&quot; was easily read, but some parts were hard to understand. Especially the dialouge and the vocabulary. I would recommend a dictionary to clarify some of the vocabulary. The characters in this book were some what hard to understand. You have to concentrate really good to understand the story. I recommend this book to readers who like ironic endings. To me this book was a whole new experience because it had so much humor and irony.

The characters, as they were suppose to be, unrealistic, and therefore are a bit unorganized. This makes the story less interesting. It also needs a more continous flow to better understand the plot. And as an outcome, this story is not taken as a comedy. You can't identify all the wit and irony it tells. It is funny, but not as much as it should. Yet it does have a great plot and well written story lines. Other than that, it doesn't do that much more."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"This book was confusing. It contained no action, suspense, nor thrill. What made me lose interest in this book was the fact that they talked about the deceased, how they died, and how their appearance were greatly transfigured. If I wanted to read about dead bodies I would have read a horror novel."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"The book, while amusing at times, could not keep my interest very long. The characters had no depth which kept me from getting to involved in the novel. To bring more definition to the characters the author should have developed more physical attributes to enhance their lifeness of their personalities. Another flaw in the novel was the lack of importance and care, for that matter, that I felt about the story line. I am not interested in the events that go on in a funeral home."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"I thought that The Loved One was a fairly good book. Although, I felt the events in the book were very reaccuring. I also didn't fancy making fun of death and the people who have to deal with death. I do feel that some of the people in the burial industry are a little odd, and I got the impression that some of the characters the book, that worked in the burial industry, were also a little strange. I liked how the writer put bits and peices of poetry in the novel, but I didn't like how so many people committed suicide. The writer had good ideas, but the author could have used the ideas in a more presentable way. I thought the book needed to be more graphic. Evelyn Waugh must not have studied the burial industry before Waugh wrote about it, more occupational terms were needed. Evelyn Waugh needed to spend more time writing this novel before it was published."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"In felt that the story was very boring and that I would lose interest in the book very fast. And the love triangle in the story between Denise, Amy and Mr. Joy Boy was very confusing. And at different times in the book the pace would change and I would totally get lost and I would get frustrated. At first I thought that the book was about death then it turned out to be about love."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"The book The Loved One is based on the burial industry. This sets the tone of sadness, melancholy, grief, depression, dejection, and disaster. The story takes place in California; particularly two funeral homes called the Whispering Glades - a resting place for famous Hollywood people and the Happier Hunting Ground - a cemetery for deceased loved aminals. It tells the story of a love triangle involving Aimee Thanatogenos, the heroine of the story who works as a cosmetician; Mr. Joyboy an established embalmer famous for his trade; and Mr. Dennis Barlow, the villain who works at the pet cemetery. Aimee the cosmetician and Mr. Joyboy the embalmer seemed the perfect match at the beginning of the story. The twist comes when Dennis Barlow is introduced as a much younger, likeable, glib, aspiring, ambitious man who works at the pet cemetery. Aimee unsure of her future, searches for something missing in her life. She meets Dennis Barlow, who by the nature of his job is an eloquent giver of obituaries for loved pets. She mistakes him for a romantic poet. Dennis does not correct the wrong notion and plays out the poet to the hilt knowing the deception was a way to the woman's heart. Aimee breaks up with Mr. Joyboy and takes up with Dennis. She finds out the truth and is disillusioned. Dennis is not a poet but like her a mere worker at a cemetery for pets, and his poems were copied from books, not straight from the heart. Faced with a dilemma, she comfides in a magazine sort of a present day Dear Abby. The Guru Brahmin actually three people gives out advice which Aimee takes to heart. This is the comedy part. Which person in his right mind would take Dear Abby seriously? Well she does and the result is a total disaster. The Guru being drunk and fired from his job tells Aimee to commit suicide when she calls him up personally on the phone for advice. Confused, Aimee does kill herself. Pretty stupid I think. The story ends with Joyboy and Barlow helping each other out to cremate Aimee at the Happier Hunting Ground, a hush - hush burial to avoid embarrassment and guilt of what they have done to their &quot;Loved One&quot; Mr. Joyboy for failing to come to her when she was distraught and for Mr. Dennis for his deception at impersonating a poet to charm Aimee. I believe that The Loved One was somewhat a mediocre book. I give it three stars because it lacked the action and adventure which could have made it more interesting to read. I was unable to understand what was going on in the beginning. Though the book was not a turn on the me, it did have a few parts which did interest me like the love triangle between burial employees Mr. Barlow, Aimee Thanatogenos, and Mr. Joyboy. The book could have used more suspense or sensitivity about suicide to give it more interest. I read the book from cover to cover and there are still parts of the book which I still don't understand. To totally understand the whole book I think you would have to be an extensive reader. I would have more of an attraction to the book if it were not a love story."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"I liked certain parts of the book and disliked certain parts. It was very hard to understand at times because of the British humor.I liked it when Mr. Barlow was asked to write about Sir Francis and the man didn't read it first and it was a joke instead of serious. Whispering Glades seemed like a very nice place. Otherwise, there was too much sadness. Like when Sir Francis hung himself, Mr. Joyboy being jealous that Miss Thanatogenos likes Mr. Barlow, and when Miss Thanatogenos kills herself. It is also weird that Mr. Barlow and Mr. Joyboy cremate her body and Mr. Barlow takes money from Mr. Joyboy and goes back to England."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"The book was very well written and worthy of its high stature. The characters which he made up were filled with depth, almost as if they were real people. The situation he put the characters into was clever as well as humurous.

All in all, I thought the book was one of the best I had ever read."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"The prolific Waugh has done it again! The story showed great emphasis on drama,suspense and Romance. The setting is a mortuary named Whispering Glades. All I can say that it is an excellent book and you have to read it to get the full effect."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"As I said, it was hard to read and understand, especially in the beginning. Knowing that it was written in the 1940's helped me to picture the setting of the book and understand that $50.00 a week was a normal paycheck. Also, the way they dressed. It was a very different view of cemetaries, mortuaries and death. When death is a big part of your job, it's a paycheck instead of a tragedy. I found the book to be boreing and hard to keep reading. It isn't one I would choose to read. It was also predictable, and that made it boring for me too."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"...skip this one; or read it only because it takes 90 minutes and has two or three good laughs. Very slight. Not really in the same league as \\"... Dust\\" or \\"Decline...\\"."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"This book was a boring novel for young people. It was hard to sit and read any large number of pages at a time. The humor was very subtle most of the time and the jokes usually flew right over my head. It was very descriptive about the time and place but very vague about most of the names and characters. Towards the end of the novel things started picking up and everything was clearer and made more sense. The plot of this book was very odd and peculiar."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"I liked the concept the book was trying to get across. The author did not do to good of a job at grabbing my attention. I only finished the book because I had to for school. Overall I did not think the book was that exciting. The book tried to display the exagerated possibility of not being able to make up your mind. The book needed a little more edge. The book could have been a best selled if it would of had a little more story to it."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"Im going to have to disagree with the majority of the people when i say that this book just wasnt for me. The author did a great job on the plot, and it was very well-written. But to my opinion, this book's setting, and its characters were very odd. (no offense to the author). When the author went and talked about the burial industry, it made me lose track. I, myself, am not clearly interested in embalming work, in the comseticians, and in general the whole subject of that type. Like i said, it made me lose track, and i think one of the main things keeping the story up was the romance between the characters. I think that was well done by the author because the romantic bit kept up with everything else in the story. Another thing i noticed, which everyone else might have, was the controversy of the influence of Hollywood, and the media. That was very &quot;eye-catching&quot; because it is also a reality in today. I would have to agree very strongly with many people that say that this is a satire on the burial industry and all of Hollywood. I agree because there are many ironic themes relating to those subjects. But, like i said before, this book just wasn't for me, and that is why i gave it two stars, which i feel is very poor, and that is why i might say I'd give it a two thumbs down."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"Evelyn Waugh is undoubtedly very creative in expressing and revealing the irony of &quot;The Loved One.&quot; The novel is easily read but partially difficult to understand. At some parts, especially during dialogue, the reader may be lost at who is speaking due the lack of some words like &quot;said.&quot; Not that I feel that Waugh is reluctant to use them but I can understand that a repetition of many &quot;said&quot; words can bland the communication between characters. Also, Waugh's plot was a bit confusing for me. It was sometimes difficult to feel the realism of the book when I couldn't interpret the time frame, (i.e. Sir Francis' past life, Sir Francis when he's alive, the present with Mr. Barlow, Mr. Barlow's past, Miss Thanageo's past.) Other than that the plot went along smoothly. The novel's characters are a work of art. I thought I knew Mr. Barlow as a sensitive writer, but he had no clue how to deal with love. Miss Thanageos can only be pitied. She ha! d a good life, but didn't listen to her heart, but to Guru Brahmin. The setting of the novel somewhat disappointing. I think of Hollywood as a lively place, far from the gloomy cemetery; not a place where lots of people die, and where unexpected things happen. I was surprised by the mortician's attitude. Unlike a classical, long-faced, spooky undertaker, Waugh came up with a cheerful mortician (yet Miss Thanageos still kept a cold emotion within when dealing in business.) In this book, you can't expect a happy ending. The last chapter has much to reveal. It uncovers the coldness of Mr. Barlow, the insanity of Miss Thanageos' life problems, and the desperate groveling of Mr. Joyboy, (ends up that he isn't joyful anymore...) For those who haven't read this book, I must say, read carefully; expect irony and the unexpected, and don't take the death of book characters seriously; (in the book, it happens too often.)"},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"The Loved One is an odd little story about a love triangle among people who are unusually comfortable handling dead things. Dennis, a poet/pet mortician, is not entirely forthcoming about his occupation with Aim&eacute;e Thanatogenos lest she, as a beautician of human cadavers, despise him for it. Aim&eacute;e, for her part, is torn between her attraction to Dennis and her respect for Mr. Joyboy, who is what passes for a stud among morticians. Joyboy courts Aim&eacute;e by manipulating into smiles the faces of the corpses he works on that are headed for her cubicle.Waugh's macabre novella pokes fun at the ceremonial nonsense with which we shroud death, packaging that manages to render the inevitable obscene. It's amusing, if not a \\"wickedly funny\\" satire as promised in the blurbs, and would perhaps be more successfully humorous on film.Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece"},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"This is, perhaps, one of the classic humor pieces of all time.

While making funeral arrangements for his former living companion, a scriptwriter-turned-suicide, Barlow meets and romances a cosmetician at Whispering Glades, the in-place for dead celebs who crave some final status before they go. Using some recycled poetry from the likes of Shelley and Shakespeare (he's long since run out of gas on his own), Barlow manages to woo young Aimee Thanatogenos from under the attentions of chief Whispering Glades undertaker Mr. Joyboy. But will Joyboy play fair with his rival?One confusing thing people often say about \\"The Loved One\\" is that it's a Catholic satire on the materialist way people handle the subject of death. Waugh was a devout Catholic, and a satirist, but it strikes me that \\"The Loved One\\" is rather agnostic in tone, without a religious character or idea presented as buttress against the nihilist vision of the book. I don't think people are wrong to be disturbed by it that way. \\"The Loved One\\" satirizes the non-religious nature of death as memorialized at Whispering Glades, but not so much with the suggestion of an alternative as with the notion that talk of non-sectarian \\"better worlds\\" is like whistling in a vacuum and, at best, frivolous. After a few reads, my sense of \\"A Loved One\\" is that it could be a book written by a Lutheran, a Jew, or an atheist. I could be wrong, but I don't think so.The fact that the novel still manages to be entertaining even as it runs against the grain of Waugh's moral and spiritual beliefs is testament to the author's brilliance. It's one thing to write the Crete passage in \\"Officers And Gentlemen,\\" where the awful carnage of the battle is presented with a sense of some higher significance. When Barlow returns home one day and finds his old friend swinging from the rafters in a noose, we are told \\"his reason accepted the event as part of the established order.\\" Barlow is an artfully rendered protagonist precisely because he is so lacking in character or decency. He is a thorough clod. Readers tackling \\"The Loved One\\" for the first time are well-advised not to make the mistake of caring for any of the characters in it, especially not him.My favorite part of the book is the opening, where we meet Barlow and his companion, the aging screenwriter-turned-hack-publicist Francis Hinsley. \\"Kierkegaard, Kafka, Connolly, Compton Burnet, Sartre, 'Scottie' Wilson. Who are they? What do they want?\\" asks Hinsley over sodas-and-whisky, taking in the literary \\"new breed\\" which was by then either dead or collecting pensions. There's a wonderful sense of comic disengagement, the idea of Hollywood as some Somerset Maugham outpost in deepest Africa, and the Tinseltown focus is something we lose as the novel goes on, which I missed.The rest of the book is a clever forum for Waugh's brilliant observations and off-handed commentary about a life lived in a world without standards. Aimee notes at one point: \\"Once you start changing a name, you see, there's no reason ever to stop. One always hears one that sounds better.\\"Or the infamous single episode where we meet Mr. Joyboy's mother, who had \\"small angry eyes, frizzy hair, pince-nez on a very thick nose, a shapeless body, and positively insulting clothes.\\" Who says adverbs ruin good writing?As I said, \\"The Loved One\\" is not for the fainthearted. I almost wish my edition didn't come with a Charles Addams cover illustration; it sets the wrong expectation. This is a \\"fiendishly entertaining\\" read only for those who go into it not expecting to be fiendishly entertained. It's for the dour pessimist in us all. But it's definitely one of the best novels ever written, precisely because of its unremitting focus on the things mankind naturally would turn away from if it could, and the dark amusement it finds from such exploration serves as a kind of triumph of the literary imagination we can still celebrate today."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"This is only the second Evelyn Waugh novel I have read, and I find myself liking him all the more. Waugh is famous for his scathing satire and witty play with words; he can craft characters who are odious even to him and dispose of their problems with ease and brillance. Such is the case with \\"The Loved One\\", a wry novel that skewers everything from the upper class to religion to funerary practices, all while drawing laughs and smiles from the reader.Dennis Barlow is a young Englishman living in southern California. He fashions himself to be a poet, but as the Muse has left him dry, he finds employment at the Happier Hunting Grounds a.k.a. the local pet cemetery. When his mentor and roommate commits suicide, it is up to Dennis to arrange his funeral at the chic and studied Whispering Glades - not so much a cemetery as an entire business devoted to the dead and their 'waiting ones'. Dennis finds himself enthralled with not only Whispering Glades, but with Aimee, a young cosmetician who works there. He fights for her attention with plagarized poems while her other suitor, Mr. Joyboy the wonder mortician, delivers smiling corpse after corpse for her to paint in hopes of winning her love.After introducing readers to this integral triangle of the book, the novel is then devoted to Aimee's struggles to choose which man she should marry. This questioning leads to some fatal consequences, that are indecorously disposed of through Waugh's irreverent creation Dennis Barlow. \\"The Loved One\\" is tirelessly funny, and searchingly honest. Evelyn Waugh examines the farce humans play when a loved one dies with heretofore unknown wit and alacrity that may have failed under lesser hands."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"In this brilliant little satirical novel, Evelyn Waugh takes on Hollywood, the British expatriate community in Los Angeles, the death care industry, romantic love, filial love, sexism (perhaps without knowing it), and American attitudes toward success, death, foreigners, art, their pets, suicide, morality, newspaper advice columns, and religion (both ancient and new-fangled). No tombstone goes unturned. Rather than summarize the plot, let me just say that the title of the book, which is an obvious reference to the standard funteral director's euphemism for a deceased person, actually takes on another meaning as well, especially as the two main male characters (Dennis Barlow, an British would-be poet newly arrived to Los Angeles, and Mr. Joyboy, a successful local embalmer) vie for the affections of the same young lady, Aimee Thanatogenos. The novel could be seen on one level as the story of her journey from being the men's love object (desired, but never really \\"seen\\") to becoming a \\"loved one\\" in the death care industry sense of the word.At the same time I was reading the book, I rented Tony Richardson's marvelous all-star film (1965). Both are equally wicked and satirical, but Richardson's film, in its exploitation of American anxieties about nuclear war, has more in common with Stanley Kubric's \\"Dr. Strangelove\\" than with Waugh's 1948 novel. In any case, seeing the movie didn't spoil the ending of the book. Both are brilliant and LOL fun."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"For those unfamiliar with Waugh, no better starting place than this, a compact volume but one that bursts with creativity, style and pitch black humor. In short, failed British expat poet Dennis Barlow competes with the stiff American mama's boy/mortician Mr. Joyboy for the love of Aimee (get it?) Thanatogenos against the backdrop of both 1950's Hollywood and the funeral industry. A small masterpiece, &quot;The Loved One&quot; showcases Mr. Waugh's wit, here like that of a cat toying with a mouse pre-meal. Anyone whose sole exposure to Waugh is via his classic &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot; will be shocked by the darkness and gallows humor; those who have read &quot;A Handful of Dust&quot; will see Waugh's imaginativeness toward the macabre and the obscene honed to a razor's edge here."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"Looking through the reviews of this book it quickly becomes apparent that the great majority of readers are, in fact, from California. Virtually no one seems to be aware that the very essence of this book's high satire is occurring daily, right in front of them. Death, it's true, is an industry like anything else. And in California, for the wealthy, and for those that desire it, death need never be a simple, natural process. If you've got the cash spend it, you can't take it with you. The book is not a satire on death as such, it's a wonderful pisstake on the ways that people prepare for the great unknown, Through Waugh's highly evolved humor death's sting is lessened. We ought to enjoy life and its absurdities now. Not from any whispering glades. The book is painfully funny. And, fer chrissakes, you people in LA should go out to Forest Lawn in Glendale because that is what the book is sending up. Not the dear departed themselves."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"First, let me be honest. The first few pages of this book are downright boring. In fact, I practically had to force myself to read these pages, because I really didn't care about two old men talking to each other. However, once I got to the halfway point of the book, I was hooked. Reading about Ms.Thanatogenos ongoing struggle on who she really loved, Mr.Joyboy or Mr.Barlow was probably the best part of the book for me. The way these characters act and speak in the book made me feel like I was standing right next to one of them, which made me greatly appreciate the writing ability of Evelyn Waugh. Alas, even this was not enough to overcome the negativeness brought down on the book by the first few pages, so I decided to give this book an average rating of only stars. I only recommend this book to people who will have the patience and discipline to get past the first few pages without skipping them, because they are a necessary part of the story. If you can do this however, you will be pulled into a whole new world of romance, comedy, treachery, and tragedy, that could very well enthrall you and keep you reading this book for years to come. Thank you for reading my review."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"Waugh is wickedly merciless in this attack, his use of humor morbid and obsene, his wit piercing, as always he leaves no room for empathy or sympathy as he cruely dissects his victims. His targets are common themes in many of his works, the British upper class, the Catholic Church, a lack of post war standards, human vanity ,love and the biggest of all, any symbol of the establishment (in this case societies method for the disposal of the dead).This short book skewers all of the above, set against the Los Angeles British film community in the thirties. Our central character (not hero) is Dennis Barlow, british expatriate, failed poet and employee of the Happier Hunting Ground Pet Cemetry. After the suicide of his mentor Sir Francis, Dennis has the task of arranging the funeral at the hallowed Whispering Glades Funeral Home where he falls in love with cosmetician Aimee.There are cultural problems, class of funeral establishment issues and a rival suitor in the shape of embalmer Mr Joybody. Waugh as you would expect extracts the maximum humor from every situation, allows no sentiment to creep into the novel or even endearing qualities in his characters. As with much of his work the love story ends in tragedy, no one much cares and life moves on.I love satire and this is so good, not the authors best but much better than many if not all his imitators work."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"Evelyn Waugh has long been a favorite of mine. His satire and his wit, along with his wonderful ability to capture human personality with words, introduced me to a whole new standard of literature in my college days. I read everything he had written, or so I thought, until I stumbled on a few books at the local used bookstore several years ago--and before my introduction to the world of Amazon.com. I don't know why it took me so long to pick up The Loved One, but I'm so glad I finally did!Dennis Barlow is a young Brit, brought over to Hollywood for his poetic skills. When his contract is not renewed, far from being horror-stricken like his fellow ex-patriots, he simply takes another job, with the intention of returning to poetry on the side. What happens afterward is a morbidly humorous tale on which I can not expound for fear of ruining it for you. I can say that it includes a cosmetician, a mortician, Whispering Glades Memorial Park, a parrot and a few famous poems. Oh, and lots of typical Waugh black humor that will have you laughing out loud, re-reading, and thoroughly enjoying yourself at the expense of the characters, dead and alive.I've read all but two of Waugh's novels, and I must say that this one tops even Scoop as my favorite!"},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"Almost as funny as the book are the self-parodying contributions from Californian schoolkids below, who complain that they cannot possibly relate to the book because it was written more than 50 years ago. Are we really at civilization's peak?"},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"After a brief, apparently unpleasant, stay in Hollywood--he had been commissioned to adapt his novel Brideshead Revisited for the screen--Evelyn Waugh wrote this wonderfully wicked satire of the movie business, the funeral industry, lowbrow Americans and whatever other hapless targets wandered within range of his savage pen. Dennis Barlow is a young British poet, who, having lost his movie job, is temporarily employed at The Happier Hunting Ground, a pet cemetery modeled after the hallowed Whispering Glades, graveyard to the stars. But such a lowly job is anathema to the British expatriate community, as Sir Ambrose Abercrombie informs him:We limeys have a peculiar position to keep up, you know, Barlow. They may laugh at us a bit--the way we talk and the way we dress; our monocles--they may think us cliquey and stand-offish. but, by God, they respect us. Your five-to-two is a judge of quality. He knows what he's buying and it's only the finest type of Englishman that you meet out here. I often feel like an ambassador, Barlow. It's a responsibility, I can tell you, and in various degrees every Englishman out here shares it. We can't all be at the top of the tree but we are all men of responsibility. You never find an Englishman among the under-dogs--except in England, of course. That's understood out here, thanks to the example we've set. There are jobs that an Englishman just doesn't take.However, when Barlow's roommate, Sir Francis Hinsley, is abruptly dismissed from his studio job and hangs himself, Abercrombie and his fellow Cricket Club members depend on Barlow to arrange the burial--after all, he knows about how to dispose of animal remains, how much different can it be?So Barlow heads over to Whispering Glades where he is treated to a hilariously garish tour and sales pitch. He meets and falls in love with one of the cosmeticians there, Aim&eacute;e Thanatogenos, but must hide the truth about his embarrassing job, particularly since she is also smitten with Mr. Joyboy, the legendary embalmer at Whispering Glades. When she proves unresponsive to his own poetry, Barlow woos her with passages from the great poets, the works of whom she is utterly ignorant.Naturally, it all goes bung, as Barlow's various frauds are revealed and Aim&eacute;e kills herself. Barlow extorts some money out of the scandal fearing Joyboy and buries her at the Hunting Grounds, so:Tomorrow and on every anniversary as long as the Happier Hunting Ground existed a postcard would go to Mr. Joyboy: Your little Aim&eacute;e is wagging her tail in heaven tonight, thinking of you.Waugh lays bare a Hollywood where all is pretense and illusion, where human lives--never mind human feelings--are meaningless, where semantic niceties, like calling a corpse a &quot;Loved One&quot; are intended to mask reality. It is brutal, and unfortunately still timely, and quite certainly one of the best novels ever written about the movie industry. It is also just a screaming hoot.GRADE: A"},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"An absolutely cracking satire about the funeral business in the City of Angels. Vicious, dark, disturbing - and laugh-like-a-drain funny."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"I can't recommend this novella enough. Blisteringly funny and biting satire of the United States, really southern California/LA, immediately after WW II. Thankfully Waugh is equally critical of the British expatriate community. Both the subject of death and the funeral home industry could be off putting in the hands of a novice, but in the hands of a master like Waugh the comedy comes through. The name of the main female character, Ms Thanatogenos, is classic: one who produces longing for death! The macabre ending is a comedy classic. Now I need to make a pilgrimage to see Forest Lawn Cemetary, the source for Waugh's Whispering Glades Cemetary and its cousin Happier Hunting Ground pet cemetary!"},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"Amazon users' favorite review of Waugh's 'The Loved One' : \\"...those who read it will uncover a fabulous entertainment precisely because of its total lack of sentiment.\\"Even after the author seemingly presented himself enough times as dispassionate about Hollywood, the subject is convoluted. I should know, I grew up in L.A. Therefore, I hardly see where the following passage, for example, is demonstration of an author who cares not of his characters, or who despises sentiment and who believes that a true artist must sacrifice sentimentality in order to pursue hard truths, as has been stated elsewhere on the web.\\"Aimee Thanatogenos spoke the tongue of Los Angeles; the sparse furniture of her mind -- the objects which barked the intruder's shins -- had been acquired at the local High School and University; she presented herself to the world dressed in obedience to the advertisements; brain and body were scarcely distinguishable from the standard product, but the spirit-- ah, the spirit was something apart; it had to be sought afar; not here in the musky orchards of the Hesperides, but in the mountain air of the dawn, in the eagle-haunted passes of Hellas. An umbilical cord of cafes and fruit shops, of ancestral shady businesses (fencing and pimping) united Aimee, all unconscious, to the high places of her race. As she grew up the only language she knew expressed fewer and fewer of her ripening needs; the facts which littered her memory grew less substantial; the figure she saw in the looking-glass looked less recognizably herself...\\"Romance and sentimentality, the inner depths of a woman's sensual psychology, are not confined to some cheap joke on the Simpsons. They can be part of a complex human psychology that, yes, may unfortunately include the compromise of otherwise vibrant people into cheapened, gullible automatons, especially in America, Vidal's 'farm.' Waugh's perfect little gem is a tragedy, a romantic, sentimental tragedy, more than it is a satire. In fact, it is these former things more than anything else, as I see it, and only uses the literary form of satire because there's no other way to describe this god damned hell hole of a town.-Peter Reilich"},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"This book is not a monumental work, nor is it extremely profound, the main character however is a man that the reader cannot fully understand. Once I finished this book I was considerably more puzzled about Dennis' character than I was at the beginning. It is unpredictable from the start and a difficult book to put down. The ridiculous characters created by Waugh are what he might consider \\"typical Americans\\", unrefined, overly-dramatic, and confused. A note at the beginning of the book suggests that Waugh wrote the book after a visit to Hollywood in the middle of the 20th century and it is somewhat apparent as you read \\"The Loved One\\" that he has a disregard for American \\"values\\" or \\"character\\" and as an American reader you can see for yourself what absurdities reside in our way of life, both then and now. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in good, humorous literature, maybe not to a casual reader, however."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"One of my favorite stories about Evelyn Waugh finds him at a swank Parisian dinner party. After rudely belittling a helpless French intellectual with his characteristic boorishness, the host asked Evelyn how he could be so mean and still call himself a Catholic. \\"You have no idea,\\" Waugh answered, \\"how much nastier I would be if I was not Catholic. Without supernatural aid I would hardly be a human being.\\"Apparently supernatural aid did not intercede during the composition of Waugh's \\"The Loved One.\\" Waugh described it as a \\"little nightmare\\" about Hollywood, inspired by the author's brief tenure in America's West Coast wasteland. When directed at such a ripe target, Waugh's cruelty morphs into a poison-tipped arrow: fast, sharp, and lethal.Dennis Barlow, British expatriate and would-be poet, works at the \\"Happy Hunting Grounds,\\" a slightly disreputable pet cemetery (assuming there's such a thing as a reputable pet cemetery). His accent and courtly manner help facilitate funeral arrangements for the deceased pets of the rich and famous. He doesn't do much writing--the California desert has dried up the well of inspiration--apart from the occasional \\"anniversary card of remembrance\\" for a departed animal: \\"Your little Arthur is thinking of you in heaven today and wagging his tail.\\"Meanwhile, Dennis also woos Aimee, a cosmetician at a funeral home for actual people (where the deceased are always referred to as \\"The Loved One\\") by passing off poems from The Oxford Book of English Verse as his own--\\"at first he had tried writing poems for her himself, but she showed a preference for the earlier masters.\\"Dennis' rival for Aimee's affections is Mr. Joyboy, the expert embalmer at \\"The Whispering Glades\\" where Aimee works, and also a mama's boy. The scene where Mr. Joyboy takes Aimee home to meet his mother is a minor masterpiece of grisly characterization, the kind of scene that wouldn't seem out of place in a horror film if it wasn't so grotesquely funny. Waugh takes Puckish delight in the foolishness of mortals. His characters in \\"The Loved One\\" are like art deco caricatures--sketches in thin elegant outlines, devoid of color or dimension, floating on style. Little they say or do conform to any reality outside Waugh's wicked imagination. He holds his characters in high contempt.Like the offended host at the dinner party, you might also wonder how Waugh can be so mean. But you'll also take a secret delight in his meanness. After all, how cruel can you be when skewering a place where the vulgar rich desperately care about what they look like even after they're dead?"},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"This is a satiric and a dark humored novel; it's very well written, but I found it hard to laugh at the characters, sensing more to their misery then I did of the humor of industrialized and specialized funerals for the well-to-do or the artist. I can only say that you should read it."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"Evelyn Waugh was a rebel.In the novel, a young English poet, Dennis Barlow, goes to Los Angeles to live with his uncle, Sir Francis Hinsley, who works at a film studio. When he is fired by the studio, Sir Francis commits suicide, and Dennis goes to the imposing necropolis called Whispering Glades to arrange for the funeral. While there, he meets Aimee Thanatogenos, a cosmetician, and competes for her attention with the sinister embalmer Mr. Joyboy.This book is a classic in dark humor. A fast and funny read.Still Recommend."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"It would seem preparation for funeral services would be a difficult service for which to create a farce. Evelyn Waugh takes this uncomfortable profession to a different dimension by exploring it through a love triangle. Readers are certain to smile at the mundane situations the characters have created for themselves.The aptly named Mr. Joyboy is in love with his work as well as Aimee. In Hollywood he is at the top of his profession, preparing Hollywood's greats for their final performance. But when aspiring poet Dennis Barlow enters the picture with his borrowed poetry, it creates an ever-shifting dilemma in the mind of Aimee. Quite literally, it is a dilemma she is never able to reconcile.At times, I found myself unsure if it was acceptable to find certain portions of \\"The Loved One\\" funny because of the context of the humor. The tone set by Waugh seems too serious to be attempting humor. It is only in the big picture that one can see the humor in the proper perspective."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"The Loved One is classic Waugh. Thought provoking, rather irrevent and good for an afternoon's belly laugh. If you enjoyed The Loved One you will also enjoy \\"SCOOP\\" and \\"Black Mischief\\"."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"I picked this book up long ago because a parts of the Doctor Who story Revelation Of The Daleks was inspired by it. Evelyn Waugh's book is a skewering of the English expatriates and Americans in Hollywood, but also that of the funeral business.English poet Dennis Barlow works at the Happier Hunting Ground,a pet cemetery, where services are offered to bereaved pet owners, such as interrment versus incineration, a niche in the columbarium versus the remains at home, and every year, a card sent reading \\"Your little &lt;insert name here> is thinking of you in heaven today and &lt;action befitting animal>\\" That last part might be \\"purring happily\\" or \\"singing in orison.\\" And at a service for a dog: \\"Dog that is born of b--ch hath but a short time to live.\\"When his friend Sir Francis Hinsley, chief script writer at Megapolitan Pictures, commits suicide after getting the sack, he goes to make funeral arrangements at Whispering Glades, where the dearly departed are referred to as Loved Ones. This is where Waugh's depiction of the funeral hostess who comes off as a salesman with a pitch comes in. There's a funny line on the description of someone who had been a month at sea and was only ID'd by his wristwatch. \\"They fixed that stiff so he looked like it was his wedding day. Why, if he's sat on an atom bomb, they'd make him presentable.\\" And the hostess later launches into a speech, trying to sell Barlow onto the idea of making arrangements for himself, using an argument akin to people turning down insurance only to lose their home, get robbed, etc. the next day.He meets and falls in love with Aimee Thanatogenos, a crematorium cosmetician. Aimee though, is enamoured with Mr. Joyboy, the head embalmer who goes out of his way to create smiles on the stiffs he sends to Aimee. Joyboy is pleased with her work: \\"I never have to tell you anything. We work in unison. When I send a Loved One in to you, ... I feel as though I were speaking to you through him.\\" Yet she is torn and writes letter to the Guru Brahmin, a kind of Dear Abby advisory column, over the matter.However, twists of fate occur, leading to tragedy in the end, and leave it to Waugh to leave his tried and true cynical humour.So enter, reader, and be happy to read this cynical laugh."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"This book is very well written for many reasons. First, it is very lifelike in that when you read it you feel like the characters are real and that these events really took place. The good thing about this book is that just because these specific people and events are fictional, this book still you lets you know the harsh realitys of life in Hollywood and that everyday these kinds of things happen. People come and go in that industry. When you are felt to have lost step you without every expecting it are kicked to the curb. This book is the kind that keeps you wanting to read more and more because of the continuous drama that leaves you at the edge of your seat.This book also has its down points. Some of those are that the book is somewhat gruesome in the way it depicts death and in the way it commercializes death itself. Those who are weak at heart would find it hard to read this book.This book in some ways is comical. The way the dead loved ones are used as a way to show love and that the way a cosmetician uses the dead loved ones as a type of art.The book is also a good love story. It does not portray love the way most people would like to think of it. The fact of the matter is that most people don't just fall in love and get married and live happily ever after. In a relationship there is deception, anger, and sometimes like in the novel confusion as to what you really want. Also, this book is really good because relationsships can drive people over the edge like some of the characters in the novel. Also, when in relationships you always in one way or another feel a lust for someone else.In conclusion, I feel this book was very well written and very realistic."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"The &quot;The Loved One&quot; is a book that many readers can enjoy. Evelyn Waugh described the book with many vocabulary words. The book had many interesting characters that each played an important part. I give it four stars for the story and how much information it had in it. I would recommend this book to alot of people interested in fiction stories."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"Evelyn Waugh is undoubtedly very creative in expressing and revealing the irony of &quot;The Loved One.&quot; The novel is easily read but partially difficult to understand. At some parts, especially during dialogue, the reader may be lost at who is speaking due the lack of some words like &quot;said.&quot; Not that I feel that Waugh is reluctant to use them but I can understand that a repetition of many &quot;said&quot; words can bland the communication between characters. Also, Waugh's plot was a bit confusing for me. It was sometimes difficult to feel the realism of the book when I couldn't interpret the time frame, (i.e. Sir Francis' past life, Sir Francis when he's alive, the present with Mr. Barlow, Mr. Barlow's past, Miss Thanageo's past.) Other than that the plot went along smoothly. The novel's characters are a work of art. I thought I knew Mr. Barlow as a sensitive writer, but he had no clue how to deal with love. Miss Thanageos can only be pitied. She ha! d a good life, but didn't listen to her heart, but to Guru Brahmin. The setting of the novel somewhat disappointing. I think of Hollywood as a lively place, far from the gloomy cemetery; not a place where lots of people die, and where unexpected things happen. I was surprised by the mortician's attitude. Unlike a classical, long-faced, spooky undertaker, Waugh came up with a cheerful mortician (yet Miss Thanageos still kept a cold emotion within when dealing in business.) In this book, you can't expect a happy ending. The last chapter has much to reveal. It uncovers the coldness of Mr. Barlow, the insanity of Miss Thanageos' life problems, and the desperate groveling of Mr. Joyboy, (ends up that he isn't joyful anymore...) For those who haven't read this book, I must say, read carefully; expect irony and the unexpected, and don't take the death of book characters seriously; (in the book, it happens too often.)"},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"This book contains a very odd sense of humor that is prevalant throughout.

Over-all, I enjoyed it, but it could have been better."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"I thought that the book had a few funny parts but the rest of it was pretty dull. Maybe I just have bad taste, but I did not find all that much of it funny at all. I thought that the book had alot of emotion, which is good, such as the parts when Sir Francis and Miss Thanatogenos commit suicide. The one part that I found funny was when Mr. Slump got tired and annoyed by Miss Thanatogenos's letters and phone call and says,&quot; Maybe she should find a high window and jump. Especially with a name like that.&quot; Over all though I liked the book more that I disliked it so I found it easier to read."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"This story is a funny yet somewhat serious novel. It makes fun of the cemetaries but it is solemn about the death of Sir Francis, Barlows friend that took him in. It captures Sir Ambrose as the Englishman of Hollywood that only cares about himself. This is overall a pretty good book."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"The Loved One was a very interesting book which had it's good and somewhat funny parts. It's questionable though, whether the good parts outnumber the bad. Some of the good parts are when Dennis first meets Aimee' and the times when the book would be describing the parts with Mr. Slump as the Guru Brahmin with his secretary and the other writer. The parts that made me either reread the part over again or just fall asleep were in the beginning when Dennis and Sir Francis were conversing or when Dennis first goes to Whispering Glades. Other parts pretty much just disturbed me. In the long run, the book was well written and it just depends what type of books you like to enjoy this. If your looking for a laugh out loud must read I'm not sure if I would recommend."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"I feel the story The Loved One was a mind catching novel about loved ones. It keeps you wanting to read more but at the same time wondering why. The story is very morbid and could be disturbing to sensitive people or even people who have lost a loved one lately. The Loved One is brilliantly written and very enjoyable. I found the first chapter to be very confusing and the fifth chapter to be a little slow moving, but other then that I enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"I thought that the book The Loved One had its exciding parts and its down parts too.The first two chapters where not very exciding, but then when Sir Francis Hinsely killed himself the book got a lot more exciding.I though the parts where they where talking about where to bury him was very unique.It was unique because the cemitary was seperated into many parts and however the person was they whould be buried in a sertin spot, like if the person that you where going to have be buried was a poet that person would be buried in the poem writers section. The characters wheren't very funny. They where all somewhat unhappy. I thought that when they went to Hollywood it was cool because in some books the author makes up places or write about places I have never heard of, but this time I know what he was writing about. Over all I kind of liked the book but I think it could of been better."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"The Loved One was a pretty interesting book, and i can't say i have ever (or will ever)read a book like this. It was extremely original and some parts were funny. I especially liked the Guru Brahmin. I must say though that i was expecting more. When I read the back cover it said that The Loved One was a comedy about the commercialization of death. I did not think it was that funny. Also the first three or four chapters bored me, and I had to read them 2 or 3 times because I was not paying attention. The end is pretty smart though. Overall I found the book to be average. I liked the end but not the beginning. I would not recommend this book unless you like books with ironic endings or you really like English Literature."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"The Loved One was a good example if how Hollywood can chew you up and spit you out without a care in the world.

It kept me very busy over the summer."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"The book The Loved One was an enjoyable book to read this long hot summer.

It would be one thing if it were much much funnier, but most of the \\"comedy\\" is of the \\"lost in translation\\" variety: nothing but xenophobia and looking down on those beings from a different culture and therefore certainly inferior that populate certain parts of the globe. haha those silly japanese persist in speaking their own language/americans women are all completely interchangable unlike our English roses!

The two men are named Mr. Joyboy and Mr. Barlow and the woman they love is named Miss. Thanotogenos. This novel is suspensful because the reader does not know if Miss. Thanatogenos is going to pick Mr. Joyboy or Mr. Barlow to be her boyfriend. This is also a great novel because there are many surprises that await the reader throughout the whole story. Another thing i liked about the novel is how Mr. Joyboy and Mr. Barlow try to win Miss. Thanotogenos. The only thing that i think was missing from the novel is a little more conflict between Mr. Barlow and Mr. Joyboy.

It looked boring at first, but you can't judge a book by its cover. It was a little boring in the beginning, but then it got a lot better towards the middle and end. I would recommend this book to readers that have a good comprehension. The reason I feel the reader of this book needs to have a good comprehension is that at times I found this book difficult to understand. Otherwise, it was a good novel for mature readers."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"The Loved OneWhen I first started to read it, I thought it was going to be a boring book.

The characters portrayed in this book are realistic and can be related to easily. This book gave me a new perception of life and death and after reading it I fell I have a better understanding of the two. I recommend this book to anyone. It will give you like it did me a new perception of life. The book talks about death in such a way as to make you feel as if death is nothing at all.

I liked this part because it was a weird way to show that you like someone. I did not like that it was written in non-american english because it made it a bit harder to understand. I also didn't like that Amee killed her-self because she did not know who to marry."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"The Loved One was a pretty interesting book, and i can't say i have ever (or will ever)read a book like this. It was extremely original and some parts were funny. I must say though that i was expecting more. When I read the back cover it said that The Loved One was a comedy about the commercialization of death. I did not think it was that funny. Also the first three or four chapters bored me, and I had to read them 2 times because I was not paying attention. The end is pretty smart though. Overall I found the book to be average. I liked the end but not the beginning. I would not recommend this book unless you like books with ironic endings or you really like English Literature."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"At first I thought that the book was going to be very boring because I didn't understand it, but when I started to pay more attention to it it became more interesting. I thought that the book was amusing because it was making fun of the burial industry. This book really taught me a little more about the burial industry even though it was a satire. Also the characteristics of each character made them different from each other. The deaths of both Sir Francis Hensley and Aimee Thanatogenos also made you want to keep reading to see what happened at the end. And the love triangle between Dennis, Aimee, and Mr. Joyboy also kept me reading to the end. All in all I thought that the book was good."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"Highly recommend this brilliant, witty slap-in-the-face to pretentious mannerisms and ignorant sanctity.

It was the best book because i couldn't put it down. It was the feeling of what they do to the Loved Ones ( the ones that passed away ) to make them presentable to the people in the funeral. Just thinking of when I die these people like Mr.Joyboy, and Miss. Thanatogenos are going to make me look like new and happy when I die. I do feel sad that some of the people died like Sir Francis, and Miss. Thanatogenos had died. This book is a little satire because they did things that were not right to do like hide the disappearence of Miss. Thanatogenos. This book wasn't a nightmare that scared me it was a nightmare that made me think of what the people are going to do to me when i die. And it was a sad book that made me feel for the people because they had to die. I liked this book and hope other people liked the book as well as I did.

This is the most boring book I've ever read. i think there should've been a stronger conflict between Mr. Joyboy and Mr. Barlow. If Evelyn Waugh would've changed some parts it would've been better. For example, Ms. Thanatogenos shouldn't have killed herself. Instead, she should've ditched the Joyboy and left to Europe with Mr. Barlow. Mr. joyboy should've been the one to commit suicide. I seriously do not recommend this novel!"},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"I never really read a book by Evelyn Waugh.

As i said this book recieves two thumbs down.4"},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"The Loved One is a very good book because it is dealing with an issue to which we can all relate in one form or another: love and loss. Evelyn Waugh wrote this book as a satire so that people could see the irony in it much better. He did a great job writing this book 50 years ago because what he wrote, about Hollywood, the burial industry, and love still hold true today. The way he named the characters after their personalities was very inventive and Mr. Waugh deserves to be commended for his good thinking. The novel was attention grabbing. It was really funny at times, and twists were constantly added to the story. The book always had you believe the same thing as the characters. Until just before the characters found out, you would find out about a lie. In this book, you find new things happening to the characters all the time. That was always fun! I thought it was a great book and recommend it to anyone who likes satires and loves to read."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"From cover to cover, the book is hilarious. Evelyn Waugh's dry wit will really inspire laughter. Waugh's take on L.A. funeral industry is amazingly funny and creative. His use of location, irony, sarcasm, and a line-up of well developed characters, is evidence of his good writing abilities.Set in Los Angeles, Waugh uses the funniest names for two distinct funeral businesses. First, for the humanly customer is &quot;Whispering Glades&quot;. Secondly, he develops a pet cemetary called &quot;Happier Hunting Grounds&quot;. In a morbid way, these two names will make you laugh. Waugh ironically and sarcastically uses a serious service, the funeral industry, to make a series of funny events that you wouldn't think happens. In one part, Mr. Joyboy, the funeral director of Whispering Glades, fixes a smile on a corpse in order to show his female cosmotician that he likes her.If you like dry humor, sarcastic wit, and great characters, The Loved One is a must read. In fact, I give it four stars and recommend it as a best seller. Waugh hilarious style of writing will leave you wanting to read more of his works."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"This book did not interest me. I found this book somewhat difficult to understand. When Mr. Joyboy and Mr. Barlow ask Miss Thanatogenos to marry her you would expect them to clash against each other. Since there was no hostility between the two gentlemen there was a lack of action in the book which made the novel very dull. What I found very unappealing in this book was the gruesome parts such as the dead bodies which were disfigured. This is what I would look for in a horror novel."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"This book, even though slim, is a laugh out loud satire on the burial industry, the movie business, and all of Hollywood. This is an excellent book for fans of Waugh and a fantastic one for those who have not yet discovered his dry wit. All I can say is: READ IT!!!"},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"While \\"The Loved One\\" was amusing enough and stylistically attractive, I just wasn't that impressed with it. The characters all seemed a bit too faded and pigeon-holed, and had no real personalities to speak of. While the premise had the capacity for great drama and/or comedy, instead there was a rather pallid combination of the two.Joyboy was an entirely creepy personage, whose mannerisms and speech made my skin crawl, which I'm not entirely sure was the intent. Aim&eacute;e was a whiny, indecisive little brat, and at times, I wanted to slap her. Dennis Barlow started out as a wholly sympathetic character, but midway through the story, Waugh turned him into an insensitive jerk with no redeeming qualities. I was jarred from the story by the abrupt change, and couldn't become interested in it again, no matter what happened next.The twist ending was pretty much anticipated and very disappointing. I suspect that I generally tend to be disappointed by \\"great\\" writers, because I expect their work to have an indescribable *something* that other books don't have. Either way, \\"The Loved One\\" was okay, but it wasn't fantastic."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"At Whispering Glades funeral home, Loved Ones is the term used to refer to the deceased. My Joyboy, a foolish, weak-willed embalmer, prepares the bodies for viewing by the Waiting Ones, the relatives and friends of the Loved Ones. Miss Aim&#65533;e Thanatogenos, the appropriately named make-up artist at Whispering Glades, is young, innocent and foolish. Mr Joyboy carefully composes the faces of the Loved Ones so that they smile for her when it is time to put their make-up on. Aim&#65533;e blushes and generally acts as though her head is made of air.Dennis Barlow is a struggling poet and works as a pets' mortician. He has recently suffered the death of his uncle and house-mate, Sir Francis Hinsley, who committed suicide following his dismissal at a Hollywood studio. Barlow visits Whispering Glades, where Aim&#65533;e leads him through the funeral process. He is impressed, both with the young Aim&#65533;e, but also with the care and expense shown to the Loved Ones at Whispering Glades. It is a far height above the casual dumping into furnaces that makes up the majority of his own mortician's work.Waugh writes with a cynical hand. At times, the text strays into near-parody, it is so caustic and contemptuous of the characters and situations presented. But there is enough wit and sharp insight to make the novel enjoyable. The dialogue in particular crackles, with sly British humour inserted alongside blatant parody of American language. Barlow is given the greatest lines - as a hopeful poet, he comes across as knowledgeable in the face of the grand American ignorance of poetry and culture, embodied subtlety within Aim&#65533;e, and more openly in the blubbering of Mr Joyboy. There is a sense that we are in on the joke with Barlow, which may prove uncomfortable for American readers, as the Americans in the novel are without fail stupid, greedy, shallow and uncultured.The funeral industry is something that we shall all, in one way or another, come into contact with. One can only hope that it will be at a late stage in our life, but at places like Whispering Glades, children are cared for with as much loving attention as the elderly. Waugh's sharpest insight is showing the ways in which the bereaved are persuaded into outlaying huge amounts for their deceased relatives. Yes, an appropriate and tasteful funeral certainly provides closure and allows for a certain aesthetic and emotional sensibility at a difficult time, but there is no question that some of the grander options for funerals run to the excessive. Waugh captures this almost parasitic end of the industry successfully, with Whispering Glades providing services that range from ordinary all the way up to sarcophagi and private mausoleums.Waugh's jokes tend to the subtle when it comes to dialogue, and the savage when it comes to plot. Clever lines are so smoothly inserted that an inattentive reader may miss them: 'We usually recommend the casked half-exposure for gentlemen because the legs never look so well.' But the larger parodies of plot are easier to spot. Throughout the novel, Aim&#65533;e is torn between her love for Barlow and her desire for career advancement through Mr Joyboy, which prompts her to write a series of purple letters to the Guru Brahmin, a conglomerate of 'two gloomy men and a bright young secretary', who share the workload of the Guru's newspaper column. Aim&#65533;e, of course, believes that the Guru is a wise man from India, one who is more than capable of helping her choose the right man. We know the joke's on her, but we are also able to raise the satire to a higher level, in realising that, while she helps relieve grieving relatives of their money, outside of work she is capable of being all but swindled by an imaginary Guru.An easy criticism of the novel is that none of the characters are particularly likable. Aim&#65533;e is naive and hopelessly shallow, while Mr Joyboy is ridiculous and far too much of a mother's boy. Barlow is the most sympathetic of the characters, but only because we are amused by his caustic wit. Take that away, and he is as unappealing as the others. But the novel exists as a satire, not a character study, and it is there where it succeeds. The funeral industry is as ripe as any other for savaging, and Waugh more than rises to the challenge.The ending to the novel is an incredibly neat fit. Too neat to be anything but contrived, though again, this works because of the novel's intention. The ending is foreshadowed on almost every page, and if that isn't enough, Aim&#65533;e's name gives the game away. While it does wrap up a little too neatly for Barlow, the novel ends in the way that a novel satirical of the funeral industry must. The Loved Ones is short, funny and very sharp."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"A brilliant example of Waugh at his best..not a superfluous word in this perfect novel."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"This is one of the great modern satires. Waugh accurately skewers both the film and the funeral industries. I've worked in both; Waugh captures the self-serving artiface of both.His style is sparkling. I've read this novel several times and still laugh out loud reading it."},{"Title":"The loved one","review":"Evelyn Waugh's 1948 satire on Hollywood and Forest Lawn, \\"The Loved One\\" provided much of the inspiration for Billy Wilder&#8217;s classic 1950 movie \\"Sunset Boulevard,\\" with Gloria Swanson as a silent-screen legend plotting a comeback and William Holden as her toy boy. The imprint of Waugh&#8217;s macabre tale on Wilder&#8217;s dark comedy is unmistakable, even though Wilder and his colleagues reversed many elements when they couldn't obtain the rights to \\"The Loved One.\\"After playing herself in Sunset Boulevard&#8217;s final scene, gossip columnist Hedda Hopper burbled on June 15, 1949: \\"It was mighty grim on the &#8220;Sunset Boulevard&#8221; set after Gloria Swanson shot and killed Bill Holden.&#8230;Billy Wilder&#8230;was crazy about Evelyn Waugh&#8217;s book &#8220;The Loved One,&#8221; and wanted the studio to buy it. Thought it would make another &#8220;Lost Weekend.&#8221; Waugh wrote it while he was here as a guest of Metro. The studio officials were trying to make up their minds if his book, &#8220;Brideshead Revisited&#8221; could be filmed.\\"The main characters in both The Loved One and Sunset Boulevard are young but washed-up screenwriters who live with older Hollywood has-beens from the silent-movie era in their fading houses with empty swimming pools.
