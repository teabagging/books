It talks about all of the good things about web services. Yet it makes several crucial mistakes that clearly show that the author is by no means aware of what a service oriented architecture must provide. The crucial points that lead to failures using distributed architectures in the grand scale are not discussed. The whole problem is seen totally as a management issue. It is not. It is a vital technical challenge, and web services are by no means ready to take that challenge. Problems like transactions, security, undoability, Quality of service etc are not even slightly solved today. The savvy managers should read the book, give it to a savvy software architect, and afterwards discuss very carefully. Another annoying feature is that the author sees technical people as the ones being the greatest opposition to service oriented architectures. They can be, but the real problem are business managers and departments who do not want to be service providers in the first place because it means giving up some of their power and probably loose some of their workforce."},{"Title":"Web Services and Service-Oriented Architectures: The Savvy Manager's Guide (The Savvy Manager's Guides)","review":"There must be hundreds of books on Web services, most of them with chapters that read like alphabet soup (UDDI, SOAP, WSDL, etc.). I've read quite a few of these books and it's awfully easy to get lost in the details. Douglas Barry's Web Services and Service-Oriented Architectures, The Savvy Manager's Guide, does something else: it gives you a genuinely useful high-level view.Barry makes a very important distinction: Web services (the term we hear about so much) are connections. Services are what these connections deliver. What is important in the long run are not the connections (Web services) but the goods they will provide (services of many kinds). As Barry and many others see it, the future of software is in the services that will be used to plug information (data) and programming into service-oriented applications.Managing both the connections and the services will be a principal task of IT in the coming years, and it's Barry's contention that it can best be addressed by developing a service-oriented architecture. Much of the book is given over to discussing the nature of software architecture, what it means in the case of services, and how you would go about deciding what kind of architecture to use. This seems like esoteric stuff, but Barry does a very good job of removing excess jargon and inserting real-life analogies to clarify the topics.The author also uses his own experience and point of view to humanize what could be a mind-numbing onslaught of abstractions. I'm particularly happy that he discusses the difficulties of implementing Web services and a service-oriented architecture - a reality check that's sorely missing from many other books.Personally I might quibble with his assumption that the technical difficulties of Web services and particularly the problem of arriving at standards will shortly be resolved. But this is, ultimately, a matter of timing. That Web services are going to be important and probably pivotal for software is generally accepted. Barry does an excellent job of explaining what's involved, why it's important, and how to approach it-necessary background information for just about everybody involved in IT. Highly recommended"},{"Title":"Web Services and Service-Oriented Architectures: The Savvy Manager's Guide (The Savvy Manager's Guides)","review":"Frankly, I feel that some reviewers misunderstand the purpose of this book. In my opinion, for the right person, this book is a gem! Any of us who have had the challenge of explaining new and difficult concepts to managers who left technology back in the COBOL days or never were technologists should be grateful.As technologists, we forget just how much intimidating jargon we use and how many underlying assumptions we make when we explain things. As a software architect once said to me, &quot;if I had more time, I'd make it simple.&quot; Clearly Barry has taken on the challenge of making it simple, and such efforts are incredibly valuable."},{"Title":"Web Services and Service-Oriented Architectures: The Savvy Manager's Guide (The Savvy Manager's Guides)","review":"As a fellow author of a book targeted at managers, I feel that I have a pretty good understanding of their needs. Doug has done an admirable job of meeting these needs for Web services. This is a book for managers that want to have sucessful Web services projects.Doug starts by motivating the need for Web services with a utopian view of a near future business trip. Then he gives a thorough account of Web services technology basics at a level that even managers whose technical days are long in the past can understand. He ties this account back to the utopian business trip, showing how Web services overcome the technical obstacles to making it a reality.This book really shines in its extensive treatment of how managers can make their Web services projects successful. As a technologist, I have a tendency to underestimate the impact of \\"soft\\" project management issues, but Doug has not made this mistake. His years of experience clearly show through in his thoughtful and comprehensive treament of the forces pushing managers to use Web services, the potential obstacles to project completion, and how to overcome them."},{"Title":"Web Services and Service-Oriented Architectures: The Savvy Manager's Guide (The Savvy Manager's Guides)","review":"I've always been a fan of Doug Barry. In the early Nineties Doug Barry focused on OO Databases. He produced a series of reports that compared every feature of every OO database. For awhile these magisterial volumes were the bible for any large company that wanted to buy an OO database. In this case, Doug presented the big picture by organizing the categories a team would use to analyze products, and then covered the details by presenting tables that showed exactly which features or functions each product had.Doug's latest book is Web Services and Service-Oriented Architectures: The Savvy Manager's Guide.(Morgan Kaufmann, 2003). This book is written for architects and managers who are trying to figure out just what Web Services will mean for their organizations. It focuses on describing just what is involved in a Web Services Architecture and then explores the various options companies face as they think about how they might implement such an architecture. A quick glance at the contents gives you an idea of the scope:I. Service-Oriented Architecture Overview1. A Business Trip in the Not-Too-Distant Future2. Information Technology Used in This Trip3. Service-Oriented Architectures and Web Services4. Forces Affecting the Adoption of Web Services and Other Integration Techniques5. Growing Impact of Web Services6. Service-Oriented Architectures and Beliefs about Enterprise Architectures7. Starting to Adopt a Service-Oriented ArchitectureII. Managing Change Needed for a Service-Oriented Architecture8. Change Will Happen9. Tips for Managing Change Issues During DevelopmentIII. Creating Service-Oriented Architectures10. Architectures at Each Stage of Adoption for Web Services11. Architectural Options12. Middle-Tier Architectures13. Revisiting the Business Trip in the Not-Too-Distant FutureIV. Compendium of Software Technologies14. Additional Specification Details15. Quick Reference GuideEarly on, Barry introduces a simple, high-level diagram of an architecture, and then follows through by using it throughout the text with great effect. Many complex options are easily compared or contrasted by a glance at one of the diagrams.Web Services depend heavily on XML and its various standards and Barry confronts that head on by providing an extensive reference guide to all the acronyms that we keep seeing, and that various specifications that tie them together. Anyone new to the world of XML would find it valuable just to buy this guide to get an overview of the world of XML. Most, however, will read the architecture sections, and be grateful that they can flip to the back whenever they want to check on an XML standard of which they are unsure.Given his nice treatment of middleware and the OMG XML standards (XMI, MOF, MDA, CWM), I was sorry that Barry didn't do a bit more to explain the OMG's Model Driven Architecture and explain how it could play a role in the evolving world of Web Service Architectures.This book covers a complex and rapidly expanding field in about 240 pages. Any manager or enterprise architect who is trying to develop an understanding of the basics and figure out the implications of web services should read this book. You won't find a better or more concise introduction to this important new area. Doug Barry has done it again!"},{"Title":"Web Services and Service-Oriented Architectures: The Savvy Manager's Guide (The Savvy Manager's Guides)","review":"Throughout the book the author discusses on the same stuff repeatedly.....as multiple parts and chapters.

I wish there was a \\"R\\" or \\"NR\\" rating for books that would reflect appropriateness for certain \\"age\\" in one's career. This book (\\"Web Services and Service-Oriented Architecture\\" http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1558609067) is dangerous in content as it is in its trumpeting up of the web services.The Good StuffThe only one good line out of the book is on p97: there is more money to be made on the services provided using web services than on the web services technology itself - yup you heard da-man: web services are NBYATP (nothing but yet another transport protocol) - pretty much since the dawn of geeks we witnessed healthy flow of trumpeted transport protocols that ended up at most as a 10 year fab - with TCP having the only staying power as the building block of our virtual lives. you know the the RPCs, the HTTPs, the DCOMs, the CORBAs, the IIOPs, the SOAPs, ...Educator, Educate thyselfThe author needs to get an education from \\"COM+ and battle for middle tier\\" (http://www.objectwatch.com/ and http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00007FYHG) where master Sessions explains why the whole shebang about caching data in the middle tier, coding transaction coordination by hand, and using stateful services is a KOD (kiss of death) for systems where number of simultaneous users exceeds one's age.The author also needs to read more from the anti-middle-tier-christ Tom Kyte (http://asktom.oracle.com/ and \\"Expert One on One\\" http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1590592433) and understand why one shouldn't try to do what databases do best - process massive sets of data, quickly.DelusionsThe dangerous chapters start around p127 (sure, stick your data inside a middle tier access rules so nobody other then your application can ever get to it) and totally enter delusions on page 175 referencing magical \\"50 times or more\\" improvement using caching in the middle tier (sure that works for magical systems where no updates take place - find ONE real system where this occurs).Distributed Cachingthe distributed caching problem hasn't been solved at the academic level, let alone implemented in any of the OOTB systems out there. The less-then perfect approaches have been implemented (e.g. Network File System, Oracle Real Application Clusters, Google File System) but with their own quirks and for their own domain. These implementations just prove that distributed caching product is an NP complete problem and will probably stay at least until the next generation.Transaction Coordinationfor those who think that web services architectures will solve the multi-source data update transaction coordination, boy are you in for a ride. Sure, you can pick up one of the standards that Roger Sessions artfully keeps spitting at in his monthly newsletter where he displays the Cassandra syndrome by telling the \\"big guys\\" that you can't cache the data in any non-authority tier (usually non-database tier), coordinate transaction with stateful services *and* provide large volume support at the same time. The experienced will tell you that the more data you cache in the middle tier, the less clients you can service. Stateful web services - eeeek - that's the screeching of my fingernails against the metal wall - find me one business that has one dedicated phonecall taking service rep per client - so why do you think that anyone can afford to have a single instance of web service for one client only?Stateless is the kingthe obvious answer is that stateless services are the king, but they bring unfriendly problems that you know and love from HttpSession days - one call one transaction, can't daisy-chain them unless there is a transaction processing monitor environment available, can't rollback after the call completes, etc etc etc.Caveat - Open/XAOne thing I will concede - if you have Open/XA compliant data source under the hood exposed via WebServices spec that supports recoverable Open/XA-like stateless transaction protocol (business workflow coordination spec) - yes you can fix all that's wrong with web services - if you can afford decresed throughput (in any measurable sense) AND inability to perform set operations.Row-by-row securityjust try applying security to the underlying data source. did you ever try to implement a security based on iterative approach where each \\"row\\" of information is fetched, and security access check is perfomed? then you know this works for systems where you fetch a few rows. try doing a search across say 10-15 million rows and apply your row-by-row security policy and you'll see why I wouldn't leave home without Oracle and its Virtual Private Database technology in my pocket. I can swifth through 250,000 users, 1M+ discretionary access controls (DACs, a.k.a. ACL) and 1M+ mandatory access controls (MACs, or functional security), and 10M+ documents in under one second - and all of it transparently available to middle tier applications, Business Intelligence (BI) reporting systems, and command line interpreters. what are YOUR numbers Mr. row-by-row middle tier WebServices security?Maybe, just maybe...web services will always be relegated to systems where flexibility and data transformation capability trumps volume in terms of simultaneous users, transactions, and data volume (but then you can use XSLT, perl, awk, etc); in other words once the number of simultaneous users exceeds your age combined with transactions volume above number of your fingers per second, and you can say good night to your web services.Anecdotalas a good friend of mine once said: \\"These guys built an XML over TCP transaction processing platform. They proudly stated they can process 3 transactions per second. Our production system at the exchange written in C blasts through about 10,000 of the same transactions per second. who are they kidding?\\"Closing Words of wisdomand to paraphrase Tom Kyte and add to this conversation: \\"I can do about 3,000 logged (recoverable) transactions per second from 5,000 clients on my ***laptop*** using a Java-JDBC-Oracle 10g all-in-one combination and about 15,000 nonlogged (nonrecoverable)transactions per second using PL/SQL as a client. What kind of volume can you service your web service again?\\""},{"Title":"Web Services and Service-Oriented Architectures: The Savvy Manager's Guide (The Savvy Manager's Guides)","review":"From the start, I was happy to see that Barry wasn't one of those old school guys who tried something 10 years ago that didn't work, and had sworn off a similar endeavor forever as impossible. He's been there - he just has moved on, just as computing and software technologies have changed and made a lot of our past experiences less relevant today.Neither is this book a recipe for perfection requiring strict adherence. His regular admonition to build for flexibility and his willingness to point out the flaws in conventional beliefs is a welcome departure from most architectural guides.I particularly enjoyed the discussion on middle-tier architectures and data caching. As service-oriented architectures mature, it's highly unlikely they will succeed if all data access occurs in the enterprise tier. An SOA will encourage new applications and more sophisticated services, which will place even more stress on data access and responsiveness. Plus, the SOA infrastructure itself will require non-enterprise data for state management, diagnostics, object mapping and other functions that must be stored in the middle tier. This is a topic that cannot be avoided for an SOA that fulfills its long-term promise to the business. Barry's book is the only one I have found that deals with this reality in a straightforward, unemotional way.Given that most of the SOA failures are likely to occur in the planning and organiation of the team or teams involved, I'm happy to see this kind of book now, when most companies are in the early stages.

An example of this phenonema from US-style western riding is the &quot;sliding stop&quot;. When a horse is very responsive, it should be possible to stop quickly in order to change direction, and sometimes the horse is going so fast he slides to a stop. Unfortunately, &quot;responsiveness&quot; is difficult to judge, and sliding is dramatic, so an original practical ideal of being able to change a horse's direction has turned into a contest to see how far a horse can drag itself by the front hooves while letting the back hooves drag on the ground. A similar corruption of purpose and technique has played itself out in almost every riding discipline as those activies have become more removed from any practical purpose.This is one of the only books that attempts to place riding in its proper context in history. Its points are illustrated with many rare color and black &amp; white prints of historical paintings and photographs that are invaluable in learning how to ride. The major riding masters of history and what they discovered are all presented in a way that makes one want to learn more. Anyone wishing to increase their understanding of riding past past what is currently fashionable should own this book."},{"Title":"Dressage: The Art of Classical Riding","review":"Dressage, isn't that just a bunch of horses being ridden around in circles?

She has artfully presented it in a way that makes it resonate to virtually everyone by showing how they are all connected through history.

Shades of Haruki Murakami by way of early Jonathan Lethem (and others), his sharply pointed science fiction-like stories and novels are deliciously active idea demons and concept farmers. In Cobralingus, Noon introduces those familiar with his work -- it is not the best introduction to Noon by any means -- to a game that writers can use to recombine disparate texts, apply a set of rules, and develop outlet texts that read like some of the most imaginative skiffy out there -- even if they're mutations of pre-existing texts.After explaining the game's process and offering a key to the rules, what Noon terms \\"filter gates,\\" the writer serves up 10 example stories, starting with the original, or inlet, text -- and stepping through the process until the resulting outlet text arrives. It's a fascinating, albeit occasionally confusing and mind-bending process, but the end results are wonderful. At the end, Noon divulges his source texts, which range from a 1591 madrigal to a BBC shipping forecast transmitted in 1999.This is a book for readers, but it is also a book for writers. The text -- and the game -- made me want to write.

There is no such actual thing as the &quot;Cobralingus Engine&quot;, it is a device dreamed up in the head of the author Jeff Noon as an experimental way of working out new ways of writing. Being a person greatly interested in DJing and the forms of Audio mixing, it was so refreshing and interesting to see these concepts applied to the humble word.His last book, Needle in the Groove, was his first experiment with this stylistic approach, and I believe that this book is unto itself a marvellous side-step from his normal works.I have no doubt that he will have a new &quot;Story&quot; book out very soon, but I believe his point with this offering was to show us readers the style behind his extremely picturesque word usage, that has developed throughout his career.It is clever, witty, and an extremely interesting peice of literature - and in using the word literature, I mean exactly that - this is no pulp sci-fi, this is a work of pure art, and should be viewed as such with open eyes - do so, and you will be amazed.

Also, there are at least two different covers, the one not shown above being a nice illustration.This is a book that has grown on me over time, and today I'm very glad I kept it around. It's the kind I often return to to read a short section, a single \\"poem\\", which leaves me sitting lost in thought for a while.These are unusual poems that can be seen in their various stages of life, each equally presented as a final piece. Like a computer program or a DJ processing a sample of sound, a text snippet is passed through various filters and processes that re-arrange, sometimes wildly, the content to create various stages of the poems evolution. These are not just the output of some computer randomizer however, the processes are to my mind much more creative and human than could be achieved by software. Some do things like mix up all the words which is fairly easy, but others do things like \\"Find A Story\\" from a jumble of words, which obviously involves a lot more decision making and creativity from the author.Just as in modern music samples, the source material covers a huge range, from serious literature such as Shakespeare, to pedestrain things like \\"things that happened to Jeff Noon today\\". The results are always amazing and inspiring, both for the actual content, creativity and beauty in the text, as well as the concepts used for types of manipulation.This is one of the most creatively inspiring books i own, from someone very interested in poetry, systems processing, modern art, modern music, deconstruction, etc."},{"Title":"Cobralingus","review":"Here Noon continues to experiment with style, &#34;remixing&#34; source texts (provided for reference) in various ways and explaining his process with each iteration.

This was their reward for having the guts and determination to go ahead with such trailblazing efforts as \\"The Curse of Frankenstein\\" and \\"Dracula.\\" In those seven years Hammer had also effectively shook off any competition (for a year it looked as though Anglo-Amalgamated might offer competition, until \\"Peeping Tom\\" halted their sojourn into horror.). However in 1964 writer Milton Subotsky and producer Max J. Rosenberg released an anthology film called \\"Dr. Terror's House of Horror's\\" and for the next decade, under the banner of Amicus Productions, would provide strong competition for Hammer. Amicus are best known for their anthology films and would achieve notable international success with films such as \\"Tales from the Crypt\\", \\"The House that Dripped Blood\\" and \\"Asylum.\\" Amicus' attempts to make single narrative feature films were less successful, but occasionally they got it right. The complex and elliptical \\"Scream and Scream Again\\" was the only film the company released that engaged directly with anxieties and issues of the day. Whilst the undeservedly obscure \\"The Skull\\" is a terrifying tour de force. Compared to Hammer there is very little written on the company. This valuable, but slim book is edited by Allan Bryce, a genre specialist whose bi monthly magazine \\"The Dark Side\\" has thrilled fans of horror since 1990. The light and conversational tone of this book is in keeping with \\"The Dark Side\\" which is not concerned with the academic treatment of films. This is very much a book by fans for fans. It is a pleasurable read due to the witty humour, which although at times is caustic and dismissive of certain films still retains a love for the horror genre. Where the book really excels is in its visual presentation, it is full colour throughout with some wonderful stills, posters and lobby cards which gives the reader some indication of how these films were marketed. This is a beautifully presented book and a key addition to any reading list of British horror cinema."},{"Title":"Amicus, The Studio That Dripped Blood","review":"A lot of horror fans are starting to regard the 70s as something of a golden age for the genre. In the US the spawn of 'Night of the Living Dead' in the form of bleak shockers like 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' were starting to roam the drive-ins. In the UK, while Hammer's classics were largely behind them, fresh competition was emerging in the form of new independents like Amicus. Amicus were best known for their anthology films, and their 'From Beyond the Grave's a personal fave.'Amicus: The Studio That Dripped Blood' is a treat in many ways. It's a competently designed, visual feast, which covers the studio's output in some detail. But like Amicus itself, the book is very much a mixed bag. British monster mag stalwart Allan Bryce is credited as editor, though who actually wrote it isn't clear. Bryce's style - 70s horror hackery - is all over some of it at least. 'Funny' picture captions, and a tendency to overuse the '!' key and finish synopses with... for example. The whole thing needed a good edit. There's far too much extraneous facts (do we really need to know exact takings for the initial runs on old classics? Or what a screenwriter's father did for a living?) and not enough insight or wit. Is a full page box-out on Joan Collins justified? Coverage of the studio's non-genre productions is probably redundant, as are full plot synopses including spoilers in our post-VCR age. I also find film journalists waxing lyrical on the sexual attractiveness of various starlets a little seedy, though that's perhaps just personal taste.The book feels very much like a lavish extended genre 'zine, with all of the limitations and advantages that implies. It's obviously derived from a genuine love of the genre, but the writing lacks the verve to make it fully contagious. Knocked into shape it could - like the best of Amicus's output - have become a cult classic. As it stands, it's a slightly stilted love letter to an unjustly neglected horror studio. Next to solid books on similar subjects like Harvey Fenton's 'Ten Years of Terror' or Jonathon Rigby's 'English Gothic', 'The Studio that Dripped Blood' feels rather thin."},{"Title":"The Horrible Happening","review":"i personally recommend this book it captures your attention on the spot, a horrible happening is a must read"},{"Title":"The Horrible Happening","review":"Grades 4-7.

The most famous participant was Wyatt Earp, who has been portrayed in at least thirty movies, and you can imagine with what degree of realism. For instance, who remembers that because of the shootout, Wyatt and his sidekick Doc Holliday were actually brought to court for murder? In the lawless West, the law took its course, and in _Murder in Tombstone: The Forgotten Trial of Wyatt Earp_ (Yale University Press), Steven Lubet has looked at the legend and the legal outcome. This particular gunfight is still argued about by experts and western fans, and it is certainly the case that important parts of the event itself are never going to be completely understood. However, the subsequent trial was well documented, and Lubet's is the first book to tell the often surprising story of the court fight after the gun fight. Lubet is a lawyer himself, and brings much legal insight to a story that is usually only told as western legend.Tombstone was a town that had sprung up in response to silver mining, and in true boomtown fashion it would fold only a few years after the shootout (it has come back as a tourist site since then). Around the town were cowboys, not at this time the respectable ranch-hands who managed cattle production, but small time ranchers who raided herds in Mexico to replenish stock, and robbed stagecoaches as a sideline. Virgil Earp came to town as a US marshal and Wyatt followed as a deputy county sheriff; they were professional lawmen, and would have been immediately marked as enemies of the cowboys. Youngest brother Morgan was there as well, and following Wyatt was the disreputable Doc Holliday he had inexplicably befriended. Among the cowboys were Ike and Billy Clanton and Frank and Tom McLaury. Ike got into a shouting match with Doc in the Alhambra Saloon, in which Virgil had to intervene. Ike spent the night drinking and cursing the Earps, and on 26 October 1881 enlisted the McLaurys and his brother Billy to arm themselves and prepare to meet the lawmen. Three of the cowboys died, and public sympathy turned from the lawmen to those they had killed. Five days later there was a preliminary hearing which was to determine if the accused men ought to be bound over for a trial. It is this hearing that forms the mass of the book, with an examination of the legal procedures of the time compared to those now.The hearing lasted a month, with thirty different witnesses, some of them surprise witnesses called by the defense. As a lawyer, Lubet is very good at alerting readers to mistakes the lawyers on both sides made. \\"As desperate lawyers often do...\\" he explains when a lawyer stalls for time after a witness has given a surprisingly unfavorable response, or \\"Then the cross examiner blundered in a manner still all too familiar to trial lawyers, by asking one question too many.\\" Spicer found that although Virgil had acted \\"incautiously and without due circumspection,\\" the defendants had committed only \\"a necessary act, done in the discharge of official duty.\\" There is a short epilogue after the trial; Virgil was ambushed in revenge and crippled for life, Morgan was shot and killed while playing billiards, and Wyatt conducted a \\"vendetta ride\\" to kill those responsible for attacking his brothers. This all sounds more like western history as depicted in the cinema. The main part of Lubet's history, however, is a fascinating and detailed examination not of a shoot-out but of the uncinematic and neglected legal outcome."},{"Title":"Murder in Tombstone: The Forgotten Trial of Wyatt Earp (The Lamar Series in Western History)","review":"Let me preface this review by stating that I am a political junkie. My copy of \\"Murder in Tombstone\\" arrived this AM. I wasn't able to sit down to read it until about an hour before the Presidential Debate. I kept one ear on the debate and both eyes on the book. I think Wyatt Earp may have expressed an opinion on the War in Iraq, but I'm not quite sure. I devoured Steve Lubet's book in one sitting, finishing just about the time Brit Hume ended his wrap-up of the debate.Seriously, I found the book absolutely fascinating. About half-way through it I came to the conclusion I'd love to see this book made into the Ultimate OK Corral Movie! Lubet brought much needed new insight into a story that appeared not to need new insight. Until now the only book strictly about the Inquest was Turner's, which is excellent source material. The Lubet version will replace Turner in many respects although the Turner does provide a complete transcription of the Inquest.The entire field of Tombstone & Earp related books and research will benefit from this book. The past decade has been an exciting one in the field dominated by well-researched books by Casey Tefertiller and Allen Barra, both of which I highly recommend. It will be further enhanced by the publication of my book, \\"Travesty\\" this winter.Anyone who is interested in a good legal read with be absolutely fascinated by this one."},{"Title":"Murder in Tombstone: The Forgotten Trial of Wyatt Earp (The Lamar Series in Western History)","review":"Despite its anomalous title, which must be either a marketing ploy or the author's unstated opinion, this is an exceptional book written by a legal scholar who is intimately familiar with the law and its history, and who has obviously done his homework regarding the hearing held in the wake of the police action of October 26,1881 in Tombstone, Arizona. The author clearly understands the laws, then extant in Arizona, and has studied the case and its testimony in painstaking detail. With that insight and background, he walks us through the proceedings pointing out when and where the prosecution and defense succeeded or erred in judgment, either winning or losing points for their positions. Fortunately for the reader, Mr. Lubet writes fluently and is able to explain the subtle nuances of both the law and the testimony, as a lawyer would see it, in terms easily understood by the layman. This makes for easy and enjoyable reading.Beyond the proceedings, the book is still more interesting since it delves into some little known legalities of times past and explores the histories of some of the major participants. For example: I never quite understood why those accused of assassinating Abraham Lincoln were never allowed to testify in their own defense. Little did I know that, prior to 1864, laws in all U.S. jurisdictions prohibited accused parties from doing so or that in 1864 Maine became the first state to abolish that rule. Neither did I know that Judge Spicer, who presided at the OK Corral hearing was the defense attorney for the only man found guilty and executed in Utah for the Mountain Meadows Massacre. I also didn't know that Tom and Frank McLaury's brother, Will, a lawyer from Texas, interjected himself into the proceedings on the side of the prosecution and may have been instrumental in that side's insisting on a charge of first degree murder.I must confess, however, that although I found this book to be an excellent read I was somewhat disappointed at some of the things the author failed to recognize, or at least failed to mention, and I have to disagree with some of his conclusions. More specifically: he never observed that the prosecution's case was almost entirely fabricated. As a result, he didn't seem to understand why their lawyers didn't ask more probing and expansive questions to solidify their testimony. The obvious answer, in my view, is that what they had contrived was all there was and that any deviation from that orchestrated testimony could easily have devastated their case. I.e., Would all the witnesses have said the same thing? (Witness Ike Clanton's wild and outlandish testimony.) In addition, the author stated several times that Wyatt Earp had clearly lied in stating that his gun was in his pocket. In the author's opinion, if that was so Wyatt would never have been able to draw it as quickly as he was said to have done. Instead, Mr. Lubet concluded that Wyatt was most likely waving it as they approached the \\"Cowboys.\\" (a clear provocation) To me, a more likely scenario is that upon seeing that the Cowboys were armed, Wyatt quite sensibly put his hand in his pocket, grasped his pistol and steadied his nerves. And, strangely enough, the author never mentioned the fact that almost all of the prosecution witnesses were friends or associates of the slain Cowboys and that, based on the testimony of the two most neutral witnesses to the shootout, all had clearly perjured themselves.There is one other conclusion which one can drawn from this book. Whereas many have long held that Sheriff Behan was simply a bumbling or ineffectual lawman with sympathies toward the \\"Cowboys\\" (i.e., the outlaws). He was most likely one of them. Why else would he: 1) deputize known Cowboys, 2) include known Cowboys in his posses, 3) steadfastly avoid ever capturing any Cowboys, and 4) perjure himself in an attempt to hang Virgil, Wyatt, and Morgan Earp, three respected lawmen, along with Doc Holliday? Blind hatred may have clouded Will McLaury's judgment, if he was an honorable man, but Johnny Behan has no such excuse.All that aside, however, this is an erudite book about the most famous gun fight and the most controversial character on America's wild frontier. As such, it is thought provoking and a \\"must have\\" for every fan of western history."},{"Title":"Murder in Tombstone: The Forgotten Trial of Wyatt Earp (The Lamar Series in Western History)","review":"Steven Lubet's \\"Murder in Tombstone\\" is a landmark study, both because Lubet takes a fresh approach and because the book represents a perfect marriage of author and subject.Paula Marks, Casey Tefertiller, Allen Barra, and Steve Gatto have all addressed the OK corral preliminary hearing at length in their books, and Jeff Morey has written about it at length in his Internet and other articles. Each has examined the testimony, and judged it in light of such factors as witness credibility and extra-transcript evidence. They have commented upon the impact made upon the hearing by Thomas Fitch and William McLaury, and upon the reasoning of Wells Spicer. But \\"Murder in Tombstone\\" is something new.While other works have focused on what the judge, lawyers and witnesses said about the conduct of the lawmen (police & sheriff) and of their adversaries in the vacant lot, this is the first work to focus on the conduct of the judge and lawyers (and secondarily of the witnesses). It is a first rate study, not only about the conduct of a particular complex 30-day preliminary hearing, but also of trial practice in the Gilded Age West. And this is where that \\"perfect marriage\\" I spoke of comes in. While Steven Lubet is not the first lawyer to pen a book about the OK Corral gunfight, he is the first recognized national authority on trial advocacy to do so. He has had that status for about a decade (as far as I can tell from the Amazon listings), and so what he has to say about the options open to the judge & lawyers, the tactics used and discarded, the traps sprung and the mistakes made, carries great weight. I don't agree with every conclusion made by Lubet. (I don't think that Wyatt had his gun out of his coat pocket; I think it more likely that he had his hand on his gun in his pocket, and that the hesitating movements of Frank/Billy gave him time to jerk and fire.) But I do conclude that this groundbreaking study cannot be ignored, will not be easily challenged.Finally, the book elevates attorney Thomas Fitch to the level of being one of the most significant characters in the entire Earp/Cow-boy/Tombstone drama. Without his representation of the Earps, there would have been no Vendetta. Without a Vendetta, there would have been some books on the OK Corral story, but they would never have become the book/movie/etc. industry they became.Buy this book and read it closely. While likely to remain sui generis in the OK gunfight field (and for that reason in print for a long, long time), it should give rise to a new genre of American legal history. Let's hope so."},{"Title":"Murder in Tombstone: The Forgotten Trial of Wyatt Earp (The Lamar Series in Western History)","review":"Anyone interested in Wyatt Earp and Tombstone might be excused for wondering what new there is to say on the most written about of all gunfights in the Old West. But in this new book, Northwestern University law professor Stephen Lubet delivers a fresh approach, thoroughly analyzing the legal strategies and procedures that took place during the post-gunfight hearing in Judge Wells Spicer's courtroom. The hearing was ostensibly held to determine whether the law officers involved in the gunfight would be held over for the grand jury, but this hearing turned out to be the de facto trial of the Earp brothers and Doc Holliday for the killing of three cowboys. The author calls this judicial proceeding \\" the most widely debated decision ever delivered in a preliminary hearing by a justice of the peace.\\" This does not seem undue hyperbole, as its results have been the subject of heated controversy for more than a century, with each generation producing its pro and anti-Earp polemicists anew.While the myriad studies of the Earps and of Tombstone history must of necessity describe notable and sensational aspects of the hearing, Lubet focuses on topics overlooked by other writers. The author deconstructs each interim judicial decision of Judge Spicer, along with the actions of the prosecution team and defense lawyers. He parses the testimony of the defendants, and of a parade of witnesses for both sides.Spicer's background as a defense lawyer at the trials of John D. Lee at the infamous Mountain Meadows Massacre is examined in relation to its critical impact here. Spicer was determined not to preside at a trial where perjury was suborned, according to the author. Lee's trials, where such perjury occurred, is pivotal in understanding his decisions.Earp defense lawyer Thomas Fitch is shown to understand recent changes in \\"cross-examination\\" far better than prosecution lawyers. This technique had been lately evolving, moving past being used merely for filling in missing information. Fitch's cross-examination destroyed Ike Clanton's testimony. The prosecution's attempts at cross-examinations, on the other hand, floundered. The addition to the prosecution team of the understandably vindictive Will McLaury, brother of two slain cowboys, hindered their efforts. It precluded the possibility of trying the lawmen for anything short of first-degree murder. McLaury would have nothing less.The author shows the entire prosecution team stumbling badly by presenting no final argument and by not moving to lesser charges of homicide. They thereby made Ike Clanton's testimony central to their case. This left Spicer with only one option, untenable to him, if he saw merit in the prosecution's case- turning the Earps over to the grand jury on first-degree murder charges. After listening to Clanton's fantastic testimony, the judge, likely influenced by his Mountain Meadows experience, was unwilling to help the defense by countenancing a lesser charge against the lawmen on his own.Lubet dissects the evidence, devastating to the prosecution, given by neutral witnesses. He breaks down the testimony of two key unaligned witnesses, H. F. Sills, a railway in town for a short time, and Addie Bourland, a seamstress who witnessed the beginning of the fight. The author discusses the legal propriety of Spicer's ex parte interview with Bourland.Those who believe the Earps acted justifiably and stalwartly at the gunfight, and followed stalwartness with truthfulness at the hearing, will be challenged. The author provides a persuasive thesis that Wyatt Earp almost certainly lied under oath about not brandishing his pistol as he and his brothers and Holliday approached the cow-boys. He also posits that in Virgil Earp's testimony, he likely invented a pre-gunfight threat by Frank McLaury, a threat that suspiciously amounted to what Lubet calls a \\"preconfession.\\"This book holds its own as a full study of the event that made the mining camp of Tombstone legendary. The first 70 pages deal with background to the gunfight, with a potted history of the Earps and Tombstone. Material is presented in an unhackneyed fashion on cow-boy depredations, town politics, disputed elections, the actions of Governor Gosper, the ill-fated deal between Wyatt Earp and Ike Clanton, the gunfight itself, the Coroner's Inquest, and the hearing aftermath, including Wyatt Earp's famous \`vendetta ride.' Many in this contentious field will disagree with this or that Lubet conclusion, but no reader will fail to find them interesting. Despite its legal analyses, Lubet's prose is trenchant, and accessible to non-specialist readers. This book should be the standard study of the Spicer Hearing for some time to come."},{"Title":"Murder in Tombstone: The Forgotten Trial of Wyatt Earp (The Lamar Series in Western History)","review":"Almost everyone is familiar with the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral; it has been the subject of numerous movies and books. However, relatively few know about the inquest that was held after the shootout, charging the Earp brothers and Doc Holliday with murder. The complete transcripts of the inquest have been published and serious books on the gunfight, or on Wyatt Earp, delve into the inquest transcriptions. However, Steven Lubet's Murder in Tombstone is the first book to analyze the murder inquest in detail, from the perspective of a lawyer.Steven is a professor of law at Northwestern University in Chicago, and an expert. He analyzes the legal tactics, examining the questions of the prosecution and defense, explaining why they were asked and what the answers reveal beyond the mere words. We can also tell, from Lubet's masterful study, where the tactics may have gone wrong, eliciting information that hurt either the prosecution's or the defense's respective case.Murder in Tombstone is not a dry, dusty, legal tome. In fact, is a page-turner of the first order. I could not wait to finish this book. It is well-written and highly entertaining. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in Old West history or, particularly, in the history of Tombstone, Arizona and the colorful characters who made the town famous - the fighting Earp brothers, Doc Holliday, the Clantons, the McLaurys, and the infamous band of rustlers and outlaws known as the Cowboys."},{"Title":"Murder in Tombstone: The Forgotten Trial of Wyatt Earp (The Lamar Series in Western History)","review":"A very interesting and informative look into the intricacies of the legal proceedings after the Ok fight, with the first published ( that I know of) details of applicable law and methods of attorneys of that time and locale.I was especially impressed with the more in depth and factual information on all three of the McLaurys involved in the story and the authors opinions on their depth of involvement with the Cowboys (Thomas & Robert \\"Frank\\") and in the prosecution efforts of their brother William ( relatives of this reviewer) I too think it would make a great movie."},{"Title":"Murder in Tombstone: The Forgotten Trial of Wyatt Earp (The Lamar Series in Western History)","review":"Steve Lubet's latest venture into book-length writing is a masterful tribute to his very special rhetorical and imaginative abilities to produce a compelling work that is appealing to both lawyers and non-lawyers alike.

Corral shoot-out and presented the issues from both a prosecutorial and defense perspective. I was particularly impressed with his analysis of the trial judge's decision in the case and his explanation of the reasoniing supporting the judge's result.

(Jack) Cooley"},{"Title":"Murder in Tombstone: The Forgotten Trial of Wyatt Earp (The Lamar Series in Western History)","review":"I have amassed a great deal of material over the years specifically dealing with Tombstone during the Earp time there, and this is indeed the most detailed information I have seen on the trial of the Earps and Holliday to date.I learned a great deal, and was very interested in, among other things, Mr. Lubet's analysis of the defense strategy, not to mention the background information on Wells Spicer (I had no idea he had defended John D. Lee of Mormon Mountain Meadows Massacre notoriety).Steven Lubet's work has done a great deal to fill out a large gap in the legal proceedings following the OK Corral gunfight that has, until now, been mentioned briefly but largely glossed over. Earp enthusiasts and researchers owe him a debt of gratitude for his work. There have been a number of notable standout books dealing with the OK Corral period of Tombstone's history, and I believe this ranks with the best of them. I can say this as an Arizonan who has visited most of the sites dealt with in the literature and who has kept up on the various authors and literature produced since Walter Noble Burns first wrote his book on Tombstone in 1927, which really started all the interest in this part of the country, and in the OK Corral gunfight. In all of the work to date, while the preliminary trial of the Earps and Holliday is discussed, the trial strategy has heretofore not been discussed at any great length, and I find that this book adds a dimension that writers until now have overlooked. One of the things that is happily lacking is an obvious bias for or against the Earps which seems to color most work done on their lives and the events they were involved in; Mr. Lubet just lays out the facts and the statements made by the principles, analyzes the attorneys' effectiveness or lack thereof in the trial, and presents his unique opinion as a scholar to the reader, allowing the reader to view the trial through the eyes of a modern legal mind.If your interest is, as mine has been, in fleshing out the events surrounding the players and events in 1880s Tombstone, Arizona, this book will be an invaluable addition to your shelf of material, and I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Murder in Tombstone: The Forgotten Trial of Wyatt Earp (The Lamar Series in Western History)","review":"This is well written and a fascinating account of the trial of the Earps and Doc Holiday versus the prosecution led by the brother of the McLaury brothers that were killed in the famous gunfight along with Billy Clanton. Lubet, who is a professor of law at Northwestern U., writes a very articulate account of the history of the Earp-Holiday Clanton-McLaury feud that culminates in an interesting and revealing review of the trial. Readers familiar with Wyatt Earp and Tombstone will appreciate Lubet's brief biographies and economical account of the brewing battle that virtually takes place after a mere 50 pages. Those unfamiliar with the famous gunfight will appreciate the detail that Lubet gives the reader in those few pages. The bulk of the book is about the trial, characters and witnesses, the lawyers, the strength of the cross examinations and a review of Judge Spicer's ruling. The shootout does have a personal element as the Clantons and McLaurys, paryicularly Ike Clanton who personally threaten the Earps and Holiday. The prosecution's theme is that the Earps and Holiday planned the all out confrontation to eliminate their enemies. Of course, as the author points out, the Earp's' defense attorney, Thomas Fitch, is a superior trial lawyer and Lubet makes it clear by discussing Fitch's accomplishments in the trial that reflects his superior experience and knowledge of the law. The trial relives the gunfight that barely lasted a minute virtually in slow motion as Lubet leads you through the testimonies and the strategies of both sides. Interesting that Ike Clanton who ignited the event essentially asks for Wyatt's blessing to flee from the gunplay unarmed. Lubet covers it all in this relatively brief book such as the weak actions of Sheriff Behan, the erstwhile politician, that makes a weak attempt to disarm the cowboys and who apparently had an interconnected history with Wyatt. Wyatt stole his girl, Josephine Marcus, who eventually became Wyatt's second wife and Behan also reneged on a promise to make Wyatt his Deputy. Lubet provides a wealth of information including Judge Spicer's earlier history as the defense attorney of John Lee who became Brigham Young's famous scapegoat for the Mountain Meadows massacre of a wagon train. The author also demonstrates that there were two societies in Tombstone, much like in Billy the Kid's town in New Mexico, Democrats that leaned to the Cowboys and the Republicans who were primarily town folk and businessmen who supported the Earps. Although most know the outcome of the trial, the aftermath is just as fascinating as Virgil is severely wounded in an assassination attempt and Morgan is murdered. And Wyatt, once his brother Virgil is safe, does go on a revenge posse acting as a Deputy Marshall on dubious authority tracking down and killing three of the suspected killers. Later after Doc and Wyatt escape to Colorado and apparently away from the scene, Johnny Ringo is found shot to pieces. It is fascinating that after the Earps leave, as did so many of the interesting people, the town ironically dies shortly there after. And how fitting that Ike Clanton, who stirred the passions that emptied into that famous street fight, was killed in 1887 for getting caught doing what he did best, rustling. And Lubet has a great comment about Sheriff Behan, he led many posses in pursuit but no closer than a mile of who ever he was chasing. But let the author tell the story, he does such a good job of it."},{"Title":"Murder in Tombstone: The Forgotten Trial of Wyatt Earp (The Lamar Series in Western History)","review":"Steven Lubet has taken a thought provoking look at the fallout surrounding the October 26, 1881 shootout on the streets of Tombstone. He gives the background of the major players and a Wild West Frontier look at a growing mining camp during the early days of Tombstone.The buildup to the shootout has all the elements of conflict, partisan politics with opposing newspapers fanning the flames, a love triangle, which involves both suitors in a run for the office of sheriff of Cochise County, and a gang of bullies known as cowboys running roughshod over citizens and ranchers in the Tombstone area.Ike Clanton, one of the most provocative voices among the cowboys sets the stage for the shootout the night before with his threats and rants against the Earps and Holliday. The threats continued the following morning with other cowboys joining in the chorus. In an effort to disarm the cowboys and quell the disturbance, Chief of Police Virgil Earp deputized his brothers Wyatt and Morgan Earp along with Doc Holliday.When the confrontation becomes imminent Ike Clanton, the chief loud mouth, ran away and left the fighting to his younger brother, Billy Clanton and two associates Tom and Frank McLaury. At the end the shootout cowboys Billy Clanton, Tom McLaury and Frank McLaury were all dead. Virgil and Morgan Earp both received debilitating gunshot wounds, Doc Holliday suffered a bad bruise from a glancing bullet, and Wyatt Earp was not hit.Cowboy backers and lawyers immediately filed murder charges against the Earps and Holliday and hauled them into Judge Wells Spicer's court for a hearing.Prosecution and defense were represented by capable lawyers skilled in the law and articulate in the courtroom.Lawyers Tom Fitch and T.J. Drum represented the Earps and Holliday in the courtroom while District Attorney Lyttleton Price and lawyer Ben Goodrich presented the prosecutions case.More than a dozen witnesses took the stand during the 28-day hearing and Lubet uses all of them to point out strategies being employed by prosecution and defense attorneys. The questions and cross examinations, objections and rulings by Judge Spicer leads to good courtroom drama. And there is a good balance in presentations until Ike Clanton takes the stand and makes a string of wild allegations that could not possibly be proven.In the end Judge Spicer rules in favor of the Earps and Holliday. Spicer advises the prosecution team that they have every right to pursue a grand jury indictment. However, it was his opinion that there was mot enough evidence to sustain a conviction.The cowboys were not finished though, and pursued a vendetta using threats and intimidation against Judge Spicer and Mayor Clum. In the dead of night shotgun blasts hit and almost kill Virgil Earp. Unfortunately their next try succeeds, when they shoot Morgan Earp in the back.Unfortunately the corrupt political ring and their night guns took over the Tombstone streets and the myth grew as victim status was bestowed upon those poor defenseless cowboys's that were shot down at the OK Corral.Tom Barnes author of \`Doc Holliday's Road to Tombstone,' \`The Goring Collection,' \`The Hurricane Hunters and Lost in the Bermuda Triangle.'"},{"Title":"Murder in Tombstone: The Forgotten Trial of Wyatt Earp (The Lamar Series in Western History)","review":"I always appreciate looking as closely at historical events through a realistic eye. This book didn't fail to meet those expectations. Although I must admit that I raised an eyebrow occasionally at some of the author's assertions e.g. Virgil Earp's tenure as police chief was a disaster. I nonetheless could appreciate what the Earps had accomplished by ridding Tombstone of scum. Sometimes enough is just enough and I can't hold the Earps to blame for dealing with the \\"Cowboy menace\\".I am sure this is closer to the truth than many of the movies portray, however I am curious to read other books on the subject. One can certainly identify the various slants people of different backgrounds bring to the table. As mentioned in this story, there are numerous people who later go on to write accounts of the ordeal. That itself is rather amusing whereas they testified to not seeing the entire event or were proven incorrect by the \\"provables\\" on the stand.Much akin to the judge's predicament in this story, it is up to the reader to determine who is able to be trusted and what their various motivations and agenda's are. Considering that people cannot agree on balls and strikes when watching a ballgame it is very amusing and rather interesting to read what a witness' take on the ordeal was.I am a fan of the Earps' saga. This book only strengthened my beliefs that the Earps were justified and honorable men and that the Clantons et al were vile individuals."},{"Title":"Murder in Tombstone: The Forgotten Trial of Wyatt Earp (The Lamar Series in Western History)","review":"\\"Forgotten\\" in the title of this book appears like eye catching reader bait to me. I don't know of a Western Buff who isn't aware that the Earp Bros. and Doc Holliday appeared at a preliminary hearing to decide if they should be bound over for trial. Such a hearing can hardly be termed a trial, which this author surely knew, even though he is only an academic attorney. It was fully covered in \\"The OK Corral Inquest\\" by Al Turner years ago, based on the long lost (or stolen) original court transcripts uncovered by the researcher who provided them to Turner as the basis of his book. Without them this author wouldn't have a clue. The term Murder is also misleading in Lubet's title. The case was dismissed with a suggestion by the judge (actually a JP) that if the community didn't like it the Grand Jury then in session could take it up. They didn't.Moreover, this book has a dilletantish odor of distaste for anyone who would shoot a gun in such fashion as to improve the moral climate of a community, which was actually regarded as a virtue under the \\"Code of the West.\\" Either this academic author is unaware of the need to treat incidents and human nature in the text of the time, or was not conversant with what the very-different-from-today \\"mores\\" were then.If the sheriff hadn't had a grudge against the Earps, in the spirit of those times the community would have cast hero medals for the Earps and Doc Holliday.I wonder why the author and a publisher felt this book would contribute anything worthwhile - certainly the lace doily analysis of the courtroom tactics would have a tough time in competition with the label on a can of beans in my opinion.Read Al Turner's The OK Corral Inquest, and get it with the bark off and sans a lot of unnecessary academic quibbling. And by someone who was thoroughly conversant with the participants so that he didn't misspell their names, of have to look them up in the first place.A better acadmemically sound title would have been \\"A Scholarly Dissection of the Preliminary Hearing Regarding the Shooting on Lot 3, Block 17, in the Village of Tombsone, AT on the Afternoon of October 26, 1881.\\"Am I being droll?

Who knew there was an inquest? A hearing? That the Earp brothers and Doc Holliday faced the possibility of being tried for first degree murder? Lubet teaches trial advocacy at Northwestern University and after reading his book I'd like to sign up for his course. Lubet did his homework. He provides significant background on key participants, detailed analysis of courtroom strategy and a suggested alternative legal approach (for the prosecution). Well written, good read."},{"Title":"Murder in Tombstone: The Forgotten Trial of Wyatt Earp (The Lamar Series in Western History)","review":"An immediate problem with this book is its title, which invites the question: \\"Which murder in Tombstone?\\"The subject is the hearing in justice court after the so-called OK Corral gunfight to determine if there was cause to bind over the Earps and Doc Holliday to the Grand Jury for determination of whether they had actually committed murders under the cloak of their positions as lawmen. The unusual affair went on for almost a month, and the unusual justice who heard it concluded that there was no cause to bind over the killers. Obviously then, this was not technically murder (yet). And it never became so because, as a result of this hearing, the Grand Jury did not take up the case, and there was never a trial in a court of criminal jurisdiction, the only tribunal legally qualified to determine murder. The later killing of Brother Morgan Earp, of course, was murder by common sense standards, whether a petit jury so determined or not.The author, a legal authority and law professor, makes a fair hand at evaluating Justice Wells Spicer, Earp defense counsel, Tom Fitch, and the famous hearing. All were unique in their own way. However, the book's claim that this is an inquiry into a little known or remembered subject is pure grasping for sales hype. No events are better known in the Earp field, a field in itself one of the best known to Western history in general. Moreover, there is more illuminating coverage of this very event in a single prior publication. That is the full testimony of both the Coroner's Jury hearing and Justice Court Hearing, published based on lost documents recovered by researcher Glenn Boyer and annotated and published by his associate, Earp writer, Alford Turner. Considered in their entirety they are more educational for even a casual reader, than is this academic recitation. They are available from Creative Publications of College Station, Texas.For example, this new book needlessly goes to great lengths to establish the objectivity of Justice Wells Spicer, based on remote past activities of his, whereas it would have done better to simply reprint Boyer 's Preface to Turner's book, which was based on local hearings conducted by Spicer in Tombstone, within a year prior to this famous OK Corral hearing. Moreover, that preface drew in necessary corollary events in Tombstone to better explain the shooting and why it occurred.After plowing through this PHD thesis-type morass, based as most are on dredging for a new angle to an old subject, I inescapably concluded the author hadn't done his homework. There seems to be a pervasive belief among academic authors and presses that the time and effort required to produce a PHD thesis is sufficient to master any subject. In the Earp field, in which books with new slants have become a cottage industry, to match the old cottage industries of scented candles and macram&eacute;, this book doesn't even qualify as a shining example of dredging.The usual shortcoming, and this book does not escape it, and may be a crowning example of it, is that academic authors appear not to have read, or if they have obviously have not mastered, their own suggested further reading, a list that makes for impressive visual documentation, but not much more. Here is two pounds of research attempting to fill a ten pound sack. The academic author simply doesn't master his subject or perhaps see any need to, since credentials assure publication, and one must hurry on to superficially cover another segment of the waterfront.However, this author may have read so much of his suggested additional reading as Boyer's WYATT EARP'S TOMBSTONE VENDETTA, which would account for his title, since Boyer makes clear that the killings at the OK Corral (so-called) were premeditated by Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday and qualified as first degree murder. Boyer's source, one might add, was fireside chats in the Earps homes where he was practically a family member for decades. Under the Code of the West, these first-degree murders also qualified as a long overdue public service. When the Texas Rangers lined up a row of the types that the Earps killed in Tombstone, like a pile of cordwood (in Brownsville, TX, as I recall) the community figuratively rushed to present them with gold medals.All that prevented this in Tombstone was a crooked sheriff who'd had his girl stolen by Wyatt Earp. At least this didn't entirely escape this author. He soft-pedals that due to a perception that the girl's memoir, the principal evidence of a love triangle, has somehow been proven conclusively spurious. Those familiar with the subject will suspect this author has been biased by exclusive reference to only one side of a historical controversy simmering over the book I MARRIED WYATT EARP. (And the wrong one, at that.)I cannot escape the feeling that this author is a \\"dude\\" of the academic variety that once asked an old timer, \\"What was the Code of the West, anyhow?\\" and was told, \\"The Code of the West was that the holes were all in the front of the later unlamented such-and-sos and got there in broad daylight.\\" It is worthy of note, but this author overlooked the fact that this was how the Earps did all of their killings, from the front in broad daylight, while their enemies practiced exactly the opposite. One therefore wonders at the thinly veiled nose wrinkling over the Earps' activities? This precious hint of bias doesn't lend much to the credibility of this book.In sum, it appears to me that this writer \\"from an infinite agitation of wit has produced not very much matter\\" to quote Bacon.Save your money! Read Turner!"},{"Title":"Murder in Tombstone: The Forgotten Trial of Wyatt Earp (The Lamar Series in Western History)","review":"This part of the title is indeed a tip-off to the fact that the author gears his book toward those who did not know this fact. Although technically, this was a \\"hearing\\" or an \\"inquest\\" as Alford Turner's book, THE O.K. CORRAL INQUEST calls it. Although this book was well-written, it was obviously directed toward the neophyte where Tombstone and Wyatt Earp are concerned. In this regard it should be a good read for those who only have a passing interest in these areas. Dr. Lubet is also seemingly new on the scene of Tombstone and Wyatt Earp, but his book stands head-and-shoulders above other one-book authors in this arena. However, Dr. Lubet seems to lack knowledge of period weaponery and how they were used. Nor does he seem to understand the meaning of the \\"Code of the West\\" and how it was employed back then.With unfounded suppositions, which some may misconstrue as fact, Dr. Lubet unfortunately \\"muddies the waters\\" - a crime other authors have been rightfully or wrongfully accused of.

It's about how the crafty Earp attorney Tom Fitch seized upon a legal tactic still in its infancy: cross examination.

Fortunately, Lubet, with remarkable skill and insight, resurrects the trial, which was as important as the \\"Freemont Street Fiasco\\" (as biographer Gary Roberts termed the gunfight).Lubet, a law professor at Northwestern, is uniquely qualified to concisely and clearly define and explain what was a stake in the Spicer hearing, the factors that lead to the prosecutions' failure and the success of the defense, and the ramifications of just how crucial this hearing really was to Doc and the Earps.Stephen Lubet is not merely a lawyer professor. He is a law professor that has done studied the political situations at Tombstone, the life as it was in Tombstone, and the plethora of other factors involving the hearing that are too numerous to mention. These factors place the Spicer hearing in an accurate historical background that is fascinating.And yes, even the \\"lay-person\\" can understand Lubet's presentation!

But it is much more than that. Lubet returns us to the Wild West of the late 19th century and walks us through the preliminary trial for murder of the Earp brothers and Doc Holliday. Did they gun down the unarmed and surrendering Clantons and McLaurys, or were they drawn on first? The answer is still unknown. Law Professor Lubet analyzes a mountain of evidence from both sides. He introduces us to the various players: the lawmen, their adversaries, the witnesses, and perhaps most interesting, the attorneys for prosecution and defense and the presiding judge. Throughout, he informs us of the difference between 19th century American trials and their modern counterparts, and demonstrates how the clever attorney in any epoch uses the rules of law and the proclivities of the judge to the client's advantage, while the less clever winds up trapped. In this case, the Earps and Holliday were lucky both in the choice of their lawyer and the overreaching and incompetence of the prosecution.Lubet's book is both scholarly and entertaining. His prodigious research is evident, both in its quantity and in its application to his analysis of the conclusions of other historians of the event. His writing style is always felicitous.

You are put into a position of deciding for yourself who drew first. All the various eye witness testimonies are laid out for scrutiny. I enjoyed how the different personalities are dissected in the heat of the moment and how the participants might have been thinking. This was all pulled to a fever pitch with the final testimony that let Judge Spicer come to his unquestionable and final conclusion under the rules of debate and law.I would thoroughly recommend this book to those who have a desire for detail.

Since her best friend is a hedgehog-fancier one cannot help but imagine that this is supposed to be a comedic story. Perhaps it is the distance in time (the book was published posthumously in 1986), but rather than humorous the characters are repellent, the plot depressing, the racism irritating.

The book is set in the early 1970s in a provincial university town, not exactly classic Pym territory; however I was utterly enchanted to find myself unexpectedly in the landscape of my own childhood. Barbara Pym was an extraordinarily careful observer of human behaviour, and so much of this book rang true I nearly laughed out loud at several points. Yes, it is occasionally a little thin, but for an unfinished work it is still a great read, and the editorial work done after her death was obviously lovingly and skilfully done. It's a not the novel with which to to start exploring Barbara Pym's writing, but if you like her other books, you will definitely want to try this one."},{"Title":"An academic question","review":"A reader not familiar with the works of Barbara Pym might come away from reading An Academic Question less than enthused. Hence, it would behoove them to read her Booker Prize nominated Quartet in Autumn first and put this one last on the list. Written during her \\"silent\\" years when she was unable to get a publisher to represent her work, An Academic Question centers primarily on Caroline Grimstone, the wife of an academic who finds herself embroiled in the studious affairs of her husband, Alan, a climbing intellectual wannabe whose book smarts are all that he has going for him. He truly is a one dimensional character if ever there was one. Yet, having worked in academia myself, the caricature of Alan is not too off the mark and certainly not a literary failing of Pym's. She has his dullish and repressed mannerism pretty much down pat. Unfortunately, that's essentially it with him. Though as a character I found him less than interesting, it is Alan who gets the ball rolling by having his bored wife, Caroline, act as a thief on his behalf. In academia, it is vital to get published, to get a name established, for that can lead to tenure, research grants, name recognition and endowed chairs. Alan wants that, for even though he is an up-and-comer, he is still a junior professor with very limited credentials. The story begins to move forward when a former missionary with research papers of profound academic interest to Alan and a competing professor named Crispin Maynard, is moved into Normanhurst, a large, Edwardian detached house where retirees go to spend their twilight years. Ever the opportunist, Alan nudges his wife to \\"volunteer\\" at the home and perhaps help herself to his private papers in order to enhance his own writings, for his speciality is a form of sociological anthropology. However, his own writings need to be beefed up a bit. A loving wife to the end, she complies. And in the process of doing so, she enters a phase internal contemplation about how she wound up acting as a kind of university spy for her husband. The absurdity of her actions begin to hit home, and she ponders about her own intelligence and also being reduced to something mirroring a Barbara Cartland novel without the romance. Without a true support system to help her out, she is reduced to the eccentric people around her, mainly Dolly Arborfield, an \\"antiques\\" dealer with a bizarre penchant for, of all things, hedgehogs and Coco Jeffreys, a rather gossipy and effeminate male Caribbean expert who works in her husband's department. Together, they are her counsel. But she would do well without them. The latter thinks she should have an affair, apparently the most daring act that a quasi nonplussed academic can take in order to find themselves. Yet, that is not her speed. Ultimately, the missionary does die, and his papers get housed in the university library where academics can sift through the research treasures. And right on cue, Alan recommends that Caroline work part-time at the library, to \\"occupy\\" some of her free time, fill out index cards and label books. And while she's at it, help herself to some of the research papers. Again, she complies and succeeds. Her reward for her devotion? Well, a reader will just have to find that out for him or herself. For me, I thought it was repellent, and Barbara Pym, in a way, does ask for forgiveness. It is only though internal contemplation and the nutty characters that make Caroline see beyond the the monotony and dullness of her marriage and life in academia, for it changes into comforting consistency and a place of development, a constant academic test to study and conquer. Life. And in the end, Caroline Grimestone becomes an A+ student, precisely because she is able to navigate around the ridiculousness of life. While an Academic Question may not be the best of Pym's literary output, it definitely has her mark on it. And it was appropriate that she chose academia for the conveyance of this particular message. It is witty, subtle and very lightly imbued with an almost unnoticed dark edge."},{"Title":"An academic question","review":"I had never read any of Barbara Pym's books before, but had heard she was a good writer, so when I came across this in a library, I tried it out. Perhaps it was the 1970s time period, but I had trouble understanding the motivations of many of the characters. Caro, the narrator, is a \\"University wife\\" whose husband teaches something unspecified in the Anthropology dept. of a provincial university. Caro herself is bored with her life, but doesn't seem to have the gumption to do anything about it. She's interested in very little, including her own child (the couple employs a full-time Swedish nanny although Caro doesn't work), and seems to just drift along, not very well-treated by those around her. When her husband commits an unethical act to further his research paper, Caro hardly seems aware that it is wrong, and never says anything about it to him. Dramatic events are quickly leached of any momentum: an adulterous affair is briefly agonized over, and then never mentioned again; thefts go unnoticed; an ex-lover shows up briefly, then disappears. The most interesting characters, Caro's flamboyant friend Coco and his diva mother, merely provide background color, and never further the story. If Pym intended to create a portrait of a dull, modern life, she succeeded, but I can't say the book does anything for the reader. Although her writing style is fairly engaging, it doesn't make up for the characters' lack of initiative. If you want to feel as frustrated as they are, read this book."},{"Title":"Good night, Maman","review":"This book takes place in Germany in the 1940's. A family of Jews run from the German Soldiers. Ther mother, Maman, gets very ill and cannot procede, so Marc and Karin (her only 2 children) must continue running from the Germans alone.This book is very adventurous. They have a journey to conqure. I want someone to make a movie out of it because I thought it was such a great book.

Karin and her family were forced to leave their home in France because of anti-Jewish terror. The German army occupied Paris, and Jewish-owned businesses were relinquished to non-Jewish people. Jews were banned from public facilities and were arrested. Karin's father was one of those who were arrested and eventually murdered. At the age of 12, Karin and her older brother Marc went into hiding with their mother for safety. Eventually, Karin and Marc got the opportunity to board a ship bound for America, but since their mother was too ill to travel, they had to leave her behind. Marc began to act as Karin's guardian once they arrived at the military base in New York, and they began their life there. They made many new friends and attended shcool, and then they contacted their aunt in California. She sent them money since she was too ill to visit, and later she sent for them to come live with her. Throughout the story, Karin wrote letters to her mother, although she could not send them since her mother was still in hiding. At the end of the story, Karin learned that her mother had died shortly after she and Marc left, and so she had to come to grips with the loss of her mother. This is a very touching story about a yougn girl facing adolescence during a time of great tribulation, and we recommend it for students in 6th through 8th grade."},{"Title":"Good night, Maman","review":"Good night, maman is a definately worth reading.

And, they are even luckier when they manage to board ship for America, for a refugee center located in Oswego, New York.Along the way to Italy, though, Karin and Marc are helped by several people. What is fascinating about this book is that it lays to rest the idea that nobody helped Jews at the same time that it demonstrates just how ambivalent, or even venal, some people were in offering such aid.Once the two of them get to Oswego, they are incorporated into American daily life--school, friends, etc, with the exception that every night they must return to the base. It's a sort of limbo, and the residents of the camp are both grateful for their rescue and justifiably resentful of their treatment as semi-prisoners.The best part of the book is Karin. Norma Fox Mazer has created a wonderful adolescent character who speaks to us in the voice of a woman-child who has been through so much. At times, she has flashes of such clear understanding, and the next, she's as confused as one would expect her to be. The author is to be commended for writing such a complex character and for shining a light on a complex topic."},{"Title":"Good night, Maman","review":"This book it was of the best I've ever read.

It is about a girl named Karin, her brother marc, and their mother Maman. They were living with their grand-mere's house for a while then they found out that the Germans were in town so, Karin, Maman, and marc left towards the mountains in Germany. They stopped at a town and tried to sell their belongings for money, so they could buy food and beef pie.

Karin and marc still had to leave to go to America.Do they ever see Maman again?"},{"Title":"Good night, Maman","review":"Books are very important to me. I love to read them and unleash their knowledge. I especially like fiction books on olden times. From the Holocaust, the Civil War, and subjects like that. They teach me about life before me, and high and low points of history. One example of these books is one that I just finished reading entitled, Good Night Maman. The book is a Holocaust story, and I enjoyed it a lot. It was a great book, and I really enjoyed the time period story line and characters of this story.One reason that I really enjoyed the time period of this book is because I think the Holocaust is very interesting to learn about. It shows, and teaches me how awful those years were, and how brave the Jewish people were to have the will to survive those dark years. Secondly, in the book, I was taught things that I never knew happened in the Holocaust. Never was I aware that people escaped Europe on boats to come and be safe in American refugee camps. Finally, this book taught me to always respect your family. The main character in the book had her brother in life, and that was all, so she needed to learn to respect the only family that she had. This book taught me things teachers could never explain to me. My level of knowledge on this point in world history has expanded because of this book.In many of the Holocaust books that I read, the story line is always the same. Thw people go into hiding, get caught by the Nazis and go to a concentration camp. However, as I read on into the book, I was very pleased to know that the same old story line would not be used in this story. Instead, the brother and sister, Marc and Karin, are forced to leave France without their mother, and get on a boat and head to an American refugee camp. Now, when I realized that this was indeed going to happen, I couldn't believe it. I kept yearning to read more, and fine out where the strang plot would take me next. Furthermore, I think that this new and interesting story line is what made me not want to put the book down.I also enjoyed the two main characters in the book very much. 12-year-old Karin, and her older, 14-year-old brother Marc, are described in the book at very strong, and I admire that greatly. Those two had the courage to leave behind their sick mother in France and travel all alone across a big ocean to a place they had never seen and start a new life. I think that shows that the author wanted to relate her fictional characters to the real life victims of the Holocaust who were also strong and brave. Even when it seemed the two would never see their mother again, they stayed strong, learned English, and created a wonderful life for themselves. Throughout the book, I often grew jealous of these two characters. I wished myself to be just as strong and brave as they were. Even though I know they weren't real people, I still admired their courage.I enjoyed this book a lot, mostly because of the way the time period, characters, and story line all appealed to my liking. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading about the Holocaust. Also, the book has a nice flow, and is easy to follow. In other Holocaust books, many characters are introduced,and it gets confusing. That doesn't happen in this book thought so don't worry. The book really lets you know how hard it was for people who suffered in the Holocaust. In conclusion, it is a great book to which I give two thumbs up and would totally recommend it."},{"Title":"Good night, Maman","review":"The characters are easy to realate to. As you are reading you feel like you are really experiencing the events that happen. When you start reading it you can't set the book down.

The combination of reading this book and then watching HAVEN (or vice versa) is extremely powrful."},{"Title":"Good night, Maman","review":"This moving novel by award-winning children's novelist Norma Fox Mazer (who sadly passed away in 2009) tells the story of Karin Levi, a 12-year old girl whose comfortable life is overturned when the Nazis occupy Paris in 1940. Karin, together with her mother and older brother, flee Nazi-occupied Paris and start a new life of constant fear, as they are first hidden in the countryside, and later escape into American-occupied Southern Italy (without their mother, who by this point in the narrative is too ill to travel).The two children manage to secure passage on the Henry Gibbons, an actual ship filled with European refugees which came to the U.S. in 1944. Although the United States, like other countries around the world, largely turned its back on the desperate Jews of Europe, in 1944 FDR decided to permit transport of 1,000 refugees from Italy to the United States. Many but not all of those who sailed were Jews, as Roosevelt did not want the venture to be perceived as a \\"Jewish project.\\"The ship's occupants were sent to Fort Ontario in Oswego, New York, where they were put in a refugee camp surrounded by barbed wire. Mazer explains in an afterword that the 982 people on this ship, who came from 15 countries and ranged in age from an infant to an 80-year-old man, were the only group of refugees brought to America by the U.S. government during World War II. When the war ended, those \\"guests\\" were allowed by President Truman to stay in the United States.As one might expect, Karin's adjustment to life in the refugee camp is not easy. Karin, who believes her mother may still be in hiding in France, pours out her heart in letters to her dear maman that she is unable to mail, not knowing where her mother might be. Her older brother Marc \\"became Maman,\\" trying to provide routine and structure for his younger sister. But he doesn't want to talk about the past. He asks her \\"Why are you always thinking about things that are done with, Karin? It only makes you feel weak and unhappy.\\" Gradually Karin begins to make friends with other girls at the camp, as well as an older couple, Mr. and Mrs. Stein, who remind her of her grandparents. Soon a girl named Peggy from the other side of the fence befriends her as well, helping her to learn to sound American, and when Karin finally is allowed to start school, Peggy is in her class. Karin is even able to spend her first American Thanksgiving at Peggy's home. But will Karin ever be reunited with her beloved mother?This novel, published in 1999, would be an excellent book to read in conjunction with Is It Night or Day?, since both deal with young girls about the same age who leave Europe without their parents to begin life as refugees in America--one at the refugee camp in Oswego, the other with relatives in Chicago."},{"Title":"Good night, Maman","review":"I first read this book when I was in the 7th grade for a book report....I'm now 21 and have been trying to remember the title of this book for so long because I loved it!

Bored, I picked it up, and read the first couple of chapters. Instantly hooked, I had to go and buy it for myself - and four other books. (Don't send me into a book shop with money.)Whereas I didn't read Priceless as fast as I would have liked, I still enjoyed the story of a teenage 'street worker', who was pregnant at 17, and experienced everything else, from being raped, to becoming an escort, to running her own 'massage parlours', to going to jail.The jail segment appears near the end of the book, and is the worst part of the book. Everything else is good. Each chapter starts with a quote from someone in history, and is quite interesting. The chapters are relatively short, and to the point.I don't necessarily think I'd read Priceless again, but it's not as depressing as some books in the same category have been. It's an insight into a street worker's world, and you do get an insight. Not the best I've read though."},{"Title":"The Closest Of Strangers: A Doctor And His Patients Experience The Human Side Of Healing","review":"As a doctor-to-be, I have received many similar books espouting the human side of medicine.

A great book that would make a good gift for any physician or medical student."},{"Title":"The Closest Of Strangers: A Doctor And His Patients Experience The Human Side Of Healing","review":"While the subtitle of this book is, \\"A Doctor's Diary,\\" it's more - as the author describes it - \\"an anthology of true stories\\" with certain information changed to protect the confidentiality of his patients. Written over a span of twenty years of his medical career, Judge states that the stories he relates in this book are the cases that still haunt him, cases where he served as an eyewitness to \\"the action of grace\\" in the lives of his patients and in his own life.Describing the book as being comprised of \\"accounts of grace's ruthless incursion into the dark spaces in our lives, the places more often characterized by fear and isolation and pain and at least the thin shadow of death, the unavoidable places none of us want to travel,\\" Judge views each of his nine stories as being a \\"different rendering of God in action.\\"Honest and beautifully written, Judge's style is sometimes reminiscent of a professor entertaining a group of graduate students at a dinner party. This is meant as a compliment, as I doubt that few can tell a better story than a History or English professor \\"holding court.\\" But, unlike many of my esteemed faculty colleagues, Judge recounts his stories without pride being an overriding factor; instead, he frames each within Frederick Buechner's contention that \\"God, using our lives and the world and one another, conspires to make us all into Christs in one way or another, all into healers. Sometimes with our cooperation, often times without it.\\"There's a great deal of insight into patient-doctor psychology, discussions of the emotions and questions of \\"Why?\\" and \\"How?\\" and how to be a good doctor and risk experiencing the \\"pain by proxy\\" of being too close to a patient.Judge is a personable, caring doctor and his stories of watching \\"The Little Rascals\\" with a hyperactive pediatric cancer patient, dealing with a mother exhibiting a fundamentalist faith right out of a Flannery O'Connor story, to the haunting, grim experience of watching a hospital employee jump to his death and trying to help a young mother whose baby has died inside of her, among others - are truly thoughtful and memorable.Highly recommended for general readers as well as public, medical, nursing and social work library collections.R.

With a good fantasy and adventure story line he throughs in a computer programmer. This is a mix that should have been done a long time ago. Although the computer programs don't come into play much in this first novel as they do in the other it is a great building block for an excellant all around series"},{"Title":"WIZARD'S BANE","review":"In a world where magic is commonplace, what use is an expert-level computer programmer like Wiz Zamult? The only person who knew the answer was the great wizard Patrius, but bringing Wiz to this medieval world cost Patrius his life. Moria, a beautiful red-headed hitch witch, is tasked to be Wiz's caretaker. However, Moria dislikes Wiz as much as he is infatuated with her. Somehow, this helpless stranger is the key to stopping the federation of evil wizards called the Dark League.Wizard's Bane is not the kind of book I would've picked up on my own. However, as a fun challenge, it was chosen for me by someone whose literary opinion I've come to value highly. Plus it didn't hurt that the eBook version is free from Baen Books as part of their most awesome answer to online piracy -- eBook readers, check out the Baen Free Library. Despite not being my usual mug of ale, Wizard's Bane proved to be a lot of fun.Mr. Cook doesn't attempt to create a complex story. It's a somewhat satirical, but straightforward good guys versus evil guys story, which proved refreshing. Especially if, like me, you're reading a lot of the dark and gritty stuff that the likes of George R.R. Martin and Joe Abercrombie have made popular. In fact, Wizard's Bane is the kind of book that's ideal for one of those picture-perfect fall days -- or in my case, a very rare fall-like late summer day -- all golden with a clear sunny sky and a gentle breeze, which sets a romantic mind to dreaming of adventure.There's nothing about Mr. Cook's writing style that particularly stands out, but there's nothing to fault about it either. Its simplicity fits the story very well. There are, however, several missing and misspelled words that should have been caught by editing or may have stemmed from conversion to the eBook format.What is intriguing about Wizard's Bane is Cook's idea of snatching a regular guy from Earth and plunking him down in a fantastical world where magic is a driving force behind almost everything. In addition, Wiz is a straight-up geek with no athletic ability, and his social skills are a little weak. So, as lost as anyone from our modern world would be, it's even more so for a guy whose sole talent is working with computers.This isn't a completely original concept. Mark Twain's A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court immediately comes to mind; even Wiz notes the similarities of that classic with his predicament. However, there's a big difference. Twain's character, Hank Morgan -- at least as I recall -- was a fairly confident guy who quickly realized how to take advantage of his (then) modern knowledge. Wiz Zamult doesn't have that luxury. In fact, the reason Wiz is such a good computer programmer is because early on in his life, he chose to master computers as compensation for his many shortcomings. Just doing the minor day-to-day chores required in a primitive world proves a challenge for him. It's believed that Wiz is to be a hero in the struggle against the League, but he seems to be a useless and dangerous burden to Moria and others.I'm an IT professional myself. (Me, a professional? I know, my boss can't believe it either.) So this story was particularly fun for me. There's a lot of inside humor that mostly computer folks will get, especially UNIX admins or programmers, but it won't be distracting for non-technical people.Years ago, when I studied computer electronics, this occurred to me: Deep inside all that computer hardware, where millions of teeny-tiny electric pulses pass along the countless paths in conceptual patterns to ultimately do things undreamt of mere generations ago, technology has blurred the line between science and magic. I dismissed those oddball ponderings as the products of an overactive imagination fueled by a passion for fantasy fiction. Besides, I'd rather have been reading instead of going to night school anyway. Apparently Rick Cook had similar ponderings himself, except he crafted them into a light-hearted, witty tale that's a perfect book to spend a leisurely afternoon with."},{"Title":"WIZARD'S BANE","review":"i got this book based on a friends recommendation.lots of computer (esp. unix) in jokes and a fun read.the series got better and better.it's an easy read (i read most on two flights from SFO to ATL) so do not expect to work hard at it."},{"Title":"WIZARD'S BANE","review":"Ready to read the second book.

Fortunately, in this case that's not a problem, because I love the book. WIZARD'S BANE is a delightful read, just the sort of book that got me interested in reading science fiction and fantasy in the first place. The premise is ingenious: if magic is a computer program, then what's the language for the program? How do you master it without getting yourself killed? Even if you're nothing like the main character, Wiz, I guarantee you've known someone like him. Just read the first few pages, and you won't be able to stop until you reach the end. Fortunately -- there are sequels!This book would make a great movie. Or even better, an HBO series. It gets my highest recommendation."},{"Title":"WIZARD'S BANE","review":"Book arrived in perfect condition, well wrapped, and it got to me in record speed.

When he arrives, he has no magic capabilities whatsoever, which confuses the wizard who summoned him.One thing leads to another and he begins to learn the fundamental rules of magic and starts to correlate them with what he knows best. Computer programming. So he sets out to write a language for magic with which he can manipulate magic to help out the good wizards. When a woman he cares for gets kidnapped, Wiz decides to 'Hack the system'. It just gets good from there.If you can find it, it's pretty good."},{"Title":"The Protected Will Never Know","review":"Do not be puzzled by the title of this memoir: it is perfect. The author was a \\"grunt\\" during the late unpleasantness in Vietnam, one of the kids who actually did the fighting (and they were kids). They had few illusions about what they were doing and precious little knowledge of why. Yet they did what they were told to do for the most part, risked their lives, all too often lost their lives or were wounded, and received little or no thanks for it from a \\"grateful\\" nation, irony intended, to this day. The protected indeed did not know much about their valor, still do not know, and, we now know, were probably not even protected, nor needed protecting. It's an excellent time for that nation to look back on the event and ponder it.Mr. Meyer, prompted by a post-service GI Bill English class, compiled the material from a journal he had kept at the time and letters to folks back home and created a narrative of his experiences in Vietnam. Uncertain what to do with it, he set it aside for more than 20 years. He credits his daughter for motivating him to do something with it. He published it, and we should all be thankful.The book is a fresh and riveting account of what it was like to actually be on the front lines of that sad episode in our history, told by one who was there and in the style of one who was there at the time. This is not polished prose but it is highly readable. I actually hated to put it down when I had to. There is no plot. Instead, the events flow in the random, chaotic order of someone caught up in a perplexing war: periods of seemingly endless boredom interrupted abruptly by terror, mortal danger, agony and slaughter, and then to repeat it all again, over and over. That grunt, the front line soldier, had little knowledge of the historical context, the strategic situation, or the winds of politics and diplomacy. His world was right around him. His job was to do what he was told and survive, if he possibly could. That's the picture this book conveys.We follow him from his arrival in country, a green, just-out-of-bootcamp \\"cherry,\\" the rawest of raw recruits, to a battle-hardened bemedaled veteran soldier in less than a year. His progress is conveyed in wonderful detail, with the earthy, profane, frank cynicism characteristic of those who must inure themselves to the incomprehensible and unspeakable or go insane. We follow him on patrols with his platoon. We learn their tactics and procedures, we learn their weapons, we see their courage and that of the helicopter pilots who brought them supplies and provided fire support and evacuation when necessary. We share their endless problems, their clever adaptations, and their forms of relaxation and restoration. Nothing seems omitted. I found myself chuckling in sympathy as the all-too-common cynicism popped up time after time: \\"Will the real enemy please stand up?\\"The book reminds me of other unforgettable memoirs of young men on their own for the first time, of people caught up in events over which they have no control. For that reason alone it is worth buying. But since in this case the action happens in our own time and resonates today, you not only have a fine, entertaining reading experience in your hands: you have something that could change the way you think about current events."},{"Title":"The Protected Will Never Know","review":"If you were in the infantry in Vietnam, it will take you back. The book inspired me to write my own story, not for publishing but for my family and friends who over the years wanted to know. I was a 22 year old college graduate that was drafted with a lottery number of 15 and consequently was much more mature than the 18-19 year olds with which I served. I believe because of the maturity that a few more years provides at this age, I was better equipped to deal with the infantry experience than most. I'm glad I served, I believe I appreciate life more because of the combat experience. Meyer's book is told from the thoughts and context of an 18-19 year old infantryman. It won't win a Pulitzer, it is not a great book, but it is a good book to read, especially if you were there."},{"Title":"The Protected Will Never Know","review":"Engagingly written by Don Meyer (a combat veteran of the Vietnam War), The Protected Will Never Know is a revealing memoir of the horrors of a grueling war that oppressed not only one's physical life, but also one's spirit. The grim realities of life and death on the battlefield are not abridged in this compelling firsthand testimony showcases in a collection of personal stories based on Meyer's &quot;in country&quot; time from 1969 to 1970. The Protected Will Never Know is a welcome contribution to the increasing library of Vietnam War combat biographies, military autobiographies, and battlefield memoirs."},{"Title":"The Protected Will Never Know","review":"I really enjoyed the content of this book compared to other books I have read on the Vietnam War. I recently seperated from the military myself and was really interested in the aspect that the author took in telling of the everyday life of a military member in a combat zone. I could relate with the details of how things are different as far as protocal of the military lifestyle when you are in a combat zone and then returned back to the &quot;real world.&quot; I am used to the telling of the Vietnam War in a broad commercial way but this author really put a reality to the telling of his story as far as specific details of the feelings that I'm sure most people were feeling but were too proud or scared to let their true colors show. I would recommend this book to anyone who has been there or has served in the military."},{"Title":"The Protected Will Never Know","review":"I read with great interest &quot;The Protected Will Never Know&quot;. I too was in Vietnam around the same time and was awed at the realistic portrayal given by Mr. Meyer as to the conditions of war. Hollywood glamorizes the entire event, but Mr. Meyer puts it into its true perspective.He did not hold anything back and touched on many of the emotions; fear, jubilance and sadness; brought out during the Vietnam War. I had lost many of the memories until Mr. Meyer brought them back in his words: in crystal clear fashion. Thank you for telling the real story of what life was like on a daily basis."},{"Title":"As Ever: The Collected Correspondence of Allen Ginsberg and Neal Cassady","review":"This is a Christmas gift but Im sure she will love it,especially since it was on her Christmas list. :)"},{"Title":"Eating for Excellence Cookbook","review":"Those of you who have read Sheri Rose Shepherd's Fit For Excellence, will love this follow-up cookbook.

While I was taking a break I couldn't help from reading the book, it is so addictive!

While they both keep me involved, unlike other adult fantasies which usually are a long, hard, boring slog, (esp. The Sword of Shannara,) they could be slightly less graphic. At first I thought, &quot;Okay, girl, this is what you get for reading adult novels,&quot; (I'm only eleven,) but then I saw a few other readers complaining.

[...] He writes good and his books are exiting when they are meant to be, but I couldn't make myself read this book. It was almost a whole chapter just containing a woman (can't remember her name) torturing Richard (and it isn't just lashes of a whip!!!) at the same time as she loves him. That's just so [...] typical isn't it??People might say that i judge the book too early since I've just read five pages, but I don't think that Goodkind has changed his sex-and-young-boys fixed thinking.

This book is a complete waste of time and money. Even writing this review feels like that. WFR was not good, but SOT is really bad.

Those of you who think that Jordan's Wheel of Time is a masterpiece will like it though. But let me tell you: Wheel of Time is not a masterpiece - not even a good book."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Read this book, but then do yourself a favor and stopand save yourself from a hard fall.The ending, 'Confessor', most awful ending I ever read in my life!And worse, bad writing!!!And worse because many of his books in this series were so awesome.I really loved most of his books.But...I just read finished the last book last night.I got it from the library. I'm thanking God I didn't buy it.When I got it from the library, I noticed the spine was all broken and torn. I was intending to fix it...but now I realize it must have been because the last reader threw it against the wall.I was tempted to as well, but didn't.It was as monotonous and amateurish. Where the heck was his editor??I should have listened and not read the book and just made up my own ending.The one thing I think I hated the most was the way he ended it the whole boring slog.... It was COMPLETELY obnoxious.His theme in most of the books was to protesting religious zealotry. Those in the Order where following some misguided notion that they were killing in the name of the creator and lived under very communistic conditions.As I read Confessor the preaching and reminding got so irritating I ended up simply skipping pages and pages of 'reminders'.Through out the series there seemed to be an acknowledged basic natural(and good) desire to connect with the Creator and the spiritual connection in all of us. And that there was indeed an afterlife and he seemed to be pointing out that those killing in the name of the Creator are wrong.Also, Goodkind spends many chapters explaining the 'theology' of his fantasy world....how magic works and is connected with the underworld etc etc..But then he completely trashes it AND connects his fantasy world to our real world!!! The whole effect was disconcerting and took away from the 'fairy tale ending'...because you know in this ending the Creator is dead, or consigned to some corner and told not to bother anyone ever again.In the end Richard destroys the entire afterlife for those banished to the non magic world, where he conveniently alludes to those formally of the Order are now the 'building churches'!!! What?)Not mosques, not temples, not circles...but CHURCHES! (and not just any Churches, but CATHOLIC churches because they use medals and 'talismans'. What?)Excuse me? Is Terry Goodkind really this ignorant, or is he just another patsy for the secular order that is encroaching with the culture of death? I think both.Does anyone want a link to pictures of happy young jihadists brandishing the hands of Christians and other kaffirs they collected for allah???? Those of the Order where more like militant islam and the Saracens of history and militant communism and nazi's rolled up in one!! Knowing that as of this minute while I write this thousands of Christians are being executed for 'blasphemy' and oppressed with well documented sharia dhimmi laws in muslim countries or as in communist China's case, having children ripped from their wombs because they value life and would want to welcome a new child among them,...but it's against the godless of laws of china. Or what about the mass graves of Orthodox and catholic priests and nuns from Communist Russia and it's former satellites??What an insult to those really truly have and are suffering on behalf of the values of life and liberty.Ugh. I was completely irritated that I even read the series to begin with. I will not bother to watch the TV series.My advice is save yourself aggravation and money and skip this series.It's a garden path to nowhere even if slavish anti-catholicism and Nietzschism doesn't bother you, the ending is so horrifically badly written, disjointing and boring after so many really good books, you come out of it feeling like you were slapped...hard.M~"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Who is writing these reviews?

It is very hard for me to say whether the book is better than the first one. The books are excelent, yet they both seem to stand out on their own. If you liked the first book, you will love this one as well and after finishing it-You will be left breathless.Goodkind begins his story exactly where he left off in the first book. However, he manages to pull in a great new set of characters (some likeable and some not) that add spice to the story.

The adventures of Richard, Kahlan, and co. continue.The events that concluded the first book (not recounted here because they're plot spoilers) were supposed to bring peace to the world, right? Right--but peace is the last thing on anyone's mind as book two opens, a few minutes after the close of book one. (Nice touch, that.) Richard may have figured out how to use the Wizard's First Rule to his own advantage, but in doing so he violated the Wizard's Second Rule, about which there is much talk without anyone really saying what it is. (By the time anyone gets around to teaching it to Richard, you'll probably have figured it out on your own from the varying contexts; it's a reworded clich&eacute;.) By now, everyone but Richard is well aware that Richard has the gift. He is a wizard, albeit an untrained one. Richard's refusal to believe that he has the gift gets him into enough troubles, but now he's confronted with others who know he has the gift. Some of them are less than happy about it. And so a whole new set of problems opens up.Despite some of the more soap operalike aspects that are unavoidable in any multi-thousand-page fantasy epic, Goodkind keeps the string-the-reader-along stuff to a minimum, uses more subtle cliffhangers than he did in the last book, and once again keeps the reader's attention well in hand. The last three hundred pages of this book, for me, demanded to be read in one sitting. (As to a previous reviewer complaining about all the sex in this book, I wonder if s/he and I were reading the same novel. Perhaps we have different definitions of \\"sex.\\") The last few pages of this one have one truly contrived moment, but somehow Goodkind pulls it off without too much cheesiness.The best thing I can say about the book is that I was planning on leaving the series for a few days while I finished some other books. And yet, after I closed the back cover on this one, I was reading Blood of the Fold within ten minutes.

I think that the author is a genious."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I continue to look for a book to rival the writing and sophistication of Tolkein and Herbert, but this book doesn't cut it. Goodkind has many similarities to Jordan, both in story line and in the ability to run on for thousands of pages. The characters are good ones, but the book has a propensity to edge towards a romance novel. What really killed it for me, however, was how Goodkind built up several story threads and then proceeded to end the novel with an abrupt godlike intervention of magic that solves all the problems. It was simply too childlike -- make your moral decisions and then your subconscious will take care of the rest. It's as if the author and editor said &quot;Oops, we've hit a thousand pages... better wrap this up quick and focus on the next one.&quot; That's all fine and good, but why kill a book that has some good moments with a simplistic deus ex machina ending? The first book, with the dark edge of the Mord Sith challenge, was more interesting for anyone over 14."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"First of all I have to admit that this book gets dangerously close to the Wheel of Time Series by Robert Jordan. If you haven't read them, I highly recommend doing so before you read this series. Books 7 &amp; 8 are a little slow, but be patient it gets better. Story plots in Goodkinds books are in some ways the same, some of the character types show some similarities, and some of the objects closely match things in the Wheel of Time. The way the magic is expressed in this book makes you think of the One Power in Wheel of Time. In fact I think he even mentions &quot;weaving&quot; a spell.Even after that, I thought the character development in the book was very good. At times you can really sympathize with the characters. Goodkind is also good at making the reader picture the scenes or the actions that are currently happening. The books are remarkebly fast paced. Things begin to happen in the first chapter and every chapter has an event that keeps the book going. Alot of people complain about the sexually oriented scenes. Lets face it, if anyone knows any history times were like that and Goodkind is just portraying it in his writing. These are books for adults. Even though the book has alot of elements that aren't original, Goodkind takes those ideas and twists them for his own use. The first book to the series is much like this one. I highly recommend both."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I'll admit, I havn't read the entire series (just finished Blood of the Fold), but Stone of Tears is the best of the first three. I'll have to agree that it was extremely slow at the beginning, but the battles with the Imperial Order make up for that. Goodkind delivers a extremely well written story, that packs a punch. During the first few hundred pages, Goodkind is winding up, but the last twenty or so, the delivery is so great, that I got in trouble by my parents for not listening to them when they called. A very good foothold for a very promising series!"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I honestly think this sequel is an improvement over Wizard's First Rule. I didn't like the fact that there were basically two main characters in the first novel, with a few subordinate characters that served little purpose. This has been remedied in Stone of Tears, where Goodkind has done a fine job of developing a host of additional cast members. I've read other reader's complaints that many plot elements in this novel were borrowed from elsewhere, but taken alone I think the plot is excellent. Towards the end, the story got especially riveting, and I couldn't get enough sleep because of it. A few things, however: It wouldn't be advisable to read this without having read Wizard's First Rule, as Goodkind seems to assume you have. Secondly, it's definitely a novel for mature audiences only."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"The Goodkind,Sword of Truth novels, are the best books I've read.They kept me on my toes and Goodkind has a way of writing that the stories took me with it.This is a book that I would share with anyone with an imagination."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Goodkinds first foray into the fanatsy genre. I criticized it for having the story unfold too quickly. Now I realize there's more to the story that happens with later events.The story was well paced, but I started not wanting to set it down about half-way through. I won't bother decribing the story because the page for this book has that.The positivies: It was nice to see Goodkind decide on what kind of character he wanted Zedd to be. In the Wizard's First Rule, Zedd seemed confused as a character. He switched too capriciously between being a serious wizard and as comic relief. On top of that, all the character became more 3 dimensional in the Stone of Tears, whereas they seemed like card-board cutouts in the first one.The negatives: There are too many elements that mirror Jordan's Wheel of Time series. The Sisters of the Light (and the Dark) are too much like the Aes Sedai without the infuriating haughtiness that they possess. The seals being released on the keeper is much like the Dark One being released from Shayol Ghul. Richard being a child of prophecy is too much like Rand Al'Thor being Taveren. Obviously if you haven't read any of those books those references won't mean anything to you. The other negative is that as in the first book, he builds up these horrible situations in the book and through 600+ pages and then everything is resolved all nice and neat in 20 pages at the end. it sometimes smacks of Deus ex Machina for my tastes, but all in all it's a worthy fanatsy novel and fun to read."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Well I finshed reading the 2nd book and 3rd(which I'll review later) the 2nd book was not bad I really enjoyed it, I know some readers pointed out inthier reviews that they didn't like the so-called graphic sex scenes and could do with out them(especially one reader who only read 1/3 of the book). While there is one scene with the Sisters of Darkness and a Demon,where as part of being a member of the Sisters of Dark they had sex with the Demon the rest of the book was not bad. and the Romance between Rithard and Kahlan was tested to the limit they managed to see it threw.Richard is in my opinion a good character but a bit of a hipocrite who say one thing and does another. Example: he says he doesn't like to hurt people and kill them(which is fine)but turns around and says he is going to kill the sisters of light if they stand in his way of being free of them. I know from the first book he had a bad experiance with the Mord-Sith and the coller he had around his neck, but Kahlan only did it because she loved him and wanted to save his life. I just want to say I can't wait to read the rest of the series. I highly recommened this series."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It took right off where Wizards First Rule ended, and continued to capture my attention. Total action from beginning to end, like the rest of the series! I thought this one was the best (so far) in the series because you really get to know the characters better in this, the second book. Terry Goodkind has made me a fan of Fantasy when I thought I never would be. I highly recommend this book, and even though each book is written to stand alone, I suggest you start at the beginning of the story of Richard, Kahlan, Zedd and the others in Wizards First Rule."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"If you enjoyed the first book in this series then you will most certainly enjoy this one. In fact, I found it to be even better than the first one. The characters are all very well written and it flows along nicely. Plenty of action, yet Goodkind still finds the time to go into detail about his world and really make it come alive. The plot gets even more interesting and looks to continue that way into the next book. I have to say that I loved this book and have put it on my list of rereads in the future. If you haven't read the first book don't wait any longer, go get it. And while you're there pick up the second book as well. Very well done epic."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I recently finished &quot;Stone of Tears&quot; and while everyone is entitled to their own opinion, I disagree with those of you who completerly bashed this book! I think that &quot;Stone of Tears&quot; was and is one of the finest novels that I have read. This novel passes the first in content, action and suspense. I found the characters believable and interesting, I also found myself worrying about Richard and Kahlan when I wasn't reading. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and cannot wait to read the next one.

At first, I thought (as many do) that he rushed things at the end to wrap up the story before the page count got too large. However, after thinking about again I'm no longer so sure about that. Goodkind makes several references to avalanches - things build and build until finally one small flake is enough to trigger an event all out of proportion to the flake itself. If one views Stone of Tears in that light, then one might say that the story follows his avalanche model pretty well. And, like the avalanche, there is always unintended fallout (which makes the next book all the more anticipated). This is not unlike many crucial points in history. Overall - good stuff"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Although the plot was very well designed, and the characters very well fleshed out, something about the way goodkind writes seems to cast a pall over the whole book. Not a very enjoyable effect Although he hadn't been the cheeriest of authors in Wizard's First Rule, somehow he got worse. Still, if not easily downheartened by the general despair, it is a very good book to read. I finished it in one continuous span of reading, just watch out for how your feeling at the end!"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"This was a good book to read, but I get the feeling that some ofthe plots in the story have been taken from some other book. However,Goodkind does a decent job of making it new and interesting enough tomake the book readable. I also like the length, it seems hard tofind a really good AND long book these days. I hope the next book inthe series has some more creativity though."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I cannot tell you how disappointed I was with this book.T.

It's amarvelous sequel to Wizard's First Rule.Only trouble is I thought it all wound up too quickly andeasily in the last 30-odd pages. All the way through thisbook - and it's a fairly large book - the author winds atleast three seperate complex plots: the Kahlan one, the Zeddone and the Richard one. You know they are all going to cometogether in the end; it just happened a bit too fast for me.It's almost as if the author got fed up or ran out of timeor space or something and decided to just tie it all up withno explanations. To be honest, it left me feeling a bitcheated. There were two or three situations that were builtup to be almost insurmountable problems and in the end thesolutions turned out to be either &quot;I don't know how or why Idid that, but I just did it and it worked!&quot; or you were justtold it has been sorted out with little or no real detailsabout the solution.Having said all that, I'm really looking forward to thethird installment. I sincerely hope that the first fewchapters do a &quot;post mortem&quot; of the things that went on atthe end of this book to explain them out. Or if not I hopethat at least they'll become clear before the end.Can't wait!I haven't been this rivetted since I read all the Dune booksor Asimov's Foundation series - as soon as you finish oneyou just can't wait to get into the next one.Nigel Davies, South Wales, UK."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Thrilling sequel to &quot;The Wizard's First Rule.&quot; I can hardlywait for a third book to come out so that I can imersemyself in the lives of Richard and Kahlan.

OVERALL GRADE: C minus to C; WHEN READ: 2001 (reviewed early April 2012)."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I really love the book. It's just as good as the first one. It would be well written if it weren't riddled with spelling errors and missing words. Each Kindle \\"page\\" has at least 2 errors on it. Unbelievable! If anyone knows how to email the Kindle publisher I would be grateful."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"In general, I found this book to be entertaining. I've only read the first two books in this series and I would describe them as entertaining if not necessarily the best written.The real reason I wanted to write this review was to let Amazon know that the editing of the Kindle edition is horrible. Paragraphs are not indented (making dialogue difficult to follow in some instances), the word \\"than\\" is replaced by \\"that\\" (and vice versa) constantly, and there are loads upon loads of other small editorial mistakes. A few mistakes wouldn't be a big deal but they seemed endless. Amazon should really have this book re-edited."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Terry Goodkind provides characters and plots to make the mind wonder. I thought I enjoyed Wizard's First Rule, but literally couldn't put Stone of Tears down. I'm not the fastest reader, but I read that book in just over a day. Richard brings the best and worst of a character, but is such a real and true character, you can't help but follow him in the quests."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"If anything, better than Wizard's First Rule. A really good plot. Lots of good characters. It switches between subplots well and keeps you wanting more. As per the first book, quite a long book but it keeps you hooked. Very well written and easy to read. I really liked some of the characters. I'd recommend this. Again, lots of fresh ideas."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I'm not one to do reviews, but I had to give my two cents worth for Stone of Tears. I must say, I enjoyed Wizard's First Rule very much, as I'm a big fantasy novel fan. I found I couldn't put the first book down, so naturally I was excited to continue the series.Obviously (or I would think) you've read Wizard's First Rule if you're considering Stone of Tears, so I'm sure you enjoyed the MordSith (ha ha). Goodkind did a great job of making you feel the story \\"in your stomach\\" on that one, which in my opinion makes him an incredibly talented author. BUT I feel like he crossed the line on this one as far as I'd like to read. Some situations were just a little too \\"sick\\" if you ask me. I feel that an author does his best when he reaches that point where the reader's imagination takes over, but in Stone of Tears he pushes the envelope a little too far for my tastes. I found some of the text downright revolting at times, and eventually just had to put it down.I'll admit, I still give Goodkind credit for his writing skill, and we all have different opinions as this makes us different, but this was one book that stopped the adventure early on for me. I hope you found this review helpful."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Great story and I couldn't put the book down.

Its strange if you haven't read the first book but it does explane few things from the first book a bit. After reading the first book and finding out theres others after word I just could not stop. In this book Richard finds himself a lone a lot, and meets a strange new friend. That in it self is a lot. I don't like giving out answers. But if you read the first book about rules. You find that even though the book is fiction. Rules become much more. The rules reflects oneself in life. I cant clame that this book change my life. But it does make me be aware of things that I once took for granted. There nothing wrong in learning new things.

Stone of tears, almost stood up to those expectations, by creating a stronger bond between the reader and the characters. I felt as beeing in the story when I read it, and felt what the characters felt . Terry Goodkind manages to do the whole text into exciting reading, you fly through the text and the pages faster than you want to, not wanting the novel to end, you take your time at the end, and read the end ten times before you take another breath. Conclusion is that this was a sequel beyond my expectations."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"This book was great!

This book is not only a great sequel of the first, but after reading Stone of Tears I feel that it and Wizards First Rule go together perfectly. If you have read WFR, you must read this one because SOT complements it so much. I must admit that while I feel that SOT wasn't as good as the first, it is still great. The only complaints I have is that the ending did seem a bit too rushed. Sorry, but that is the only reason this book got a 4."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I've read alot of fantasy. Just wanted to state that before anything. I've read the first two books now in Goodkind's series, and I have to say that it's been ok. Stone of Tears was a good book, but, it wasnt warranted all this attention. The Similiarities between Jordan and Goodkind work is staggering, but, I am not a huge fan of Jordan, so, it never bothered me. There isnt any specific that I didnt dislike about this book, besides the obvious and over drawn mooning that Kahlan and Richard do. Also, I wasnt overly fond of the graphic rape scenes.. But, over all, this book was fine, it just didnt make me go &quot;Wow, what a great book.&quot;"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Well, I really did like this book.

I am happy to say that he gets back to some more original writing in later books."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I thought the book was okay, just not as good as the first and fourth in the series. I have read it three times and, I admit, I did find a few plot holes. There even were parts that were a bore to read, but overall, I think the book was excellent. I don't think it will be one of the great literary classics of all time(of course TG probably didn't write them for that reason!). Also, there are those who constantly compare his work to that of Robert Jordan, Tolkien, and a few others....I have one thing to say; I may not have read any of the authors mentioned, but enough allready! And I also saw someone compare TG to Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weis, of the Dragonlance Series. How can you?! They are by far, the best examples of authors of poor writing. I mean, their books were enjoyable, but had very juvenile concepts, and emotions."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I beleive that this book lived up to the original. And did a great job of it too. From the first chapter the action keeps your nose in the book. Now, about Jordan, dont get me wrong I loved the Wheel of Time, but I found his books to be very low on action. There was tons of drama and I loved that too but in the later books in the series, there was only that one battle for the climax. Goodkind thrills you with all the action a normal human being can handle but lacks in the description and drama categories. I still gave the book five stars because I read it again and found even more interesting ideas and lessons. Loved every word, as I did with Jordan."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"There is not much to say about a book like this.

I also found errors in Wizards First Rule!!"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"As much as I loved the Legend of the Seeker TV series (I mean it is what got me into the franchise), they diverted so much away from the books themselves. This book though has so much that happens during the course of it. I feel it has more action than the first one and we learn so much more back story that will make the firs books revelations seem trivial.The story is really one of those great classics. I actually found myself seeing parts of this book that Harry Potter might have taken inspiration from, which is a pretty big thing. The characters, setting, plot are all interwoven together wonderfully and you actually care about what happens. This is defiantly a book that earns its \\"New York Times Bestseller\\" recommendation.The pacing is amazing in this novel. I found myself just blasting through time wanting to know what happens next. Wither it was the action taking place, the suspense or even just the traveling; the book pulls you right in and doesn't let you go. Writing is top notch and I only noticed some minor printing errors in the book itself.Verdict:I say pick this novel up if you liked the first. It continues the great story and throws a bunch of curve balls at you along the way. If you are interested in this series at all, I highly recommend reading these books. Just from the first and second I am sucked into this saga and I can't wait to continue reading more about the adventures of Richard Cypher.Positive:* As violent as the first one* Learn a lot about the main characters in this novel* Story you care about* Amazing pacing even with almost a thousand pages* Great writingNegative:* Definitely not a kids book"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I originally bought right after reading wizards first rule since i had to know what happened, now I'm wishing i bougt a physical copy instead of kindle so i could skip ahead a bit easier.

The story line has split into three and each has gotten a bit long winded for my taste, repeating things over again to where I'm having to put it down more often than read.

I read a review criticizing the epilogue about the Sisters of the Dark at the end,saying it was out of sync with the chapters - it was an epilogue to lead you into the 3rd book, giving you a teaser that the tale was not yet finished. I have been a fan of Terry Brooks for many years and have read everything he has written. I longed for a good fantasy tale the let my mind soar into worlds I could never be part of - to help me lose myself from the normal \\"hum-drum daily life of working, paying bills, and taking care of everyone else's problems - and I found Terry Goodkind. Goodkind, like Brooks, takes you into a world of magic and fantasy. The character development is so complete, you begin to feel you have known Richard and Kahlan and Zeb your entire life.

The books are well written, and are entertaining. However, the swiping of ideas from Brooks and Jordan are pretty common. Any reasonable person has to admit the book lacked originality.

Stone of Tears is, in my humble opinion, is about the best way to continue the story. Your love for Richard and Kahlan will grow more and more through this book.

That was a good book on its own.He continues in good form with this second book in the series. Richard Cypher (excuse me, Richard RAHL - he found out that the villain of the first book was his real father) now has to learn how to master the abilities he discovered he had in \\"Wizard's First Rule\\", and towards that end agrees (extremely reluctantly) to be taught by the Sisters of the Light. But it seems that they have their own agenda, both for Richard and the world - and another group has their own agenda for the Sisters.Goodkind continues to entertain in grand style. This book is a well-done sequel, but it partially suffers from the so-called \\"sophomore jinx\\" - the ending of this tale contains several plot twists that can only be described as cop-outs. I won't say any more about what they are but it'll be obvious when you get to them.This is still a good book, however, and I'll keep on with the next book in the series."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Have you ever read a series where you can just tell that the author is making it up as he goes along? This is NOT one of those. The detail of the storyline is fantastic. The characters are full and the storyline is impeccably thought out. I love the nuances and the small curves in the storyline that oftentime become huge plot twists! These are weighty tomes at almost 1000 pages in paperback form, and I looked forward to every word.

The characters are very likeable and the story moves along at a good pace. With plenty of action and dialouge, this book lives up to the first of the series. The reason this was not a five star book, is the ending seemed rushed a little, wich doesnt matter that much because the journey is much more intriguing than the outcome. Also, I have heard alot of complaints about Goodkinds tendency to reflect on events already taken place in the previous books, and it starts in this book. I am almost done with the third book 'Blood of the Fold' and its continually becoming more frequent. This however is not a good enough reason to miss this series. If you love fantasy, than you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"If you liked Wizard's First Rule, you'll enjoy Stone of Tears as well. There is less action in this story than its predecessor, but Goodkind begins to fill in the gaps with more social commentary. Stone of Tears introduces loads of new characters as do the rest of the books in the Sword of Truth series. Much more thought provoking than First Rule."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"The first book in the series is one of my top 21 books. (21? I've never felt a need to cap the number of books I have really enjoyed.) Even so, I never jumped to read the sequel. How would the followup followup? Would more to the story just be more to the story? Would it pull down my experience of the first book?Well I finally picked up the second and started to read. My exact rating would be 3.75. A 'good' opening got me interested.Then 200 pages into the book I was straining to be drawn into the story. I kept being left with the feeling of 'get on with it'. And suddenly it did! The last 700+ pages were (are) worth reading.Overall, not as good as the first book, but a good maybe very good followup; but unlike the first book that was good enough to stand on its own, I feel this book needs the next book to be good enough to lift this volume up. Which I now have to go buy."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Okay, the dialoge between the charactures is not the best, and Richard does seem to have a way of getting out of every seemingly impossable situation (but then what kind of story would it be if he died in the first few chapters). But all in all, it is a very good book, the charactures are likable and the story line is very intertaining. I have allready orderd the third book and look forward to spending many late nights (and bleary eyed mornings) reading it!"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I disagree with the previous review in respect to it not being as good as the first. After reading the first I thought it was pretty good, but it felt to me like too much of a direct ripoff of the Wheel of Time. I wasn't sure I wanted to go on to the next book, but did. After the second, no doubt I'll keep reading, it was much better than the first. Felt more original, and more of the world was explained. In the first book new random stuff kept popping up and I just thought it was lazy writing, but in the second he's done better with the world building and the world and the characters are more interesting. Not to mention a more page turning story, at least for me. I am glad the next books look to be a little shorter, these huge bricks, also known as paperbacks, hurt my hands when trying to read them."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"After reading Wizard's First Rule, I found myself wondering more about Richard and Kahlan. The first book went far beyond my expectations, and I was enormously happy with the finished product. Stone of Tears, if anything, has surpassed the first novel in quality. This monster book, around 1000 pages, is full of all the things I have come to expect from Goodkind. Strong settings, wonderful characters, and an inventive plot keep the book moving at a blistering speed. Many people feel that most modern fantasy is derivative, and that is true to some extent. However, Goodkind has established a wonderful world, a unique slant on how magic works, and some of the best characters to ever grace the page.Stone of Tears takes off with breakneck speed and takes the reader to so many amazing locations that the book almost comes off like a George Lucas visual extravaganza. I would simply love to see some of the amazing pictures Goodkind has created in my mind on the silver screen. Yet, the book is so large and the plot so twisting and turning that it would lend itself adapted to a cable TV series better than a movie. There were times I would look up from my reading only to literally hear the sounds stop and the landscape change. I was in Goodkind's world and he worked his special brand of magic on me as I read. These books are not literary giants. Admittedly they would fall under the \\"pulp\\" category, but they are of such a wonderful quality that I feel almost guilty calling them \\"pulp.\\" They transcend it. They are so entertaining that many well read people might regard them as \\"guilty pleasures.\\" Stone of Tears is truly a pleasure to read. There are so many situations in the book that could be pointed out, but to take time to do so would make this review far longer than it should be. Suffice it to say that Stone of Tears is one of those rare novels that draw the reader in completely. From the dark beasts of the underworld to the war against the Imperial Order, this novel jolts out off the page with unstoppable energy. I honestly think I could have read it in one sitting if my own constitution had been up to the task.I recommend this novel with complete confidence. I am certain that most readers will want to plunge into the entire series as I am doing now. I am very glad that I did not find this series until it had been out for a while or there would have been a painful wait for each book. Goodkind is up to eight novels, one short story, and more books to come. I am certain that the coming months will find me reading way into the dark night following a hero that I understand and identify with: Richard, a man with amazing wisdom and goodness that finds himself forced to do things for the greater good. His character speaks to all of us. As we read, we discover something about ourselves and the fears we all have. In doing so, we discover more of our humanity. These works may be seen as \\"pulp\\" in origin, but they are a powerful read. Sometimes this novel is dark and brutal, sometimes it depicts things we rather wouldn't see, but sometimes it lifts us up into a wonderful place. A place filled with the one thing we all need...hope."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"The plot was good. My biggest problem is the constant misspellings. I am a good reader and read about one book per week. This book had a lot of \\"that\\" when they meant \\"than\\". Also there were a lot of mix ups between \\"they\\" and \\"then\\". As a good reader I substituted to keep the meaning, but a poor reader would get lost in the incorrect words. It looks like someone did a find and replace and replaced more words than they expected. Because of the constant wrong words I had to rate it a three. Maybe someone will fix it soon. Because the wrong words are actually words themselves, it won't word to do a spell check. It will take some proofreading."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"In this day and age, it is not really necessary to purchase e-books. I could for instance go to any number of websites and download them for free. But that is piracy, and I don't generally support that. Furthermore, the pirated versions generally have chunks missing and grammatical/formatting errors. I assumed that since I purchased an officially distributed e-book, I would not have these problems. I have previously purchased Wizard's First Rule, and did not notice any problems within that one. Stone of Tears however, is full of grammer/spelling errors, and I have only read a few chapters so far. This is poor quality even among what I have seen of pirated/scanned versionsThere is another issue I had that may not matter to most people. As with most books, the hard copies of the Sword of truth books start each chapter on a fresh page. There was also a sword of truth logo at the start of each chapter, and a smaller one for certain breaks in the story. I was happy to see that they kept this format in the e-book of Wizard's First Rule that I purchased from Amazon. They did not for Stone of Tears. I do not necessarily have a problem with the format itself, though it does cheapen it, but rather the fact that the formats between e-books of the same series is varied.Wizard's First Rule cost me $4.99 and I was very happy.Stone of Tears cost me $8.54 and I feel scammed."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Condition was as stated and it arrived very quickly. I appreciate that it stated book #2 because I was having a hard time keeping track and other posts did not specify which book # within the series. I now have almost the entire series, thanks to amazon!"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I have to admit, I read \\"Wizard's First Rule\\" and came away unimpressed. I saw a story beneath the poor up and down event roller coaster that could come to fruition if Goodkind had worked just a tad harder at it. I couldn't relate to the characters because of their bipolar like tendencies. I feared I had started a series I was going to fight day in and day out. I was wrong. By the end of the first book I found myself curiously interested in these characters and their next step on their adventure and \\"Stone of Tears\\" certainly delivers.Instead of finding this as more of a story about Richard I found it focused more on Kahlan. She does much more than Richard does over the course of the entire novel and we really get a taste of what it is to be a Mother Confessor who is in love and gets happiness snatched from her viciously. Richard does do his part, but it seems much less and much later in the story. Kahlan is the world changer for a while in this book and I think Goodkind fights this a bit too hard at the end where he drastically switches back to Richard. It's as if he realizes that the story has to be about Richard. It also seems a bit rushed (but after over 900 pages who can blame him?). Which is truly my only major complaint.Now that I'm used to his bipolar tendencies for characters I am seeing much more of the story and I absolutely love how small things become more and more important as time goes on. It's small changes in the past that effect the greatest things in the future and Goodkind jeopardizes on this idea greatly. Some of the predictions are still obvious, but some come right out of left field and I am thrilled with this change. I no longer felt like I knew what was going to happen.Another change in the book that I enjoyed was that it was a history lesson in disguise. We get a lot more information on what happened in the Old World and the New, why and how this world we are in works, etc. Couple this with quite a deal of action scenes and emotional times of hope and despair makes for a quick and easy read.I am also curious as to how he continues the series since the ending is so concrete. It makes me want to read the next and I am truly engrossed at this point. There is quite a deal of critique hidden between the lines. That of societies, power, corruption, understanding of words and thoughts, good and evil, differing views of life, balance. Much can be analyzed along with just having a decently good read in your lap."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"This is, unfortunately, a typical sophmore kind of effort from a new writer. Wizard's First Rule was clearly a labor of love that went through countless edits before it finally found its way into book stores. Thanks to its success, the sequel likely had very little editing, and was written in a much shorter period of time - and it shows.I am guessing that the writing process went something like this: The author drafted a roughly 200 page outline of the story, then went back to the beginning and started adding detail. A LOT of detail. The first 75 pages of his outline swelled to about 500 pages. Some of the detail needed adding, but there are also some 5-page-long speeches in there that could and should have been whittled down to a page at most. My guess is that his editor gave him a free hand, and maybe was looking to do a lot of the editing once the book was complete. This gives the first half of the book a plodding feel. Goodkind's determination to make all his villains as wicked as possible doesn't help the mood, either. Some of the extra detail in the book is used to detail graphically the gruesome aftermath of the sack of a city, and a dark ceremony with lovingly detailed bestiality - I see there's some concern on this site that that particular scene is not fit for teens. My opinion is that it's not fit for adults either. I wish there was a way to scrub that scene from my mind.Suddenly, at about page 500, there is a shift in the level of detail, and the author spills all the secrets that he has lovingly saved up to surprise us with in one big gush. You can almost feel the book deadline looming as his writing becomes sparse and frantic, with only occasional details, and little character development. The last 75 pages of the book are probably taken verbatim from his original outline, with no further editing or additions. The climax is ridiculously easy for our hero, who conveniently has the kind of magic that you don't actually need to learn how to use because it works instinctively. So, with the world hanging in the balance 50 pages from the end, and several insurmaoutable problems, he basically waves his hand and the problems all go away. It is a ridiculously simple and unsatisfying ending to a very dark and troubled book. The worst is the way he is reconciled to Kahlan by a coincidental prayer to the \\"good spirits\\" at the end, which conveniently also solves Adie's problem as well.The book, overall, is a disappointment, given the quality of Goodkind's first effort. It's clearly hampered by his newfound success, and subsequent deadline. Goodkind needed to take the time to expand the whole of his outline, and then edit it back down to a reasonable level of detail - instead, we get a book that is too verbose at the start and too terse at the finish, with no happy medium in between."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"First I have to admit that the book was captivating and I 'sacrificed' significant portions of my time to read it out of curiosity about what will happen next. The book was overall fun to read and that is why I gave it 3 stars and not 2.Now the bad parts.As mentioned by others the book could have been at least half in size without omitting anything important.Although the story (like all fantasy stories) is located in an environment resembling our 'middle ages' (dark ages) the characters posses a 'modern western psychology' and the whole story is entangled (I would even say almost obsessed) with very modern issues like sex crimes, child abuse, democracy, feminism, equality, secular vs religious and so on. I personally detest this incapacity or unwillingness of the author to detach himself from our everyday world when writing a fantasy book. I also detest his personal obsession with 'evil sex' which he insists to display all over his books. Most of the negative characters have to display some sexual deviation. The evil ones always rape women and children. The 'sisters of darkness' had to have some weird ritual involving sex with a statue that comes alive (for sex only). You got the idea.The same thing about misogyny. Every bad male character displays an unexplainable extreme misogyny. It seams that all the bad guys have to be also 'politically incorrect' in some way. This goes even for minor characters which I can't even remember their names. For example from the two unimportant mud men that were to protect Kahalan the one who betrayed her happened to be the same one that made the remark about her sexy breasts. Of coarse the opposite also has to be true. All the good character have to display some 'modern open mind issue' like pacifism or feminism. Also the motivation of the characters is often unconvincing. Too many times they happen to be 'good' or 'bad' for no convincing reason.His writing style also seems to be inconsistent with regard to details and passage of time. At times the story goes slowly and abounds in details like there is all the time in the world so if you skip a couple of pages you are still in the same scene/event and than just a few pages later the events develop so fast 'right to the point' that if you skip a paragraph you have missed the whole scene. Even worse, this is in inverse relation to the importance (the important parts are too condensed while the less important are too detailed ).I say this again, despite the critics I still enjoyed reading the book."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Do not doubt yourself and not purchase this book. This book is a great read and if you liked the first one (wizards first rule) then you will love this one. Like i have said in the other reviews, goodkind is great at building characters. You fall inlove with who you read about, or you hate them totally. I would recomend this series to any fantasy fan. I am on the sixth of the series and only one of those is not very good, but read this and you will like it."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"This is the continuation in the Sword of Truth, a Might Magic type story. This saga is definitely an adult subject due to the graphic discription of some of the scenes. I would not recommend it for a younger child.It is an excellent audio book. The reader, Jim Bond, does a wonderful job of changing his voice to mimic the different characters as he goes through the story, keeping the listener engaged in the saga.However, in the unabridged set that I recieved the disc marked 12 is actually a copy of the 10th disc. I was able to speak to the publisher's representative, who will be sending out a replacement to me."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"As the first, Terry Goodkind's penmanship flows well in the second. It was a great read as Richard and Kahlan find themselves mired in ever deepening political and personal \`adventures', the story develops numerous twists and turns. Unlike the first, the story does bog down on occasion as the author lays the ground work of history and develops new sub plots for the series. All in all I thoroughly enjoyed it. If you like the first, you'll get a fair bit of enjoyment out of the second."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Stone of Tears is the second in a series of books revolving around the epic battle of good versus evil. In this book, Terry touches many times on the point that the line between good and evil can, at times, be distorted by our views. With the addition of characters not in the first book, the author weaves a web of hope mixed with despair; love mixed with hatred; and truth with lies. You find yourself at constant odds on what to think about each character and verbally yelling at them to see the obvious or to stop being obtuse. All in all, it's a great read and I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Robert Jordan must be furious if he's read any of the Book of Truth series. It is astonishing how many similarities there are between Stone of Tears and Jordan's Wheel of Time series. Between the Aes Sedai and the Sisters of the Light. Between the Black Sedai and the Sisters of the Dark. Oh, I could go on, but why bother? Terry Goodkind's series just isn't worth the effort. Why? Because unlike Jordan, Goodkind has not told a real story. Instead of developing the plot, so that events that occur throughout the novel lead, inextricably, to the conclusion, Goodkind simply lays out events which finally and inexplicably run to the conclusion. Nor are the characters developed in the way that Jordan develops his, so that by the end of the second volume in the Wheel series, we understand who Rand, Mat, and the other characters are. Ultimately, Stone of Tears seemed amateurish and childish -- a not uncompelling story poorly told."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I enjoy reading fantasy for the pure reason of escaping the real world.

The issue I had with the first book, where the content (torture) didn't match the writing style (shallow/not complex), was mostly eliminated in Stone of Tears.

Goodkind created characters you really care about and you want to win through in Wizards First Rule, and carries on that tradition in this instalment. The story is well thought out and fast paced with barely a pause between adventures - this time Richard is kidnapped by a mysterious group of women who say his magic will kill him if he doesnt become their slave. The imagination of Terry Goodkind leaves you breathless and gasping for more. Stone of Tears has some of the creatures and characters you will find in other fantasy books, a dragon, wizards but several more never heard of before, yet has a unique way of combining magic and philosophy that is rare in teh fantasy genre. The story is overflowing with magic and adventure and creates a story with is a must for fantasy readers old and young alike.

I also liked the underlying messages littering his book about human nature, and his insights into the nature of death and life. One more thing, Mr. Goodkind had going for him is, when he switched characters, he always left the last character you read about in a suspenseful situation making you almost need to read the next chapter so you could see what happened. Mr. Goodkind, though he had many strengths, had one major weakness. I did not like that when he changed characters he sometimes dropped the pace, having completely changed situations, meaning the reader gets excited about one character or situation followed by almost instantaneous boredom at the dead drop in action. All in all I would strongly recommend this book for the writer's mastery of suspense."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I thought that I was the type of person who would never start reading fantasy novels, but after finishing Wizard's First Rule, I became hooked.

The book was satisfying. I am enjoying Zedd, Kahlan and Richard, and this book really developed them. The length of the book was a little problamatic, first because I felt like there was a lot lot lot of talking, and I felt the resolution was rushed. If there can be anything rushed in a 979 page book. Everything was resolved really quickly. I felt that Goodkind looked at the length of his book and thought, \\"Gosh! I have to hurry up!\\" That is what took the fifth star off my review.spoilersI also tire from plot frustration. Where characters just miss each other, or the one thing that would clear up the confusion of the plot is just out of reach. Why tell the reader that Zedd just misses a meet up with Kahlan? It just frustrates the reader. Chase only appearing just as Richard is going into the storm? I also was a little annoyed that Richard and Kahlan spent so much time with the Mud people at the beginning of the book. If they had immediately left for Aydandril at the first opportunity, the whole Sisters part would have been missed. Obviously that was integral to the plot, but if it was so important to close the veil, I think Richard and Kahlan would have left immediately.And why have all the drama about Richard putting on the collar again? Yes he hates it. But when K told him to put it on, she could have explained herself way better and put Richard's mind at ease. Just a couple of things like this where characters could have acted slightly differently (and in my opinion, more in character) and it would have solved a whole lot of problems.This was a fun book, with a few plot problems, but I really enjoyed it. Looking forward to book 3...but I think I'll wait a few months."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I'm less than halfway through the book, and already I want to choke the editor for leaving out commas, periods, and closing quotation marks all over the place. It is driving me insane!!"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I enjoyed &quot;Wizard's First Rule&quot; enough that I pretty much went straight into this sequel. And it was grand. For a while. The problem I felt with it was it breathed nothing new into the fantasy genre. I won't bother with the Jordan comparisons - they're there but then you can always compare the Aes Sedai to Dune's Bene Gesserit, etc. Originality is rare in fantasy. What really really really irritated me about this book was the ending. It drove me insane almost. The whole tone of the book is fairly bleak and dark and yet the ending...resolved in a few mere pages it is totally disjointed next to the rest of the book. In addition I can't feel anything for Richard or Kahlan. In fact they can be both more irritating than likable. Unlike Janny Wurts &quot;Wars of Light and Shadow&quot; characters, which have great depth to them, Goodkind's characters come across riddled with cliches too often...Yes the same can be said of many fantasy authors but the style of Goodkind's writing suggests he's trying to be deeper and more meaningful. That's why I can enjoy Feist - it's not deep but it's not *trying* to be.The style of writing by itself is grand and there are good moments in it. It gets 2 stars because of the none-involving characters, a plot which seems to jerk from point to point on ocassion and largely due to the terrible awful ending...I WOULD give Goodkind another go but not before I'm uptodate with better authors first."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Pros:--Richard--Seamless fantasy world building--Individual scenes of excellent proseAs a lover of fantasy, I appreciate Terry Goodkind's world building skills. He does a phenomenal job creating a world where magic is part of Nature's balance both in the world of the living (The Creator) and the dead (The Keeper). His prose, in varying stretches of the novel, leads me to forgetting that I'm reading as I become immersed in individual scenes.So why 2 stars?Con:--Overwritten scenes that become tired melodrama--Characters with conflicting behaviors and actions--Overkill of author's drama for anti-woman sentiment--Simplistic and overdose of rape (This book is NC17)The characters are far too inconsistent in their behaviors and actions, and storytelling is overdone. Let me say first that Richard is consistent in his personality and actions. He's the only one. The rest of the main characters, especially Kahlan succumb to the Wizard's First Rule, that people will believe in something out of fear or ignorance. One might argue that even the wise fall prey. That's potential good drama. Bad drama is when the characters you've been led to believe are wise, assertive, and make good decisions under great stress, \\"repeatedly\\" act like they have no sense in the world. Because I respect Kahlan's character and the others like Zed, I found the unusual behaviors contrived by the author just to magnify some \\"dramatic\\" moment. The result consistently fell flat and largely unimaginative.It's Goodkind's prerogative to create a world where misogyny breeds under the surface ready to explode. In Stone of Tears, readers are beaten over the head with it. Several rape scenes (implied to uncomfortably graphic) are used at pivotal moments in the story where a modestly skillful writer could have created horror and sympathy in less \\"in your face\\" detail. From villains spouting their views to getting into a woman's head while she is being raped did not help those story moments move forward, NOR did they serve any moral point of reflection that might have remotely support the content.When the story focused on Richard and his struggles, there was drama, character complexity, and, yes, moments of \\"ahas\\" for the reader as Richard grows into accepting himself (minus the melodramatic hint of a Romeo and Juliet suicide). The rest can be skipped over unless one has a voyeur desire for bad soap opera. If you read only Richard's story, you will have a great journey. Terry Goodkind understands his main character and Richard's story.Or perhaps, check out a book by David Gemmell, David Duncan, or Jennifer Roberson."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Terry Goodkind's first book, Wizard's First Rule, was entertaining many years ago when I was a relatively new fantasy reader. Except for the actual First Rule (\\"People are Stupid\\"), which was... stupid. The story had some fascinating characters (mostly the secondary ones -- I could never muster up much care for Kahlan) and Richard started out as a pretty good hero. The next couple of books of The Sword of Truth were also fun for a fantasy newbie.Then, Terry Goodkind just TOTALLY lost it. His writing style became incredibly annoying and Richard was getting WAY too preachy (constant Ayn Rand-ish humanistic ranting). But, I kept going because I was invested by this time. And each time I bought one of his $25 hardback books, I found myself rolling my eyes at every passive sentence and starting to fall asleep during the sermons (when did Richard hire a speech writer??).And the plot really got ssslllllloooowwww. Just look at the book covers for Chainfire, Phantom, and Confessor -- you can tell we're not going anywhere. (I hope they got a 3-for-1 deal on that cover art.) But the weirdest thing is that I kept buying these 1 star books! I can't explain my behavior, except to say that I kept thinking that things would get better, but they did not. How did he pull off that first booK?? I've learned from this experience that I can put down a book if it's not good. There's too much good literature to read.According to Mr Goodkind, those of us who have bailed out are ignorant and uneducated. Wow. That is something I have never been called before. I should have realized right from the start (\\"Wizard's First Rule: People are stupid\\") what kind of fellow Terry Goodkind is. Here is a quote from a chat session conducted with Mr Goodkind (this used to be on his website, but has now been removed. It is well-documented on the internet, however.):\\"Why would they continue to read books they claim are bad? Because they hate that my novels exists. Values arouse hatred in these people. Their goal is not to enjoy life, but to destroy that which is good -- much like a school child who does not wish to study for a test and instead beats up a classmate who does well. These people hate what is good because it is good. Their lives are limited to loathing and indifference. It isn't that they want to read a good book, what they want is to make sure that you do not. Ignore them.\\" ~Terry GoodkindI say Terry Goodkind is the one acting like a school child having a tantrum. I regret that he got so much of my money. I hope you won't give him any of yours. If you really want to try a Goodkind book, I would recommend that you go to the library and check out the first few, and then trust me that you don't need to read any further. I will not read the last book. I'm not even tempted."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I have enjoyed the story line and creativity of the author, BUT I am VERY disappointed in the lack of editing. This kindle book is filled with hundreds, HUNDREDS, of spelling/editing errors. The editors, if they exist, don't know the difference between that and than, or affect and effect. I DO NOT WANT TO PAY FOR ANOTHER BOOK THAT IS NOT EDITED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I like Goodkind, the next book after this is good and his first was top notch.This novel is about 500 pages of painful dreck, for example. Richard will go on for pages about how much he misses Kahlan and Kahlan will in turn do the same thing. I understand they are deeply in love but you don't need to beat that dead horse anymore, I got the first hundred times it was irritatingly mentioned.Secondly, the main problem of the novel is wrapped up in the last 50 pages."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Having read the Sword of Truth series several times I decided to give the audio-books a go. Wizards First Rule was fantastic and the narrator brought the characters to life with his voice. The imagery that he created kept me riveted to my ipod even though I knew what was going to happen next. At the end of the first book I eagerly looked forward to the second in the series, but was surprised to find that the publishers had decided to go with another narrator. Examining the rest of the series I saw that they kept switching narrators around as if they really don't care about a sense of continuity. Even though these audio-books are way overpriced I went ahead and purchased Stone of Tears. What a mistake! Jim Bond has a voice and diction that I can only compare to a 90's computer voice synthesizer. His style of narration is flat and boring with no flare whatsoever. Even though the story is great, I find myself dreading the next book and may just drop the whole series and go back to print. Its to bad that the publishers really don't care what the listening audience thinks about their books or they would \\"audition\\" the narrators before giving them the projects, not to mention keeping the same narrator for the entire series. Storytelling is an art-form and needs to be treated as such. The story itself is only one part of the experience."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Since I enjoyed Wizard's First Rule, I was fairly quick to pick up this sequel, and see if Goodkind could maintain his excellent story.In short, almost, but not quite.Several things are improved upon from Wizard's First Rule, most notably dialogue and character interaction. I've finally been introduced to some secondary characters that are interesting. Chandalen and Gratch immediately come to mind.The best way I can give a good idea of the plot without spoiling everything is to say that Richard and Kahlan are separated in this book, and most of the book follows one or the other at a time. Of the two, I preferred Kahlan's story, which mostly consisted of the beginning of a war with an Old World superpower called the Imperial Order. Richard's story, unfortunately, was bogged down with lousy characters, poor plot choices, and the most idiot organization I've ever had the misfortune to read about: The Sisters of the Light. Boring, stupid, arrogant Sisters of the Light!What's worse is that the author totally ripped off the idea of the Sisters of the Light from Robert Jordan. They're obviously clones of the Aes Sedai, right down to the detail of putting collars on people and having a secret organization of \\"dark\\" members who serve the Dark Lord hiding among them. Stone of Tears would have been much better off without the Sisters of the Light.That isn't the only problem here.Though we see several new landmarks in the world, such as the Towers of Perdition(sp?), they are not added to the map, which remains the same way it did in Wizard's First Rule.The book is still derivative, only this time more of the Wheel of Time than of Star Wars or Lord of the Rings.The violence and sexuality are more intense than Wizard's First Rule. Apparently, Goodkind didn't think he made the world brutal enough, and decided to crank it up a notch. Rape and violent deaths abound, often described in uncomfortable amounts of detail. This book is clearly not for anyone younger than sixteen or seventeen, at least.The new villain we are introduced to, the Keeper, is just as bad as Darken Rahl. He is evil for no other reason that he hates things that live and wants to snuff them out at any cost, and he is nothing beyond the sterotypical, devil-like Dark Lord who the hero has to stop with his magic sword. However, the plot against him is in the end less developed than the struggle against Darken Rahl, because Richard spends most of his time hanging out with the Sisters of the Light(and giving them the bad-talk they deserve), and only starts working against the Keeper towards the end of the book. Stone of Tears could have been a lot better if the war against the Keeper was more developed and remained the main point of the plot through the novel. Richard's quest in this book was rather boring, and amounted to little. He did a little training at the Palace, than off he went to hastily wrap up the plot.A high point was we got the POV of Zedd, which was quite interesting, especially when he subtly interacts with Kahlan's story arc and neither of them know it. Zedd travels with the sorceress Adie, gets infected with an anti-magic curse, and has other problems to boot. The best part in the story was his reaction to Kahlan's decision involving the Sisters of the Light and Richard at the beginning of the novel. I'd been horribly worried that he would be too easy on her for her mistakes. He wasn't.However, I have to say that Zedd's story would have been improved without the anti-magic curse. If he had, like Richard should have, focused more on stopping the Keeper, it could have added quite a bit to the novel.In conclusion, Stone of Tears was a good book that didn't quite match the previous quality of Wizard's First Rule, mostly because of poor plot choices on the part of the author.3.5 stars"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I am more excited to read the third book having just finished book two than I was to read book two. It was a great read, full of detail and many thoughtful little episodes that were sometimes quite touching. I guess that many of the characters will show up in future books and I look forward to meeting up with them again. Here are some of my random thoughts about the book:1. At first, I was a bit bothered by some of the graphic violence, killing, rape, hugely bad bad guys, terribly creepy leaders, etc. But now that I've read through it, it's a bit like graphic comic book violence or like the violence in \\"Kill Bill\\" or \\"Spiderman.\\" It's a necessary part of the background and while still a bit too much, it is satisfying when the good guys finally come through.2. I'm impressed with the massive background and detail in some of the sub-plots and how they all fit and come together. Many viable and interesting subcultures and people are described, all who are important and yet very different and in their own ways very likable (or not).3. Richard, the main man, is a strong and great character. A lot of time was spent forming him with all of his faults and weaknesses. There are so many traits that are great about him, gullible, loving, caring, has a bad temper, doesn't want any part of his gift, loves animals, falls into traps set by tearful women, doesn't want to wear fine clothing, is unimpressed with \\"your Creator\\" , etc. He is as good as any of these kinds of characters.4. There is a bit of a free and easy feeling about love and sex that, at first, seems a bit wrong, but as time goes by, seems to work well and flow well considering the setting and time. I laughed many times as the \\"Mud People\\" guilelessly complimented important women on their nice breasts or bottoms. It made me love the Mud People.5. I've enjoyed how the scenes in the climax are quick and succinct, not drawn out and over-done. So much work has gone into setting up the final scenes, and then \\"boom\\", they are come together and are very rewarding.6. I believe these books need to be read sequentially and don't work on their own.So, in conclusion, give this book a try. It's a great follow-up book to book one and contains a lot of rewarding and great story telling . At least one star better than book one for me. I'll be back to review book three in about a week. I'm looking forward to it."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I actually received this book before it said it was to be shipped online. :) it's exactly how a \\"very good\\" condition book should be; it's in great shape. the dust cover even has an additional plastic cover around it for protection! overall, very happy with this supplier!"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Without question the worst seller I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with. I purchased three books each from a different seller. The first was an older book but was obviously never read or opened. The second was a very new print. This one however was printed the same time as the first but there was a book mark in it, the spine was worn, the back of the book was bent and some of the page corners where folded or dented. Did I mention the moisture damage? So I asked for an actual new one. Turns it was the only book she had. I was told to send the book back in the packages that she sent the book in. Unfortunately the package she sent it in was a plastic bag from Fedex and no other packaging. It could not be resealed and I did not want her to blame me for any of the damage so I had to ship it back myself. I was only refunded my original purchase and was not refunded the return shipping nor has she responded to my last email."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Terry Goodkind is a fantastic writer.

This is a great and fun escape into the midlands. One thing I don't like about a lot of fantasy novels is they can be somewhat hard to read because the author is taking themselves too seriously or describing things so much you forget what is going on, you don't have to take ridiculous english classes to understand the writing in this series.

Stone of Tears is the second chapter and, as in the previous book, is well written.The only issue someone might have is that every minute detail, no matter how small, is included. Someone might find that a little tedious to read, and someone else might find it makes the story more enjoyable. I'm in the middle as sometimes the detail seems to take just too many pages, and yet, later in the story, in most cases, you find the information useful.Simply put, I am enjoying this series tremendously."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I have both a hard copy and the kindle version, and while the story itself is great, the editing is horrible in the kindle version.

Stone of Tears has non of those flaws. The plot flows nicely, there is some real good character development, the characters are no longer childish, and the book is just really interesting! Richard and Kahlan's struggle for love is intriguing, and once they're separated, each has their own fascinating plot.However, there's just one issue with this book- it's a compete copy of the wheel of time. Banelings are darkfriends, the blood of the fold are the children of the light, the sisters of the light are aes sedai, the sisters of the dark are black ajah, and the tare in the veil is the bore in the dark one's prison- it's completely ridiculous! The only reason I didn't give this book 1 star for being totally unoriginal is that the bottom line is that i enjoyed reading this book. If in order to make me enjoy reading his books Goodkind has to copy... well I won't appreciate him as much but I'll still like his book.One other small problem I had with this book was that there were some really disgusting and inappropriate scenes. For example the scene where a wizards power is passed on to one of the sisters...In the end, this book is definitely worth reading and i highly reccomend it ."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I was excited to begin reading after finishing the first book and was not let down.

I can only hope that Richard meets up with Nathan in a future book as Nathan's character has my interest sparked."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Stone of Tears does not equal up to Wizard's First Rule, I'm afraid. Terry Goodkind should have stuck with his first book and left it with his happy ending, then started a new book. However, if you are reading this review, you're probably going to read 'Stone' anyway. I won't spoil anything, but I will tell you that all the scenes from Wizard's First Rule that made you want to cry and vomit at the same time (especially scenes with Denna) are gone. Many of the feel-good scenes with Richard and Kahlan are gone as well. They are separated early in the book and not reunited at the end, so the ending is not necessarily a happy one, unlike its predecessor. Plus, characters you came to know and love like Chase and Rachael are gone by the 100th page. But that ends up being reasonable, because there are also newbies like Gratch the gar who you come to love just as much.Though I've pretty much slammed the book at this point, it is a good read. There is more magic and less swords than the last, so you can judge that individually by which you prefer. My only problem with 'Stone' is that it isn't as good as the first."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Well, just finished Stone of Tears, and overall found the book pretty good. I enjoyed the pace of the book, character development, and the storyline- I couldn't set this book down. That said, I do have a few complaints.I DID enjoy the character development. But, are you supposed to look forward to the parts of the book that don't involve the protagonist? I loved the development of Chandalin,Kahlan, Sister Verna-and Ive always liked Chase. THe jury's still out on Zedd for me.I also find myself slightly irritated at the way that Goodkind does conversation between the characters, and at the actions of characters. There is just a little too much hugging that goes on, and the verbal dialoge just seems to be a little- I don't know-forced?One last complaint, and maybe its because Im a little more used to the writing of George Martin, or Jordan. I felt that more description could have been used in general. You rarely get to see the world through the characters eyes except for an instant. I remember at one point, Richard is holding a dead assasin in his arms, and the only description that we get of her is that she was female. I also tend to forget exactly what the characters look like, because they are mentioned so infrequently. What color are Kahlan's eyes? I think green, but im not sure. Richards? No idea. Maybe I just dont have the reading comprehension that I like to think I have, but I would have liked it if descriptions and appearances were mentioned a bit more frequently.It was however, a great book. I enjoyed it greatly, and would recommend it to any Fantasy reader (already have, in fact) despite my complaints. Im looking forward to the 6 + more books in this series that I have yet to read."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I have read the first book and I have to say that this is the best series to come along yet! I am an avid reader of fantasy/ sci-fi and am very picky about my books. This series hit the spot. As Richard is taken away from his beloved Kahlan, you feel the pain that defines just how deep their love for each other goes. And it starts you on a journey that only surprises and pleases the need for unusual and imaginative plots and twists. There is also a good dose of humor. You find yourself supporting Richard in his vow to remain unkempt and surly towards his captor. The rest of the characters in this book only adds to the story that you know will appear in future books. The Sisters prove to be despicable and lovable at the same time. I only hope that Goodkind continues to write in this intriguing manner."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Like night and day.... I was horrified by _Wizard's First Rule_ with the vulgar and disturbing sequences and the undistinguishable dialogue (remember the gratuatious use of 'friend'). But having promised someone to read both WFR and _Stone of Tears_ I was forced to continue the saga. How glad I am that I did. I must change my previous statement about not being a fan of the sword of truth series, because this book has changed my mind._Stone of Tears_ was well planned and equally well executed. It was excellent from start to finish. Here we find ourselves with Richard and Kahlan, once again they are put into action and danger by something greater than they are. But this time they must go their separate ways if they ever want to see eachother again.Richard may very well die from the magic within, if he doesn't follow the Sisters of the Light to their palace and learn to control his gift. However, to accomplish this task, he must go alone without Kahlan. Richard will have to learn to use his gift while staying clear of the Sisters of the Dark, who want to destroy him and in doing so, set the Keeper of the Underworld loose on the living.While Richard walks his path of destiny, Kahlan must follow her own. Kahlan will have to continue to learn and expand her own limits of endurance, in order to save her beloved Midlands from destruction by the Imperial Order. A group of fanatics who claim all societies must join with them or else be slaughtered, all for the sake of ridding the world of all things magical. Which includes Kahlan as a Confessor.I was impressed with the use of prophecy in the book. So many things were set up within the first three chapters that by the time these events were carried out near the end of the book, I found myself constantly flipping back to the start just to clarify the prophecies. My only complaint was the akwardness of the events involving Zedd and Adie. The events at Adie's cottage were well written, however once those events were played out, Goodkind seems to just shove the two back into the story near the end. This would be fine except that their story of survival is so hacked that as a reader I found it difficult to piece back together the events that they had gone through. Their story just seemed so forced and contrived, where with Kahlan and Richard we are taken on the road with them through their adventures.Overall a very good story. And a fantastic three pages that have set up the premise of the next book _Blood of the Fold_. We have already met some of these people in SoT, and I am looking forward to finding out what they have in store for the next book in the series."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Classic Goodkind... just as good as Wizard's First Rule.

Just when everybody is getting all warm and gushy inside over the victories of the previous book, we come to find that the solution to the last book's problem has become the problem now in the second book of this series. While many would rather skip some of the rather graphic details, I find it rather refreshing for once to be told what is happening instead of the events being merely alluded to.Again, another highly detailed body of work that is extremely hard to put down, as was the previous opus.

Much more focused. The dialogue is a bit weak, and the characters are somewhat inconsistent. Also, some of the sexual refernces are a bit adolescent. Furthermore, why would a woman over 100 years old behave like a young, teen-aged girl? Addtionally, some of the obstacles that the protagonist must surmount are overcome rather easily.

Goodkind keeps you wondering just what might happen next as well as trying to find the small clues which you just know have to be there. This book had an excellent beginning and wonderful end. The inbetween could have been better... especially since he told months of Zed's story in just a few pages... that could have been a whole book in itself! My favorite part though, was Richard's reaction to Kahlan's &quot;death&quot;. Never before have I read such a vivid and amazing display of anger and magic.

From beginning to the end it was all action. The appearance of the screeling from the underworld starts the problems. While Richard's intentions were good, he mistakenly tears the veil to the underworld. The Keeper of the unerworld seeks to enter the world of the living. If that should happen, all is lost. Richard and Kahlan return to the mud people to get married, but the Sisters of the Light show up to take Richard to the old world to learn how to use his newly discovered gift. Kahlan, concerned for Richard, makes him go with the Sisters postponing their wedding. Richard goes on an adventure to seek a way to escape the Sisters of Light and Dark. Zedd finds Adie to help him decipher the prophecies. Kahlan helps to destroy the Imperial Army, when it backfires in her and she is to be executed.

I've read Wizard's First Rule as well, and feel that this book is of similar quality. It's fast-paced and will not bore, however it is not very sophisticated, and the romance aspect is still somewhat juvenile. I've also read the first of Jordan's books, The Eye of the World, and can certainly see some similarities, but then again, most high-fantasy books have similar themes. I think that the book is original enough to be entertaining and am not convinced that there is purposeful plaigerism.

Dick Hill, the reader of this book, does a wonderful job of narrating the book with the appropriate pace to match the activity in the book, and a variety of voices to differentiate between the characters.

I like this author/series for the exact reasons that the previous poster did not. Goodkind takes old cliches of the fantasy/sci-fi genre, and makes them BETTER. Somehow he improves on these authors' stories. While I did not like the way he plagiarized the Aes Sedai idea from Robert Jordan. The stories you mentioned are some of my favorite stories. I could like nothing more than I like Star Wars. (Star Trek sucks!) I have read only one of Eddings books, but I have heard he, like Jordan, gets very boring after a just a few books. I have read all of Jordan's books by the way. Goodkind's greatest asset is not his ability to create a universe in which you can completely immerse yourself (like George Lucas' Star Wars), but his ability to draw the reader into the story from page one, and keep the book moving along at an unbelievably fast pace. Jordan and Eddings can only wish they had the same talent. Goodkind is the best author for an intelligentperson that is looking for a good series to start his foray into the fantasy genre. Once you have read other authors, Goodkind's greatness is not quite so apparent, but nevertheless, it is still there.I liked Wizard's First Rule much better,and I even liked The Blood of the Fold a little better. (the ending was better)SincerelyAlberticusTry not.Do;Or do not.There is no try.-Jedi Master Yoda"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Soul of Tears - Terry Goodkind (Review)Wow. I remember, after I had started getting into Wheel of Time (by Robert Jordan), but before I had started the Sword of Truth novels, I thought that the Sword of Truth series was a WoT ripoff. I read the first book in the SoT series (Wizard's First Rule), and my opinon was significantly changed. I thought it was a great book, with inventive and original concepts and ideas. I found it strange, though, that all the plot developments and problems were wrapped up by the end of the book. What more could the series be about? Well, from just reading Stone of Tears, the second book, I know that there is much to advance on in the SoT series. Here is a summary of what the series is about:It's about two characters, Richard Cypher and Kahlan Amnell, and their emotional struggles and hardships to be together. That's all. But that, in itself, is alot.So, in that aspect, in might fit in the \\"romance\\" genre, since their love for each other is incredibly strong, and unbelievably realistic. One, when reading any of the books in the series (save the first one, perhaps. The two's love doesn't develop till the end of that book!) must frequently remind themselves that it is simply a book, and that Richard and Kahlan are not real.I shall delve further on what the SoT series is like. It's fast-paced and more provocative and shameless than most other fantasy series/books. Indeed, that is true. There is sexuality in the series that borders on eroticism, although there, (as far as I've read, at least, which is only up to this book!) is no actual sexual content, something that, annoyingly and stereotypically, is anonamously forbidden in the fantasy genre. The emotions of the characters are frighteningly realistic, and, because of that, the books are unusually intense.Aside from the fact that the characters most certainly do not die \\"unexpectedly and brutally\\", the commentary describes SoT novels perfectly.So what can I say about this book? I was reading it constantly, it was so good, and nearly had me excluding all other activities save those I cannot skip. When I say that this series is excellent, I'm not exaggerating. Some prefer Robert Jordan over Goodkind, because they find that Goodking isn't very experienced as an author, and this is mildly true, but Terry actually writes with a somewhat casual style that some may be more comfortable with.Hands-down, this is the most intense fantasy I've ever read. (And I've read alot, Forgotten Realms, Dragonlance, Goodkind, Raymond E. Feist, David Eddings, etc.) Alot of people like the SoT series more than WoT, and, although I can't really decide myself, I finalize my review by stating that Terry Goodkind is just as good as a writer as Robert Jordan is, if not better. Despite being a somewhat inexperienced writer (at least when he first started out the series), and having \\"Mary Sue\\"-ish kind of characters, Terry Goodkind proves in Stone of Tears that, without a doubt, he is one of the best fantasy writers around today."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Everyone knows the Wizards First Rule. This is MY first rule: Mr. Goodkind couldn't write a graceful, believable line of dialogue to save his soul from Darken Rahl. This is my second rule: Mr. Goodkind's editor is either so incompetent that he/she should be hung from the highest rafter of the Palace of the Prophet OR he/she has been collared and tortured to the extent he/she can no longer performed his/her duties.

However, I was promised the second book was much better. I was lied to. The subpoena's are currently being served.All bad jokes aside, The story was a bit better. There were moments of the book I really enjoyed. Yet there were also points in the story that made me feel like putting my head in an oven. The main character's slow transformation into a giant baby kicks into high gear in this book. His feigned respect for other people's feelings and beliefs that he had in the first book is thrown right out the window in the sequel. Richard spends most of the book threatening to kill innocent people while claiming he was in the right. The ending of the book seemed improvised and rushed to say the least. There were several segments of the plot that weren't expanded on nor explained. Terry Goodkind seemed set on keeping the book under the 1000 page mark.Please. Don't read this book without having first put a dunce cap over your head."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I was wondering if Goodkind could pull off in a 2nd novel what he had started with his terrific 1st effort in 'Wizard's First Rule' but I must admit, he did a mighty fine job with 'Stone of Tears'. Personally, I felt it was about 95% as good as book #1, but that is still high praise indeed since WFR is easily one of my all-time favorite Fantasy novels.'Stone' picks up immediately where WFR left off...Richard has defeated the horrific Darken Rahl -- who turns out to be none other than Richard's own Father -- and has found a way aroundthe magic of the Mother Confessor, Kahlan...all is well in the Land...right? Not for a second. Within moments of the opening page something has escaped from the Underworld, which is supposedly impossible -- but nevertheless, it happens, almost killing Zedd. Uh oh. Meanwhile Richard &amp; Kahlan are reunited with the Mud People preparing for their wedding when three unwelcome women show up and spoil the party. They claim to be Sisters of the Light, come to save Richard from himself and to teach him how to govern his Gift. At first I thought this seemed rather hokey, but Goodkind manages to make it absolutely riviting. Without spoiling the plot too much, Richard reluctantly agrees to travel to the Old World in order to learn more of this Gift he was born with, all the while acting as if he is a prisoner. It is a long trek to the Palace of the Prophets in the Old World, and we get to know a lot more about Richard and Verna, the last of the three Sisters of the Light that came to find Richard. Goodkind gives us the impression that this is indeed a very long journey, but he also fills the quest with adventure and danger every step of the way.After arriving at the Palace of the Prophets, Richard is stunned to realize that it is expected to take many YEARS in order to learn all that the Sisters of the Light expect to teach him, maybe even HUNDREDS of years. A spell has been cast over the Palace which slows time for those within, allowing them the time to study and learn all that it will take in order to become a Wizard. This of course is unacceptable to Richard, who views life without Kahlan to be no life at all. In addition to all this Kahlan is experiencing an adventure of her own. In the Palace is also the place where we first learn of Emperor Jagang and his ability to invade the dreams of his servants turning even a few of the Sisters of the Light into Sisters of the Dark (not unlike the Dark Side of the Force). There are those within the palace who desperately wish for Richard to fail, at the same time there are a few who are slowly discovering that Richard just might be someone of incredible importance to the history of the world. Goodkind has crafted what I consider one of the bestFantasy tales ever told with his first two books, and althoughbook #3 is slightly less entertaining, the series overall is MUCH stronger than most available today, and better than most available at ANY time. In short, 'Stone of Tears' is a tremendous addition to an already Fantastic Fantasy series. Buy it. Read it. Enjoy it. Repeat."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I have written a review for WFR and after reading some more I have decided to annoy every single person who has read Robert Jordan.Terry GOodkind writes much more egrossing stories that display much more emotional characteristics than Robert Jordan's. The relationship between Rand and Egwene really isn't that engrossing. I think that Rnad should go with the Woman In White instead just to make it interesting!Also, about comparisons. I have read some Robert Jordan. They were good, but not really my style. The love-stuff is completely unrealistic and some people fall in love with Rand realy uncharacteristically. True, Aes Sedai, Clack Ajah, Whitecloaks, I could go on forever. but the thing is, the core of imagination stems from reality and what you know. The truth is, if things weren't already there, people wouldn't be expanding on that idea and making it bigger. Take birds for example, they fly. Chances are a human being probably wouldn't imagine flying if there weren't beings that already could fly. The imagination is an expansion of knowledge, not something picked up out of nowhere. Also, Terry Goodkind's books are like Marmite, you love them or you hate them. You don't really get that many in betweens though there are some. I think this is because you either agree with his morals and are fanatically involved with them (like me: I try them out after I find out another e.g.Wizards First Rule. A friend claimed she was feeling carsick. I gave her a 'tablet for carsickness'. Immediately she felt better. the tablet only works after two hours) or you totally disagree with them and try to find out every single flaw with them.Don't read any reviews that tell you not to read a book.

I could care less if he borrowed from every other author in the genre. He simply does a better job than most any other author. He tells a great story, the ultimate escape, that when finished you realize it has more depth than Jordan, or Tolkien, or Williams. Actually I detest Jordan. He's horrible. Anybody ever read Snow Crash where in Neil stephenson writes about books such as the bible that act like written drugs that make people believe and follow what ever lurks beneath the pages. That is what Jordan has done to readers, which I know could be considered a form of genius, but I consider a form of mind control. Yuck, I'm glad I tore myself away from that series before I was possessed by that kind of evil. Anyway, The Sword of Truth is an example of prodigious storytelling that all other authors should study. Intellectuals, wouldn't this novel of been already a classic if somebody like Gene Wolfe, Shakespeare, or Dickens had written it with their incredible use of the language.

Goodkind writes as an author should write, to keep people turning pages for the story, for &quot;what's going to happen next?&quot;, rather than to labour through yet anouther 900+ page book. With dazzling (if graphic) descriptions, Goodkind has a masterful command of the language, which he uses to full effect in this and his other books.

First it is a bit darker than most standard fantasy, and the world is interesting. There are only two things bad I can say about this book. First the kingdoms of the book just seem sort of small, and closed off from the HUGE world around them. You never hear about the whoevers of the north or anything, even in passing. The second is the main characters insanity. It reminded me of Miracle Max's line from &quot;The Princess Bride.&quot; &quot;He is not dead, just mostly dead, which means slightly alive.&quot; Paraphrased using the book would be &quot;He is not insane, just mostly sane, which means slighly insane.&quot; But putting that aside I did REALLY like the book."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"This is a book that wants to be great, but the author just wont it let it get there. Now, before anyone rips my head off, I do have reasons.Good:1) The characters are compelling. I enjoy all of them, and they're a lot of fun to keep up with.2) While the story line has a lot of predictability, I'm still not bored by it. It keeps things fun.3) It's a long series. I always hate when it ends too short or I don't have more to read. There is a lot of content.Bad:1) Editing. Lots of misspelling, incorrect word usage (than vs that, etc), incorrect paragraph spacing, incorrect dialogue spacing, the list goes on. Some of this is from being digitized to kindle, but that's even more of a reason to CONTINUE EDITING for a polished product. It's not like they have to print new copies, just update what we already have.2) Repetitive. The dialogue repeats itself incessantly and I simply can't stand it. How many times does a character need to say the same thing WITHIN the same conversation? It's terrible. (I find myself having to skim, and I don't like doing that).3) Sense of scale. Sometimes I can't believe how out of scale things seem to be. Palaces that fit within staircases? Things that simply can't be done, and have promised to change and then do so in an instant? Personality changes that flip flop within moments of talking? The progression simply isn't good.This series, from what I have read so far, has potential greatness. If it was re-written to change some of these problems, I would rank it among some of the finest stories I have had the fortune to enjoy. I really hope that these problems to not persist through the rest of the series, but I have a sneaking suspicion that they do. If you can manage to get past these problems, which I try to on every page, it is still an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"excluding the length (far too long - especially the first 300 pages) everything was just okay. the writing was good but not inspired or inspiring. the characters moved forward but didn't seem to develop much beyond book one (excluding new gifts). there was a story but it was buried so deep inside the 900 plus pages that at times it became hazy.Basically: if you have read Book 1 in the series then there is no harm in reading this as it will get you to the rest of the series. if you are new to Mr. Goodkind then you should read Book 1 in the series first, that way you will know that he is a talented and creative writer and therefore br better able to trudge (and at times i did feel like my mind was wading through a vast feild of mud) through this book.personal feelings: had this been the first book in the series i would not read on, but having read wizard's first rule, having experienced Mr. Goodkind's writing and creative talent, i will move on and read book 3."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Wonderful story, terrible presentation in the e-version.

After finishing the first book of the Sword of Truth series, I figured I might as well give the next one a try. In short, I kind of wish I hadn't.First off, this book is long. It's almost one thousand pages long, and it feels it. I have no problem with long books, but this one felt unnecessarily long to me. Goodkind is terribly redundant (I wish I had the book with me so I could write a few examples) and it really detracts from the writing. Also, his style has gotten even clunkier in this book than it was in Wizard's First Rule. I would think the writing would be better, but to me, the first book was the smoothest.Another thing that detracted from the story was how Goodkind seems to add worldbuilding and magic rules whenever he can't explain something with what he has. It seems really amateurish, like he throws in a twist to keep things interesting and then pulls some lame explanation out to make it seem somewhat feasible.Okay, pros:The Imperial Order is introduced, and they are quite awesome.Hmmm....guess that does it for that list.Cons:Would mention redundancy again, but...Not enough focus on Richard. I understand that he's introducing the Imperial Order, which my friend says is going to be the biggest problem in the series for our heroes, but I feel like Goodkind spent way too much time focusing on that subplot instead of fleshing out the Richard plotline. The result was a very rushed conclusion in Richard's struggle to master his magic and mend the veil to the underworld.I always feel like a rabid Wheel of Time fanboy when I read Sword of Truth books because I spot so many similarities. Really, I'm not just trying to pointlessly slam this series because I'm in love with WoT or something; the similarities are just too obvious for me not to notice. I know, people say \\"Oh, Jordan ripped off Tolkien\\" and \\"There's nothing new under the sun\\" and things like that, but really, there are some instances where I'm left thinking \\"Umm plagiarism?\\" For instance (and this doesn't belong in this review, I know) in Wizard's First Rule, we see a poor individual named Samuel (or was it Smeagol?) who has destroyed himself over his desire for the Sword of Truth. He has long arms and is pale/gray I think...and he walks like a quadruped. Need I say more? WoT certainly has its rip-offs (Myrddraal/Nazgul, Trollocs/Orcs, etc.) but I've never seen anything so blatant. Also, I see some things that are a little too close to WoT for my liking. For instance:Caharin/Car'a'Carn (I'm not going to say that Goodkind just took Car'a'Carn and made a word that sounded similar and is pretty much the same thing, but...)Sisters of the Light/Aes Sedai (this one wasn't nearly as bad as the rest, but it did stick out)Rada'Han/a'dam (this one is also sort of forgivable because it is used by the Sisters of the Light; if it was used by an army of foreign invaders, well, then we'd have a problem. But still, it is pretty much the same thing.)Baka Ban Mana/Aiel (Richard, the Caharin[*cringe*], is supposed to return this group of \\"savages\\" to their homeland, much in the same way Rand is supposed to bring the Aiel out of the Three-Fold Land.)Those are the only ones that really stuck out to me. If there were other similarities, they were forgivable.I think the only reason I didn't like this book very much is that I can't seem to get drawn into the characters. Wizard's First Rule drew me in some, but the main thing that kept me reading was the mystery and excitement of this new world I was exploring. Stone of Tears doesn't have very many \\"new\\" things that kept me interested. In Wizard's First Rule, I found the character's interesting, but in this book they seem to all be cardboard cutouts. I'm not sure what happened between the two books, but I hope Goodkind fixes it in the next one.If you're totally in love with the characters, you'll probably love this book. There are new things added in, but I feel that he spends more time developing what's already there than he does adding new things, which is admirable. In my opinion, the writing was clunky, the characters all one-dimensional (really, it seems like everyone speaks the same way; there are almost no differences of voice between the characters) and the similarities to WoT way too distracting to make this book worth the time it took to read it. I might feel differently if I had picked up Goodkind before I picked up Jordan, but as it stands, that is my opinion."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"This review is about the digital, Kindle version of this book. It is so filled with errors it looks to have been edited by one who learned English as a second language.

Those are exactly the kind of errors you hear from non-native speakers of English. The print version that I read before was much cleaner. There is truly no excuse for this.

I love to read using a Kindle; I am just shocked at such a lack of quality control. I hope it is not a trend. So buy or borrow the books and enjoy a good story. Just don't get them on the Kindle."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I got Wizard's First Rule on Kindle and it was great. However this book is atrocious it appears to have been formatted by a 1st grader. I am very displeased I hope that amazon fixes it and gives a free update to people who bought this version. I am actually mad about it."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"This book was good, but not as good as the first in the series. However this review is not about the content of the book. I got the Kindle version and it was riddled with typos. It's very distracting to read a book that has so many mistakes in it. I'm sure the author would not be pleased with the way his creation is being distributed."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"First, I would like to state that I read almost all of the reviews of this book and I would like to tell you, the future reader, that almost every single bad review on this book on this site came from people that [obviously] did not really pay attention to what they were reading. I am not saying that people couldn't dislike this book, but these specific reviewers missed so much that it is hard to believe that they did more than skim through the book. If there is one thing that Goodkind does good, it is making sure that everything that happens CAN happen in his world and nothing is too far fetched.While Goodkind does seem to take a lot from Robert Jordan, the overall story is completely compelling. I spent hours upon hours reading this book because I could NOT put it down. It seems like anything can happen and many times anything does. Sometimes the conclusions are rushed and there are things that don't seem all that important, but there is always a fast pace that will make you want to know what happens next. I must admit that I had a hard time getting though Khalan's first chapters and after she was alone and there were a few boring chapters in Galea I thought that either I didn't like the character or that her part in the book would be boring. Trust me. It is the best part of the book after you get past those few chapters of nothing.If you are a fantasy reader and are not of the weak at heart. You will love this book. One word of advice though. Try to read large chunks at one time or in one day. If you try to read Goodkind and only read ten pages a day, you will NOT get the full effect of the book. I'm not sure why, but with everyone I have talked to it is the same case. Some I have talked to read it slowly and hated it. I told them to go back and read more at a time and then they loved it."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Ok, maybe my rating of 3 stars is a little harsh, it would be 3.6 if I could do that, but I tend to round down.Don't get me wrong, this book was good. It has all the great elements of the last book, but there were two fatal flaws in it.1. The story is VERY loose. Not much that really matters happens at all. It could've been half the size that it is, and I almost felt like I was wasting my time when I know that Richard won't be much further along when I stop reading.2. The way the dilemma was solved was craaaapy. It must've been a total of 5 pages or so. I felt cheated. I felt like &quot;I read all this for a 5 page ending?&quot;. I was expecting something better. Not only that, it didn't seem very hard to do what he did.To me, this book seemed more like a &quot;character development&quot; novel. The characters become more in-depth and then there are new ones.I really REALLY disliked that Goodkind got rid of Chase. He was my favorite character from Wizard's First Rule (don't worry about me giving that away it happens early in the book). I'm currently reading Temple of the Winds and Chase still isn't back, so I think he is gone, never to appear in the series again.Not all is lost though. After I finish this review I'm going to go and review Blood of the Fold, which was actually pretty good. I'm giving it 4 stars. And Temple of the Winds is, by far, the best book in the series (even better than First Rule! I'm only like 1/3 into it though).Read this book, but don't just give up on the series because the other ones are good."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"This was an outstanding book. If you have read Wizards first rule and enjoyed it as much as I did, then you are probably frantically searching for the next one. It definately fills in the missing parts and you get a better understanding of what the series is about. This dramatic fantasy is the best I have ever read. Granted, I have not read many fantasy books but this one definitely takes the cake. You won't be able to put it down and it will be over before you know it.One thing that did it for me was the characters. Unlike many fantasy books, Terry Goodkind creates realistic characters, if you can believe that. It is easy relating to many of the characters and their personalities are unlike the norm. For me it was easy to relate to Richard, but that's just because I think of myself as a hero. OK but seriously, no matter who you are, there is at least one character that you can associate with.Besides all that, Goodkind's writing is so captivating and so amazing, that all you can think about is getting home so you can continue reading. I don't know how he does it but when I read his work it is like he is putting pictures in my mind. His settings are so extraordinary, only your mind can comprehend them.Goodkind's style of writing hooks me because instead of writing the book chapter after chapter, he changes things up a bit. Maybe you will be reading about Khalan and her adventures, and then all at once there you are reading about Richard. You might not get to find out what happens for another two or three chapters. But the suspense is what makes it good. It wouldn't be nearly exciting if you found out things right away.If you are looking to enhance you vocabulary this may not be the book for you. However, he does not bore you whatsoever with low-key tone or lousy words. If fantasy is your thing then I say you are obligated to read this book. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I read the whole Wheel of Time series just before starting this series. I give this a rating of 2 stars since I found at least a few things interesting in the books, like Kahlan, but sadly, the rest is nothing more than copy and paste of the Wheel of Time books. :(Here, let me give you some parallels:Richard = RandRand is in prophecies, gee, so is Richard....Rand becomes a sword master, hmm, so does Richard, although via spirits instead of actual practice.The White Tower = Palace of the Prophets, both establishments are on an island next to a big city with a river. Goodkind hardly even makes an effort to make anything different.Sisters of the Light = Aes SediSisters of the Light want to control Richard, the Aes Sedi want to control Rand.Wizards in this series are basically the male Aes Sedi of WOT.In this series, new wizards must learn to control their magic or it causes them a horrible death if they are not rescued and taught how in time. In WOT, the men must overcome the 'taint' of the male half of the power or they die horribly.Wizards are at odds with Sisters of the Light...Male Aes Sedi are at odds with the Female Aes Sedi....There are 'Black Ajea' in the White Tower, and surprise, there are 'dark sisters' in the Palace of the Prophets. In both series, it's forbidden to mention the 'Dark sis...er Black Ajea' and they are mythical, scary, and powerfull. Identical in both series.In WOT, the \\"Dark One\\" is trying to escape his prison where he was put by the Creator...the \\"Nameless One\\" in this series is trying to escape his prison where he was put by the Creator. There aren't even minor differences here. They are the same.Richard is the only one who can stop the Nameless One from escaping. Rand is the only one who can stop the Dark One from escaping. Both Rand and Richard are headed for the 'big showdown one on one fight with the Nameless One.Chase the border guard = Lan in WOT. Both the formidable almost unstoppable fighters of the series.Blood of the Fold = White Cloaks in WOT.The Bak Ban Mani = AielBoth have men and women fighter sects. Both series, Rand / Richard ends up ruling them.Rand becomes the Caracarn, Richard becomes the Caharin.I can go on, and on, and on.... but I'm running out of space to shoot holes in these books.Bottom line: Both the Wheel of Time series and the Sword of Truth series were essentially written by the same author, Robert Jordan.It's too bad that he copied someone else's work, because the 'few' places where the books actually diverge, the characters are interesting...like Kahlan...and he did do a decent job of getting some emotion into the story, which was fun.I loved the part where Kahlan leads 5,000 young recruits against 50,000 battle hardened men. I was rivetted and that was one of the more original parts of the book, so trust me, I'm not just bashing the series. The problem is that there are just too many similarites to WOT.Maybe next time he'll actually take the time to come up with his own story and write a real book, but this stuff is mostly just a work of cut and paste. Goodkind has lost my trust as a reader. Skip this and go read WoT...."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Oh dear, oh dear, where did it all go wrong Terry? What a pity,when the first book was quite good this book is just pure unfilteredcrude &@*!$. Terry plunders every cliche known to man and doesnt seem to have his own writing style. The way Kahlen and Richard kept apologising to each other at every available opportunity smacked to me of an author who can't write a decent line of dialog or of line wasting. Terry is deeply preoccupied with physical violence and uses it at every opportunity to shock the reader. The ending was the most contrived i've read in years! Terry conspires to forget about the plot for the whole book until the last 10 pages where he tries to squeeze it all in! It just doesn't work! Poor show Terry. END"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"The only thing that keeps Goodkind from being the most popular fantasy writer to date is the fact that all the plots are unoriginal, the dialogue is often unrealistic, and the characters never change. Wizard's First Rule was worth buying and reading; it supplied hours upon hours of entertainment for me. I enjoyed the characters and the action. However, if Goodkind is only going to write one plot through out the entire series, I find no purpose in reading the rest of the 'Sword' books. There's always some kind of badguy/villian who wants to conquer the world with either an object or his powers, and Richard along with Kahlan go out to destroy this evil being before his plans are accomplished. While Kahlan and Richard are torn apart in this book, there's also an aggrivating sense of Dramatic irony, much like there was, (Irritatingly) in Wizard's First Rule with the Box of Orden being held right underneath their noses for about two hundred pages before they even think about it being held where it was. Used with the right pen of the right author, this could be used as a suspenseful element, but when Goodkind uses it, it turns out as pure disaster. Goodkind, leave the dramatic irony for Shakespeare. Also, might I add, Terry Goodkind's imagination is kind of warped in a weird sense. It's not as sadistic as people are really saying it is, because Goodkind is just adding an element of gritty realisticness that chills to the bone, (The Mord-Sith are so scary, and the torture scenes are really brutal and it makes you feel as if you're there) but even with some experience and a rather good hand with the pen, he often bores the reader and drags out some scenes with romance scenes that feel like a daytime ABC soap opera.However, I would like to point out that he's not as bad as some people are saying he is. He's not the worst writer in the world; he keeps the ingredients of a modern fantasy novel at hand to use, (Dragons, Kings, wizards, heroes, escapism, rescues, damsals in distress,) but his plotlines are often predictable. Like I said earlier, they're really all the same.What I just said, though, does not mean I support his stories. The first one was a gem, yes, but it is because of writers like Goodkind, Jordan, and millions of others that fantasy is in the major piles of crud that it is. Tolkien was a good author, but it is because of him that every other author of fantasy is constantly trying to conquer and dominate his world, which is simply impossible. When will fantasy writers get over trying to be Tolkien? There used to be such a thing as independant heroes who didn't wine during grave situations where they always had to have the help of friends or family or the local 'wizard' to come and save them. We need more stories like the Red Sonja books, which are now, most unfortunately, out of print. Howard's 'Conan' books. I'm still convinced that no author has ever tried to pluck this genre which is going nowhere in my book out of the frustrating area that it dwells in. We need real fantasy books with real, muscle-bound broadsword wielding heroes that slay beasts and monsters while laughing. Not scared wanna-be Frodo's that travel across a land to get tortured and be broken in spirit until they accidentally stumble across the bad guy and then somehow get the magical item they started on the journey for in the first place.What I'm saying is, read Wizard's First Rule. Then stop there. The other books, simply in my opinion, are not worth reading."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"While the storyline continues to be very good, the number of bad grammar and spelling errors were quite distracting. By book four, this seems to be corrected to a large degree."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"This has been one of my favorite epic stories since I first began to love reading. Terry Goodkind masterfully makes his characters as real to the reader as if he were speaking with them. It is impossibly easy to become invested in their every success and cry for them when they suffer. Also, the settings are beautifully depicted.The problem here is that when this book went from print to this Kindle version, no one seemed to notice all the typos. And I don't just mean one or two, that anyone can ignore in good grace.I cannot believe this has been made available to purchase. \\"Than\\" is without fail ALWAYS spelled as \\"that\\" and I don't know if you know this, but it makes a big difference in the meaning of a sentence when that is mispelled. Like I said, once or twice? No big deal. Once you are used to it, it just becomes incredibly irritating. Not to mention frequent mispellings of many other wrods (like that) and blatant ommisions of words that are rather important for context. Or putting the one more \\"the\\" in the sentence that necessary.Conclusion? Read it--absolutely! If you liked Wizard's First Rule, you are bound to like this sequel. But for the sake of your enjoyment, buy a secondhand paperback instead. Don't waste your valuable money on this. On the other hand, if you have prime and can borrow it for free, why worry?"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Other folks have written, I believe, very good synopses and reviews of the content of the book, so I'll not go there. All I would like ot add is that, while I enjoyed the story itself, the Kindle edition of the content seems unfinished. I own the paperback as well and, relative to it, there are a LOT of typos, wrong words, blank spaces and, at one point, what seems like a plot summary instead of text (it looked a like a note someone would write to themselves about what they meant to happen next if they didn't have time to actually write it out). It honestly feels like when the publishers decided to hop on the Kindle bandwagon, they just grabbed any digital copy of the book they could find and 'published' it. Unfortunately, it seems they grabbed on that hadn't gone to editing yet. It's not that big of a deal, really, but when they are charging more for a digital copy than the cover price on the print version, I would at least expect it to be an apparently-finished version."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Now let me get this straight:1- Kaylen loves Richard.2- Richard hates wearing the Rada'Han to the point where he feels betrayed.3- Kaylen believes that without the Rada'Han, Richard will die so she makes him wear it and is told that if she does in fact love him, that she must go find Zed who may be able to help Richard's headaches without him wearing the collar.4- Kaylen believes that Richard MUST survive as he is the only one that can repair the veil.So, off Kaylen goes to find Zed..yet she goes off track to check out Ebinissia and takes over an army?Ah, what happened to the great pain and fear of her love?

Decided it would be a nice distraction and purchased it then and there. One week later I went back to the bookstore and bought the rest of the series, &quot;Stone Of Tears&quot;, &quot;Blood Of The Fold&quot; and the &quot;Temple Of The Winds&quot;. I found each book deeply involving with a fine array of interesting characters. And a plot with more twists than any I have ever come across before in any film, book or play. I was constantly surprised to find out how easily I was caught up in the story. Sharp wit brought on laughter, characters who died brought a lump to my throat and tears to my eyes. Malevolent evil characters brought out righteous anger and rage and a need to see retribution and revenge... which I hasten to add was forth coming all this and it's a love story. This surely s! hows that assumption IS the greatest sin and faith, trust and loyalty do win out even if the path to the end result is filled with fear, frustration and pain.

I'm around 1/3 of the way through, and that will probably be it for me. The writing is excellent and well-paced. But disappointment #1 came with the introduction of the &quot;Sisters of Light&quot; (read Aes Sedai). C'mon, I know there will be comparable events, characters, etc accross fantasy books, but this isn't even an original thought. I like Robert Jordan, but don't want to re-read him under the guise of another author. Disappointment #2, and the reason I won't finish, is the unecessary detail given to the graphic sexual &quot;perversions&quot; if you will. I won't spell out for those reading this exactly what I'm referring to. Allude to them, Terry, it makes for a better book. Jordan does it well, as does Lawhead and Eddings. So, I'm onto George R R Martin now, which is a shame, because I think your story telling, pace and style are actually better than Mr. Jordan's. Hence the rating of three. But I don't need the rest.

I will now state some of the things I have seen and think are worth writing about. Feel free to skip sections if you want.What is the worth of a friend anyway. Are they to be used as tools for the greater glory of the main character, or are they sidekicks, meant to support and do 1/2 but recieve 1/20 of the reward. Planescape Torment put it best when it stated do they \\"matter\\" to you? Are they the kind of friends that stick by you through hell and heaven? Khalan in Wizard's First Rule has never had a friend. Ever since she was a child she has faced adult responsibilities and others fearing her power. Personally I would love to have someone touch a person and make him tell the truth, that would pretty much eliminate death sentences and mistakes. If you were guilty why let her destroy you since you'll just tell it all? But I would also fear that which I would not understand and its abuse. Search Kahlan's personality and ethics and see if she abuses her power. There are lesser people all around that if they had this power, they would be corrupted by it.When she says you are special Richard, and when Richard says that is what friends do... Its a subtle communication and teaching. It means more to people that really appreciate it. It is teaching that there is more to life than just \\"duty\\" to the people.Next on the agenda is magic, how I love how magic is explained in this book and the series in general. Richard learns what is magic but not how to work specific aspecs of magic, mainly his magic. The Sisters of Light(AKA 50% Aes Sedai, 50% religious fanatics) said every wizard/sorcerous uses the gift differently... mm that sounds like telepathy and telekinesis to me. Additive magic adds and multipies what is there, but subtractive magic obliterates things. [...]Rather I just look at how Zedd uses magic. Floating things, making dense air sharper than a scalpel. Making fire that is alive. Too bad he's not powerful enough to raise rocks out of the ground and impale people. Although the tearing of the ground is just a waste.Zedd worked up a great conundrum when he said the murderer justifies his killing because he believes he is right in book 1. Lol, but zedd also talked of Righteous anger and justification to Richard. So who is right and who is wrong if it is all only on perspective. Well there are 4 truths, your truth, his truth, the guy that saw it's truth, and the Real truth. Reality is so complicated its ridiculous.The Six Wizard's Rules have improved my life by adding a touch of wisdom to a rather dull mind. It made me think about my actions, who governed them, and if they were right or not. Faith is all good and nice but I'd rather search for it then have it handed to me. I always did like philosophy and ethics.I agree with some when they said there were several irregularities in Robert Jordan's works. To understand Goodkind's strong points, you must understand Robert Jordan's works. I don't think all the similarities between the two is by coincidence, yet a zirconium and diamond is similar in appearances, only when you go deeper is where you see the divergeance. Aes Sedai can't lie, but are they better for that or do they just adapt into a more subtle form of lying. Sisters of Light don't believe in lieing but they would do it by justifying it that it saves lives. Originally both were good, Sedai served the world, Sisters served the wizards that would otherwise have died. Now they are both corrupt, aes sedai trying to dominate the lives that they were Sworn to protect. Aes sedai would eviscerate any male that so much as insulted them. Abuse of power. Sisters of Light train and brainwash wizards so they can be controlled. Causing more harm than good. Aes Sedai is both male and female. Yet the females has so much scorn for the males that if I didn't know better I would think we had a gender switch. Circa 1500s when everyone thought females were stupid as cows.Book 2 is an excellent sequel to Book 1. It begins the moment Richard and Kahlan leaves which is suprisingly enough. But the danger manifests itself very quickly as the People's Palace is attacked by the Keeper's minions. Richard has torn the veil, and now has to fix it. But his gift is going awry so he has to go and get helped. Whether that help is good or bad is your guess. In the end, you'll see that dragon, know what the Stone of Tears is, see the palace again, and get rid of that collar!"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"This book is exciting and keeps you from putting it down.

Downloading now!"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"This book -- and the Sword of Truth series as a whole -- is one of the preeminent works of its genre. Period. I've read the series a dozen times, starting from Book 1 with each new book published (a year or more between each book kept them as fresh reads, or nearly enough so to enjoy). Heroic, noble, evil, redemption. A mirror into the soul of the world and of human nature. As insightful as Ayn Rand's work, a/ a lot faster. What's not to like? I don't care much for Goodkind's more contemporarily set work, but this series rises to iconic in my view."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"So far this is an awesome series of books.

The story continues right where the previous book left off and relays the story of Richard and Kahlan in their quest for peace in the Midlands as well as their love for each other and the trials and tribulations they endure with their situation. Old characters like Chase, Zed and Addy return and a new array of characters are introduced as well.If you loves the first book, Stone of Tears will also be a very enjoyable read for you. Highly recommended. The next book in the series would be Blood of the Fold followed by Temple of the Winds which are also amazing continuations of the saga."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"This is the second book in his series and it is just as good as the first one. When reading his books I can't stop, I will spend entire nights just reading his books and when I look at the clock I see that it is time for me to head to work. Just a great read and a great book."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"The errors in this kindle book are ridiculous. Its a shame that the great writing its partially ruined by terrible editting. I can't speak for the printed version but this ebook has so many errors, at points, its hard to read. One common example is using the word \\"that\\" instead of \\"than\\". This seems trivial but after a while, you have to study every instance of the word to figure out which he meant. As the book progresses the errors come more and more often. I just hate that I loved this book so much and every time I got some momentum while reading, I would be dragged to a halt and pulled from the world by these errors. Aside from GRRM's stuff, this is one of the more expensive ebooks I've bought. It would be nice, with the ton of money I'm sure they've made on this book, if they could find someone to properly edit this.That being said, I loved this book. It gets moving more slowly that wizard's first rule, but it is also more than double the size. Some of the stuff going on felt like it wasn't really needed but by the end, everything tied together nicely. At one point, I was convinced that there was no way this book would wrap up what was going on. It seemed to be dragging its feet but at about the 2/3 mark, this thing just takes off. As another reviewer said, the last 300 pages demand to be read. I thought after this book I might take a break and read some other stuff but I have got to know what happens to Richard, Zedd, Kahlan and the rest.All in all, this book is amazing. I couldn't give it 5 stars because of the constant annoyance from all the errors but there's no way I would recommend not reading this if you liked the first book.On a side note, another reviewer complains about a section of the book being moved to the end. I'm not sure this is an error. I believe it was intentional in its placement. The passage at the end doesn't take away from the story but in fact, gives you a \\"holy $#!+\\" moment when you realize what's being said. Again, I think this is intentional and even if it wasn't, I think the book is better read like this."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I do not often re-read books, but I have been drawn back it and have moved on to book 4 in the series!"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Goodkind writes entertaining stories, but I find his dialogue to be downright poor. The exchanges between Richard and Kahlan seem to me like little kids talking - simple sentences, explaining everything in brutal detail. This series isn't awful, but I admit I'm having trouble finding a reason to keep reading."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Terry Goodkind is one of the best authors I've ever read and becoming my personal favorite.I could read this book a thousand times and still laugh, cry and bite my nails just as hard!!I Definitely recommend reading this great book and all the ones after it!!!!"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"This book is full of excitement!

It slows down a bit towards the middle and I found myself frustrated Witt some of the choices by the characters even though in the end they seemed to be reasoned.My only issue with the sorry was the ending seemed a bit rushed. Lost of time for development and creating a set of problems for out hero, Richard Rahl to solve. Then suddenly, with a couple of quick decisions they are solved and the story is as an end.Even with my issues, the characters and the setting remain interesting and I will continue to read the series."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"The characters are mythical, virtuous, and very love able.

I own it in paperback already, but I have a tendency to re-read books several times, so I picked it up. BECAUSE FREE. Why wouldn't I?These books are decent. They start out pretty excellent and sort of decline from there.. but by the time you realize they're becoming less and less entertaining, you're already too invested to stop. At least, I was. So I finished them. All of them all the way up through Phantom and Confessor. (I can't remember which order those two were written in. It's been a year or two since I read any of them.)If you ask me, Goodkind gets a little preachy around the fourth or fifth book and the series sort of becomes a platform for the advocacy of communism, rather than an entertaining fantasy series. I was able to read through it, for the sake of his lesser-liked characters, and finish the series. I felt like I owed them that, at least."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"That being said it did get old towards the end of the series, however this book was great and came before Terry got onto a high horse he couldn't find his way off of ...."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"The first, second and last of the Sword of Truth series are without a doubt the best books I have ever read and I read a lot of books."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"The second book in the series, it holds up well and carries on what was good about Wizards' First Rule.Why they didn't just call this Wizards' Second Rule, I will never understand. I do like the convention of each book learning a new rule and seeing it applied in the end game of the book.The story and themes this book touches on are both interesting and very touching. The importance of love and the dangers of it is one of the great themes of this book, and done well with the Sisters of Light. Also, the poor nature of prophesies to be understood in any way other then hindsight is something I definitely like. In to many fantasy novels, prophecy is so spelled out that it hardly resembles the idea of it any more. At some point, it just becomes direction. This book continues to handle prophecy very well.As always Zed is a pleasure to follow, and Richards story line is also interesting. I find Kahlan to be a bit tedious, but her story is not all together uninteresting. The addition of Gratch is well done, and you find yourself like him very much.This book continues in the vain of the first, and does an admirable job. If you enjoyed Wizards' First Rule, you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"By now you've seen reviews of this book that hype it as the best thing ever, and those that slam it for the violence and rape images. I will do neither. I give it 5 stars based on one thing: its ability to keep me turning page after page, not wanting to put the book down. The only other book in this series that accomplishes that feat for me is Faith of the Fallen. Some reviewers claim they know Fantasy. I know Fantasy Fiction myself...my library contains over 500 books in the genre, and I am a writer myself, though I have not yet sought to publish my work.Yes, there are acts of violence and rape described in this book. It's probably overdone to drive home just how evil the enemy is, so that Richard's actions are all the more justified. Unnecessary, yes. But ultimately it has a place in my library. You see, if every book on my shelf were The Sword of Shannara, that would be incredibly boring. No knock aginst Terry Brooks, I enjoy his books and am just using this as an example. It is the diversity of the material that makes the reading worthwhile. There is nothing out there like The Sword of Truth series. Though people will claim the Sword of Truth is similar to the Wheel of Time series, the latter has child-like characters, way too many side stories and characters, does not possess the violence and graphic descriptions, and the villians are forgettable. So Goodkind sits on my shelf next to Zelazny's Amber, Moorcock's Elric, Brooks's Shannara, Hobb's Assassin, and many others...and holds its own place for what it brings to the table.For those who choose to explore it, this book holds some fascinating elements such as the Sliph, the Mriswrath Cape, the Black and White Towers, how prophecy works and much more. No other book in the series brings out such a variety of fantastic elements.My final thought on the entire series is that it was intended as two trilogies, with Wizard's First Rule through Blood of the Fold as the first, and the Chainfire trilogy as the second. But perhaps after the success of the first two books, someone in Goodkind's camp looked over at the bloated garbage Jordan was writing (and the money he was making) and said, \\"hey, we can do that too!\\" Every book in between the \\"two trilogies\\" I have described above does little to advance the overall plot, which explains why they are the least popular. Although, without the bloating, we would never have been gifted with the excellent Faith of the Fallen. But that is a story (or should I say review) for another day..."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Since I bought the MP3/CD edition, I have two things to comment on, the book itself and the cd production and format.Goodkind reminds me of Herman Wouk, in both the good and not so good ways. Reading Winds of War, by Wouk, I thought \\"I wish a better writer could have written this story,\\" as I read on avidly, page after page. He had a way of telling you the same thing three times, or using clunky language. But, then I realized: No other writer thought of this story, it didn't exist before Wouk created it. And I couldn't stop reading the book. Sometimes, a great storyteller is a great stylist, but the most important thing is that he or she tells a great, compelling story. And Terry Goodkind does that. Sometimes, he spends way too many pages telling us something he could have told us in one, but, ultimately, it is well worth the read. It's a powerfully imagined world.The MP3/CD format worked fine in Media Player and iTunes, once it was imported, but wouldn't play on the car CD player, nor directly off the CD on any other CD Player I tried.Jim Bond, the narrator, does a consistently good job, giving distinctly different voices for each of the characters. The sound quality is excellent."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"this series is becomming my next favorite to the lord of the rings. thank you terry goodkind."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"My mom's work has a 'free book exchange' where you can bring in books and borrow the ones other people have brought in for awhile. I asked her to bring me some. The first time she brought Wizard's First Rule and three books in the Crown of Stars series by Kate Elliot.I started with Wizard's First Rule and went on to read the others before having her take them back and get more books. The second time she brought back Stone of Tears and Blood of the Fold. I couldn't help but notice how long SoT is compared to BotF, but I personally don't shy away from long books, and I had gotten attacheed to the characters from reading the first book. So I went ahead and read it.One thing that I can say is that there is always something going on. Like a good book should, there's an exciting scene at the beginning to get things rolling. The main characters split up in the first half of the book, but I found there's not as many dead spots as in the first book, simply because all of the characters at least have something to do. I personally didn't have any problems with the writing style.Why am I'm knocking off a star, then? For the number of distasteful scenes. Now, Wizard's First Rule had a section that I personally found uncomfortable, but it was just one part. In the sequel, there are multiple scenes of mass murder, ritual murder, rape, torture, beheading, sex with demons, and other things that I think most people would rather not read in detail. Here, all are described with varying (but still too much for me) degrees of explicitness. IMHO, these kinds of scenes in a fantasy novel are best left implied or vague, if they are included at all. In this case, they would not be out of place in a gothic horror novel, and certainly don't fit well with the adventurous tone of the rest of the book.Not a series you want your kid to read after Harry Potter.Also, one more thing I wanted to note on: the quality of the binding. Every single one of these books my mom has brought me has had a broken spine. Don't expect it to last."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"After reading the first book it wasn't long before I had to drive to the store to get the next one. It didn't let me down. This book is a bit on the long side, but that really is not a bad thing. I found myself at the end not wanting to pages to run out! I would highly recoomend this book. The reason I gave this book 4 stas instead of 5 is just because, for me, his writing on a 5 star level, I reserve 5 stars for the absolute best books in my option. This book won't be a waste of your time!"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Don't worry this review contains NO SPOILERS! I found Wizard's First Rule to be extremely inventive - and I would implore anyone reading this review that has not already read Wizard's First Rule to be sure to read it first because it is awesome. Stone of Tears was equally inventive and I think even more interesting than Wizard's First Rule. I personally found the first 300 pages of Stone of Tears to be 'a little bit slow' - o.k. a little boring. However, the storyline progress in a much more enjoyable way from about page 300 on and the pacing increases dramatically. Without a doubt, you will admire &amp; empathize with the good guys &amp; girls. Conversely, you will loath &amp; condemn the bad guys &amp; girls. I would argue that Terry Goodkind's biggest strength is his ability to trigger an emotional response from his readers. I know that Terry plays with my emotions with the skill of a master conductor. My favorite parts of this novel are those sections that reveal the awesome potential that Richard has as a wizard. I found myself wishing I were Richard more than once! That's what fantasy is all about!"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Let me start off by saying this book is pretty decent in it's own right. However, I have to agree with Jim's list of similarities. There are just way too many parallels for me to reccommend this book. It wouldn't surprise me if Goodkind wrote this book using Robert Jordan's notes."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I loved the first book, and I loved this 2nd book -- Terry has a great imagination -- totally amazing the things he can think of, the pictures he can paint -- how you are there just as if you were watching a movie and you know, see, feel what's going on.Like the first book, I couldn't put it down - I simply devoured this book and happily went on to the next one! I bet you do too.Happy reading! :-)-- Nancy"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I truly find it hard to believe that the negative comments for this book, are really talking about this book. Stone of Tears is prehaps the best fantasy I have read thus far. The vividness of this book has granted me an unlimited enjoyment. The characters were down right likeable, and blievable. Richard and Kahlan are greatly executed, and I honestly can't find a single fault with this book, or this author. Mr. Goodkind is like known other, the world hasn't seen an author of his magnitude since Tolkein and Jules Verne. Mr. Goodkind is a man of pure talent, which won't be contested prehaps many years from now."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Everybody has read the kind of books that keep you wanting more after you have finished it. This on was like that for me. The action and battle scenes are graphic but graceful. The sexual content is very tastefully done and doesn,t get tawdry. The characters are beleivable and realist in their actions. I was a bit put off by the size of the book(over 900 pages), but the only thing that matches it is the scope of the book. The only other series that matches this is the Deryni titles by K. Kurtz. There is only good news coming in the fact that the story isn't over, look for &quot;The Blood of the Fold&quot;, and more. They should have done a better job with the maps though. It's hard to follow the paths fo the characters because some of the cities and landmarks are not shown. If the publisher is reading this maybe they can do something about it in future offerings. Some of us really like maps."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Goodkind had me from the first page. He takes the typical equation for a fantasy and applies it with the best of them.The plot, characters and myths that Goodkind employs to create his world may not be original to many experienced fantasy readers, but he does wonders with them. Any author who can take the tried and true, and often run into the ground, and create an imagination firing adventure for the reader is due for some praise.This book is a fluid read with very few slow areas. Enjoy.Robert B."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"&quot;Stone of Tears&quot; is the second installment in Terry Goodkind's &quot;Sword of Truth&quot; series. It is very long. Through much of the book I found myself wondering when the author was going to get around to dealing with the Stone of Tears. Having now also read the third installment, I see that a great deal of &quot;Stone of Tears&quot; was setting up the background for the third book. I like this series a lot. It's a very worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Terry Goodkind is an excellent writer. You find yourself falling in love with the characters, sharing their pain, and perhaps more importantly learning their lessons. Their emotions envelop you, taking over your psyche for however long you stay with them. You understand the respect for life, love, freedom, and death. Everything we do can have an effect upon others, illustrated by the pebble in the pond, the one snowflake in the avalanche, and the wizard's second rule- &quot;The best of intentions can lead to the greatest harm.&quot; Learn from the past, don't live in it and let it control your life. And always, always believe that true love can never be destroyed by evil. Care about the world's future and perhaps it won't be so bad."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"In this, the sequel to Wizards First Rule, Mr. Goodkind once again writes a spellbinding and mesmerizing novel. Sure, there are similarities to Jordan's work (who is also an incredibly talented author), but which fantasy hasn't ripped something from greek mythology, Arthurian legend or legends of old and stuck in their book? In my opinion, Mr. Goodkind is definately on par with great authors like C.S. Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkien.And to all those people who think only kids and teens like this book because they're less mature than you, with all due respect, GROW UP!"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"'Stone of Tears' keeps the momentum and praise that is obtained from the first book in the great series.

If you have a love for fantasy READ THIS. It will feed your appetite"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Not surprisingly, I enjoyed Stone of Tears as much, if not more than Wizard's First Rule. Again, I still can't see where any of the criticism that I've read would come from. Like the first, I could not put the book down, looking forward to every suspense-filled page.

Balderdash, I say!!! Whoever had an original thought, anyway. The whole point of reading a fantasy book is to be entertained, not to look for flaws. Goodkind keeps me reading, something I cannot say for Jordan. I loved the Wheel of Time series until book six when it just flat bogged down. I haven't finished it yet. Goodkind keeps dragging me along with him through all the different adventures. I really enjoy his writing, the way he uses words. I haven't been disappointed by the characters at all. They don't do idiotic things just to keep the plot moving; the women are as strong as the men. It is a fantasy...lighten up...enjoy it for what it is, not what you would make it"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"This series is a good read even if we have seen alot of it before.I just wonder why all those readers who think this series is so bad continue to read each book that follows in the series.

For some reason when I was reading this book I got really lost as to what was going on and what exactly was the importance of some of the characters. My own fault for probably overlooking some important fact though did not deter me from giving this book a perfect 5 out of 5. The story was very interesting and just like the first part, Terry Goodkind did a very good job of character development and story telling. I only time I read books is right before I sleep but for some reason the sword of truth series has me driving to starbucks in the middle of day to read! Haha. I strongly urge people to read the first book first before reading this one. This book is full of mystery, action, and drama, don't miss out!"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"There was an improvement in the writing skill for this book, as I'd hoped he's seemed to have gotten a few of his writing kinks out and it was more enjoyable and less aggravating than the first book. I enjoyed the plot and characters, and thankfully after about the 12th time he finally stopped referring to Richard as a 'Rare person' every three pages.A few quirks still bother me, namely that he can't really get away from describing things certain ways. Kahlan's use of her powers are always described as 'thunder with no sound'. After the umpteenth time of reading that, alright already, I get what her power is like, you can shake it up a bit. Goodkind does this in other areas as well, but the strength and pace of his story makes up for it, and it was an enjoyable read all around. A solid 3 1/2 stars, I'm looking forward to reading the next in the series."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"This book is very long, but very good.

I found it difficult to understand some of the elements of the story until I read later books, and realized that Terry wound the story so masterfully that even though there are many books they are one seemless story. This is without a doubt the best series I have read."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Is there a rule stating that the second installment in a fantasy series HAS TO deal with the hero going through training? There's The Empire Strikes back and Eldest (Eragon 2), and then there's Stone of Tears. They all follow the same track. Either way, I loved the book. Goodkind is quite good at establishing a scene so that I feel like I'm there."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"So far I have not been disappointed with the series, I only hope I can say that when I am done.

Not bad but not good either. When reading I kept wondering when we were going to get to the Stone and it's meaning. I was dissapointed in the amount of time it actually recieved.

Goodkind is an excellent author. His novels are extremely well-written, his characters pull you in and make you a part of the novel. He may very well have borrowed from other authors...but then, we all do. However, I have to take offense at the &quot;the only people who like this trash are teenagers&quot; comment. Violence, sex, and intruige have long been a successful formula, and because he pulls it off with a plot and likeable characters the Jordan fans are going ballistic. Grow up, adults. You say teenagers are immature."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"If you like part one, you'll like this book too. I think it's about 300 pages too long, it seems Terry doesn't really know how to make things a bit more short. Some of the happy coincidences in the book are a bit hard to believe, which degrades the story. Richard is a cool guy, a bit like Arnold Schwarzenegger at times (excluding the accent), Kahlan does her usual thing (i.e. being a brave woman who uses magic when things get tough). Terry G. himself says he wanted this book to be better than the first part. I do not think he has succeeded in that, but it is a satisfying story with some terrifying scenes (some of which are indeed unnecessary as one reviewer suggests), and which still appears to be an introduction to the real story (that of course never gets told in part three). I'm off to read Tolkien first, then I'll proceed to the Blood of the Fold..."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"This book is a must read for any fantasy lover. I have a hard time finding books I really enjoy, and can't put down, and I was so thankful to the friend that recomended me this title."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I love this series. I simply couldn't get into the portions of the book involving Kahlan or the Sisters. I found the story much more appealing when Richard showed up. This simply was not a book in the series I can read over and over. It did not live up to Wizard's First Rule."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"A good book with well developed charactors, and impressive magic, and with good fights that you could follow along with. Bad things... The book builds to a grand ending and ends within a chapter or less."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"The second book in the Sword of Truth series has pretty much the same strengths and weaknesses as its predecessor, so if you liked 'Wizard\`s First Rule', you should enjoy this one.The story starts within days of Richard's victory over Darken Rahl, when monsters from the underworld attack in the People's Palace in D'Hara and the Mud People village where Richard and Kahlan have gone. It's soon discovered that Darken Rahl's use of the magic of Orden in Book 1 has weakened the Veil between the worlds of the living and the dead, and Richard and Kahlan are off once again to prevent apocalypse. The angle this time is that prophecy shows that the apocalypse can be prevented only if Kahlan dies.This time they are mostly separated, Kahlan traveling through the Midlands while Richard leaves with the Sisters of Light to seek to learn mastery over his powers. Once again, there is no shortage of action, but the writing isn't the best, too many fantasy cliches are invoked, and the characters don't show any further development. New characters and locations are introduced, especially in Richard's travels.Once again, there is a somewhat morbid element running through the book. Along with the battles, there is a good deal of rape, torture, and mutilation. Unlike the prior book, it takes place mostly offstage and we generally get elaborate and excessive desriptions of the results more than the acts."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I steer away from these massive concrete block o books series because most of them are so poorly written I fear devolution overtaking me before the end of the first endless volumn. Goodkind is different. Not that he's that good a writer, he isn't. But I would not be giving this book and all the rest in this series 4 stars if he was just the best of a very poor lot.Goodkind has a great love for his characters, enough to get under their skin and explore just what and who they are and what they can be. He may repeat himself a bit but his world is a rich and solid place and given half a chance you will love it too, and the people who try to save it. Goodkind's style may be pedestrian 45% of the time but his imagination is prime and occassionally utterly inspired.One thing I have not seen mentioned yet about Stone of Tears is how funny it can get. When Richard, the immovable object, is stuck in the palace of the gaggle of Sisters, some dark some light, his common sense is hilarious. Previously, Zedd carried all the humor of the series, but Richard is the better comedian. Them gals just don't know what they are in for.If you don't usually read books like this, try this series, it may truly change your mind. As long as you give it time to get under your skin. It ain't Gene Wolfe--- but let's face it, absolutely nothing else is either. And it's tons sexier than Tolkien."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"In \\"Wizard's First Rule,\\" we met Richard Rahl, a humble woodsguide. Or so he thinks, until he goes through a series of adventures, finally overthrowing the wicked Darken Rahl at the end of WFR.The fact that Richard is Darken's son through rape doesn't please Richard; worse, he's in love with Kahlan, the powerful Mother Confessor, and he wants to marry her. He's already proven his power vanquishes hers (well, enough so she won't take him over during the act of mating, as they'd both feared during book 1).But, because of politics, he's having trouble. To put it mildly.The strong points of the book were the relationship between Kahlan and Richard, whenever Zedd (aka Zeddicus Z'ul Zorander) shows up, and the fanatical loyalty of the remaining Mord-Sith. The weak points include the politics; too much time is spent on this aspect, in my opinion, getting in the way. Also, there are many hints and portents of things to come in following books, some of which do little to advance the action at this stage of the game.\\"Stone of Tears\\" is good, though; it's by far better than the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth books in the series, but still weaker than the first book. I hope Goodkind will find some way to return to the humanity and realism of the first two books soon, as the endless changes on the themes of politics, religion, and how they interrelate grew stale way before the middle of the third book."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"...but not in others. Stone of Tears is a little longer than Wizard's First Rule, which is fine, but at some points I felt like Terry Goodkind was just telling me too much. There were a lot of loooong scenes between Zedd and Adie that I just wanted to skip (which I didn't, but it took me longer to read because of it), and the separation between Richard and Kahlan was excruciating - they must have been gone from each other for at least 700 pages. But when all is said and done, there is one thing that makes this book irresistable: Gratch! The loveable fur ball formed such a bond with Richard that it was hard for me not to reach for a Kleenex every so often while reading. I think the scenes between Richard and Gratch are an indication of a good author - I actually would have been satisfied with a 1,000 page book on just the two of them! Still, despite its flaws, it's a fine sequal. It's for the most part interesting, and it has its share of intense and suspensful (and not to mention GORY) parts. If you liked Wizard's First Rule, you might as well continue with the series."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I am now on book 4, Temple of the Winds, and have enjoyed every one of them. I have never read books of this type before and have found them very compelling. One of the major things I enjoy is the continuity from one book to another. Twenty years hasn't gone by when you start the next book. I hope this holds true as I continue. I listen to books on tape because I drive for a living and these books have ALL held my interest with the constant action. I also like that while there are 2 main characters, there is becoming a wide range of supporting characters that are well defined. Unless the series takes a serious downfall I will read them all."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"First off, I'd like to say I'm tired of practically every reviews comparing Terry Goodkind's work to Robert Jordan's. Granted I've only read the 1st book in the WOT series, but even I can see major differences. Goodkind's books read much faster and keep me interested longer. I was able to grab hold of and enjoy learning about the characters in Goodkind's books and was eager to turn the pages to find out what happened next. I have no trouble look past the sado-eroticism and the sometimes extremely gruesome parts to get right down to the heart of the story."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Nice book. It has degrated little from the first of the series, Wizard's First Rule, but it still carries Goodkind's genuity. The only fault I could find was the sort of dropping off at the end. All the problems are solved within 50 pages and you don't get any more information on what happened to the imperial order. If the book continued to a longer length then it would earn the extra star. Some unexpected turns were taken and I was always craving to read more. The writing is good and fast paced but the map is indefinite at best. The writing truly is a great work and I hope it can be maintained in the next book's of the series which I am yet to read. If you read Wizard's First Rule, read this."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I like this one better than WFR. I don't enjoy the character development as much as the thorough 'creation' of a believable world and book 2 makes a giant leap in that compared to book 1. However, a lot is still in the shadows and needs explaining. For one thing, a glossary would help and a more detailed map. The magic stuff drives me crazy sometimes. When the author doesn't want to tell you how it works it seems as if he does not know or care himself. Here you need magic powder, here a waive of hand , here a spell, here just a thought. Magic in a sword, in a person, in a creature;creature of magic;a gift... Where's the system? What is the difference between a witch and a sorceress? Additive/Subtractive concept is often contradictory. Zedd built the boundaries and talks to his parents' spirits, but other than that knows naught about the veil or the underworld and does not have a hint of Subtractive. But, nonetheless, the book is exciting and well worth the lat night time spent on it."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I bought this book hoping that it would be as wonderful as the Jordan series from which this author borrows heavily. What is so disappointing is that this book is merely a detailed outline that the author has failed to embellish. What I got from Jordan's books, Kathryn Rusch's Fey series and George R. R. Martin's books were fully developed characters and plots. I was able to fully immerse myself in a new world and believe that world existed. Goodkind, while writing a good yarn, has failed to make the characters interesting, has failed to describe the countryside. I have no idea what sort of trees grow there, what the mountains look like, what clothing the people wear, what the native food tastes like. I am left with a one-dimensional story that while promising, should never have been released without the detail to make it come alive."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Unfortunately, Mr. Goodkind failed at the job of writting an interesting sequel. Though he made a mighty effort to bring the story back together at the end, it was like trying to recapture the ballons blown to the four winds. Dialoges were uninspiring, characters were imitation of book one. Gratch maybe is the only one with enough originality. But I wondered, did this gar have blood flies? Still, I would buy the third book, since it is not so thick therefore, less expensive."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I remember being absolutely obsessed with this series...even missed a couple nights sleep because they were so hard to put down. The first book (Wizard's First Rule) especially was mindblowing - fast paced, action filled and (seemingly) original.Soon afterwards, I went through a new phase...I hated the books with a passion. The plagiarism was terrible, the porno extremely uncalled for, and the plot was overly exaggerated.However, I have now reached a middle ground. There really are some amazing sections in the books - completely original and heartrending. As for the rest, if you haven't read the Wheel of Time series, you'll be fine - if you have, then try to be a little open-minded...I guess in these times, it's difficult to come up with a complete fantasy world without recycling other's works (although Robin Hobb managed it with ease).I rounded up my 3.5 to 4 starsgive it a go!"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Stone of Tears is the second novel in the sword of truth series, and while it is not quite as good as the first novel it is good enought to buy. Although it was a tid bit graphic, and i had to skim a few parts, this book goes a long way to explain later book and help develop the characters. There is so much information in this novel it's almost scary. You are so into reading it and finding out what happened that you don't even realize how much you've actually read."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I actually found Goodwind's second book quite dark in places with the rape/torture repeated themes, however overall the book was quite enjoyable. The similarities with Robert Jordan's wheel of time extend into almost every area of the plot. right down to the Sisters of light being on an Island, the warder type cloak, the term 'novice' etc etc etc however the great thing about Goodkind is that he wraps up most of the loose ends by the end of his books. This means the books can be enjoyed on their own, being a story in themselves. Overall I've enjoyed reading the series so far and plan to continue reading them all."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Terry Goodkind is a morbid sadist who can write extremly well. This kind of book is great for some poeple, but I can totally see others making little mews of distaste. I thought it was a good book, and loved Gratch, but some of it really is overdone. You are all acting like not loving this book is sacriligous, or that everyone who did like this book is some kind of heathen. Grow up! If you didn't like the book, you sure wouldn't have read all 900 pages. You wouldn't even have picked it up unless you liked WFR. Get a life!"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I have read many fantasy books, but it has been awhile since I have purchased a book that I just couldn't wait to get back to.I originally bought the book because of its size and the long flight I had waiting for me. I read through 1/2 of the book during that flight. Over the course of the next week, I went to that book whenever I had the chance. I took the book with me to places in hopes that I would have a chance to sneak in a couple of pages.I enjoyed the characters. Being the second book in the series and having never read the first, the characters were well developed and well utilized. The characters were pushed to the boundaries of the scope of their world. As they expanded, they did not give up their core, but found ways to integrate their new world with their known world. The introduction of peripheral characters were well placed. I enjoyed the fact that once the peripheral characters had finished their place in the story, they were not discarded, but brought back to flesh out the rest of the novel.Terry Goodkind filled the book with the right amount of harrowing experiences, mystery, humor, and a smattering of foreshadowing that made the book enjoyable and totally addicting. This is one that I will happily re-read for years to come."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"TOR (the publisher) has discovered yet another goldmine in Goodkind, but after reading this sequel I suspected Robert Jordan from the first. This is like Wheel of Time with SEX. It's good, but it's too similar to Wheel of Time...the &quot;Sisters of Light&quot;? Come on, I hear Aes Sedai coming, and they're not happy. Goodkind lives up to his name, but like the rest of his books, &quot;Stone of Tears&quot; is a suspicious mix of cliched TOR high fantasy and his own views.I prefer Goodkind.The whole violent-sex thing is so refreshing to me, even though Goodkind is right in your face. High fantasy adheres too rigidly to passive sexual relationships. Goodkind has read his Freud, and it's one of the few welcome elements of Stone of Tears. His character development is also good, although I personally am sick of rags-to-riches crap (see:Rand al'Thor). It's even more annoying if the main character is noble anyways, and he just needs to figure that out. It's just another formula that Goodkind follows.And what's with this Gratch thing? A little too smarmy for Rahl...I can only hope Goodkind finds his own voice, his own world, and quits following in Jordan's footsteps."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Everyone has always been extolling the Sword of Truth novels so I figured that I would read the books. However, I was shocked and dismayed to discover that this series is nothing more than a pale immitation of Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time. The similiarities go far beyond mere coincidence and often specific details are pathetically renamed. For example, Sisters of the Light = Aes Sedia, Sisters of the Dark=Black Ajah, Blood of the Fold=Whitecloaks, The Dream World=Tel'aran'rhiod (The World of Dreams), Rada Han = a'dam, Han=One Power (Even the process of reaching it is the same), and on and on the list goes. Yet there is more, Goodkind has also lifted a central element from Terry Brooks's novels namely the Sword of Truth=Sword of Shannara. Perhaps if Goodkind actually came up with an original idea instead of &quot;researching&quot; the works of his contemporaries, he could produce a true novel. I may even be able to overlook all of this blatent plagarism if the story was well written, but sadly Goodkind could not write realistic dialog if he tried. Honestly, the amount of repetition in his dialog is terrible and his characters have a tendancy to launch into continous diatribes about trivial matters. If you doubt me, pick a random passage in any of these novels where Richard or Kahlan speak and you will believe. Please do not buy these novels. I have read all of them up to book 4 and can honestly say that I gave them a chance. I urge everyone to read the true masters of fantasy: Robert Jordan, Tad Williams, and Terry Brooks."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"WHY YOU SHOULD READ THIS:If you're looking for a breather from important stuff and just want something \\"fun\\" to read, look no further. No reason that you must read Wizard's First Rule first, just buy this one and dive right in. It's quite self-contained. It has the advantage over the Wheel of Time books in that it is self-contained and does not take hundreds of pages reiterating prior events. For those people who delight in reading action-oriented tales in the vein of Dragonlance, early Shannara works, and others then this is a book in which you will delight.WHY YOU SHOULD PASS:There is quite a bit of violence here as well as a bit of sex. Nothing that kids won't find on the sci-fi channel, but the descriptions are rather more brutal than customary and give a flavor of realism that will give people pause. Maybe keep away from soft-hearted or very young children (maybe also away from children you've noticed tormenting small animals). If you are looking to read a book that will seriously change how you look at the world, pass. You will not find that kind of writing here.

It truly seems to be a &quot;love it or hate it&quot; kind of situation, with very little middle ground. About thirty minutes ago I finished reading &quot;Stone of Tears.&quot; I enjoyed the book. I do not, however, think that Terry Goodkind is very skilled in his use of the english language. His prose is flat, raw and terribly blunt. He often explains the plot as though here were speaking to a three-year-old child. Most annoyingly, the man has no sense of subtlety. Every part of the story is in-your-face; even the &quot;morals&quot; and his view of the &quot;good vs. evil&quot; dichotomy are hurtled at the reader like a bundle of bricks. You don't need to stop and think--he processes any possible &quot;deeper&quot; thoughts right there on the page before you (and there aren't very many). Yet, I still feel that Goodkind's work is exciting in that his story is highly involving--he may lack the writing skills of Herbert and the likes, but he does manage to weave an intense, engaging story. I like the characters, simple or not. I like finding out how they win in the end. It's like watching Robocop--you get swept away for awhile on a simple, thrilling ride. My advice is, just make sure to take a break from this series to read some fantasy that may stimulate your head a little more (like Donaldson)."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"This book reminds me of my high school book reports where I would rearrange the authors words just enough to keep it from being called plagiarism.

This was similiar to what happened in the first book (Wizard's First Rule) but Stone of Tears is a better book. It's more consistent and has a better pace to it.

In general it follows Richard and Kahlan, much as the first book, and was every bit as engaging and enjoyable a read. My only gripe is that the plot tends to be a bit formulaic, and really could have been lifted straight out of a \\"wheel of time\\" novel (the similarities are beginning to get suspicious actually). Richard gets a little preachy, Kahlan outright irritates at times, but it's got action, a pretty fast paced plot, and did I mention action?Worth a read if you enjoyed the first installment of the series, and fans of \\"the sword of truth\\" certainly won't be disappointed. A small cut below the best fantasy available, and what it lacks in some areas of plot development and characterization, it more than makes up for in enjoyability.

It is too bad because I sure would have enjoyed learning why his &quot;wife&quot; was needed to get through the towers. In the first book he was quite unsure of himself and this theme carried on into this book until he met the Spirit of Darken Raul.

Were it not for the Mord Sith scene being way too long and sappy, I would have given it 5 stars."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"In this book, the author expands on his main characters, Richard and Kahlan, plus brings new and interesing characters into the fold. 'Stone of Tears' is more engaging than 'First Rule.'This is a fantasy series that I have wholeheartedly embraced. So far, each of the two books are self-contained. Mr. Goodkind &quot;finishes&quot; each story without the cliffhanger ending, so you can enjoy each book on it's own merit. I eagerly anticipate the third book, &quot;Blood of the Fold&quot; and each book thereafter. If they are like the first two, and I believe they are even better, then this is a series I won't stop reading until I've read all the books back-to-back.Excellent. Outstanding read!"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"This is one of the best books I've read, the writing is intense and keeps you on the edge of your seat. This book like the rest of the sword of truth series is very good and if you liked robert jordons wheel of time series, or any of R.A. Salvators books, then this is a must read series."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Stone of Tears would have to be one of the best books I have ever read. It starts off where Wizard's First Rule left off, with Kahlan and Richard going to view Scarlet's Baby.This book has alot of twists and turns that are quite suprising at times, but I will not spoil them for you. Richard will befriend a beast that would normally kill him, Kahlan finds out a shocking truth, and Zedd finds Adie in trouble.I really must recommend this book if you like Fantasy books and have read Wizard's First Rule. Goodkind has a way of making the words leap off the page, in your face. It is as though you can actually picture the events that are unfolding before your eyes. Goodkind has a way with words that is absolutely marvellous. If you have not read this book, then you are missing out on a great read and I say to you: Stop reading this review and go out and buy the book you fool!"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"It is a great book and its sequals are great to."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Firts of all I Want to say that I haven't had the opportunity of reading the wizard's first rule but I can say by reading this book that this writter takes too much time trying o explain simple things but oposite this I like the way he leads his adveture because you don't know what's going to happend."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Kahlan is the heroine we would all like to be. Excellent rea"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"This is a good book to read if, and only if you can find nothing else that looks interesting. I do believe this book was a little better than his first, but his story is so predictable--especially since I've already read most of it in other series written by better authors (Robert Jordan for example). Goodkind's characters still get on my nerves too. Especially Richard and Kahlan's annoying behavior. When real life people are in love, they are nowhere near as sappy as Goodkind makes those two characters. It makes me want to puke. But still, if you've already read all of Jordan or whoever is your favorite author's work, but have nothing else to read until their next story comes out, then this book works just fine as a time fille"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"It could be argued that deep, involved plots are the surest way to lose your audience. Certainly, this was what happened whenever I picked up the newest Tolkien release. Whew, talk about complex!! But Terry Goodkind changed all that for me. His subtle intermixing of intense character development, deep emotional suffering, and occasional comic surprises hooked me like no fantasy novel has ever done before. The main character's persona seems to leap from the page and project itself directly to the &quot;adventure center&quot; of the mind, where it springs to life in a blaze of light and glory. The relationships in the book were well developed and realistic in a way that I've never seen before. I found them, and the book, to be a refreshing change from the humdrum worlds wrought by everyday fantasy artists. Indeed, this latest book in Goodkind's &quot;Sword of Truth&quot; series brings me to a point far from the tears espoused by the title, unless you can count tears of joy"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"This is the book where the Sword of Truth begins its downfall. Wizard's First Rule had its faults, but it was still an enjoyable read.In Stone of Tears, however, Goodkind appears to have (already) run out of ideas, so he takes them from another author, Robert Jordan. Anyone who's read the Wheel of Time will notice the similarities. Sisters of the Light = Aes Sedai, Sisters of the Dark = black ajah, Palace of the Prophets = White Tower, rada'han = a'dam. In one case, blademaster, Goodkind doesn't even bother coming up with a new name. Even the book's name, Stone of Tears, most likely comes from Jordan's universe. With so many similarites, Goodkind's explanation that he doesn't read other fantasy and his reference to \\"common themes\\" ring hollow.And then there's the lack of realism, most notably in 5,000 naked boys attacking an army of 50,000 in winter - and winning. Someone should tell Goodkind about hypothermia. Also, why didn't the army of 50,000 bother posting sentries? Oh, right, they were all busy getting drunk. In the middle of a hostile land.Oh, do you remember Wizard's First Rule's bad guy, Darken Rahl? It turns out he wasn't the ultimate bad guy, but a minion of an even stronger bad guy named the Keeper. This is mentioned nowhere in book 1, further proof that Goodkind hadn't intended Wizard's First Rule to be the first of a series.Still, there are a few good points. Unlike so many other fantasy authors, Goodkind doesn't hesitate to show us blood, gore, rape and similar themes."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"This series is one of the worst that I have ever read.This is mainly because of the repetition and out right stealing of the books. What do i mean by stealing? Just that, this book has taken plot elements and other things from Jordan's tepid Wheel of Time series. Take the main character is a man with a &quot;gift&quot; of magic that will drive him insane, unless he trains it, the group that trains him put a collar that controls his &quot;gift&quot; (the seanchen from WOT) and besides that, that group is a group of women who study and such and tend to act like the Aeis Sedai.On top of all this, the disturbing quality and violence of this series starts to get so insane as to make it sickening.In the end there's nothing for me to suggest this book for one to read, while the first book was okay, and had some great scenes in it (but still was stealing from Tolkien and Jordan amoung many others), this book is just plain horrible, go read something good instead of wasting your time with this horrid book."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Goodkind is a fraud!!!! I read the first book and hated the first three quarters, then the last quarter caught my interest. I then decided to buy the next book, and was thoroughly dissapointed. The main character Richard is a Jesus like character that can do no wrong. He is the god of every tribe he comes into contact with, he is the main focus of every prophesy ever written, he can do just about everything better than everyone else in the book. The dialogue is also very childish. I really would like the time I spent reading this garbage BACK!!!!!"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"A friend loaned me this book because I loved Eragon, Elder and Brisinger.

There is no comparing Paolini and Goodkind. Goodkind reeks."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"In my opinion Stone of Tears is one of the best books I've read since Harry Potter, and it is easily better in my own opinion. Still, I do not understand why so many people are more interested in Harry Potter, perhaps though, it's just because most people don't find this book commonly.This book is based around middle ages, but it is really hard to tell. A summary would be to say that a great Underworld overlord called the Keeper is trying to get out and take over the mortal world. The stone that can keep him from doing this though, is on a young girl. The two main characters, Kahlan, the Mother Confessor, and Richard, the Seeker and War Mage, are separated. And their nemesis, Darken Rahl, or Richard's biological father, has come back from the Underworld and is trying to help the keeper get out, with the help of the Imperial Legion.In the end, the two main characters are re-united, and the world is once again safe from the Keeper."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"The entire series is the best I have ever read.

Both books move at a lightening pace and there are surprises at every turn. The characters are flesh and blood and not some cardboard cutouts that seem to plague most books. You really feel for Richard and the rest of the gang as they go on their separate journeys. I will warn you though,these books are dark,with a surprising amount of graphic violence and sexuality,they are not for children. Surprisingly the darkness of the books actually works,it does not repulse as one might imagine but adds to the story and the ultimate &quot;light&quot; it lends to the characters at the end. If you are considering starting this series by all means do so. It is well worth your time. Looking forward to reading Blood Of The Fold,which I have just purchased. Keep them coming Mr Goodkind!"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I didn't really like the first volume of this series, and vol. 2 ain't a masterpiece either, but I would regard it as a better than average read anyway. Even if the plot seemed to drag a little bit at first, it sped up towards the end and the last 200 pages or so were very entertaining, especially the parts about Richard in the Palace. Another good thing was the lack of overly detailed torture scenes that partially spoiled the first book.Faults? There's a little too many ideas copied straight from Jordan. And if the 3rd volume contains an even more epic plotline... well, I just hope it won't. Still, could have been worse."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I'm on page 853 of this book and just realized a new &quot;skill&quot; I've acquired: speed reading.With Terry's books (I finished &quot;Wizard's First Rule&quot; before diving straight into this one) I've found something that for the first time I've liked even better than Tolkien: his reflection and understanding of how we Humans think. As far as I'm concerned, he's the &quot;Wizard's Machievelli&quot; of fantasy fiction.These books go on my top ten list, right up there with Joseph Campbell."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Terry Goodkind has you once again, wishing you could read faster and get to the climax of his second novel in the Richard Cypher saga. However this time he takes 970 pages to weave an intricate tale of riddles and mystery only to resolve all the unknown in a mere 10 pages. I could not believe where he was at in the story with only 25 pages to go. This book could have eaisly been another 500 pages. Terry seems to have an obsession with women dominating men by the use of a collar. This is the second novel where it is the underlying theme of the book. This sequel cannot even compare to the first.

He must defeat countless skilled warriors, so his sword just &quot;happens&quot; to bestow upon him the collective skill of all its wielders? This is not plotting, this is plodding.

Everthing published by Terry Brooks (Shanarra series), Raymond Feist, David Eddings (Mallorian and Belgariad series), Robert Jordan (Wheel of Time series), Even the series about the guy with the white gold ring Don't remember author White Gold weilder (it was not very good) and others. Terry's books are awesome! I read strictly for the enjoyment and the wonder of being lost in a magical world. Terry's books do this wonderfully. For those that would claim that it is a copy of WOT series (Wheel of Time), both series have similarities but BOTH series are worth the money even in hard back. Terry has said that he doesn't read other fantasy stuff, so any similarities are coincidental. I have very disriminating taste, and Terry's series is one of the best I have read. My favorites are Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series, David Eddings series (Belgariad and Mallorian) and Terry's Sword of Truth series. For those of you reading this revie! w to decide whether or not to buy this series... Ignore the \\"Oh my God, you should burn those books,picket TOR publishing, write your congressman, go on a fast, shout to the top of your lungs curse words because it is too much like Robert Jordans books\\" ...

This book, like the first, is just fantastic. He has some wonderful characters and a great storyline to start off with, and develops both nicely throughout."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Terry Goodkind has done it again with Stone of Tears -- he's written a lopsided, badly characterized, overly plagiaristic piece of trash. I don't recommend this book -- I laugh at it.Goodkind has no sense of the ridiculous. The ideas and concepts that he gives the most weight and significance in this story and in the first (&quot;The Book of Counted Shadows,&quot; the length of a woman's hair, 'the target comes to you,' etc.) are all the most ridiculous. Some of them would have been okay if they had been handled better, but Goodkind has no finesse, no delicacy: he bludgeons his writing instead of trying to sculpt or craft it.The characters in &quot;Stone of Tears&quot; are all awkward and two-dimensional. They do strange things without sufficient motivation: I get the idea that they were all abused as children. Richard is a good example. At times he acts rationally, even level-headedly, but at others, he rushes around without thinking. The way he gave into the Sisters without asking enough questions and without contacting Zedd is bad enough, but when he threw everything out the window to rescue Du Chaillu I decided that he must be deeply disturbed. The &quot;Blood of the Folders&quot; are, of course, Robert Jordan's Whitecloaks redone, but their hate and KKK-like actions are not believable with the explanations Goodkind gives us.Taking inspiration from another author is okay, but Goodkind lifts whole ideas and tries to bend them to fit his plot. Instead of completely rewriting them or (gasp) thinking up his own ideas, he cuts and pastes, leaving his readers the impression of a patchwork quilt.Goodkind isn't really a bad author; when he thinks up an idea and runs with it he can be pretty inventive. The problem is he doesn't do it nearly enough. Maybe in ten years, if he's still writing, his books will be worth reading, but right now they should be treated like a very good example of &quot;how not to write a fantasy epic.&quot;"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Not as tightly written or plotted as the first book, which is a real shame considering the author is writing a third"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"If you are looking for a way to kill a few days reading an below par book then this is the one to get. This author does his best to drag out a book that should be no long than 400-500 pages into one almost 1000. He does so by repeating lines of characters over and over, adding in openings for future books, and constantly describing Richard and Kahlan's feelings for each other.These books have the weakest plot line I have ever seen and left me with a bad taste in my mouth for wasting the 12hrs it took to read. The author seemed to focus more on side plots in order for him to write even more crappy books than on actually getting to the point and finishing this one.Dont read these books. Instead look into George R.R. Martin."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"This is a great fantasy series that any intelligent reader who likes the genre must read. Wizard's first rule was and still is one of my favorite books of all time. But, Goodkind excelled even further with his writing of the sequel. As a series the story slows down a little after book four but it still is worth the read and I find myself anxiously awaiting each subsequent book. I have recommended this series to all my friends and have not found one yet who didnt enjoy it or who wasn't addicted from the start. Most of the negative reviews talk about how cliche some of the themes are (good vs. evil, etc.) but that is what makes us watch a movie or read anything right? Seeing good triumph over absolute evil is always an uplifting feeling that we as a race can never get enough of in any aspect. Goodkind introduces new ways to replay similar themes (mord-sith, confessors, gars, mriswriths, dream walkers, prophets) with each gifted person he throws you a new and interesting twist in the typical stereotype of that kind of character. Don't let all this negative reviews fool an intelligent reader. Terry brooks, and Tolkien bored me at times where as Goodkind kept me up late reading until I couldnt keep my eyes open any longer, anxiously awaiting what was going to happen next. I have grown attached to the characters , feel for what happens to them and what they have to go through and have enen shedded a tear over many of the tragedies that occur. The one thing I love about the series is how it mimics life so well. The characters interact like real people even though many of them have extrordinary abilities. And most of all , even though good usually triumphs , like life, there is no happily ever after, you just move on to the next problem and look for a solution. There is always something to fix or correct, life is not picture perfect and once you solve one problem , not too long afterward something else comes along that you must attend to if you are going to survive. Excellent series that I truly recommend to any reader. If nothing else read the first four books (without a doubt the best in the series so far). IF you give Goodkind a chance you will not regreat it and if you are an open-minded intelligent reader will be hooked as have many of his fans have been for many years."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"This book was horrible. I'd say it's even worse than the first book, but that's pointless. Goodkind doesn't have a single original thing in this book-- characters, plot twists, bad guys. The violence is just too much to be believed, the writing is the worst I've ever read, and the plot... well, that is even worse than his previous novel. I'm still hitting myself over the head for making myself READ this."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Goodkind is balderdash. Aside from not having anyideas of his own, he can't write fit for s**t.Nor can he plot, nor can be build characters.

It is entirely lacking in chapter placemarks, and an entire section of text that belongs just before chapter 65 is instead placed at the very end of the Kindle edition. The lack of chapter markers are hardly a significant bother, and the section of misplaced text is not a terribly important segment."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I've read many a book, but none reach me like this series has. The entire Sword of Truth series, sets a pretty high standard for epic fantasy, let along a good book series. Early books had some places that were a bit clunky, (it was the authors first books if I'm not mistaken), but don't we ALL start out something a bit green, and then hone our skills?The more books by Goodkind you read, you clearly see the excellent progress he's made in his craft. Goodkind does what so few fantasy authors do, that being have true heroes, heroes who use reason, heroes who do not become the enemy or become cowards and most important, heroes that stand up for what is honorable and true. And heroes that do not sacrifice their values to accomplish their goals.You will not see nasty words, vulgarity, incest (unlike some series), porno, or any kind of depravity in the name of literature. This series touches on some violence and deals with real world issues like war and the true horrors of war. It exposes evil for what it is and it shows that mankind can rise up and be truly noble!While I see there are a few people who want to vote poorly and post negative comments, it is your right. But when you post such acerbic comments, it is easy to see that you simply think it funny. Like anyone would take your petty comments as anything but jealousy and immaturity.While this series has its merits, it has its problems as well. No book will have everything to speak to every person.This series starts in easy, and right away you grasp the wonderful story telling ability of Goodkind, and as you go on, it delves deeper into the nature of man. This series explores deep human themes and exposes the fallacy of collectivism.This book has a striking romantic aspect as well as plenty of heart wrenching twists. While I personally love the philosophy, I can see why some may not. That (IOHP), is why we have arena such as this, so that we can offer up likes and dislikes. Most who do that have offered up an HONEST review. The rest simply are offering up vitriol, because they fear this series for the good that it does and they fear it because they feel it a threat to their favorite author.BE HONEST, give the book its due.Support your book stores! Support the Publishing world, and for goodness sake buy a book so we can drive these whacked out \\"save the rain forest\\" freaks crazy by cutting down a few more trees!"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I made it through Wizard's First Rule and rather liked it and sought to continue in the series. The first book was often slow and tried to avoid arriving at any conclusion to any matter, but the story and the chacacters interested me greatly, so I moved on rather quickly.Stone of Tears, the second installment of the series was an obvious choice for my next read. Alas, it presently sits half read in a box as I wait for a point in my life so boring as to make me want to finish the book. If it weren't for the fact that I was involved enough in the story to not want to toss the book entirely, it would likely have been given a mere 1 star.Goodkind has a wonderful imagination, and I don't doubt that some people will find his writing style energizing, and others just love the characters enough that they'll embark on the epic journey of reading this novels to share in some of the pain that their beloved characters endure. When I some day finish this novel I would probably give the third installment a try as there have certainly been interesting moments in the tale Goodkind weaves.Unfortunately, these stories lack urgency and as a result are not compelling."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I'm up to part 5 right now, but looking back, I can say that Stone of Tears was probably the best. The first one was alright, but didn't break any new ground for me. When I got around to reading this one, it blew me away! The book is epic in scope and the plot is exciting. The end seemed a little rushed, but the rest of the book is so good, I still recommend it. Richard is the man!"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Stone of Tears, Terry Goodkind's 2nd installment in his Sword of Truth series, was a fairly good book although Wizard's First Rule was better. While Goodkind's writing style has matured quite a bit since his debut, Wizard's First Rule, he has sacrificed the constant action that made book 1 so exciting. The plot is deeper, but moves at a snails pace for most of the book. As many others have said before, it picks up dramatically towards the end, perhaps too much. The novel is highly inconsistent to this end. However the storyline still held my interest despite all these flaws. I found it to be a decent book worth your reading if you have nothing better to read at the time."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"This is an excellent book. It is very well written and the story pulls you in. The only trouble with this book is that there are an overwhelming number of typos. Every single instance of 'than' is replaced with 'that'. Incorrect usage of a/an is common and extra or missing words are on almost every single page. It is incredibly jarring to be reading and encounter a few (1-5) typos per book. This is unacceptable. The only reason I gave two stars was because it is otherwise very well written."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I truely enjoyed this book.

I love Richard and Kahlan and can't get enough of them!"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"TG blatantly stole from WOT. The example are legion. To begin with, there is the striking similarity between female wielders of power, the Aes Sedai and the Sisters of the Light. Plus, each has a dark, secret sect amongst them: Black Ajah vs. Sisters of the Dark. There is also the fact that male users of the power suffer and eventually die if they don't find ways to get their power under control. Add to this, Stone of Tear vs. Stone of Tears, the use of collars to subdue magic use, Caracarn vs. Caharan, sword forms used by blade wielders, ageless female users of the Power, etc. Oh, and don't forget Children of the Light vs. Blood of the Fold.It is actually patent and obvious when you look at publication dates that Goodkind ripped off many concepts and terms from Jordan, nearly whole cloth."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"The story is not as well weaved and reads somewhat like a romance novel...where the last story left off with the hero more confident he is plunged for most of the book into tired whining about relationship issues. Instead of wasting time with the author should have connected all the sub-story lines together. I am undecided if I will read more in this series."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"4.5 stars. This book was much different than the first for me. In the first book, I was struggling to feel Richard's inner struggle with his new role as Seeker and hero. However in this book, I felt his conflict much more intensely which I liked. In the first book, Richard was a little to nieve for me but in this book I felt he was more mature and had grown as a character.When I picked this book up, I didn't expect it to be as long as it was (900+). The first book was roughly 500 pages so this was a huge jump in length but I thought it was appropriate because a lot happens in this book. The length didn't bother me but it did take me a while to get through.Overall this book had a decidedly darker feel to it. It was more about self acceptance and then of course the character conflicts and their inner struggles were interesting and complex. A enjoyable read for sure!See my full review here: [...]"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I really wish that there were half stars on Goodreads but alas, there isn't. So instead of two and a half, I gave this book three stars. I'm really torn about it though, I don't think it's on the same caliber of many of the other books that I gave three stars. Only the fact that the story was interesting bumped it up that little bit extra.The overall story was what moved my rating but there were several finer points about the writing that I didn't like. This story is pretty interesting, as was the first book of this series, but in a lot of ways it feels contrived or \\"borrowed\\" from other series. I found a lot of similarities with The Wheel of Time in several places throughout the story which quite annoyed me. I don't want to read a story I've already read. Nor do I want to feel like the story is being moved on just for the sake of being moved on. If there's no natural flow, it feels fake and to me this book felt that way.Additionally, there were several flaws in the writing that I found frustrating for a writer who has attained the level of fame that Goodkind has. The one that mainly sticks out to me is that there is a point in this story where Khalan is riding a horse through a crowded war camp. Not only is she able to pull a sword from a sheath at full gallop, but she is able to use it to amazing efficiency on horseback. But that's not bad enough. I can believe that adrenaline does that to people but what I can't believe is that a warhorse, running at a full out gallop rips tent stakes from the ground with his legs. Horses legs are the most fragile part of their bodies; if you ran a horse, even a heavy war horse, through ropes like that, it would likely snap his legs. The rope wouldn't give way. If the stakes were pulled out of the ground, they would have wrapped around his legs and tripped him at best or punctured his sides at worse. Common sense doesn't need to be abandoned to write fantasy.Again, Goodkind feels the need to push his views onto the reader. There are some that I agree with but at the same time it is poor writing to be so obvious with your views. It detracts from the story when it becomes a social narrative. Deep metaphors work far better than a surface veneer over an issue.On that same note, he constantly talks about how Richard is this wonderful, gentle character when in reality he is a pretty much an arrogant jerk throughout this entire novel. Several times, he berates characters for their religious beliefs (the Mud People, the Bantak, the Sisters of Light). The funny thing is that he talks about how narrow minded the Sisters of Light are. It's ironic that he talks about how narrow minded they are without ever noticing his own hypocrisy. That is far from a gentle, loving, wonderful character that he is portrayed as.There are characters who act completely out of character for themselves or who change their minds suddenly about something. I found more problems than things to praise in this book. Again, there are far better epic series out there."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I love The Sword of Truth Series and this book is absolutely wonderful! This second installment is a little hard to get through since it is so long.I got the Kindle version of it, and my rating is for four stars because there were multiple little errors in the Kindle version (such as missing quotation marks, or missing letters on the ends of words)."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"The book was every bit as good as the other Sword of Truth series I've read. Mr. Goodkind's carictures are crisp, detailed and vibrent. The action is very believible and well written. His backgrounds and seenery are very realiistic. I like how each book has it's own storyline. Yet, the story flows into the next book so readily. I am now trying to read each one of his stories."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"great story, nice plot, superb characters and wonderfully annoying typos. its seriously so annoying it takes away from the story. i dont think you are supposed start a new paragraph every line."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Good God and there are six more? When I signed up for the Sci-Fi book club several years ago I received the first four books in the Sword of Truth series. The Sci-Fi book club just raved about them being the next great epic fantasy to rival Tolkien. I should have remembered that job one of the book club is to SELL books. Letting it's potential members know their selections were coma inducing would not have been good for business. I managed to get through the first book and since I had the nect three I figured I should read them. Well, the second was as far as I got and I ended up trading them all in at a used book store without ever opening up books three and four.To Briefly summarize, Richard and Kahlan, easily the most lackluster characters to ever see print in a fantasy, are back. Richard is having trouble controling his powers and is getting bad headaches (although I bet they were nothing compared to the ones I got trying to get through this). The Sisters of Light, a Quasi-Religious group of fanatics who train wizards offer to help. Well, not really offer, more or less force themselve on Richard. Meanwhile Kahlan is off to the Council of the Midlands, dodging all sorts of trouble along the way including a prophecy that she must be executed.And thus the bulk of the tale becomes these separate, long, ponderous Journies with a lot of muck about prophesies. Goodkind certainly loves to see his words in print that's for sure. Never was so many pages spent accomplishing so little. I didn't care much for the characters in the first book but now I basically despise both of them.The only way I would recommend this book is if you have a sleep disorder...or need a good paperweight."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"The only thing worst than reading Stone of Tears is reading these reviews! Someone actually reviewed this book as &quot;long but worthwhile!&quot; Great! Terry Goodkind fans are people with the attention span of gnats who need D'Haran soldiers cutting open small boys and raping their livers to keep their attention for more than three pages! Terry Goodkind should be the public relations advisor to Saddam Hussein.Oh! The characters... Big handsome good guy! Cute little good girl! Perverted, sinister bad guys! Terry makes Dr. Seuss look like deep reading. Actually, I don't think most Goodkind fans could get through an entire book by Dr. Seuss without wandering off and raping their sisters or something."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"This novel is utter and complete garbage. After 600 pages of wading through waist-high piles of raped corpses, I wanted the Keeper of the Underworld to destroy everything just to make it stop. The story drags through the death and destruction until the very end where everything is suddenly resolved in slam-bang fiesta of Spielburgian special effects and the book is over before you figure out what happened. The subplot with the conflict between the Ai'Sedai... I mean Sisters of the Light and Dark was briefly interesting, but the rampaging stupidity of the Sisters of the Light had me rooting for the Dark."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"The rating for this book is for the Kindle version only.

Imagine my suprise when I picked up this novel expecting another smash hit and instead got Jordan re-runs! Every detail matches Jordan's books but with different names, especially the final sequence with the dark sisters-almost word for word with a specific part in the Wheel of Time books. I can't believe that there isn't a lawsuit in progress over this. I have never been so disappointed in my life. This series started out very strong and then this. What a waste of good talent. People...read Robert Jordan-at least his characters are powerful, beautifully written and ORIGINAL."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Stone of Tears is the best book in the best series I have ever read. It is the perfect match to WFR. Everything is done in the way that something actually would be done, by real people living in that setting. A whole new dimension is added to the series, the best start possible to the story arc of the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"First off, I would begin by saying this is a good fantasy book for those who love the genre (as I do). Second, I'd like to quickly address the copycat issue regarding Wheel Of Time: if you dig deep enough you will always find similarities between 2 stories especially when they dwell upon the same genre, however unless you happen to be in the head of the author (or unless the author confesses) you can never know which idea was consciously stolen or borrowed or which ones just happen to be in another book.However what interests me more in this book is the fashion with wich Goodkind ignores all logic. For instance take Kalhan. Unless you tell me that confessors have super-human agility and strength Kalhan makes no sense at all.First why would you need 4 man to kill a confessor when just one arrow would do the job. In the first episode they even say that Kalhan could easily evade a sword thrust by a Quad (swordman expert I presume) and then advance close enough to touch him before he can swing again... Wow !!! In SOT Kalhan also leads troops in battle, however not only does she plans the battles (which is quite possible) but she's also a front soldier in all of them (and when I say front I mean she's the first one out there)... She seems to thrive in the middle when surrounding by dozens of elite swordmen and she never gets cut. She goes on solo suicide mission and then come back victorious (after dispaching the ennmy by the hundreds... Unless she's got superhuman combat abilities that's quite the little soldier she is (No amount of training could yield such results)!! On another matter, Kalhan also like to kill her victims AFTER she's taken them with her power... Correct me if I am wrong, but once somebody's been taken by a Confessor, their personality is dead no ? All that remains is an able body 100% faithfull and dedicated to the Confessor... So why kill them ? That would make sense if the Confessor's magic was reversible... But it's not... In my opinion that's the beauty of the Confessor's magic. It's definitive, unlike every other magic I've ever read about where there's always a counter spell or a mean to reverse it etc.In my opinion, the way I see her, Kalhan should remain well beyond ennemy fire(at camp pref) and control the battle from there with her military mind. Plus when they capture an ennemy alive she should take him with her power, debrief him for information on the ennemy (plan, location etc) and then send him in the ennemy camp as a spy (with order to bring back a commanding officer for instance). Sooner or later she'll have her own army inside the ennemies army, and with the 100% reliable info gathered by her 'conquest' she can devise even more deadly military plans... Not to mention that if she 'gets her hands' on a high ranking officer she can the use him to give false orders and such... Plus, by keeping everybody she takes(the guilty I mean, not the ones like Brophy) with her Confessor's power she will rapidly have her own bodyguards (and none other will ever be more dedicated to her safety and no 4 quads will be able to squeeze through that!!)That's the biggest logical flaw in Goodkind's story but not the only one.However as I said in the beginning, this is a good book because it's a fantasy book, and the defining traits of fantasy is certainly not logic... So for those who don't ask too many questions, this is your kind of book. For the others (like me) why don't you just go read a mathematic essai or go debug a software code or the like ;-)"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Guess old Terry didn't learn his lessonwith the first book: he can't write as wellas a monkey could in his position.

Love the series, but the mistakes in the Kindle version really take away from the enjoyment when reading it.I honestly have no idea what rating to give this!

Comprised of intense and emotional violence, extreme and tantalizing magic and fantasy as well as thick, heated feelings and love as well as hate. I am a writer myself and I have been inspired by this book as well as all the rest of the books. The author, Terry Goodkind, has a gift unlike any other. He has the ability, magic within itself, to produce words and images on paper that seem to engulf you within the book and send you into a vortex that takes you to a new world where your thoughts are limited only by the amount of pages and the amount of imagination you have. In all aspects, this is a book for any fantasy loving reader..."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I am a fan of Terry Goodkind and all his wonderful books, I was eager to review his work, hoping to encourage future would be readers to get themselves a copy. However I was most dismayed when I found other reviews were not so glowing.Reviewers who have offered their own opinions about the Sword of Truth series, have been cut to pieces personally, targets because another person did not agree with what another has written. Whether for or against the series, I feel that reviews should be limited to the book concerned and not with the person writing the review, we are all intitled to our own opinion.So to end on a positive note I Loved Stone of Tears, sharing the experience of following Richard and Kahlan through their many adventures, triumphs and tragedies, my favourite character would have to be Gratch, wish I had a Gar. Get a copy whether you buy or borrow it, READ STONE OF TEARS and make up your own mind! ENJOY!"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I highly disagree with most of the negative comments on the review page. I, personally didnt find either of them dull at all. In fact I had difficulty putting them down ((and that is coming from someone who could not finish the Return of the King because it became so tedious...of course I have grown quite a bid since I read that:being in elementary school at the time I read it)) I also disagree with the comment that it is too similar to the Wheel of Time books, I have read to book four in that series and they are only slightly similar. (Really, how diferent do you want them to be? There's not all that much you can do with this genre, and the human imagination is not as good as we would believe it to be)I liked these books because of their similarity to real life. (Obviously without the magic, Keeper and etc) Everything isnt all good, and there are problems that don't look like they will be solved...because not all problems are...Not everything is perfect. The gruesome detail added to this, though it was often disturbing. Also, it showed alot of the greed of the human race, and what people will do to gain power.One thing that I didnt see others mention is that some the characters were slightly one dimensional, not in their personalities (which were well develloped), but in the fact that they were either good or evil. There were none in between. Even Harry Potter books have in between characters.In conclusion, it was a very good book and I am eagerly awaiting the opening of the library so that I can get my hands on the next book."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I want to start this out by saying that I have been a fan of fantasy for the past 20 years and started out with the Tolkien and Terry Brooks novels. I have read the WOT by Jordan (all 9 volumes) and I am not easy to please.I want to address some of the plagurism issues that have been brought up. I wholeheartedly agree that many of the associations between Goodkind and Jordan have been made by Mr. Goodkind, but how many other authors have used the concepts of J.R.R. Tolkien's works.I beleive Mr. Goodkind to be a blend between Jordan - because of his ability to spend some time on details and then to bring the cataclysm in a speedier fashion; and Terry Brooks - for the manner in which he can spin a tale.As opposed to lovers of Robert Jordan, Goodkind's books only seem to get better. SOT is a wonderful book that I found the story line to be very emotional and with a few twists that keep me wanting to go on. SOT is another step in the tale of Richard Rahl and there are many other characters being introduced.Try not to look at this as a Jordan purist or we can all make references to Tolkien from Jordan.

His father had told him that he would read it before he went away, beyond the enclosure, never to return. His father had taught him many things. How to make akward, declarative sentances. How to kill with violence, when nescessary. When it was good.Nooly watched Ronald looking at the book. He looked to be interested in it, but is face was frowning. He looked to be thinking about something. Nooly loved Ronald. She had thought for days about how much she cared about him, and had imagined spending dusky evenings eating beans with him while the sun was in the sky. He was a good man. As good as any man she ever knew.Suddenly, there was a sound in the air. Something happened. Ronald ducked down. Nooly saw him duck. She thought to herself about all of the danger she had ever seen. She realized that a dangerous thing might be above her. She ducked down low, lower even than Ronald. Nearby, a Dirt Person was trying pitifully to scratch out a living in the dirt with primitive, quaint tools. The dangerous thing was on top of the dirt person. The thing cut off the dirt person's hand. Blood was everywhere. The hand was lying in a crimson pool of red blood.Ronald opened the book. He was the strongest, best person in a five-mile radius. Nooly nervously watched him as blood from the dirt person sprayed everywhere.Ronald put down the book. \\"I've read this book before. It was not a good book to read. The author was like one of the dirt people. He didn't know about how to build proper indoor plumbing. But I loved the book anyway.

Each must undergo a perilous journey: Richard through the Wilds and beyond the great barrier into the Old World, a vast land beyond the three introduced in the first book; and Kahlan northward to Aydindril, through the harsh winter climate of the Midlands with a Mud-People escort, to seek the help of First Wizard Zeddicus Z'ul Zorander.While Richard's is the more essential for advancing the plot of the series as a whole, this is really Kahlan's story. We finally get to see the Mother Confessor in action, as she confronts vast armies against impossible odds, and scheming politicians at home. Her journey and fate are breathtaking and moving.If you liked the first book in this excellent series, you will love the second."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Goodkind seems to have solved some of the kinks in found in the first book of the series in Stone of Tears.

But I thought, hey, there's 9 of these, gotta be good somewhere right? Well, this one was better. The world feels a bit more real (still tackily fake sometimes) and the ideas and characters are more interesting. The plot was alright, a bit deus ex machinistic to me. You absolutely know that when a character says something about certain kind of wizards, and no one's touched it in thousands of years, where it's going from there. Here's the big problem though. Writing style. Perfect grammar might be nice for English majors, but in entertainment value writing it is not. It sounds dead, forced, whatever. But when every single character has perfect grammar you wonder. It makes the dialogue, well, laughable. I don't remember laughing quite like I did for the first one, but there were moments. But like my title says, it is better than the first one, and was enough to keep me into the next one at least. I hate dropping a story in the middle, so I rarely do unless it seriously kills me. So we get to see."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Returning from the first book, The veil holding back the Keeper is torn, and Richard and Khalan have to split up in order to figure out how to save the world. Richard is taken away to the Sisters of the Light to be taught about how to control his wizard power in order to keep from dying, only to find out that it would take hundreds of years to do so at the Palace surrounded by a magic that lengthens life. He's gotta figure out a way to get out of that situation in time to save the world from Darken Raul's spirit and be with Khalan again. Khalan on the other hand is planning to reunite the Midlands by way of force against a new threat known as the Imperial Order. And with all of that, again, another prophecy is in the way of their plans.Probably one of my faves, although it's hard for me to dislike any of them. It has plenty of fighting, adventure, suspense, and character development. There are a couple more twists I found in this book than the last, so it kept me more glued. The only parts of the book that I had to force myself through were when it gets to talking about Zedd and Adie, but I know it is necessary and it wasn't so bad (i just got so into what was happening to the others).The only gripe i got is the decription of how Sisters of the Light became true Sisters of the Dark. I'm not much of a reader for sexual scenes such as that, but it was kinda original (unless other fantasy books had creatures from the underworld have sex with women in order to give the women greater power). I don't know if I'd want my mom to read this book, although I got her into the first...maybe she can handle it better than I. She DOES read those romance novels, and I could only imagine what was in them.We're introduced to a couple new characters like Ann, Nathan, Verna, Chaundlan(sp?), and Warren, who do more in the next books. There were a few minor characters that I wished would have expanded even more in this, but maybe the ones I'm thinking will in future books.Prophecies seem to be a major part of \\"The Sword of Truth\\" series, but it would be hard to make a big deal bout them in one book, and take them out in another. The good thing about these prophecies is that they are somewhat true, but not literally true all of the time, and hopefully I get caught off guard every time.The action is awesome, even if it was a small army of naked soldiers painted white against a large army of drunken, handicapped (not mentally, but if u read it u'll realize the handicaps involved) warriors. Khalan has got to be the greatest woman in a book to know: she's a beautiful, kind woman and a great battle strategist (what more could you ask for?).I basically loved this book, and the whole series overall. Another re-adding of great story-telling done by Terry Goodkind. I thank him for having me spend most of my days reading his books while I have had homework to do.

More time is devoted to character and emotional developement, and while much of it is heavy handed, at least there's an effort. The plot flows better, and is slightly less predictible. There are actually a couple subplots. Unfortunately, Goodkind slipped up here too. The root of the books problems is Richard. Before I found him dull. Now I find him far too perfect. It's not just physical prowess, though he has that in spades (defeating thirty blademasters without a scratch, yeah right), but his &quot;wisdom&quot;. When did Richard become Zedd? And if he knows so much, how can he be so blind to what's happening with Kalahn? It should have been painfully obvious to anyone, especially when Verna explicitly told him what had happened. The plot also drags at times, and the second wizzard's rule is worse than the first. He might as well have said &quot;The road to the underworld is paved with good intentions.&quot; The ending is rushed, and wrapped up way too neatly and predictably.Oh yeah, and Gratch really got on my nerves."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"This is a very long series - 12 books I think, But I can't put them down.

And, fortunately, Goodkind covers so much ground and we get a big chunk of resolution. Of course, he does set us up with two new challenges for future installments. I know it will be worth it though as Goodkind has created a huge cast of amazing characters with a wide range of values from truly evil to incredibly good and all the human foibles in between. Even if it is a bit callow in its presentation. There is a naive simplicity to sentence construction; too abrupt in its transitions. Still it is a story I could not put down. It took all night and I still had to read a bit of another book to bring my heart rate down!The basic fight is between Additive and Subtractive magic with the Additive used by living magic users and Subtractive by the Keeper and dead magic users. Extremely rarely, one person may use both. In Stone of Tears, it's up to Richard to repair the torn Veil that prevents the underworld from entering the world of the living, to prevent the Keeper from emerging and destroying all life. In his zeal, Richard simply makes things worse and worse.It's fascinating to watch Richard change the perspective of those around him. He learns so much on this journey of his as do those who come into contact with him.Reading of the tactics of a woefully outnumbered force of 4,500 children against 50,000+ hardened warriors is an absolute treat--I cheered as I read!The StoryA series of events have triggered Richard's magic and the headaches he suffers are increasingly debilitating. The Sisters of the Light tell him that he will die very soon unless he submits to the Rada'Han, a collar of control. After his experiences with such a collar under Denna's tutelage, Richard will never accept it. Until Kahlan orders him to. A betrayal of such depth and anguish for both.But Denna's lessons stand Richard in good stead when he is on the road with Sister Verna and he slowly converts her to his ways including changing her attitudes about horses. On their journey, he acquires an unexpected companion and sets the conditions for several prophecies to be fulfilled. You'll love the commotion he creates once he does reach the Palace of the Prophets! Not to be missed!!Kahlan's journey is much more fraught. To escape notice, she leaves the Mud People with only three men. And those three learn a great deal about the world: its size as well as its cruelties. They also learn Kahlan's true role in the world. The cruelest is the massacre and destruction of Ebinissia while the most illuminating is the revenge and betrayal in the mountain pass. However, that is not the last betrayal Kahlan suffers or in which Chandalen aids her.Meanwhile Zedd and Adie have their own set of life-threatening adventures however minor their appearance in the story.The CharactersThere is a cast of thousands, almost literally, so I'm simply going to list the more important.Kahlan Amnell is the Mother Confessor, the head of the Central Council of the Midlands in Aydindril that orders Kings and Queens, vetoes their actions, keeps the peace. It is her responsibility to represent the interests of everyone and every country but especially those who have no representation on the Council. Queen Cyrilla of Galea is Kahlan's unacknowledged half-sister. Captain Bradley Ryan is the commander of what remains of the Galean Army. A child. But a child bent on destroying the Army of the Imperial Order which destroyed his home city of Ebinissia.Richard Cypher has just learned that George Cypher was not his father. Instead, the tyrant he just killed was his true father, Darken Rahl. Richard is the new Lord Rahl of D'Hara. The man who raped his mother, Zedd's daughter. His actions inWizard's First Rule (Sword of Truth, 1)have set tripped his magic and he will die unless he receives training in his magic.Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander is the First Wizard. The most powerful mage in their world. He is also Richard's grandfather and he needs the help of Adie, a sorceress who lives in the Boundary to help Richard repair the Veil. Lady Jebra Bevinvier is a servant whom Zedd rescued in D'Hara whom he has sent on her own journey to use her visions to aid the Midlands.Sisters of the Light are a rigid religious group who believe they are justified in doing anything to train the men who have magic. They're bad enough but there are also the Sisters of the Dark some of whom set sail from. Like Denna, they also use a collar to control their charges. Sister Ann is the Prelate; Nathan is the Prophet who has quite a few enlightening facts for Richard. Pasha Maes is a novice promised the charge of training Richard. Warren, a.k.a., Mole, is a mage whose specialty is prophecies; he helps Richard learn more about the prophecy that applies to him.The Mud People adopted Richard and Kahlan; now three of their own will escort Kahlan back to Aydindril: Chandalen, Prindin, and Tossindin.Scarlet is a dragon to whom Richard gave aid and befriended in Wizard's First Rule; she plays a cameo role here. Denna was a Mord-Sith who tortured Richard horribly teaching him valuable skills for this story. Shota is a witch goddess who pushes Richard onto his pathThe CoverThe cover is bordered in black with an ominous desert landscape. An isolated castle in the background highlights the aloneness of Richard and Kahlan with Gratch in the forefront amongst large stones. If only the artist had made the woman Sister Verna, it would have been accurate.The title is the key to salvation."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I wish I could restart this book and count how many times Richard or Kahlan says to the other that they love the other one. I tore through the Sword of Truth in 3 days, folks. 3...days! I have had book 2 for almost 3 months and I am only on page 256. Seriously, Richard and Kahlan's relationship is disgustingly unhealthy. They are so \\"in love\\" that they are co-dependent on each other just to breathe. It's really sad. If you don't believe me, try to focus on how many times they say, \\"I love you.\\" It's literally every third page, if it's that far in between.We are not stupid as readers, nor do we have short-term memory loss. We don't need to be reminded how much they love each other ad nauseum. It's pathetic. Oh, and Richard is going to have a collar put on himself again. Really? That's the best plot device Goodkind could come up with?(Sigh). It's almost as if the Sword of Truth was written as a standalone book, but once the publishers saw how popular it was, they decided they had a new cash cow. The differences between books 1 and 2 are glaring and painful. We go from loving these characters and caring about them, to finding them unbearably pathetic and annoying. I am going to continue plodding through in hopes that it gets better."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"This 2nd of the series is better than the first in my opinion. I would have to make sure I had hours to kill because when I sat down to read it, I couldn't help but read 100's of pages at a time. When I got up (this happens with all good books I read) to eat I would think \\"Oh crap I'm missing it\\" Thinking I was watching a movie of it and missing what was about to happen next! hahahaha...."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I just finished WFR, and had to start reading this immediately. Since I had been introduced to the series from watching Legend of the Seeker, I knew that the TV series grabbed from all over the books, and was eager to see how things played out in the novel. To my surprise, almost all of this was different than the second season of the TV show, and that was a pleasant surprise. It's a shame that the fans of the books didn't support the TV show - because for anyone who started with the TV show and then read the books afterwards, it's like having Goodkind's world expanded."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Almost very good. A lot of interesting stuff comes up in the book. Not quite as good as the first.If you've made it this far in the series, STOP, they get much much worse."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"this is the 2nd book of Terry Goodkind I have read and I must say it is very good reading. I have ordered the next one in the series and I'm hoping to see more like the 2 already read."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"In starting off my review i should probably say that i think this book really only deserves about 2.5 stars, but because of Amazons ratings limititations i decided to err on the generous side and give the book 3.The realitively low rating i give the book and my own personal feelings of dissatisfaction towards 'Stone of Tears', are due to several reasons.The first of these is the sheer length of the book, 'Stone of Tears' is over 1050 pages long. Yet despite this length, the action only really gets going around page 600, with much of the previous bit of the book spent on largely unnecesary characterisation that seems to do not very much to advance the plot.This excessive length is made worse by (and/or caused by) the disjointed rambling nature of the plot. The story seems to crawl for the first 600 pages, at which point it then seems to take drugs and proceeds to race the characters through 2 seperate major conflicts awfully fast and unsatisfactorily. The author seems to spend little time fleshing out the background world around these plotlines and even less building up the conflicts into the gritty enthralling fights for life we expect from other authors such as George R.R Martin, Robert Jordan, Janny Wurts and even Raymond E Feist. Indeed the main characters seem to spend little time dealing with the &quot;big issues&quot; and seem to have little trouble (either morally or practically) in winning and resolving all the conflicts they are presented with. To make things worse the book has a wildly fast forwarded conclusion spaced over the last 70 pages of the book where the main character Richard solves 3 epic problems, zips around half the world and has a passionate reconciliation with his beloved. This gives the conclusion the distinct feel of something that was written hastily to try and bring to an end a book that was already much too long and going no where.The substance of the plot isnt all that much better either with too much cheap prophecy, enemy armies materialising out of nowhere, little plot situation background and a rather depresing lack of originality at certain points. However despite this there is still more than enough action and exitement, combined with a bit of practical philosophy/wisdom for a moral to make the book readable.I personally believe this all probably indicates a lack of pre-planning by the author about where the books plot and indeed series is heading.Another reason the 'Stone of Tears' isnt exactly my cup of tea, is the excessive Sado-eroticisim (to copy another reviewers phrase) in the book. There are several quite disturbing scenes that serve to advance the plot very little, with any benefit to be gained by them quickly undermined by Mr Goodkinds lack of characterisation and time spent developing character interaction, especially at the abbey of the sisters of light (he fails dismally to create a sense of suspense and mystery there). Another issue is the seemingly excessive amount of rape and violence towards women that occurs in the book, which he almost sees to trivalise through the sheer amount of it and his rather simplistic treatment of it. This is made probably worse by Mr Goodkinds rather clumsy and simplistic statement on abortion that occurs in chapter 43. Indeed it makes one wonder whether most of the sex scenes were added primarily by Mr Goodkind for his own jollies ( A recent South park episode featuring Mr Garrison and his book 'The valley of Penises' comes to mind).This all has the effect of making the book seem heavy going, confusing, shallow, disturbing at times and ultimately rather unsatisfying when compared other epic authors. However despite all this the book is still an mildly entertaining read and I will still probably read the other 4 books in the series, if for no other reason than a lot of other people seem to have enjoyed them"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I have been a reader of fantasy for some time now. I have also been reading reviews by readers for sometime as well. One thing that is blatantly obvious is that people put far to much importance on Fantasy writing. Simply put, Fantasy writing is usually based on an author's particular views, and their associations with history and mythology, blended together(the names have been changed to protect the innocent). And emerges under the guise of Escapist literature. I will not criticise people's positive reviews of books that they have read, because their opinion is certainly valid for the context in which it is written. My issue is with the negative reviews that seem to be motivated by anger, like they have been personally insulted by the author for making them read their book. Why all of this emotion, get over it. You probably would've wasted the time somewhere else. Maybe it helps to vent I don't know. I find it amusing that most of the negative reviewers cannot put together a cohesive paragraph let alone, 982 pages. I would love to see them attempt writing a novel. It is easy to throw rocks from down below. I think people need to remember that Fantasy is not created for a religious experence, it isn't meant to give spiritual enlightment about the world, it is meant to entertain, nothing more-nothing less.Onto the book. The Stone of Tears did resolve a little to quickly in the end, and I didn't care for that Sisters of Light portion very much-rather dull in my opinion. The bulid up; however, was very interesting, and I personally liked the darker elements, I admit it. I am tired of reading about the same old villans commiting the same crimes, Goodkind's villans seem to mimic the perversity and violence in our own world. Perhaps that is why some people have a problem with it, because once you are reminded of the attrocities in your own world the story is no longer an affective means of escape. I recommend this series for what it is, a non-groundbreaking enjoyable fantasy with a dash of the cold realities of evil. Try to ignore the irritating characters, though none match the most irritating character of all Nynaeve from Wheel of Time."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"The only thing more saddening than Goodkind's abysmal writing style, unrealistic and childish world and stereotypical characters seems to be the apparent legions of fans who proclaim him as the best thing since sliced bread (which, I suppose, would be correct if that is your perspective. Sigh. I just hope no other publishers will put forth similar drivel to cash in on the indiscriminate market of escapist pulp fantasy."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"After I read &quot;Wizards First Rule&quot;, I anticipated the sequel. It was a treat to read this book. From beginning to the end it was all action. The appearance of the screeling from the underworld starts the problems. While Richard's intentions were good, he mistakenly tears the veil to the underworld. The Keeper of the unerworld seeks to enter the world of the living. If that should happen, all is lost. Richard and Kahlan return to the mud people to get married, but the Sisters of the Light show up to take Richard to the old world to learn how to use his newly discovered gift. Kahlan, concerned for Richard, makes him go with the Sisters postponing their wedding. Richard goes on an adventure to seek a way to escape the Sisters of Light and Dark. Zedd finds Adie to help him decipher the prophecies. Kahlan helps to destroy the Imperial Army, when it backfires in her and she is to be executed. If I were to describe the whole book it would take me forever. But take my word for it, this is a great book. I look forward to reading the next book, &quot;Blood of the Fold&quot;."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Only by sheer force of will (OK, and skipping pages here and there) did I manage to slog my way though this 100 page novelette. 100 pages -- what is he talking about? Well if a real editor got hold of this and did his job, that's all that would be left. Ok Terry is creative, he thought of all that filler between that start and end of the book, but did any of it really make sense? Was there any flow? Was it really believable? Did all the whining give anyone else a headache?This would be a great kids book, except he forgot to take the dirty parts out. Happy reading."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"There is NO God, and this book prooves it! If there was then he would fling Mr. Goodkind and his publishers into the fiery hell they so richly deserve! This book is the most atrocious use of the English language that has ever been. I feel the need to switch to a different tongue simply because Mr. Goodkind speaks this one. The writing is infantile, the plots absurd, and the eloqution terrible. Mr. Goodkind, go check your report cards, I'm pretty sure you'll find a failing grade from your 2nd grad english teacher. Read this if you want to feel horribly ill."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Good writing consists of just a few basic things: interesting dialogue, concise sentences/paragraphs, and focused ideas/plot/characters. Sadly, none of Goodkind's works contain these three simple writing rules.Interesting dialogue: &quot;You are a *special* person, Richard.&quot; &quot;You're my friend... That's what friends are for...&quot; This is really annoying when it comes up nearly every other page. Goodkind simplifies his dialogue to the point where an attentive reader will feel insulted. Come on, chum, we're not that retarded (unless you've been buying the whole damn series).Concise sentences/paragraphs: Why in the hell is this book 1000 pages long? Even &quot;War and Peace&quot; isn't this long, and it's got enough epic plot to fill a hundred Goodkind novels. This boy needs an editor to distill this crap down. Longer does not equal better. (Read the Earthsea novels.)Focused ideas/plot/characters: It's like wandering in Wonderland, but lacking Alice's cat. There are a quite a few focused ideas here: sexual perversion, gratuitous violence, defecation (read the part about the palace), cardboard relationships, cliches, etc. Unfocused include: truth, magic, characters, and plot. The magic system is unwieldy, insipid, and simplistic (additive and negative magics?!). Goodkind mentioned something about &quot;righteous anger&quot; in the first novel; good to see that &quot;righteous anger&quot; actually means &quot;righteous slaughter/murder.&quot; He should've told us earlier. Richard and Kahlan are like love-sick teenagers, and the combined IQ of these two is lower than my caesar salad. Actually, one should ask: What plot? If there is a meaningful plot here, I'll be amazed.One could write an English doctoral thesis on Goodkind's usage, but his list of follies also includes all the &quot;borrowed&quot; ideas from Robert Jordan (who suffers many of the same problems) and Terry Brooks (ditto). We're going to keep on receiving crap in fantasy and science fiction until we demand better authors. At this point, it doesn't seem likely though..."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Well, I read the first in this series years ago, and tried reading this one right afterwards. I started and was disgusted with it. I for one do not like the neverending list of baddies that suddenly crop up in the beginning of each new book. The characters seem fairly stupid to me, and even though they have all these powers and gifts, they cant seem to ever use them to advantage. Also there are so many things ripped from other recent fantasy, very blatantly I might add(a silver collar that controls magic with no visible clasp... um is it just me or is that a direct rip off of the collar thing in Wheel of Time?) I just put it down in disgust after a few hundred pages, but thats just me. I know fantasy 'borrows' often one from another, but this is just copying. etc etc, I dont really see how so many people rate it so well, Proceed with Caution!"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Many people that read Terry Goodkind's first book in The Sword of Truth Series give up in the beginning. Goodkind is a decent writer but honestly, I think declaring him one of the best fantasy writers today speaks words about how bereft the fantasy genre is of talented authors. I almost gave up on book one myself and I'm glad I didn't because in the end, I enjoyed the book and had a merry time reading about the adventures of Richard, Kahlan, Zed, Chase and others. I purchased book two the day after completing the first book and initially, I zipped through it like I did book one but something happened along the way. Stone of Tears isn't a bad read but it just didn't pull me in like the first book. I think the biggest point of tension in book one was Richard and Kahlan's relationship and now that they're together (sort of) and know each other so well, their characters don't have the same zip they used to. I don't mind long reads but I feel like Goodkind could shorten all his books by AT LEAST a hundred pages. In book two, I started feeling like I was slowly churning along and I stopped reading about midway through after reading Ada's (Is that her name?) background story. I won't ruin it for any potential readers but the story about her split from her ex-lover smacks hard of that typical Goodkind nonsense that he sometimes uses as origins or motivation for his characters. If you enjoyed the first novel, I'd give the second one a try. After all, enough people have enjoyed this series to allow it to continue to book eight, nine or whatever it's on now; but in my opinion, if you want a new fantasy series, check out George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire Series or Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time Series first if you haven't already. Jordan's series gets slow in the end but the first few books are much better than The Sword of Truth Series. Overall, Stone of Tears is a decent read but not everyone will enjoy it."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Is this only the second book in the series?

He keeps my interest with the turn of a page.."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Stone of Tears picks up right where Wizard's First Rule left off. With hardly a moment to catch your breath from the conclusion of the first book, the consequences of what was done arrive in an action-packed sequence. After an initial burst of action, though, things settle in for a bit, and the long process of setting up the pieces for the story to come begins. And make no mistake: at nearly one thousand pages, this is a long book. On the one hand, this length helps give the book its epic feel, along with the mythical creatures, heroes' journeys, and high-stakes conflicts, but at times it feels like the writing could be sharper, tighter, and less repetitive (how many times does he use the phrase \\"sidelong glance\\"?). Repetition does seem to be Terry Goodkind's favorite way of ramming a point home, and he walks the fine line between repetition and padding frequently. Another problem here is poor copyediting. I don't knock Goodkind for this, but his copyeditor let a ton of misspellings through, which can be a real distraction. Whether they're word errors like \\"in\\" where it should be \\"it\\" or straight-up misspellings, \\"brough\\" instead of \\"brought,\\" I've never encountered more misspellings in a book more often than in Goodkind's novels. My last criticism is of the overuse of rape as plot point. This is Goodkind's go-to problem for Kahlan and other female characters. It was used well at times, but after a while it lost a bit of its narrative power due to overuse.Still, one does not have to be blind to a book's faults to appreciate its virtues. The action is exciting, the characters have heart and soul, the adventure is truly epic. It's been many years since I read books this long this fast. It's very difficult to stop at the end of each chapter. Throughout Stone of Tears, I'd keep finding myself saying, \\"maybe I'll read just one more chapter . . .\\"In the end, that's the most important thing, particularly for a Fantasy novel. This world, and these characters, draw me in like few others ever have. I care about what happens to Richard, Kahlan, Zedd, and the others. They can be maddeningly stubborn and naive, but their imperfections help to make them more real and interesting. When it comes to magic, adventure, swords, and sorcery, The Sword of Truth series delivers for the second time with Stone of Tears. I suspect it would be difficult for Fantasy fans not to proceed quickly to Blood of the Fold after reading Stone of Tears."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Note: I would read book one first entitled Wizard's First Rule.I don't usually read books over 800 pages. Why? Because I get bored. That is why I don't read Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time saga anymore. By no means are Jordan's books badly written, I just get confused with which character does what.When I started Terry Goodkind's gigantic Sword of Truth saga, I was worried he'd confuse me later. Thankfully, he did not. He kept me on my toes throughout Wizard's First Rule , throwing shocker after shocker, and awesome fights reminiscent of R.A Salvatore.Book two, Stone of Tears begins with a bang, and ends with a bang, with smatterings of classic political tension, and true love in the classical sense.This isn't a book for the faint of heart. Action is bloody and very graphic. And yes, there is sexual tension ( the kind which can be skipped over, without losing important information.). And even cannibalism.The villains are very, and I mean very diabolical. The kind of villains that are dangerously too smart for their own good (which eventually gets them killed.).Goodkind also weaves heroes that actually act like real people, by the way they think, feel and act. You will be able to relate to most of the heroes, and yes even the villains.I give this book 3 stars out of 5."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"This book is a behemoth at nearly 1,000 pages and Goodkinds deliver another fantastic adventure that picks following the events of the first book, Wizards first Rule.

Of the three storylines, Kahlan's is the most complex and adrenalin-fueled, her is actions are most pivotal in driving the action forward. When she took up the charge to lead that army of young Galeans, it was a heart-rendering and spectacular moment.The Sisters of Light never connected, they were insincere and manipulative in their motvations and their involvement with Richard just fell flat for me.I ended up loving the dragon Scarlet and the scarily adorable Gar, Gratch, more than I did the Sisters. Even the semi-reformed, danderous Mord-Sith were more likeable than the sorceresses.Following Wizards First Rule I knew I had to brace for even more violence, torture, and rape scenes so I pretty much skimmed those passages. The author seems to have a propensity for depicting graphic sexual violence but lacks in creating intimacy, which deflated some of my reading enjoyment of this adventurous sequel. Also, I felt like the ending was too rushed to wrap up the story.Now, this consistent comparison to Tolkien, Jordan, or George R.R. Martin is tiresome and nitpicking. Tolkien was the first and set the standard for this genre but no one author holds an exclusive patent for this genre nor does an author need permission to create their own fantasy world. Literary fantasy is open for the addition of new worlds to be built from various author's imaginations. Tolkien, Jordan, Martin had their vision and this is Goodkind's. SOT should stand on its own merit and the criticism should be based on whether or not a reader appreciated what the author has created, not that he dared touch some sacred cow.Overall, Stone of Tears is a compelling sequel and good, if exhaustive read. I need to take a breather before tackling the third book, Blood of the Fold, but I am semi-hooked into the world of Richard, Kahlan, and Zedd."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I started reading the \\"Sword of Truth\\" series after watching \\"The Legend of the Seeker\\" on TV. The series was PG, maybe PG13 for some episodes. The books are R. Great story, great characters, easy to pick up and not put down, but very graphic brutality, gore, and rape. A few cursewords also. I just wanted to make this clear for any parents ;)"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I started reading the Sword of Truth series after enjoying the Legend of the Seeker. I really like the stories so far, but the author seems very preoccupied with rape. I do appreciate that he does not graphically describe such scenes but merely alludes to them."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"This was a great follow up to the first book and all of the characters I fell in love with were back in this follow up. What I like about the books in this series is there is the master plot that goes across all of the books, while each book on its own is a great read alone."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I'll make Sword of Truth fans mad with my review, but so be it. I listened to the audiobook version.This is the fourth book in the series I have read, and although the storyline was enough to keep me attentive and following along, I probably won't finish the series.The chapters with First Wizard Zed I found the most entertaining, but elsewhere the author just waxes on about Richard Richard Richard, his greatness and ever increasing powers and talents, and his unending, undying love for Kalen Kalen Kalen.The book follows Wizards First Rule.....in which a huge amount of time is devoted to torturing Richard in captivity, followed by this episode where the major gist of the book involves his capture and captivity again by the Sisters of the Light.The themes cycle between violence (usually involving doors being blown apart and bodies hacked or thrown), Richards sword rages (different flavors of rage, changing his sword different colors, etc), brief interims of strategy-planning, followed by the next wave of violence with occasional droning ons about how much Kalen and Richard love each other, may never see each other again, can't live without each other, etc.The author imagines a 'world of the dead' run by a Keeper (sort of like Satan or at the least, Sauron from Lord of the Rings), where people basically go to when they die. But those who die still exist as active characters in the story; some barrier called a Veil keeps them from coming \\"back\\", which is always in danger of being damaged and rendered ineffective.This complicates things as the bad guys who are killed aren't really killed, and the main nemesis in this book is essentially King of the Dead, and therefore unkillable either. Nevertheless a whole lot of attention and time is devoted to killing regardless.I found the book entertaining but I wearied of the continual violence, I imagine if this were ever made into a movie it would literally wear the actors out. How Richard could endure all the physical pain by this point and not be entirely numb, every bone in his body broken and his nervous system completely destroyed (as well as some of the other characters....) is something that would have to be considered. Lucky for him even if he were killed, he'd still be alive, just in the dead world, of course (??)"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Personally, I prefer an interesting story to rivetingly revolting descriptions of perverted gore. I really enjoyed Wizard's First Rule and was looking forward to reading this one but I couldn't even finish it (which admittedly limits my ability to review the plot, so I won't).Using nothing but shocking violence to keep a reader's interest is immature and insulting to the reader's intelligence. Everything in the book that is not disgusting imagery is boring dialogue and preposterous motivations. I got tired of the constant feeling of revulsion pretty quickly. I'm really not a prude, I don't have a problem with sex or violence in literature when it contributes to the expression of art. This book is not art, it's porn for psychopaths.SPOILER: I put this book down on the page where a woman finds herself holding her warm, wet intestines because she has been cut in half by another woman who just finished screwing a demon with a dick made of metal spikes or something such that her vagina has become a bloody, mangled mess that is sliding down her thighs. I just don't need that image in my head."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"This novel contains some of the best aspects of epic fantasy. Both Kahlan &amp; Richard (the main characters) are even better in this novel. They face many challenges but prove themselves as worthy to them. This is a great book! And it is one of Goodkind's best."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Yes, Goodkind could indeed spare us some of the graphic details, but at least he isn't as bad as Steven King. But this book still scores high points on plot, setting and characterization. The reader has no trouble caring about Richard, Kahlan or their friends and is quickly drawn into what they are involved in. Goodkind has great skill with his characterizations! The little girl's point of view is wonderfully done! Don't stop reading this series yet! It is good and the plots are very very good! Read it!"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"While not as completely engrossing as the first book in the series, Wizard's First Rule, Terry Goodkind still does an excellent job with The Stone of Tears. The sequel brings again to the epic saga of Kahlan and Richard, who really ought to have sorted themselves out by now. Now we have Richard being captured by the mysterious Sisters of the Light so they can teach him to use his gift (magic). Goodkind gives the reader hints of Richard's past along with seductive hints about the Wizard's War that ravaged the land centuries before. This book is not the generic, money-making sequel that some authors rattle out by the thousand by taking some insignificant character from their first book and shoving them into the main plot line kicking and screaming. It answers questions from the previous novel and leaves the reader asking more. Definately worth a look."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I love this series.Although this is not my favorite book of the series because there was alot of focus on the one city; Goodkind manages to keep the reader enthralled. I can never put these books down."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Stone of Tears is an awesome follow-up to Terry Goodkind's wonderful first book, Wizard's First Rule. Stone of Tears also has everything that you could want in an epic fantasy. It's not nearly as fast-paced as Wizard's First Rule, but still worthy of recognition!! I definately recommend this to all who loved Goodkind's Wizard's First Rule!!!!"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"This book was very good, but not a great like wizard's first rule.

I scincerly recomend buying this book."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Goodkind should have spent substantialy more time on the ending since it concludes hastily without any of the rich detail he is renowned for. Good - but could have been better."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Stone of Tears was a fun book to read. I haven't been pulled along a story like this since the Shannara series. There's a couple of twists I particularly liked. The first twist was the return of the collar. The second was Gratch, I luuuuuug Gratch! The two reasons I can't give this book 5 stars are: 1) there is too much storyline that reminds me of Wheel of Time, and; 2) the book concludes too quickly without giving certain story elements the attention they deserve. I sure like Richard more than that mean ol' Rand al'Thor!"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"This book is one of the best I've ever read. It's involved, the reader is sucked in instantly, and the writing is excellent. The concept that Terry Goodkind has for this series is awesome, and he really carries this off. I would recommend it to anyone who likes wizards, dragons, sword fights, and a little bit of romance mixed in."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Book 2 of The Sword of Truth follows squarely in the footsteps of the first. If you loved the first book, you'll probably love this one. If, like me, you thought that the first one was a generic heroic fantasy pastiche with lots of pointless cruelty thrown in, you'll despise this one too.The sad thing is that Goodkind has a fair amount of talent at jerking reactions out of people. I kept reading because I *did* become involved with the characters, and I kept hoping the overall narrative structure would go someplace interesting.Word to the wise: It doesn't."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Stone of Tears is a great sequel. I read the first book and wasn't impressed with Goodkind's writing; however, I loved the characters and the idea behind the series so I decided to keep reading them.This book exceded my expectations. It seemed like Goodkind's writing improved alot, maybe it was just good editing. Anyway, the character devlopement was throughly enjoyable and storyline progress seems to go at a perfect pace.One thing I didn't like was in the beginning of the book everyone seems to cry, about everything, all the time. Fortunately that pattern didn't continue after the first 100 pages so I was happy.If you liked the first book or just thought it was OK then I still recommend giving the second book a chance. I thought it was much better then the first."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"this book has the following:rapetorturesexvery gruesome,gory descriptions of batte scenesit's 1000 pgs and should be about 600i thought Wizard's First Rule(1st book of series)was betterP.S: i'm over 13, just didnt want to sign up for this F**king thing :.)"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I'm not big on writing lengthy reviews when I like a book compared to when I dislike it. The character developement, the world and the plot are all totally gripping. Excellent book!"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"The second book was excellent. It picked up right where the last book left off with the same force that the last book left off with. There is no rest for those who read this book, it is jam-packed with adventure. There are occasional points, yes, where the actions are predictable or trite, but there are far more that are completely unexpected or at least slightly different than what was expected. The turn of events is tireless and consuming at the same time. From one heartache to joy, to another heartache, this book keeps you on your toes. You will find yourself happily wearied by this book by it's end, and yet still wanting to pick up the third book to find out what next is in store for Richard and those around him.The lessons in this book are thought-provoking. If you look at this book as more than just a fantasy novel, you will realize that, whether he intends to or not, Terry Goodkind is making some very valid and intriguing observations about human nature, and may very well force you into making those observations as well.One thing that was seemingly lost from the first book to the second was the understanding of Darken Rahl. In the first book there is an attempt made to show the reader that even though Darken Rahl is made out to look evil, he isn't much more evil than everyone else, he simply goes about it in more dramatic and extreme ways. He is likely no less evil than Richard's stepbrother, but his magic allows him to be brought to the forefront of the scene. To some readers, this may make him seem overly evil and devoid of any real human nature. However, at the root of his person, he probably isn't much more evil than even Richard, himself. Only he carries greed with him more strongly, and in the form of wanting money, whereas Richard's 'greed' is for love. Not to go on terribly about this point, but it should be made because the second book lost the sense of connection to humanity that Darken Rahl had in the first book.This book is also very heavily ignited with romance. The passion of their love for each other is all-consuming to Richard and Kahlan, and yet they still stay true to form. Despite some peoples' criticism about their love being trite, their love is no more and no less strong than many new lovers seated in the real world. The book captures the arousing, addicting feelings of love - new love, in particular - and simply displays how weak and how strong it makes us at the same time. Very realistic.As a final point of mention...Someone had mentioned of the first book that it rang of Dungeons and Dragons - it does. This book has huge parallels to the familiar role-playing game and there were times, most especially in the first book, where I would think &quot;ouch! he rolled a 1 on his will save.&quot; For those of you who are DnD fans - this book should prove to be very interesting to you."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I have recently read WFR and I enjoyed the the strong encouragement that Mr. Goodkind put into his fantasy elements. On this particular story the begigining would sure seem promising to me. But within the first 300pgs. we are into talk of inapropriate sexual scenes that would undoutably come to a rated R movie. One thing that is nice about goodkinds works is that human conversation is simple vs. Tolkeins rather confusing way of writing. I would only hope that in the future Terry would think about the following1. Think about the sex content in his books because of young readers (I myself im only just 11 going on 12)2. Perhaps try ajusting the story endings to be more exciting in the futre."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"After a great book like Wizard's First Rule, Terry Goodkind disappoints with this 1000 page flop. It seems that Goodkind stretched the novel to it's limits with about 700 pages. He beat around the bush with lots of bull with them going here and there, and not actually doing what was important. Kahlan was especially disappointing. When in need of figuring how to fix the viel, saving 5000 men means nothing when the world is at stake. I was sorrily upset with this 980 page book. I expected something more than maybe 250 pages of useful writing."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Definitely one of my all time favorites! Goodkind puts his heroes through truly grueling trials and keeps the action and suspense high throughout. The final battles and confrontations were huge and powerful.

It was so good it kept from preparing for my exams. The only thing i didn't like about it is Richard and Kahlans life it terrible. Will they ever be at peace. In fact events go from bad to worse. But i think that is what makes the book so good."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"This is the longest book of the series, but definitely one of the best. Goodkind weaves together a story and world that is rich and inviting. The book plays like a movie in your head and you'll have a hard time putting it down.As a side note, there are some current issues as of this review with the Kindle Edition. It lacks all paragraph/tab indentations as well as not having the Mud People's spoken words in italics as it should. I have sent this information to Amazon, and they report that the publisher is fixing these problems, and a new update version will be released as soon as possible. According to them, if you have already purchased the Kindle Edition, you will be able to download the update for free once it is released."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"The first book in this series, Wizard's First Rule, was very good. This book is better. The author, it seems, is improving on both his writing style and technique. The story, as well, in my view is much better. It starts strong, and continues to be a good read until the end.Literally, literally, the book begins in the garden of the dead wizard, Darken Rahl, moments after he died. Chase and Zedd are discussing what to do with the boxes of Orden when a creatures from the underworld attacks them. The &quot;Keeper&quot; creatures are loose. Will the Keeper follow?I have read others complain that this plot line is too similiar to Robert Jordan's series, the Wheel of Time. This is both true and false. The &quot;Keeper&quot; story is one plot in this book. But, this book is really about much more. There are other villians and other struggles. The Keeper story is only part of the tapestry.It is also interesting, to me, how the &quot;Keeper&quot; is described in this book. He follows are evil, but the Keeper may not be. He function, death, is described as necessary for life. What good function does the villian in the Wheel of Time series perform?I also love the humor found throughout the story. The author here does not beat you over the head with it. He has a singular wit to him, which makes these books much more enjoyable. If you think like the author you will find this book very funny. Mind me, it is not a comedy. But, life is rarely a drama or a comedy or a romance. Life is everyone of those things, and more. The writer here remembers that fact and puts all the elements of life into his book, while remembering and delivering on the fact that he is writing a fantasy adventure series."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I really thought that this was a brilliant book !!!! Firstly to those of you who are comparing this book to the Wheel of Time , the 2 series are very different and I think that some people have nothing better to do than sit and try and think up similarities between the 2 series . At least Terry Goodkinds books get somewhere and don't just hang around in the middle of nowhere !!! These first 2 books have kept me riveted for the last couple of days and I really enjoyed them !! This book is a must !!! I rate it up there with Tad William's 'Memory , Sorrow and Thorn ' ."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I enjoyed 'Wizard's First Rule' but not this subsequent attempt at writing. The author's style bears remarkable similarity to that of Robert Jordan. Also, the author seems to revel in the idea that genocide and rape offer good plot intrigue. Indeed, most of the suspense in this work can be traced to whether the lead character is to be imminently defiled. This book has left me perturbed as to the author's intentions."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"The first book of this series wasn't too bad. That's why I read the second one. I was extremely disappointed with this book. This series is turning out to be a very poor and polluted copy of The Wheel of Time. The non-stop violent and perverted sex is enough to make you vomit. Needless to say, I won't be wasting any more of my time or money on this series."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I can forgive him for copying Tolkien cause every fantasyauthor does it.

Can't Goodkind come up with ANYTHING original?"},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"This book was boring. The first few chapters kept my attention but soon I was getting tired of reading Richard and Khalan cry again and again. in fact it was rather annoying. All they seemed to do was whine which made me wonder what they were. Powerful heroes of this story plot or helpless children who feel the need to moan about everything from spilled water to death. I expected MUCH more from this book but it just turned out to be a very big dissappointment. I don't even bother to read any of Goodkind's novels anymore."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I really enjoyed the first volume in this series. There were one or two places where I winced at the obvious &quot;borrowing&quot; of characters and concepts from other fantasy series, but there was a lot of creativity there to counterbalance those minor lapses.I cannot say the same about this second volume. I was shocked at concept after concept that appeared to have been lifted directly from Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series, shifted slightly in context, then placed into Goodkind's storyline.Eventually I became too distracted by the large amounts of &quot;borrowed&quot; material to be able to enjoy the creative and original aspects of the story (which were less in evidence here than in the first volume), so I am sending this one off to the used book store -- unfinished."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I should first qualify this review by stating that I've read only the first two installments in the &quot;Sword of Truth&quot; series. However, that amounts to around 1700+ pages of Goodkind's writing. Most of this review is negative, but I do list some of the good points of the books at the end. A paraphrase of this review: If you are the type of person who only reads fantasy novels to escape and not think, then these books may suit you. If you enjoy a well-considered background and plot, and characters with whom one can relate, then these books will probably not suit you.Within the first hundred pages of &quot;Wizard's First Rule&quot; I wanted desperately to leap into the world with Richard and Kahlan and end the misery they were inflicting on me. Their characters were so incredibly flat that I was horrified with the idea of reading another 700 pages featuring them. Not only was their dialogue childish (E.g. &quot;That's what friends do.&quot; &quot;That's what friends are for.&quot; etc., ad nauseam), but the actions ascribed to them were completely overused. I've lost track of how many times I've read a phrase like &quot;She gave him a sidelong glance&quot; or &quot;He looked at her from under his eyebrows.&quot; That gets old after the first couple of dozen times, and one gets the impression that people in this world never just look at each other when they talk, but instead walk side-by-side or keep their heads turned down at all times.Another gripe I have is that Goodkind doesn't seem to keep much logical consistency to the background of the story. For instance, Kahlan the Confessor has the power to touch a person and completely command/control them thereafter. Thus, when the uber-baddie of the first book, Darken Rahl, wants to kill the Confessors off, he sends out quads, which are groups of four well-trained killers. The reason given for the four assassins is that the targeted Confessor will touch one man, and he will then kill one or two other members of the quad before they can kill him. That leaves at least one member to kill the Confessor (their power usually only works once, then must recharge).OK, here's where I get annoyed: The Confessor has to touch their target. Many other people in this world seem to possess and use weapons such as crossbows, long bows and so on. I would like to think that if me and my quad mates were sent out to kill one of these confessors, we might sit down first, have a beer or two and then decide to go buy ourselves some crossbows! &quot;Hey, guys, what if we just shoot her from about 50' away and don't even give her a chance to touch us? I think we should at least try it once!&quot; Given the blinding stupidity of some of the more central characters, though, this type of oversight from the supporting cast is not too suprising.Magic is a difficult thing to work with when writing. Most of the better writers will leave it as more of a mysterious thing, and allow the reader's mind to fill in the details. Tolkien was a master at this, and I believe that George R.R. Martin is doing a very good job in his Ice&amp;Fire saga. Goodkind just seems to make up things that suit him as he goes along and it ends up being a bit like &quot;Wizard trumps Sorceress, Witch trumps Seeker, Mord-Sith trumps Magic&quot; and then ends it all by basically saying &quot;Love is the 5th Element!&quot; And calling something a &quot;Mord-Sith&quot;?!? That's about the least imaginative name for an evil creature I can imagine, and I think that Lucas should sue.I said that I would write something good at the end, so here it is. Goodkind does have moments where some talent shines through. When he is carrying the story forward it tends to be a fairly enjoyable read. When he is trying to do some character building it tends to be a very frustrating read. I think that with some judicious editing -- not just running it through a spell-check program and declaring victory -- these books would rate a 2.5 or even 3 star review.A well-known author evidently provided a review saying, &quot;I really think Goodkind's work will sweep the country in the way Tolkien's did&quot;. That is a paraphrase as I don't have the book with me. That is an insult to the genius of Tolkien. I have read none of Robert Jordan's doorstops, so I can't compare. But after reading the first three of Martin's saga, I have to say that Goodkind's work is not even a close second. If I couldn't buy used copies and then sell them back, I wouldn't bother reading these books."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Terry Goodkind continued his Sword of Truth series and the book is good. Be aware that the Kindle version of this book has a flaw - does not display in the color mode white letters-on black background. For some reason - it works correctly on the Kindle applications on the computer, iPad, or iPhone - but not on the Kindle Fire."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"This review is not about the novel, but the ebook version. I can understand some errors during the conversion process, but to misplace an entire section is unforgivable. A key section dealing with the Sisters of the Dark, originally taking place at the end of chapter 64, has been moved to the end of the book, AFTER \\"The End\\". Obviously, no one bothered reviewing the ebook prior to publication.Editing errors continue in the next book, \\"Blood of the Fold\\". Upon checking to see if any sections had been misplaced in that book I discovered sections were divided not by a sword, as in \\"Wizard's First Rule\\", nor by asterisks, as in \\"Stone of Tears\\", but by the words \\"1 Line Space\\". I did not look beyond the last chapter to see if this occurred throughout the book.I understand Amazon and the publishers' reasons for encoding their products with DRM (digital rights management). But I consider this a breach of the unwritten agreement between publisher and reader. If they continue to provide us with inferior, error-ridden products, they should not complain when we strip their protections so we can re-edit their books into something readable."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I read Wizards First Rule in one extended sitting during a 30 hour trip from Sydney to Frankfurt. I wanted a book that would take my mind off of being cooped up in airplanes. It worked really well for that.I read Stone of Tears because WFR got me hooked on the characters, particularly Richard, the hero, and I wanted more. For me, Stone of Tears was an even better story. Do you know that feeling when you identify with a character so much that you start writing your own dialog for him? I hope that's not just me who does that...I agree with a lot of reviewers who talk about wooden dialog and some unbelievable situations. Most of the men and some of the women in the story seem to have physical abilities and endurance that would sweep the olympic games if they ever tore the veil between that world and ours. But, listen: that's not important. To me, emotions are important, and intelligent characters. I don't want to be yelling at dumb characters, in my head.I identify with Richard. He's an angry young man with a strong personal code. He's no wuss. He's smart. I once was a young man like that, too, so it felt good to slip into his skin.Ultimately, my test for a good book is whether it changes how I experience the world. This series is doing that. I'm thinking about my own experience as a Seeker, and my own personal Sword of Truth. Sound silly? In 1999, I quit a safe job and became a consultant. I had no savings, nor equipment, nor preparation. This was a Sword of Truth moment, I now realize. It's a moment that comes rarely in life-- when you see what you must do and you do it despite the pain it will cause you. We're caught up in so many complicated threads in our modern lives, Terry Goodkind is the kind of writer who helps me reflect on how I can maintain my moral compass."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"\\"Stone of Tears\\" by Terry Goodkind picks up right after the first novel, \\"Wizard's First Rule\\", and really hits the ground running. The story transitions pretty seamlessly, and the reader is again struck with Goodkind's relentlessly brutal storytelling ability. This book greatly expands the world of The Sword of Truth series beyond what had been revealed in the first novel. The readers are given several new major characters, along with a host of minor ones, and an entirely new land of people only previously mentioned in passing. At almost one thousand pages, this is probably the longest novel in the entire series, and a lot of ground is covered here. The events of Stone of Tears set up the direction the rest of the series takes, which, as of this writing, is currently at it's tenth book and set to end with two more.There are so many different plotlines that it's difficult to summarize it all in one review, but the main plot here is that Richard is taken, mostly against his will, by a group called the Sisters of Light to their palace in the Old World. It seems the Sisters aren't fond of untrained wizards running around, as they have a tendency to cause unnecessary problems (and a wizard's gift can kill him if he doesn't know how to keep it under control). At this point there are no other wizards left to teach Richard, so they take it upon themselves to ensure he gets the proper training. Several reviewers of the books later on in the series try to point out that Richard is invincible, all powerful, never makes mistakes, etc. To them I would firmly point right here, where the far-reaching extent of Richard's mistakes begin to manifest. While it's true that Richard generally comes out on top in whatever immediate conflict he's involved in at the end of each novel, each and every one of his minor victories only creates a larger problem for the world. At the end of \\"Wizard's First Rule\\" Richard does in fact defeat the wizard Darken Rahl, but the manner in which Richard defeats him tears the veil between worlds, giving the Keeper of the Underworld the ability to reach into reality and begin the process of freeing himself from his infernal prison. Seeing as how that jeopordizes the lives of every individial in the entire world, I'd call that a mistake. Likewise, at the conclusion of Stone of Tears, Richard (*spoiler alert*) destroys the boundary between the New and Old Worlds so that he can try to rescue Kahlan from a dark prophecy he has learned of. While he is successful in bringing the boundary down, this act unleashes the full wrath of Emporer Jagang and his Imperial Order upon the New World - a force of destruction still being felt seven books later (*end spoiler*).The depth of the characters really begin to show in this novel. Abstract concepts that Richard just talked about in the first book are delivered much more keenly by his actions this time around. Richard's nobility and desire to preserve life is brought sharply into focus when he and one of his captors, Sister Verna, travel through the land of the Majendi - a tribal people who are at war with their displaced neighbors, the Baka Ban Mana. It seems Verna, along with all the Sisters of Light, are well aware that the Majendi are ritualstically sacrificing members of the Baka Ban Mana, but they do nothing to stop it, as the Majendi allow the Sisters of Light safe passage through their lands. Unable to stomach such blatant disregard for life, and the fact that the Sisters of Light do nothing to right a wrong clearly present to them, Richard does everything in his power to bring this horrid tradition to and end, even though it puts his own life in mortal danger.Although it pops up every now and again in a small way, the philosphy of Objectivism, which the whole series is based on, takes a back seat to the storytelling and action. This one is mostly plot progression, and it does a very good job of that. Besides the other world-altering examples previously mentioned, the \\"Sisters of the Dark\\" are introduced here, and are a constant menace throughout the book. They dissapear at the end of the novel, off to do dark deeds on their own, only to re-appear in the newest novel, Chainfire, and bring a plot line thought dead in this book back to the forefront. As was stated in my review of \\"Wizard's First Rule\\" every book in this series has some capacity to make the reader cry - look for it here in the form of an unlikely hero displaying emotions thought impossible for this particular individual. Goodkind's ability at writing is showcased by the fact that he can vividly and effectively describe high fantasy, horrific warfare, scenes of dialoge, and more sentimental scenes all in one novel.If you liked Wizards First Rule, I'd highly recommend contuining the story here."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I noticed somebody giving a review on this after reading 1/3 the book. Such a review should be given only 1/3rd its weight in value in my opinion. First of, the so called &quot;sexual situations&quot; are directed at adults. Goodkind say's he writes these books with adults in mind. If there is so much evil in these fantasy type stories, its only common place that such gory sex acts might exist too. I don't have a problem with that. If the reviewer continued reading, he'd know the Sisters of Light are nothing like the Aes Sedai of Jordans world. In conclusion, this is a fabulous tale, and I give it 5 stars. I have read all the books in this series and their wonderful. Each book is nicely concluded and we're not kept hanging."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I just started reading Terry Goodkind (&quot;Sword of Truth&quot; series) again. A few years back, I was reading the second book, Stone of Tears, but never finished it due to it seeming derivative of Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time (it had Sisters of the Light, like Aes Sedai, and other similar things) and it being long - 997 pages). Well, I picked it up again and finished it. I tell you what, it was excellent (I was stupid for putting it down before). Goodkind keeps the plot moving and the action brisk. It doesn't have a series of long chapters (or books) where you get endless description, endless insignificant characters, and nothing happening, as is common in The Wheel of Time. In other words, Goodkind tells a story and entertains you with action, intrigue, fascinating creatures, spectacular magic, good characters that grow and evolve, philosophy, and satisfiying conclusions. Goodkind gets things going right away and doesn't bore you with excruciating, pointless, mindless drivel that's being used for profit producing filler, like is so common in the later books of The Wheel of Time. It's like night and day, comparing Jordan to Goodkind in terms of entertainment value. And it's not like Goodkind lacks in vivid description or quality detail. He just incorporates description and detail within the flow of the story in a graceful, entertaining fashion that enhances, not detracts from, the reader experience. So if you are looking for an entertaining, enriching read in the fantasy genre, I recommend Goodkind."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I had some hope after the first book in this series, as it seemed that there were some interesting ideas floating around in what was essentially a soup of derivative fantasy (think Star Wars/Matrix in a fantasy setting). Toward the end I was waiting for Darken Rahl to say, \\"Richard, I am your father. Together we will rule the world as father and son!\\" Anyhow, unfortunately the second book was the same type of derivative fantasy, only more shallow. It gets wrapped up \\"deus ex machina\\" style, or what I also like to refer to as \\"Dumbledore conversation.\\"This is a 300 page book that was dragged out over 900+ pages. There are a number of interesting questions that are raised in the first 100 pages, but are answered (mostly) in the last 100 pages. Everything in between is hackneyed, repetitive filler. I found myself skipping 3 and 4 pages at a time. I'll try to put some context to this. There is a big long section in the middle of the book where Kahlan gets involved with an army that is fighting against hopeless odds. She spends a lot of time with them when she should be going to Aydindril to tell Zedd how she sent Richard with some strange (possibly untrustworthy) sorceress to teach him how to be a wizard and that, oh yeah, the veil to the underworld has been torn which could lead to the Keeper destroying the world of the living. This entire section of the book served no purpose other than giving Kahlan something to do. When she finally gets back on track she practically says something like, \\"Oh yeah, I guess helping Richard and saving the world is probably more important than saving a few small towns from this army I spent the last few weeks defeating. It must have been the Keeper distracting me. My bad.\\"Also the characters are incredibly brilliant and powerful world leaders and heroes, yet they do the most stupid things. Kahlan, for example, spends a good while fighting Keltons, as mentioned above, then just strolls into Aydindril to find some Kelton sitting on her throne. Later that evening she catches him urinating in her bed and for some reason does not confess or execute him on the spot for treason. She then goes to the council meeting the next day without having a plan or even suspecting a trap. The new leader of the council whizzed in her bed the night before and she thinks nothing of it. She is portrayed as a brilliant military strategist and all around badass, but she doesn't bother to come up with a backup plan... how about she goes and finds a convicted murderer, confesses him, then instructs him to attend the meeting, as regular citizen's are allowed to be in the audience. OR she could have gotten the highly skilled assassin and the soldier she already confessed that were just outside of the city to go as well. When things start to go south she could order them to attack or at least cause a distraction so she can get away. I literally just thought that up on the spot, and I am not a brilliant military strategist, or a successful fantasy author. I think that exemplifies what is wrong with this book. The character's personality, intelligence, and abilities are changed at will by the author to facilitate plot points.Even though I have mostly focused on Kahlan in this review, there are similar issues with Richard and Zedd. For instance, everything that happened to Richard, throughout the entire book, was invalidated with two \\"Dumbledore conversations\\" at the end of the book. After the big reveals, which were incredibly predictable and formulaic, I was left feeling like the author tricked me into reading this awful literary abortion.This book is a derivative, repetitive, and poorly written soup of meandering fantasy cliches."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I really like Stone of Tears; the plot and situations facing Richard and Kahlan are very unique and creative. Let me go ahead and say right now, that I don't think this is a bad book, but a couple of things got under my skin:1) Too much recap. I know Goodkind (or his editor) was probably not thinking too much for his future readers. What he (or they) had in mind was making sure his fans would be reminded what happened in Wizard's First Rule and could therefore grab it hot off the presses on its release date. But for someone like me (who, 15 years later, bought the boxed set and could immediately jump to the next book) that much recap was useless and frustrating.2)Repetition of certain concepts. I don't know what the problem was but it seemed Goodkind felt his readers couldn't remember basic facts about Kahlan or Richard. I was reminded in almost every chapter focusing on Kahlan that she was THE Mother Confessor and it was HER responsibility to watch over the little people of the Midlands. I GET IT! I remembered that just fine from WFR. Thankfully, around halfway through the book, Goodkind must've felt it was hammered in well enough and moved on to telling the story. It also seems that Richard can't even touch the Sword of Truth without Goodkind throwing in that Richard \\"felt the word 'Truth' on the hilt digging into his palm\\". Cut the drama of useless detail and get on with it.3) Way too much sap. And this is bad coming from a chick. I know, I know, \\"but they discovered they could love each other and not hide their feelings\\" blah, blah. Instead of condensing this into one or two effective, touching and poignant scenes, this drags on with every chapter Rich and Kahlan are together until they're separated, which is when I took a sigh of relief. I needed them to have some time apart!4) Characters talking to each other as if they're stupid. This happened a handful of times between Zedd and Adie; Zedd is a wizard, Adie, a sorceress. There should be at least a base of common knowledge between the two. The best analogy I can make is to pretend that they both have Ph.Ds in physics, but one is telling the other how Newton formulated his theory of gravity, or explaining how sub-atomic particles work. That should not happen, ever! Goodkind should've thought of better ways to teach his readers this system of magic besides dialogue, especially between the two most skilled wizards of the story (so far) after Darken Rahl. It was forced, fake and boring.Again, this is NOT a bad story, it was bad editing. I recommend reading it, but be aware of the crap you're gonna have to skirt around to finish it."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"I own both book and ebook.

Not as good as Wizard's First Rule, but still quite decent.The kindle version, however, should get zero stars. The amount of errors in the book is just... laughable. I counted roughly FIFTY grammatical and spelling mistakes scattered around, along with an entire section completely out of place. Obviously, there was no proofreading done whatsoever.

After I read the first I knew the secondone would be just as good. I was right it was excellent."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Very Good, but not great... good characterisation and descriptions, the prolonged graphic descriptions are there for a purpose, not from a morbid pre-occupation with rape or pain - we see the results of his months of torture with Denna (book#1) causing the deaths of two Sisters - without being pre-armed with his forceful hate of collars, we would think his refusal to wear one a bit pig-headed.Many things are injected into the plot whose significance is not apparent until much later - I found myself forgetting about Scarlet, until she suddenly appears; probably the egg will have a significance in the next book(s).Altogether a good sustaining read - never boring - makes you want to continue straight on to the next book in the series.My Wife has just finished 'Temple of the Winds' (book#4) and says it continues to be just as exciting, unlike the 'Wheel of Time' series."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Okay, loved The Wizards First Rule, but I wasn't too happy about the end of Stone of Tears. It was way too easy! Richard kills the Sister of the Dark and doesn't send his Daddy to the nether regions of hell, which he'd already been warned severly of doing. I understand Goodkind was going for emotion, but in doing so he left the whole thing unsatisfying. I felt betrayed. I mean, I've read enough books to know you never really kill off a main character like Kahlan, so ,to me, the emotional battle was secondary. Richard had it too easy."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"This book was great. I can't say which book I liked better, WFR or this one. The story starts right off where it left you in WFR. The characters were alive and made me feel like I was right there with them on there journey. Richard finds out that he made a few mistakes in WFR and has to set them right. Richiard gets captured and collared again but this time by the sisters of the light. Yet while Richard was captured he accomplished and learned what was needed to save the world once again from his father Darken Rahl and the Keeper of the under world. In the mean time Kahlan tries to find Zedd to tell him that the sisters of the light have Richard and she too gets side tracked into a midland war.

The Stone of Tears is totally amazing. I was completely aborbed into the story. Once I started I could not put it down.

As the story grows deeper I find myself more involved within the saga, as if I'm actually there.

Well, it's not about the book per se, which by the way I thouroughly enjoyed. I read the reviews of others but rarely do I base my opinion on what they say. I enjoyed this book immensely and will be running out to get the third on very soon!!Now for my gripe: Who is this guys flipping editor? With the first book, there were stupid errors in grammar and sentences that had the wrong words in them, things spelled wrong and just not making sense. In this one, I find the lack of punctuation to be very disconcerting. It is annoying as I am reading to come to what should be the end of a sentence, but because it lacks the appropriate punctuation, not knowing it is the end and having the entire sentence make no sense to me.While this book also has a few grammatical and spelling errors, I find the lack of punctuation to be appaling.How the \\"editor\\" missed these things is beyond me!Mr. Goodkind, if you read this, e-mail me!

Goodkind's writing is stilted, amateurish, and honestly, I have read better fanfiction from teenagers. This is the first Sword of Truth book I have read, and it is also the last. Actually, I only managed to get through a hundred pages before the wangsting became too much for me. \\"Oh, woe is me!\\" Richard sobbed. \\"Kahlan doesn't love me anymore, but I still love her so I will be a wangsty hero and let her go. There is nothing to live for anymore!\\" That's pretty much all I got out of a hundred pages. If I hadn't had to write a book reviewfor class, I wouldn't even have read the end, because I seriously don't care what happens to these characters.I don't get how people rant and rave about how good these books are and how 'Legend of the Seeker', which is a surprisingly good show very loosely based on these books, does not do it justice. Personally, I think these books are not worthy of the show, and Terry Goodkind should be grateful that someone took the time to make a better version of his world instead of criticizing it at every turn."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Stone of Tears continues where the first book left off.

The idea that it goes on for seven more books is a little frightening to me if this is the tone that's being set for the series this early.Again, depending on how much of the genre you've read, this is an enjoyable read if you're not expecting any ground-breaking ideas or direction, or a break in formula, and just looking for a fun book."},{"Title":"Stone of Tears: A Sword of Truth Novel (Sword Of Truth)","review":"Stone of Tears starts off quick, bringing you quickly back into Richard and Kahlans world before the first chapter is out. It picks up where the first book left off, and continues telling the exciting story, and picks it up a few notches. Everything in Stone of Tears is more extreme, the action, the plot, the dilemmas, and the romance. I cried when I read this book, and I can sit through anything Hollywood puts out without so much as wet eyes, but this book made me cry.I'd consider it the best one out of the Sword of Truth series, closely followed by the first and the third in the series, which were both excellent as well. It sort of has something for everyone, its full of omens and portents, giving a thinker some foreshawdowing to work out, it has a fabulously written war sequence, battles between a small heartened army and a much larger force, it has romance to boot, and it is packed full of the stuff you loved from Wizards First Rule, magic, swordfighting, barriers to be overcome, and a cast of unforgetable characters that continues to grow, without too much recycling.Plus, it has Gratch, and everyone loves Gratch.

and so on and so on. if one were to study only this nikaya they could have an extremely firm and clear grip on what buddhism is. actually you could easily say that about each nikaya, they are all amazing works of stunning beauty and infinite depth! in this volume he teaches the eightfold path, dependent origination, the four truths, jhana meditation, the story of his enlightenment and first discourse, the story of his struggle before his enlightenment, and so much more! the amount of information in here is staggering! and again, i think he teaches all that stuff in the other nikayas as well. this one just happens to be my favorite at the moment.i cannot say enough good things about this book. it is indispensable. if i had to only own one single book, it would be this one.end review, the following is notes for those who need more information on the pali canon, agamas, mahayana and vajrayana:*the pali canon nikayas counterpart, called the agamas, in the taisho tripitaka (chinese equivalent of the pali canon, including the old, original buddhist texts as well as all the later mahayana texts**) also have parts that are equally old, but the pali canon was committed to writing first and is all from one school whereas the taisho is combined from many schools and many different points in time. hence, while there are others that have parts as old as the pali canon, the pali canon is still the best way to go if you want consistency and if you want the earliest written recension (as opposed to oral translation) as the sanskrit originals that are the sources for the taisho agamas were committed too writing about 100 years (and more as they are of mixed recensions from different schools) after the pali canon.this is a little confusing but i'll try to clarify quickly: the buddha died and later his sangha split up into different schools. all the different schools shared mostly the same texts and teachings but only passed them down orally for 200 or so years. then the theravada recorded theirs in writing in the first century BC. then the sarvastivadins recorded theirs in writing in the first century AD. the theravada still exist and continually passed down their texts up until today in the same language and format, it's still recorded in pali (actually magadhi, closely related to sanskrit) which is the language spoken by the buddha himself.the sarvastivadins ceased to exist over time. their texts were brought too china bit by bit and recorded by translation from sanskrit into chinese over a few centuries. also some of the texts in the agamas were from other extinct schools canons and also of different dates and all of them committed their tripitakas to writing after the theravada. very little of the sanskrit source material for the chinese translated agamas are extant so all we have are the translated versions.so there you have it, both are very old but the pali canon is slightly older, all from one school, and more consistent. however if you compare the agamas with the nikayas you find great similarity. the texts they share are sometimes nearly identical. the texts they don't are still very similar in general ideas and core teachings and principals. this really speaks to the oral transmission method! this means that even though the schools split up and continued to pass it along only orally they still kept it mostly the same! i had always thought the telephone game effect would wreck any oral traditions but apparently not! very cool stuff.**mahayana and also vajrayana (tibetan buddhism) texts are texts that came about after the agamas and nikayas were already finished and canonized. so the theravadins, sarvastivadins, and all the other old schools had their tipitaka/tripitaka complete and agreed upon, then they split up and then later these new sutras appeared on the scene. generally mahayana starts appearing about first century AD or slightly before and continued to be created for centuries after. vajrayana appeared even later than that and continued for many centuries after as well. these later inventions are where zen, pure land, vajrayana, and all the other schools came from."},{"Title":"The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha: A Translation of the Majjhima Nikaya (Teachings of the Buddha)","review":"This is part of a greater series, but it is an essential book for Buddhists to have. It is all the middle discourses as aggregated by the monks. While we talk about the suttas and stories that frame the Buddhist mindset, usually they are third party analogs or commentary. This is the direct teachings of the Buddha and written in a very enjoyable prose. I read a chapter every night and go to sleep with inspiration for the next day."},{"Title":"The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha: A Translation of the Majjhima Nikaya (Teachings of the Buddha)","review":"NOTE: the following review applies to the 1995 edition. Two editions since have come out, the most recent in 2005. Some comments here likely do not apply to the most recent edition. If you purchase the book, try to ensure you are getting the most recent version.--------For my review of this translation I decided to take a different tack. Since I am not a Pali scholar I am not qualified to critique Bhikkhu Bodhi's (or Ven. &Ntilde;anamoli's) translation, so I thought I would turn to someone who is-namely, L.S. Cousins of the University of Manchester writing in The Journal of Buddhist Ethics (Vol. 4, 1997).Cousins criticizes the title, specifically the word \\"new,\\" since most of the translation was done by &Ntilde;anamoli in the 1950s, not by Bhikkhu Bodhi in the 1990s. Indeed, in Cousin's view, Bodhi's contribution is fairly cosmetic in the sense of making the text more readable, and of lending more flexibility to certain Pali terms. In this sense he commends BB by making the text approachable to modern readers who are not themselves scholars. This is, however, about the only good thing he has to say of Bhikkhu Bodhi's work.Other significant points are:-A lack of clarity as to which source text is being used. BB claims it is the PTS edition, but Cousins doubts this as the text often follows earlier Sinhalese editions that &Ntilde;anamoli likely had available.-No use of recent scholarship.-Many old mistakes are perpetuated, and even some inaccuracies that &Ntilde;anamoli had removed are reinstated.-Cousins deplores the large scale cutting of repetition, pointing out that when the original-with the full repetitions-is chanted aloud, it has a certain, meditative effect on the mind; this is lost in the edited, written version. (I have to disagree with Cousins here: since most people in the West will approach the Suttas through the written word, my feeling is translators need to make the originals digestible in that form.)-Lastly, he notes BB's uncritical acceptance of the commentarial tradition, something I have harped on in other places commenting on BB's work.As regards the introduction, like Walshe's for his Digha Nikaya translation, Bodhi's is necessarily fairly basic, but does go further. For example, his discussion of certain critical terms such as dhamma, sankhara, namarupa, etc, is more informative. I always read introductions, but not everyone does-my wife, for instance, will not even read a two page author's preface. For someone in a rush (though I'm not sure how one would rush through a one thousand plus page book) and who is already well informed on these matters, the introduction is dispensable. Someone more beginning, though, would do well to read it carefully.On the Majjhima Nikaya specifically: This is the second of the five nikayas (\\"collections\\") that make up the Sutta Pitaka (\\"Basket of Discourses\\"). In accordance with its title, the 152 suttas (\\"discourses\\") here are not generally as lengthy as those in the Digha Nikaya, though they are often more substantive. The entire teaching, in some way or another, is touched on here, and some of the most important of the Buddha's discourses are included in this collection. It is repetitious, however, even with the generous editing of repetitive passages. There really is no way around this, though, and readers need to be patient. Not every discourse is a treasure; some are nearly verbatim reruns of previous ones. However, a benefit of this (if one is charitable) is that important issues are more likely to sink in deep; that is, you can begin to get a sense for where the real emphases are in the Buddha's Teaching.While it is important to be grateful to Bhikkhu Bodhi for his many years of labor on this and other works of translations, I am left scratching my head over why no able team of scholars has ever been put together in the way that Biblical translation teams are. Why is it always a lone translator trying to capture a literature that is many times more voluminous than the Bible? Certainly there are other monks, scholars and interested individuals who could add their talents to the project of translating Buddhist scriptures. It is high time that we stop relying upon the understanding and insight of individuals-always limited, however learned they may be-for our access to these vital documents."},{"Title":"The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha: A Translation of the Majjhima Nikaya (Teachings of the Buddha)","review":"A very good book for understanding the early discipline taught for buddhist for meditation from the Buddha.

The repetitions really help the stuff to sink in. I suggest you don't skim over the repetitive parts (the translator having removed 80% of repetitions anyway) to let your brain build new wholesome samskaras. The high percentage of \\"water\\" is designed to keep your brain circuits under-occupied to facilitate analysis of the implications/relations of what you read.- Still you can almost feel how some sutras must have been made up by the subsequent generations of buddhists -- e.g. most of the ones where Buddha talks to brahmins were obviously designed to promote buddhism among brahmins etc. I would say about 30-40% of suttras in this nikaya are of that kind.- What I found interesting is how this buddhism seems to have much more practical, and should I say, psycho-therapeutic flavor than in later teachings like Abhidharma or Mahayana or Tibetan stuff. The focus is clearly on getting rid of discontent on the personal level. Monitoring emotions through meditation on breathing, healing the old wounds by isolating from experiences that trigger pathological reactions, overcoming the negativism by volitional generation of positive mood -- these are the topics this nikaya keeps hammering again and again.- Didn't like the introduction at all -- there's clearly too much of the translator/editor in them -- skewing the tone and the emphasis of the sutras. I definitely recommend skipping the intro and the backnotes on the first read.- My favorite suttras are #118-119 and #140."},{"Title":"The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha: A Translation of the Majjhima Nikaya (Teachings of the Buddha)","review":"Don't be fooled by the name.

Still, when I look at the endless list of books currently in print, old and new, addressed to Buddhist topics, I cannot help but think there may finally be too many of them! Can there really be a market for books devoted to such questions as What if the Buddha Dated? Or to Buddhism and Bears? Goodness.I am particularly puzzled by this mountain of books because I know that, buried deep within it, is the real bedrock of Buddhism, the ancient Sutta Pitaka, of which the Majjhima Nikaya (or Middle Length Discourses) is the second volume. Why doesn't this bedrock generate as much popular enthusiasm as that readily inspired by the less significant edifices merely erected upon it? Derived from orally transmitted texts, the Sutta Pitaka is virtually as old as the Buddha himself, and is presumed by many (though of course not all) to preserve the oldest and most authentic account of his teaching, his personality and his life. Nearly everything else we are familiar with in Buddhism springs from it. Though one might have to detour around rather a lot of unrelated material in it to find the Buddha's ideas specifically regarding dating or bears, I believe it is probably all there, neatly fitted into only a few powerfully poetic volumes.And thanks to the brilliant scholarship and profound comprehension of Buddhism possessed by many modern translators (for the Majjhima they are are Nanamoli and Bodhi), these have become thoroughly readable, easily accessible works. They teem with the sights, sounds and reality of Buddha's everyday world and the issues which concerned him most. The Sutta Pitaka is peopled by his friends and enemies, and enlivened by his ideas, his frustrations and his triumphs.I think this translation of the Majjhima lacks the warmth, charm and wit which Walshe achieved in translating the preceding volume, the Digha Nikaya (or Long Discourses). However this Majjhima is second to none in authority, scholarship and elegance of translation. Nanamoli (British by birth and education) is reputed to be among the most creative and innovative scholars ever to translate Pali literature into English, and this is one of his finest efforts. It also profits from the collaborative effort of Bikkhu Bodhi (originally an American) who has long been at the forefront of making Pali texts accessible to English-speaking readers.Wisdom Publications, which claims to publish works from all major Buddhist tradtions (but which in reality seems totally mesmerized by anything Tibetan or Tantric) deserves much credit for going far enough afield to print both the Digha and Majjhima Nikayas, and for having in press even now a long-awaited new translation by Bodhi of the Samyutta Nikaya, the third volume of the Sutta Pitaka.As much as I admire these books, it is only fair to caution the reader that, though the text is always readable and interesting, there is a quality peculiar to both the Majjhima and the Digha Nikayas which probably results from their having existed for centuries before being committed to paper: some sections are spelled out in elaborate detail, whereas other ideas and concepts are presented in a very condensed, almost shorthand way, as though the reader is expected to have grown up knowing many fundamental and basic ideas ahead of time. However, fear not. The translators of both volumes provide comprehensive, highly informative introductions and thorough, helpful footnotes. The result is to educate the reader as-you-go in many of the most vital Buddhist notions, and with a minimum of inconvenience or confusion.In closing, let me change my mind about something I said earlier. I guess there can't be too many books about Buddhism. Perhaps the problem is simply that many of the people curious about it are being tempted to jump in at the wrong place. They are being deluged with secondary works, without being advised to ground themselves in the real thing -- the Sutta Pitaka -- first. So my suggestion is to buy and read this version of the Majjhima Nikaya (and Walshe's earlier version of the Digha Nikaya) and then go on to the fun stuff. It will feel a lot like mastering a conventional clutch before trying out an automatic transmission for the first time."},{"Title":"The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha: A Translation of the Majjhima Nikaya (Teachings of the Buddha)","review":"If there is one book in English that all Buddhists should read, this is the one. The Majjhima Nikaya (Middle-length Discourses) is, along with the other nikayas of the Pali Canon, probably as close as we can come today to reading the actual words of the Buddha. The Mahayana sutras have their own great virtues, with their lofty vision and profound scope, but these Middle-length Discourses are on a much more human scale. What a joy and inspiration it is to walk with the Buddha through the villages of ancient India and hear his teachings to monks, royalty, peasants and members of the other religious sects of the time. Although his teachings weren't put into writing for several centuries after his death, the monks of that period put great emphasis on memorization and group recitals to ensure that nothing was lost. This lovely English translation is a great treasure for the modern world, and particularly for all Buddhists."},{"Title":"The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha: A Translation of the Majjhima Nikaya (Teachings of the Buddha)","review":"Hard work, diligent effort, and a commitment to share the Dharma, all combine into this one book. This is an extensive piece of work. Bhikkhu Bodhi has compiled the Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha into a fine reference guide for us all to enjoy.The discourses, which are talks that the Buddha gave, were chanted for over a hundred years after the passing of the Buddha and were eventually written down. They were written in the same form as the chants, which offer many repetitions, which like any song/chant, makes it easier to remember.I would not suggest this to be the first book on Buddhism or the Buddha's teachings for most people unless you are a scholarly type. There are numerous wonderful books available that would benefit most people before delving into such a comprehensive book. That being said, once you have done some reading and want to explore the teachings of the Buddha in more depth, this is the perfect book. For me, I feel this is as close to the original teachings of the Buddha as we can get, now some 2,500+ years later.I find myself returning to this book often. Reading a discourse, and then contemplating and seeing how it applies in my life, brings much happiness and joy."},{"Title":"The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha: A Translation of the Majjhima Nikaya (Teachings of the Buddha)","review":"I bought this book back in 1995 when it first came out. After reading the first 10 pages or so and tackling a few of the suttas, I set it back on the shelf unread and left it there for 7 years. For various reasons, i.e. more lessons in humility, this Summer about mid July 2002, I dusted it off and started reading again. Wow-what a blast, a direct shot from the Buddha to me! It was clear, simple and unmistakable. \\"If you do and think this way, you will receive that kind of result.\\" Across the centuries and millenia flew the dhamma! As they say when the student is ready the teacher will appear. Maybe I needed to suffer another 7 years before I'd consent to read the dhamma in its original form. Yeah the Mayahana cannon is brillant too. As other reviewers have mentioned this is not a book for the faint hearted. If you buy it be prepared to read something like the King James version of the Bible, but with one important difference--the Majjhima Nikaya (MN) reveals the Ultimate and realtive truth about you and your immediate situation. Its actually a little more readable than the King James. I can only say \\"ditto\\" to all the other reviewers who have mentioned \\"why only read the second hand information from contemporary authors when the real dirt is right here\\". If you wanted to keep a secret from an Amercian Buddhist the best place to hide it would be somewhere in the Majjhima Nikaya! That's the last place they'll ever look. Sure I've had Buddhist teachers suggest to the group that we read the suttas but somehow Rumi or Mary Oliver always seemed a lot more inspiring. And Rumi and Mary Oliver are great writers of the universal dhamma. I hope this doesn't sound angry or cynical because I'm smiling and joyful as I write it. But in reading the MN I find myself feeling that practicing and living the Buddha Dharma is a lot more simple and reachable here and now than I ever got from reading recent authors. If you buy it, try reading the simple suttas first. Jump around and read whatever topic catches your eye. Use the summaries and subject index. In fact, read through all 152 summaries first and then pick the discourse that seems most interesting to you. By the way, I'm only about 2/3 of the way through the book right now. I still have another 40 discourses or so to go. I'm grateful to Bhikkus Bodhi, Nanamoli and Wisdom Publications for having provided me with the original and best teachings directly written for my benefit right in the palms of my hands. I'll come back and add another note when I get through the next 40 discourses.

This book was written from the point of view of what a physician should tell a patient who has some sort of ailment of the brain or nerves. Some of the information is no longer the generally accepted. For example, there are not 24 spinal vertebrae. Most of the time technical terms are avoided in order to ease explanation. But though the cranial nerves are not all named and explained, the ending of the spinal nerves is properly labeled the cauda equina (horse's tail).That's what makes the usefulness of this book questionable. Pool describes certain procedures as being painful. In the last thirty years some of these procedures have become less painful. Yet at the same time pain in the left arm is still a valid sympton for diagnosing CVA's.Something that might be interesting is reading what Pool considered topline medicine in the 1970's. For example as Pool wrote this book, brain surgery for a leaking aneurysm \\"can now be successfully treated\\" 95% of the time, whereas 15 years before Pool wrote his book such operations were only 50% successful. It never ceases to amaze me how much medicine has changed over the last ten years."},{"Title":"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas","review":"David Bornstein has done a world a great service by writing \\"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas,\\" a systemic account (with case studies) of how social entrepreneurs effect change in the world. I think that the book's main argument -- that social entrepreneurs are wired just like entrepreneurs, except that they're driven by a desire to do social good rather than to make money -- is on the mark. The book also points out that the defining characteristic of an entrepreneur is his/her drive in pursuing one idea/goal. (In that regard, there's no difference between Florence Nightingale and Mark Zuckerberg.) I also agree with the author's argument that people matter more than ideas, and it is the effective execution of an idea (some stubborn and recalcitrant visionary who pushes an idea through enormous resistance to change) that defines the impact of the idea on the world.This book is essentially about Bill Drayton and his Ashoka organization, which seeks to be the venture capital firm/incubator of the world's social entrepreneurs. It's a brilliant and effective insight to see that good business/management discipline needs to be applied to NGOs as they are applied to corporations, and that's why Ashoka is so effective at what it does.Unfortunately, from my own personal experience, Ashoka really is the minority in the non-profit world. When I was working for the United Nations in Afghanistan I dealt with a lot of NGOs, and most of them seemed to me fly-by-night operations that were most interested in quickly obtaining funding than in effecting real change. These NGOs were often headed by charismatic visionaries who, if anything, lacked discipline and management skills. And that was the way in Afghanistan because that's what the market demanded: the United States government wanted to show fast results, and it was willing to pay a lot of money to individuals who could show short-term results. And unfortunately it's in the nature of governments and societies to care more about short-term statistics than to care about long-term real growth that genuinely improves the lives of ordinary people."},{"Title":"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas","review":"\\"Rejoicing in the world, His earth,And having my delight in the sons of men.\\" -- Proverbs 8:31Can one person make a difference for the poor, the helpless, and those with no hope? The case histories in this book will encourage you to think that it's more than possible: The process can be studied, taught, and encouraged as journalist David Bornstein recounts this point through his story of what the Ashoka foundation is doing to develop social entrepreneurs and establish a discipline that can be rapidly improved through sharing of best practices. Whether you are a social entrepreneur, want to become one, or want to encourage what they do, this book is must reading. It systematizes much of what is scattered throughout many speeches, good stories, brief articles, and a variety of excellent books.The book's main weakness is that it doesn't do enough to draw more than big-picture conclusions about social entrepreneurs. To me, those profiled here simply look like successful business model innovators who care more about the social impact of what they do than the financial rewards for themselves. As a result, the book's focus is a little too narrow to be totally useful. There are also for-profit entrepreneurs who great vast amounts of social benefit using different, but similar, methods to what is described here. Both groups can learn a lot from one another. I suspect that there are also other streams of creativity conjoining as well, such as I often see accomplished by people who want to systematically raise up socially conscious entrepreneurs by the tens of millions in Africa, Asia, and South America.I hope that this book will be updated and expanded in scope every year or two. That will be a great blessing for those who are interested in the field and those who want to help it advance.Bravo, Mr. Bornstein!"},{"Title":"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas","review":"Social entrepreneurs are a relatively new breed in their field but their numbers are growing larger and their influence growing stronger each year. How to Change the World features the stories of several successful social entrepreneurs with personal stories that detail the challenges and many obstacles placed in their paths each day as the struggled to make the world a better place. Many of these entrepreneurs were considering a career that including the owning/operating of their own business enterprise. But instead of going for the money, these individuals chose a different path. They felt a life calling that was more directly associated with the improvement of individual lives and they accepted and embraced this challenge even though they could have made a much better living as a business entrepreneur.This book includes more than twenty different stories of personal sacrifice and courage and most all of the stories are inspiring and memorable. The range of social activism is pretty wide in this book, even though improving health seems to be one of the primary concerns of a large percentage of these social entrepreneurs. Whether the cause is direct, like providing immunizations against polio, or indirect and ongoing, like educating cultures about the importance of sanitary conditions, each of the stories offered in this book is unique in its own way and its methods and successes vary from one entrepreneur and one location to the next. Some of the stories are very positive and have been very successful, almost from the start. Others have been more frustrating for the parties involved and have required greater patience and strategy to achieve desired results.Bill Drayton is the founder of Ashoka and he speaks at many points throughout the book. Drayton's Ashoka organization is responsible for the continued financial and moral support of many of the social entrepreneurs presented in this book and if I'm not mistaken, all of the success stories presented in How to Change the World include individuals who are members of Ashoka. This association of social entrepreneurs has strict guidelines and only the most dedicated individuals to their respective causes are selected to become Ashoka fellows. At present, Ashoka has grown to more than two thousand fellows in more than sixty nations around the world and it continues to grow in influence as the profession of social entrepreneurialism continues to grow and thrive.If there is any small criticism to make with How to Change the World, it would be the fact that it doesn't directly explain how to change the world. When I first heard of this book, I assumed it was going to be a book about social activism and the necessary steps needed to get licensed, jump the regulation hurdles, etc. to become a social entrepreneur. Instead, this is a book about success stories. There is no direct explanation on what to do if one decides to become a social entrepreneur. The actions of the leaders in each story are meant to serve as inspiration and as an example of what steps to take. Also, it would be nice if the book included more statistical facts to illustrate the success stories. I fully believe what the book says, but having more numeric illustrations, graphs, tables, etc., would enhance this book.Overall, How to Change the World is a very good book about the difference that a few hard- working and determined individuals can make when they decide to take up an important cause and press forward with their dreams for social change. The stories the book presents are inspiring in their own unique ways and they illustrate the difficulties, challenges, frustrations, and triumphs that one can experience when they decide to take on the role of a social entrepreneur."},{"Title":"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas","review":"David Bornstein captures the spirit, determination and passion of social entrepreneurs from all around the globe.I was especially delighted to read about my friend and mentor Bill Drayton, of the Ashoka Foundation.

You can sense it in vigorous retirees still aching to contribute; and in restless baby boomers ready to marry the idealism of the '60s to all their practical skills gained since then. And you can easily detect it in young people. They refuse to inherit such hollow, bankrupt ideas as slavishly working and consuming being either their destiny or patriotic duty.Without question, many people are ready to roll up their sleeves and dig in to fix, or at least substantially address, the very problems that evade governments and established institutions.Some folks, David Bornstein shows us, are doing that all over the world already.This thoughtful, well-researched book serves up plenty of hope replete with case studies from around the globe. Dig in to this book and you will believe that people with imagination and commitment can make substantial contributions. (Though, despite the author's assertion, it still helps, in a major way, to have connections to those with money or power.)The book makes the case that a few driven people (who, as Bornstein points out, are not selfless) can make a major impact when more powerful players are either not willing or not capable to do what needs doing.STORIES OF SOCIAL ACTIONThe tapestry woven by Mr. Bornstein is mostly a collection of enlightening biographical profiles of social movers (in India, Brazil, South Africa, Hungary...). You'll find chapters on Florence Nightengale (yes, the 19th century British nurse), Bill Drayton, the founder of Ashoka (the organization that provides much of the foundation for Bornstein's interest and research), and others who've made great contributions with little notice.Interspersed with the biographical profiles are essays about the phenomenon of social entrepreneuring. There is a chapter describing the &quot;Six Qualities of Successful Social Entrepreneurs&quot; (placed between an account of India's movement to provide access for the disabled, and a profile of former Unicef head James P. Grant).GRAND MISSIONS, A PRACTICAL OMISSIONQuite surprisingly, what's not to be found in the book is the content promised in its very title: HOW TO. For all the delights to be found in this far-reaching and well-documented work, that's a glaring gap. The title (probably the publisher's fancy) more accurately should have been: &quot;Changing the World&quot; or &quot;People Who Are Making a Difference&quot; or anything else that neither stated nor implied HOW TO.The book's title is accurate in regard to its reference to changing the world. Bornstein's &quot;How to Change the World&quot; focuses on grand schemes that do demonstrably change parts of the world.And that's a shortcoming for most of us readers. Profiling extraordinary social entrepreneurs -- whom the book describes as being &quot;possessed&quot; -- is a bit like using the biographies of Ted Turner, Richard Branson, and Bill Gates to make the case that starting a business can make a major impact on the world. You certainly must agree, but you don't really know what to do about it. (Unless the &quot;HOW TO&quot; is to hope and pray that more possessed people step forward to do good works rather than chase more lucrative traditional careers.)&quot;How to Change the World&quot; definitely is not a primer on how to do good works on a modest scale. In fact, there isn't so much as a sidebar distilling lessons for the aspiring social entrepreneur (something such as &quot;How to Convert Your Own Stirrings Into Social Action&quot;). A quasi-practical-sounding chapter on &quot;Blueprint Copying&quot; essentially says that it's a good idea not to reinvent the wheel if you don't have to.So I left the book as I started it, still hungry for actionable advice on how to give birth to my own nascent, modestly ambitious, do-gooding idea (creating a tradition -- and mechanism -- whereby every December 26th people donate their unwanted holiday gifts to charities that can redistribute them or otherwise mine them for value. &quot;Gift Back Day&quot; would be a charitable version of England's Boxing Day.)CONCLUSIONReading this book, I did come to believe that:1) Exceptional people with neither high office nor deep pockets (but with unusual drive and maybe some well-placed connections) can accomplish great things -- and are doing that with very impressive results. And2) The mass media, destructively obsessed with tragedy and failure, has ignored social entrepreneuring while lazily traipsing around the old, familiar bastions of power.Interestingly, Mr. Bornstein notes in his Conclusion:&quot;To be sure, some social entrepreneurs seem hard-wired. But countless other people, perhaps less single-minded and obsessive in their focus, share the desire and possess the talent to build and support citizen organizations at all levels.&quot;Yes. And we'll be here waiting for a book that addresses us.[A related article on the social entrepreneur phenomenonappeared in the New York Times, December 20, 2003.]"},{"Title":"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas","review":"My takeaway from this highly inspirational book is: Dare to care. In a self-obsessed world, where the &quot;I&quot; reigns supreme, along comes a book that has the potential to change that for ever. I would be surprised if this book did not serve as a catalyst for all those people who are aching to leave their mark on the earth's future by altering the world for the better.In How to Change the World, author David Bornstein presents short biographies of ordinary citizens who have cared enough to actually go out and change what is wrong in society. The nine stories of social entrepreneurs or innovators, dubbed 'transformative forces' by the author, have the power to inspire readers to want to do something. The fine examples of social entrepreneurship within the pages of this book make one realize that there is hope for the planet after all.To quote Bornstein, &quot;Across the world, social entrepreneurs are demonstrating new approaches to many social ills and new models to create social wealth, promote social well-being, and restore the environment.&quot; What is tremendously energizing is that so many of these change agents already exist and are moving mountains for you and me, and for our children.The major contribution of the book is that it underlines that one doesn't have to be rich or powerful to alter the current reality. What is required is to feel empathy and concern in high doses, and to recognize and understand a problem. The stories trace how, if one is sufficiently charged, creative ideas for \`getting around' problem areas -- be it public apathy or bureaucratic indifference -- flow naturally. The hallmark of a true social entrepreneur really shines through at the next stage, when these ideas are converted into reality.For Bornstein, these illuminating stories are merely the fireworks display. What he goes on to do is to distill for us the factors that ensure success of any venture -- the do's, the don't's, the must-watch-out-for's, the how-to's. Everything that you ever needed to know about entrepreneuring, but didn't know where to start, is in here. What is the citizen sector and what have been its achievements thus far? What are the qualities of successful social entrepreneurs? What is so cutting-edge about their work that makes their strategy stand apart? Are they really effecting a systems change as against providing band-aid? What are the Four Practices of innovative organizations? Whom do you turn to if you want to become a social entrepreneur?Bornstein attempts to answer all these, and more. For the very first time ever, we have been given a viable, highly sophisticated blueprint for pattern-changing social action. Bornstein has done the world a service by putting this into the easy reach of anyone who has a conscience.Policy makers should make note of the book as it offers insights on how to look at problems and problem solving. It is particularly enlightening to note that all the social entrepreneurs in the book have facilitated some form of cross-sectoral partnership, be it with municipal-level governing bodies, state-level government departments, or businesses.The book also spotlights win-win models of strategic convergence between social good and businesses. Original and ingenious examples of the entrepreneurship process, and its effectiveness of strategy, could serve the business sector well.For academia, the book throws up diverse areas of social and economic concern that beg a relook and analysis.The media, saturated as it is with reports of a world gone horribly wrong, could infuse fresh hope and energy with incisive stories on the work of social entrepreneurs.And for young people, who hold the keys to the world's future, this book is a must-read. At an age when cynicism is almost a virtue, it will inspire them, and hammer home the realization that there is an alternative route to getting meaning from life. By changing others' lives."},{"Title":"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas","review":"This account of one man's efforts to revise the defintion of \\"entrepreneur\\" demonstrates the capacity of what can be achieved from small beginnings. Bill Drayton has created a \\"consulting\\" firm that girdles the world. Creator and promoter of Ashoka, a foundation dedicated to social change, Drayton uses a highly selective arrangement to locate and encourage people desiring social change. Their efforts, rarely, if ever, depicted in either mainstream media or even specialty publications, are here explained and endorsed. As is Drayton's unorthodox methods. Yet those methods, and the people adapting them to local conditions, have been demonstrably successful. They need further study and application.Drayton, through Bornstein's depiction, has redefined the term \\"entrepreneur\\" from its narrow economic framework into a broader and more flexible environment. Money \\"profit\\" is no longer the basis for evaluation. Instead, how widely can a new idea and its promoter[s] affect betterment of the people shunted aside by pure capitalism? Is the multinational the sole or even the major means for offering employment and economic gain? Must the values implied by major infusions of capital, often with restraints tied to the investment, be limited to what firms successful in developed countries decide? Drayton argues that instead of \\"top-down\\" economic structures, change for the better should come about by local initiative. How far this idea has spread is exemplified by the map opening the book. From Brazil to Bangladesh, people with drive, patience and talent have made, and are making substantive changes within their communities, regions and entire nations.The book provides real examples of people who identified a problem, then set about to improve conditions that had come to be accepted by social inertia. His opening example, that of Fabio Ruiz of Palmares, demonstrates how effective one person can be. Ruiz, living in a depressed area in Brazil, discovered how greatly something most of us take for granted, electrical power, could influence a local economy. Ruiz observed the condition of the rice farmers in the state. A steady supply of water would allow growth of successful crops. Erratic natural supplies, often interdicted by highland farmers, meant turning to groundwater supplies. Groundwater means pumps and petrol-driven pumps were expensive. Ruiz instituted an inexpensive method of distributing electricity throughout the area. The farmers provided the minimal investment and performed much of the labour. As electrification spread, farmers produced steady crop returns, reaching a level that led to marketing co-ops and economic independence. The programme meant dealing with banks, bureaucracy and competiton. Ruiz and his associates doggedly promoted their success, finally seeing it adapted to other regions. It's an object lesson for many rural farmers in the developing world.Drayton's methods require a draconian approach to assessing ideas, programmes and the people behind them. Once an idea is presented, the obstacles and restraints must be planned for. A good suggestion isn't enough. The people seeking Ashoka's support must demonstrate they can follow through and adapt to changing conditions or outright opposition. From Brazil, through Africa, into the Subcontinent of India and its neighbours, back through Europe and North America, his evalution teams are constantly assessing, inquiring, and selecting those individuals and their plans for improvement. Money, of course, must be stretched to the limit. Government funding is a bane to most NGOs, since too many conditions are generally tied to resource allocation. Drayton's entrepreneurs must demonstrate their proposals are good enough to use with local resources. Only that way can they be launched into a project with Ashoka support. These projects aren't limited to developing countries alone. Bornstein shows how these examples may be applied to any community feeling their social advancement is under restraint. The models are clearly spelled out in detail. The only thing lacking in your community is the individual who can clearly identify the problems and find innovative ways of implementing the solutions. Is that you? [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]"},{"Title":"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas","review":"David Bornstein's new book How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas offers a superb introduction to the burgeoning field of social entrepreneurship, which has gained prominence in the past two decades but is still awkwardly explained. Rather than group radically different projects under the umbrella term \\"social entrepreneurship,\\" Bornstein goes to the root and describes what makes a social entrepreneur. While well-known figures such as Florence Nightingale and Unicef head James P. Grant are described, most of the individuals profiled in the book are active, independent entrepreneurs found through the network resources of Bill Drayton's organization Ashoka: Innovators for the Public. Ashoka has broke new ground as a venture capital firm for social betterment, investing in carefully selected individuals and projects that promise long-term, sustainable returns - that is, positive social change - and more than any other organization promoting the ideas of social entrepreneurship around the globe.It is telling that, on the surface, the entrepreneurs described have little in common. Vera Cordeiro, for example, grew up comfortably in the pampered upper strata of Brazilian society, while AIDS worker Veronica Khosa was orphaned at an early age in an impoverished village in South Africa. F&aacute;bio Rosa is a born tinkerer and engineer who built dams and irrigation systems in his backyard as a child, while Erz&eacute;bet Szekeres was a mid-level tradesswoman who never considered the changing Hungary's treatment of the disabled until the birth of her disabled son. The variety of conditions and approaches Bornstein describes may appear bewildering at first, but in fact this breadth is perhaps most effectively drives the book's point home: Bornstein highlights the lateral thinking and tenacity of the entrepreneurs, who recognized and devoted themselves to solving problems others did not even acknowledge. Most of the entrepreneurs arrived at their methodologies through trial and error, never realizing at the time that others were engaged in analogous work in vastly disparate fields.Many entrepreneurs conceive of projects in modular or franchise terms, eschewing top-down fixes by fiat. Creating a hotline and crisis center for street children in India and promoting rural electricity and irrigation in Brazil have little in common, but both Jeroo Billimoria and F&aacute;bio Rosa saw that sustainable, long-term solutions would have to incorporate local interests and involvement. In this way projects can maintain core principles while adapting to local circumstances and needs, and entrepreneurs who struggle for years with a particular local problem hammer out a replicable and portable model that spreads quickly. The results surprise Bornstein himself on occasion:&quot;When I read about [Tomasz] Sadowski's work, my first thought was that Ashoka had made a mistake. If ever there was an idea that was destined to remain local, this was it. How many stable, self-managed, partially self-supporting homes made up of former prison inmates, alcoholics, and homeless people can you have?\\"The answer, as of early 2003, was twenty and counting.\\"Bornstein's writing is brisk and energetic, using a wry wit to strike a fine balance between the gravity of the work and the infectious energy of the entrepreneurs. This style of writing befits the entrepreneurs themselves, who do not dress up their language in niceties when bluntness is more effective. The reader is struck with both admiration and amusement, for example, reading how Indian disability activist Javed Abidi took advantage of physicist Stephen Hawking's visit to India to excoriate the government's reluctance to promote widespread disability access.\\"I would be absolutely grateful to Dr. Hawking,\\" Abidi told reporters, \\"if he would want to go to different parts of Delhi, like Janpath, Connaught Place, the public loo, and to any of the government offices or shopping centers and hotels and embarrass the authorities.\\"In this way the book avoids the pitfalls of excess piety and preachiness and instead reads like a collection of exciting and incredible life stories. Bornstein wisely lets the entrepreneurs' works and words speak for themselves whenever possible, and thus the book feels genuinely moving and inspirational rather than overwrought.I would recommend this book to anyone involved in policy-making or curious about the global potential of individual action. The ideas discussed in the book appear to be gaining momentum on a global scale, not merely that social entrepreneurship is an idea whose time has come, but because selfless and driven social entrepreneurs are bringing the idea to our time."},{"Title":"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas","review":"Bornstein's book might not be what people are looking for when they initially pick it up, however, overall it has a diverse plot. The sections are all very different and cover a variety of different people and places. One of my favorite chapters was chapter 10, Are They Possessed, Really Possessed, by an Idea? I liked where the writers bring up a strong point about the term, 'social entrepreneurs.' The term social entrepreneur is new to many people around the world, I remember saying it to my roommates and they looked at me like I was mildly crazy. However, the term is relevant to a lifestyle and purpose of life for many people who live it. The lifestyle explained by Bornstein in this chapter explains the character of the entrepreneur doesn't announce themselves, they work hard to gather important and relevant information for the good of the project, not for the good of themselves. They want this earth to be a better place for the earth, not for themselves. This was a great point and helped me to view the book as extremely helpful. It shares a variety of different stories, and helps to put cultural differences into perspective. I am enjoying this book very much!"},{"Title":"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas","review":"Every person Bornstein discussed has the inspired capacity for solving intricate social problems resourcefully and efficiently, and they are able to maneuver around seemingly insurmountable obstacles to accomplish their goals.James Grant of Unicef is particularly striking. His story illustrates how the provision of social services on a grand scale will be met with resistance, even if it is an easy one to distribute, is relatively inexpensive and could save thousands of lives. Grant never faltered, and activated his limited resources. As a result, he changed the world. Yet, there is a long road ahead on the mission towards immunizing all children against preventable diseases. Governments, investors, and all concerned citizens want to know the value of enterprises such as Unicef. Bornstein emphasizes in his conclusion that metrics for analyzing social value need to be developed in the civic sector in order to accurately evaluate the organization's ability to create social value. In the public health world, value is created in the number of sick individuals. The statistics that followed Grant's initiatives indicated lowered child mortality and improved qualities of life across the globe, which speak to the value of his work.Each entrepreneur exemplifies the nature of their work in different ways. Bornstein succeeds in drawing connections between each Ashoka fellow and teases out a skeleton of what an effective social entrepreneur might look like. A new generation could be in the grooming process of inheriting the legacy that these fellows have built from scratch."},{"Title":"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas","review":"How to Change the World, is an insightful book focused on people who strive to make this world a better place.

This book is very readable and without jargon, but it is not \\"dummed down\\" whatsoever. It is very thorough in both describing how various \\"social entrepreneurs\\" from around the world have succeeded in realizing their dreams to make the world a more liveable place and in laying specific guidelines for what it takes to become a successful social entrepreneur. He also alternates chapters from specific case studies to more general and practical tips on what one needs to do to succeed, thereby making it all the more interesting. In other words, after reading a case study, I would find myself inspired and wondering what I could do to put myself on the path towards social entrepreneurship. The next chapter would answer a lot of those questions and by the end of that chapter I couldn't wait to read more about real people and what they were doing to change the world.Before reading this book, I thought the title may too much hyperbole or perhaps a little \\"cheesey\\", but after finishing the book, the I think the title is perfect. In short, I highly recommend this book to anyone who's ever wished they could change the world for the better."},{"Title":"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas","review":"David Bornstein's book How to Change the World is worth reading if youa) prefer action instead of stagnancyb) prefer good solutions instead of persisting problemsc) prefer justice and opportunity instead of poverty and neglect, or,d) prefer good writing, period.Bornstein accurately writes, \\"Anyone who has ever dreamt of solving a problem or making a positive change in his or her environment will find encouraging and instructive stories here.\\" He takes us around the world to visit social entrepreneurs and find out what makes these people tireless fighters for their causes.Each profile is like an episode of VH1's Driven - we see what inspires these people, how they overcome obstacles, and why they succeed - but instead of following a pop star to a record deal and a fleet of Escalades, we watch social entrepreneurs achieve rights for people with disabilities, compassionate home care for HIV / AIDS patients, and electricity for the rural poor. Unlike celebrities or CEOs, these folks have no interest in fame and fortune. We are lucky indeed that Bornstein has taken it upon himself to describe their efforts; they are far too busy pursuing their dreams of a better world to stop and promote themselves. Many advocate endlessly for their causes, but as Bornstein points out, they have in common a willingness to work quietly, to share credit, and to plow through their own savings and time to make progress. Social entrepreneurs have a greater attachment to finding solutions than to being right, rich, or recognized.These and other common traits are highlighted throughout the book. We see that social entrepreneurs don't start with the perfect plan, they just have a complete commitment to solving a problem. Like a river they flow around obstacles of status quo, regulations, lack of funding, program design flaws, and changing needs, always adjusting and maneuvering to still reach their goals.The book is especially appropriate now because:1) Many people are questioning their ability to create change. No matter what your political leanings, it is easy to feel far from positions of power and authority. These profiles demonstrate that there is no stopping the power of a good idea in the hands of a passionate individual. Javed Abidi spent a year and a half lobbying for legislation that would ensure the rights of people with disabilities in India. With three days left of the government's session, the political parties were at an impasse. Abidi organized a protest of 300 people, got media attention, met with leaders, and the bill was signed into law. Abidi said, \\"India is a country where rallies of hundreds of thousands of people are not uncommon. Here was just a handful of people. But because they didn't stay home, it happened.\\" Because Abidi called them, they didn't stay home.2) Many people question the meaning and richness of their lives and careers. For people who are looking for a more rewarding and fulfilling sector, there is endless opportunity in being or supporting a social entrepreneur. Jeroo Billimoria was headed for a career in accounting, but when her father died she rethought her plan and moved into social work. Billimoria started Childline, a toll-free number that street kids in India can call for help. Former street kids answer the phones (learning skills through the work) and connect those in trouble with the agencies that can help them. Childline gets 1.5 million calls a year, and is spreading to 57 cities, and now, internationally. You could be another Jeroo Billimoria. Or one of the social workers who helped her. Or an employee who works in her program. Or a politician who is spreading her ideas. Or a donor who is funding them.3) Many people are more aware of global problems. It's easy to get depressed upon realizing the widespread poverty, disease, and disadvantages that are so pronounced in the developing world. And it's easy to get even more depressed when you see that well-funded, top-down, international aid programs aren't really working. This book doesn't overwhelm with bleak statistics, but instead makes you realize that there are people with answers. You can be one of them, or you can help one of them, and that will make the difference. The book shows that this is a global phenomenon, and one that can be nurtured by global communication and access. Veronica Khosa didn't set out to change healthcare of AIDS patients globally. She wanted to help those who were not receiving treatment in her township in South Africa. Her homecare model was spotted by the World Health Organization and UNAIDS, and is now being supported and replicated.For those who are looking for real change, Bornstein offers this: \\"One of the most important things that can be done to improve the state of the world is to build a framework of social and economic supports to multiply the number and the effectiveness of the world's social entrepreneurs.\\" The first step is to get this book."},{"Title":"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas","review":"This inspirational book should be in the hands of every career development person in every high school, college, and university. If I had known in my twenties or thirties (quite a while ago) that the field of &quot;social entrepreneur&quot; existed, it would have influenced my career path. Bornstein gives full credit to Bill Drayton's pioneering work with Ashoka in identifying the skill and character set necessary to succeed as a social entrepreneur and then finding and supporting these people in numerous countries around the globe. Readers can begin to assess, perhaps with feedback from friends and colleagues who know them well, whether or not they have what it takes to make it as a social entrereneur. By publicizing this field, which up until now has largely been flying under the radar of media attention, Bornstein has provided a significant public service. As more people learn about this new profession, more people with the skill and character set will get into it. As a result, more social problems in more countries will be addressed in ways that work and that can be replicated regionally and nationally. Just as social entrpreneurialism is a powerful leverage point for positive social change, I predict this book will be a leverage point for the development of social entrepeneur as a new career option. IF, and this is an important &quot;if&quot;, it gets into the right hands, namely, people who influence career choices. After reading this book, if you agree, you can amplify the public service by recommending it to any career development professionals you know. Some future social entrepeneurs and the future beneficiaries of their work will thank you."},{"Title":"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas","review":"You could fill a small library with books on what entrepreneurs do, how and why. However, until now, that library would have little to offer readers interested in non-profit entrepreneurship. The nine successful social entrepreneurs profiled here are global agents of change, risk takers and organization builders. However, they measure success not by how much money they make, but by how many lives they change. They care about helping abused children or parents with AIDS or impoverished farmers. In a saga that began as an article for The Atlantic Monthly, author and journalist David Bornstein profiles Bill Drayton, who founded an organization to support social entrepreneurs and foster citizen involvement. The book is a unique treatment of an important subject, and therefore valuable. Organizationally, it suffers from the author's decision to chop up the Drayton story and interject profiles of social entrepreneurs between the segments. The technique would probably work well in a television documentary, but gets a bit disjointed here. That quibble aside, we highly recommend this very significant book to anyone who wants to make a difference."},{"Title":"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas","review":"I found it inspiring and at the same time intimidating to contemplate the brilliant, hardworking people who inhabit this book. All of them committed their lives, talents, and fortunes to tackle seemingly endemic and chronic social problems, starting small and eventually spreading their good works throughout their nations and even globally. I recommend the book for anyone trying to improve their communities' health and welfare."},{"Title":"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas","review":"Bornstein awakens the entrepreneurial spirit inside of you as he details the stories of several innovative social entrepreneurs from around the world. Some of the social entrepreneurs he highlights, such as Florence Nightingale, were paving the way and laying the groundwork for future social entrepreneurs long before such a role in the world was considered to exist. Others encountered extreme adversity whether it was due to technology, politics or funding, which only encouraged them to work harder. If you're a changemaker considering undertaking a social initiative, these stories will help prepare you for your journey."},{"Title":"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas","review":"Bornstein's book speaks to the power of people. Hearing the accounts of extraordinary individuals and their perseverance really makes a person think about their own capacity and capabilities. Each social entrepreneur shared common core ideologies of tenacity, intelligence and determination. Their creativity to solve social problems brought about a whole new sense of pride and innovation to their communities. Though I was inspired and challenged to think beyond my comfortable bubble it was intimidating to imagine the strength needed to facilitate change and the audacity needed to face adversity and critics.One of the quotes that stood out the most to me was \\"In the fight for an ideal, we face those who are deceptive, envious and incompetent. The man who is firm pays no mind to such people and wastes no time counting them. For he who marches toward the light need not worry about what occurs in the darkness.\\" When I feel intimidated by the challenges that lie ahead I need to remember my vision and not let obstacles tear me down but to thrive and be a true change maker."},{"Title":"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas","review":"How to Change the World was such a pleasure to read. It was the first book I've read on the topic of social entreprenuership, and I really couldn't put it down. Bornstein conveyed such inspiration and hope through these real life stories of social good trailblazers who never give up. I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas","review":"I was a little disappointed that I didn't find this book as compelling as I had hoped. I have to admit however that the stories portrayed were inspirational.The synopsis writtten on the back of the book was misleading and I have to agree with one of the reviewers, Don Blohowiak when he said \\"Quite surprisingly, what's not to be found in the book is the content promised in its very title: HOW TO. For all the delights to be found in this far-reaching and well-documented work, that's a glaring gap. The title (probably the publisher's fancy) more accurately should have been: \\"Changing the World\\" or \\"People Who Are Making a Difference\\" or anything else that neither stated nor implied HOW TO.\\".Subtle nuances also lead me to believe this book to be more about the \\"social\\" venture capitalist Ashoka, its fellows and the \\"How To\\" become one of Ashoka's \\"Social Entrepreneur\\" recipients. There is nothing wrong with this for I believe Ashoka to be one of the leading and respectful venture capitalists in the world today. However, it would've been helpful if this was stated initially."},{"Title":"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas","review":"This book is a wonderful collection of stories about social entrepreneurs who were able to effect a change in their communities. Though not always 100% succesful, their stories illustrate that business, government, and social concerns do not have to be at odds with each other and in fact, they can often complement each other to bring about a greater good. For those in a corporate or academic setting, the chapters from this book could easily be excerpted and used as case studies for your organization. Highly recommended! If you liked this book, you should also read &quot;Banker to the Poor&quot; by Muhammad Yunus."},{"Title":"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas","review":"As a serial entrepreneur and teacher of entrepreneurship at the college level, I see social entrepreneurs emerging all around me. While many of the tools and techniques used by social entrepreneurs are the same as those learned and used by their more traditional counterparts, there's a tremendous amount to be learned from role models who are focused on developing enterprises that target social causes. This book does a wonderful job introducing social entrepreneurship through the stories of people who are actually doing it. The individuals profiled in this book, along with their causes, are diverse and can teach us a lot, irrespective of how we label ourselves as entrepreneurs. In general, I found this book to be well written, informative and inspiring, and believe that it has a lot to offer to anyone who wants to make a difference in the world.Steven K.

Bornstein does a great job of capturing the journey and practical principles of social innovators. Most edifying for those entering or seeking to understand this work is the examples and transparency found in each chapter as Bornstein gives insight to specific skillsets of Social Entrepreneurs. Bornstein must be commended for his work in exposing the commitment, passion, and fortitude of the individuals chronicled in this book. You certainly won't be disappointment but encouraged and more important inspired by this book."},{"Title":"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas","review":"I personally believe this is a great book for any individual who is interested in the field of social entrepreneurship or for one who wants to learn more about this emerging field. Since the term social entrepreneurship is a fairly new topic, Bornstein provides a great foundation for those interested in the topic by giving detailed examples of real life success stories in the field. It was perfect for the individual, like myself, who wanted a solid foundation about non profits and how they emerged into successful entities. I would suggest it to anyone who believes that working or starting a non profit might be in their near future."},{"Title":"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas","review":"\\"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurship and the Power of New Ideas\\" by David Bornstein is a book about social entrepreneurship, which is illustrated by examples from work being done by Ashoka Fellows. The book provides a history of social entrepreneurship and the organization, Ashoka, which was founded by Bill Drayton. Bornstein's book is very inspiring, motivational and informative in many respects, but by only using Ashoka Fellows it isn't very representative of social entrepreneurship endeavors as a whole and feels more like a plug/add for Ashoka. This however, isn't the point of the book, which is to inspire and offer hope to others to make an impact on society through others examples. The author also does an excellent job of introducing social entrepreneurship to those who may not be as familiar with this concept and encourages them to make a difference. This book is another informative read about the good people are doing all over the world, like \\"Half the Sky\\" by Nicholas Kristof, which also shouldn't be missed."},{"Title":"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas","review":"We read this as one of our books for the Harvard Extension school's Social Entrepreneurship class. It's a great book, very accessible with stories that travel a quick loop around the globe. While broad, it presents emotional and rationale reasons for how to change the world. It is worth your time. It shows how you can make a difference in a community even if you have nothing, e.g. no running water? no electricity? One young man's approach is not only resourceful, but he changes the way his community lives and now the whole country! (I also recommend reading Half the Sky, a wonderful, emotionally upsetting book about injustices in the world that people are trying to right: one singular person at a time -- it makes you jump up onto your feet because you can't sit there doing nothing, you have to do something, and fight back)."},{"Title":"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas","review":"As someone just entering the social entrepreneurial space, this was a good segway into the sector. Bornstein does a good job at highlighting different social entrepreneurs and their strategy to success."},{"Title":"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas","review":"Theme of book is change. Stories about people who have changed world and analysis of common trends of these social entrepreneurs. Lots of details, mostly boring details of little interest to average student (economics, history of organization with lots of acronyms, statistics). However, these stories are real and you are encouraged to step up and follow in the footsteps of these men and women who are still alive, impacting the world. Stories of real men and women, who they are, what they have done, what they continued to do to this day. Note: some of these people are doing so great of things that you might feel incompetent and faulty but author's message is not to compare yourself to these people but rather to see that you as a human being possess the power to make changes, to help everyone around you. Don't have to change world; can help to make your home community a better place if want. Key: passion and determination to make world better place to live. Author delves into personalities of these people, how they act, their attitudes toward life, and you are tempted to ask, \\"Am I like them?\\" Do I have the courage, the will, the desire to change this world, or to change this community, to make it a better place to live for all? From political standpoint, consider this: trend has been private organizations in control, then governments step in (try to do everything like welfare, social security, health care) but can't handle everything, so citizen sector/nonprofits charities/organizations show up where people are donating time and/or money to help poor, sick, under-served, less fortunate (loosely speaking, rely less on government and more on private \\"charities\\" more).

Can we change the world? Is globalization a benefit to the world or a curse? The western world look at globalization as a curse (the loss of wealth and power status) while the rest of the world looks at it as hope for life and quality of life. Social Entrepreneurs have these and many other issues to contend with. This a good book and highly recommended. Also, Stop Working by Rohan Hall which deals with globalization and entrepreneurship is an excellent companion book that also deals with these challenges."},{"Title":"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas","review":"This book was a pleasant, coherently written text about how individuals, \\"social entrepreneurs,\\" can change a specific problem for the better. It focuses on a non-governmental organization called Ashoka which gives stipends to social entrepreneurs in several countries. The author and the people he writes about consider humans to be essentially good, and that everyone can help make the world better, if only they are given a chance, but it takes someone with a special set of skills, practicality, resourcefulness, charisma, and a business orientation towards helping others."},{"Title":"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas","review":"This book has a great title, but somewhat lackluster content. The book is really not so much about changing the world, and more about one organization in particular. In addition to focusing on an organization, I find that the stories of the people *in* the organization take up as much of the book as actual stories about people they've found who have made or are making a difference in the world. It's not necessarily bad-there are plenty of inspiring people and stories to motivate you. It just takes the book a long time to get to them and seems to deviate often."},{"Title":"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas","review":"\\"How to Change the World\\" by David Bornstein has quickly become one of my most favorite books because of the way it confirms and challenges my knowledge and perceptions of the world all at once. I'm currently working toward my graduate degree in Social Entrepreneurship & Change at Pepperdine University, and it wasn't until I began reading this book in my second semester did I begin to dig into the change politics of social entrepreneurship more deeply. I highly recommend this book to change agents of all ages and backgrounds. It takes time to grow, nurture and cultivate change; This book is filled with stories and ideas that will teach you how to grow, nurture, and cultivate whatever change you seek in the world without a doubt. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas","review":"David Bornstein's book \\"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas\\" is a handbook not for revolutionaries so much as evolutionaries-individuals who are committed to social change, and are willing to work within the system, and at times changing and redefining the parameters of that system to effect lasting, sustainable change. These people such as Rodrigo Baggio, a social entrepreneur who works to provide access to technology for slum areas in Brazil-along with 33 other inspiring change agents featured in the book-offer compelling case studies that explore everything from driving passion and root causes of injustice, to obstacles and pragmatism required in the creation of effective social change programs. Bornstein provides a historical context and lays out a common thread amongst change makers to provide a realistic context and insight about the process of social change through innovative entrepreneurship. Bornstein takes an important step in defining this emerging sector, or as he calls it \\"citizen sector,\\" for those of us who are interested in legitimizing this field in academia, business, and activism work."},{"Title":"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas","review":"In Bornstein's \\"How to Change the World,\\" a dynamic collection of compelling stories of social change, his selections illustrate the most creative passionate, driven and visionary individuals from around the world who boldly take on extraordinary challenges in efforts to create long term change for their communities.As a student new to the study of social entrepreneurship, Bornstein's compilation allowed me to vividly envision the people, the place, the need, and the struggles, to the glorious outcomes accomplished by the earnest work of the social entrepreneurs. \\"How to Change the World\\" is a great read for those interested in learning more about the concept of social entrepreneurship and referencing success models of social entrepreneurs.I was particularly moved by Fabio Rosa's lifelong and committed work, beginning as a young man in Brazil, who married his passions to ensure that every household in the rural communities would have electricity to circumvent the ills of poverty. Through his connections, organizing and his childhood experience growing up on farmlands, he was certain he had to and could do something. From Florence Nightingale's story of helping provide clean and attentive care to injured and often forgotten war soldiers, to Erzebet Szekeres' unconditional love for her son to use his disability to reform the attitude of individuals - all are poignant examples of passion, sacrifice, perseverance and vision that effected real change, not only for their loved ones, but for those throughout the world."},{"Title":"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas","review":"I read a lot, almost totally non-fiction, and for the past several years, after accidentally becoming a top Amazon reviewer on the strength of 300 reviews lifted from the annotated bibliographies of my first two books, I have been dedicated, as a hobby, to reading in the service of the public. My goal in life at the age of 55, what I learned from this book is called an \\"encore career,\\" is to be intelligence officer to the five billion poor, and--I now realize from this book--to the social entrepreneurs that are changing the world on a scale and with a speed that governments cannot match.This book blew my mind, literally. It has not altered my course, but it has dramatically accelerated my ability to make progress by illuminating a path I thought I would have to discover. This book is the first \\"map\\" of a completely new form of endeavor, profoundly individual in inspiration and global in scale, that of social entrepreneurship, not to be confused with non-profit or non-governmental, more traditional forms.The author, apart from mapping examples (33, focused on education, health, protection, and access to electricity and technology), provides what I consider to be the single best preface/introduction I have ever read. Here are a few of the underlined bits:+ hidden history unfolding+ landscape of innovators+ ratio of problem-focused information to solution-focused information is completely out of balance+ reality distorted, people deprived of knowledge they could use+ individual social entrepreneurs advancing systemic scalable solutions+ new sector of social entrepreneurship now being taught, funded, and respected+ two Nobel Peace Prizes (2004, 2006)--micro-finance now micro-everything+ Ashoka, founded by Bill Drayton is the spine of the book+ conceptual firewalls coming down, \\"whole brains\\" being used+ influencing conventional businesses (going green, good) and governments (adopting unconventional education, kids teaching parents, etc)+ \\"social entrepreneurs are uniquely suited to make headway on problems that have resisted considerable money and intelligence\\"+ government are looking at problems from the outside, social entrepreneurs see problems--and solutions--from the inside+ scale still a challenge, but coming+ Students and local groups actively interested in hearing about this now+ Students are leading the way, pushing for change in curriculums+ optimism, hope, energy are being unleashed as never before--but not being properly mapped, reported, or appreciated outside small circles+ new pathways being discovered every day in every place+ changemakers far more numerous than any might have imagined+ many levels of changemaker+ charaqcterized by first-hand active engagement in reality+ individuals driven to understand, and driven to remove shackles from others with shared knowledge (e.g. kids learning to fix pumps and spreading knowledge across villages with a speed and energy only quick-witten children could apply)+ social entrepreneurship network now has sensors everywhere, millions of changemarkers, tens of thousands of organizations+ far better mechanism to respond to needed than we have ever had before+ decentralized and emergent forceBAD NEWS:- not yet properly financed- lacking holistic public intelligence for voluntary harmonization against the ten threats, with the twelve policies, with a special focus on the eight challengers.

Just don't take the title too literally. This book is not a \\"how-to\\" manual for changing the world. I would also challenge the premise that non-profit entrepreneurs are the only people committed to positive world change. Nevertheless, the book serves as an inspirational review of good ideas and people committed to serving others."},{"Title":"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas","review":"David Bornstein's How to Change the World is a book that both gives you hope for humankind and forces you to ask yourself \\"so, what can I do to help?\\" While some may be bothered by the lack of conclusion or handy textbook guide explaining how to become an impactful changemaker, I think the stories speak from themselves and illustrate that there is no \\"right\\" path or specific academic or professional skill set required to impart positive social change within a community.I read this book from three perspectives and each provided a unique but constant insight. As a working woman, I admired the strength, tenacity and unwavering determination of each of the profiled social entrepreneur. As a graduate student, I analyzed each individual's techniques and searched for the common thread and motivation among social entrepreneurs. And as a compassionate person, my immediate reaction is to find my place in social entrepreneurship and start doing my part.The profiles are written in a way that is factual and informative but also possess an underlying emotional component that sucks you in like a good fiction novel. By the end of each chapter I had a newfound respect for social entrepreneurship and organizations like Ashoka who seek to help bright social entrepreneurs take the steps needed to make change happen. I highly recommend this book to anyone in the field, interested in the field, or simply looking for an inspirational read."},{"Title":"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas","review":"For anyone starting off in the social entrepreneurship field this book can serve as a good starting guideline. Here the author, Bornstein, presents various stories of individuals whose passions have led them to address varied social causes. The subjects presented are different and my personal favorite was, \\"This country has to change\\" by Javed Abidi, India: Disability rights. Mr. Abidi describes the social stigma associated with disabled individuals living in India and the work he has undertaken to change this. The numerous stories on various subjects ensure that individuals will see \\"their\\" cause addressed in one form or another."},{"Title":"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas","review":"Mr. Bornstein's book brought dreams out of me that were just ready to be born. &quot;How to Change the World&quot; is a collection of powerful stories of people who had the initiative to stand up with their ideas and make effective, dramatic changes to their communities. And by doing so, they helped others in other communities find ways to do the same.It is this entrepreneurial spirit that *will* change the world, for we all can change the world if we find new ways to look at recurring problems. It is possible, and it's not just optimism I'm speaking of. True desire and will to change will bring change.Thank you, Mr. Bornstein."},{"Title":"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas","review":"Bornstein is a compelling and thorough storyteller. As a master's student studying social entrepreneurship, I would have to agree with the New York Times' accolades; this book can be considered a bible in the field. After the first reading of this book, I have a better grasp on the critical characteristics required for aspiring change makers. More importantly, I recognize that the power of new ideas deserves the attention of anyone who has ever dreamed of anything new before.True, this book title will most likely attract the already altruistic, but Bornstein makes a convincing case for anyone teetering on the edge of action. Rather than a traditional \\"how-to\\" guide with specific instructions, How to Change the World reads more like a documentary. Bornstein entices his audience with inspirational stories about seemingly ordinary folks jostled so deeply by a world's need that they felt no other choice to but to devote their entirety to bringing about a better future. It is about people whose tonics are their pivotal and innovative ideas. Foundational principles that undergird these social entrepreneurs and their ventures are woven throughout the stories and later clarified in several chapters. Researched for over five years, this book boils down countless interviews with Ashoka fellows and Bill Drayton himself.While it is difficult to articulate a single definition to capture a social entrepreneur, Bornstein was able to describe he or she as an \\"obsessive individual who takes the initiative to act on that vision, who gathers resources and builds organizations to protect and market that vision, who provides the energy and sustained forces to overcome the inevitable resistance, and who--decade after decade--keeps improving, strengthening, and broadening that vision until what was once a marginal idea has become a new norm\\" (p. 3).The author retraces how he came to this conclusion by meandering through the critical landscape of social entrepreneurship today. If you find Malcolm Gladwell's insights on innovation fascinating, you should enjoy Bornstein's take on the phenomenon of social ideas and their tipping points."},{"Title":"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas","review":"This book was required for a macro social work class, but I have truly enjoyed reading it for its own sake!

It's mostly a collection of anectodal items on people in different countries and the challenges they faces. I was surprised on how sometimes such common sense ideas become revolutionary movements. Because the book covers so many countries and problem solvers you don't find out about the people that came before that failed. Its clear that these people are building on others but just now how.The book is a great study of characteristics that shape a person to become a leader in a national or regional social justice movement. It is quite interestign how people from separate worlds and cultures have such similar traits.I recommend the book to those that are looking for any broader discussion on leadership and social justice. We used this for our first book in a book club that we started and it was a good lead to other discussions."},{"Title":"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas","review":"I enjoyed learning about how social entrepreneurship is quietly blurring the boundaries between social action and the way to do business to better the world. The case studies inHow to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas, Updated Editionare inspiring to those who are, in whatever capacity, contributing to make a difference and to drive change, and for those who are at least thinking about the need to change.However, I would have liked to see more inclusion of what social action could mean even for all of us (people and organisations), particularly for those who are still blinded by greed and and growth and everything else that got us into the predicament we are finding ourselves in. Our belief systems need to change dramatically and with more urgency. We need critical mass and we need it fast.Christine Maingard, Author of 'Think Less Be More:Mental Detox for Everyone'"},{"Title":"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas","review":"Good and useful, but probably need some updating and more information on current sources of financial support, specially for projects in developing countries."},{"Title":"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas","review":"I enjoyed reading this book because it reminded me of chicken soup where every chapter started a new story about someone."},{"Title":"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas","review":"Good condition of the book as specified, and it was delivered within a week. so quite a good experience overall"},{"Title":"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas","review":"The stories of individuals told in Bornstein's \\"How to Change the World\\" showcased the unbelievably adaptive and responsive spirit social entrepreneurs possess, changing what could have been a tiresome \\"how-to\\" (as the title might imply) into a very inspiring and compelling read. Fabio Rosa was one story in particular that I found both fascinating and encouraging. Rosa's parents both came from farming families, and Rosa grew up listening to the stories. As someone who took a long and winding road to not only bring electricity to poverty-stricken Brazil, but to also single-handedly bring farming into the 21st century and improve the lives of the lower class, his connection to those farmers struggling to make a living with no electricity and outdated farming methods seemed to be a very large part of what kept him focused and motivated through all the difficulties he encountered. For those interested in entering the social entrepreneurship field this book is both inspiring and motivating. As social entrepreneurs, we all need to find that one reason to keep us focused, keep us motivated, and keep us working."},{"Title":"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas","review":"Bornstein's \\"How to Change the World\\" is a love letter to Ashoka, an impressive and arguably very successful organization that identifies and supports social entrepreneurs throughout the world. Throughout the book, Bornstein provides a primer on Ashoka, its founder and methodology, as well as a number of success stories. He begins with a well-researched and interesting explanation about how the social entrepreneurship movement - or the citizen sector, as he calls it - found its sweet spot for expansion in the late 20th century. His narrative style is not nearly as compelling as first-person stories, such as \\"The Blue Sweater\\" (Novogratz, 2009), or even \\"Half the Sky\\" (Kristof & WuDunn, 2009). If each featured social entrepreneur had written a first-person account, this may have provided a more compelling read. One obviously missing component of Bornstein's vignettes is an acknowledgement of failure. On their respective roads to success, what significant missteps did these entrepreneurs take? What did they learn from those mistakes and failures?This book may be a wonderful resource for people who are not yet familiar with social entrepreneurship or the amazing work that has been done by citizen sector individuals and organizations worldwide in the last 30 years. I appreciate the time Bornstein spent describing historical figures, demonstrating that social entrepreneurship is nothing new; it is simply finally getting the attention it deserves. However, the book falls short of its title. It is not a how-to. Although the resource list is well-balanced, and there are some nuggets of discussion of what it takes to be successful in social entrepreneurship, Bornstein falls short of providing insight for individuals who are wondering whether they have what it takes to be a social entrepreneur. Other than being passionate and obsessive, what else does it take? Do the vignettes provide actionable lessons learned for readers who are considering becoming social entrepreneurs, or who are already in the citizen sector but want to find more success? This reader was left wanting."},{"Title":"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas","review":"This book has 15 or so case studies on how people, all Ashoka fellows, made significant social impacts on their part of the world. It also spends a significant numbers of pages describing the Ashoka program itself; It is kind of a \\"cheerleader\\" for Ashoka which is less interesting than the case studies. The case studies are very detailed and give uninformed readers like me an understanding of how other people have created successful social programs that benefitted their society. If that is what you are looking for, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas","review":"After reading Bornstein's How to Change the World, I was touched with the social entrepreneurs' stories who felt compelled to pursue their careers. Many sacrificed a great deal, including their sleep, marriages and even disregarded others' negative judgments. It was not easy, but it seemed that many created a vision and continued to develop it. My most important take-away was that many see the problems that require change and develop a solution to treat the symptoms, rather than just providing a temporary cover up.If you are seeking a career in social entrepreneurship, I would encourage you to read this book. Even if you're not pursuing such a career, it is important to realize the sacrifices many have to make to change our world for the better. It truly touched my heart knowing that these people felt such an obligation to help others. The book also allowed me to realize that these change makers did not view themselves as social entrepreneurs, but most were simply influenced by contextual events that led them to their current entrepreneurial endeavors. It is important to understand where social entrepreneurs originate from, as well as what drives them to want to contribute in making a difference among society."},{"Title":"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas","review":"The case studies Bornstein presents here are fascinating, and, at once uplifting and heartrending. I very much enjoyed reading the book, and I would probably recommend it to others interested in social entrepreneurship.Now that it's been a few days since I finished the book, though, I find it had some deficiencies:--Bornstein doesn't sufficiently define \\"social entrepreneur.\\"--Drayton, founder of Ashoka, is presented with a bit too much hero worship. I'd have liked to see Bornstein provide his own interpretations rather than rely on the Ashoka framework. Even when presenting some of the negative personality traits of Drayton or some of the failures of Ashoka, Bornstein is apologetic.--The profiles are a bit uneven, and why some were chosen is beyond me. Nightingale? Really?--Bornstein could have done more to distill the common attributes of social entrepreneurs--in essence put more theoretical framework in the book.--In 2008, the book feels dated because business moves so quickly. I kept wondering about the fate of the organizations profiled.Despite the problems with the book, it is a great introduction to social entrepreneurship and a great reminder of what dedicated, passionate, and driven individuals can do to change their communities and even countries."},{"Title":"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas","review":"Having been most inspired by his remarkable study of the Grameen Bank (The Price of a Dream) and his articles for Ashoka at Changemakers.net, I was delighted to a new Bornstein tome. And, in fact, this surpasses all my expectations. What a phenomenal tour of some of the most remarkable changemakers who, quite independently from one another, are creating a quiet revolution in how we think about creating a new world that is based not on top-down solutions but on local initiative. This is much more than a compendium of fascinating stories, however; Mr. Bornstein provides a very profound study of just what we can all do to become participants in this adventure of social entrepreneurship. Bravo, Mr. Bornstein!"},{"Title":"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas","review":"Amazing what books can teach us. I'm so lucky that I love to read. Even more lucky to love and devour books that have been assigned in class. One of the books in particular - How to Change the World - by David Bornstein. The subtitle of his book is 'Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas'. This book is devoted to just that. He not only describes in detail over a dozen social entrepreneurs; their accomplishments, struggles and breath-taking social changes, but he breaks down what it means to be a social entrepreneur. \\"...transformative forces: people with new ideas to address major problems who are relentless in the pursuit of their visions, people who simply will not take \\"no\\" for an answer, who will not give up until they have spread their ideas as far as they possibly can.\\" Anyone who reads this book will not only be inspired by these stories, but if they really take the time to study these pages and read between the lines, they will be challenged to their core. This book teaches you to love the work of social entrepreneurs and self reflect on your own life, career, decisions and how you may possibly direct or redirect your life in a way that is consistent with creating and sustaining positive movements on this planet."},{"Title":"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas","review":"David Bornstein's How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas provides a guidebook to the world of social entrepreneurship for those unfamiliar with the field; while also offering thorough examinations of successful social entrepreneurs, and their plights, for individuals already ensconced in this social realm. Any individual or group interested in learning the correct way one should undertake a social cause will find Bornstein's work a great aid. As he investigates the social change agents referenced within his work, such as the educationally minded J.B. Schramm, Bornstein establishes the foundation by which each individual created their change making situation. Through said background research, the author presents the reader with tangible examples of how any individual with interest in the betterment of society may begin their own quest to improve the world. Likewise, his methodical assessment of each social entrepreneur's mission supplies the highly involved social change agent with excellent techniques to continue one's work within his or her respective field. Overall, Bornstein's How to Change the World imparts a wealth of knowledge concerning the achievements of multiple social entrepreneurs around the globe."},{"Title":"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas","review":"How to Change the World provides a clear picture of a social entrepreneur's role in the creation of social change. With each Ashoka fellow's story, Bornstein presents a challenge for readers to find their passions and use their gifts and skills to make a difference in the world. This book encourages readers to reflect on the type of change agents they wil become. Regardless of the role one plays (or will play) in social change, each reader can find himself/herself in this book. Whether one has the determination and tenacity of Fabio Rosa as he tirelessly works to provide rural electrification in Brazil or the patient dedication of Magony who serves as a staff member in a Hungarian assisted living community for the disabled, each reader can discover his or her place as a changemaker in this world."},{"Title":"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas","review":"This is a book \\"whose time has come\\"! (read book to understand why this is ironic) Our world is so desperate for change in so many ways. This book gives both the inspiration and the tools for those of us already working to make change become better leaders and advocates for our cause. This is a must-read for all social change advocates. I highly recommend this book and applaud all that Bill Drayton and the Ashoka Foundation are doing to sustain the many people on our planet who are driven to make it a better place."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I couldn't put it down. Read the book in 1 1/2 days. Of the last ten or so books I've read, this was the best."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This shows that real life has more twists and turns than anyone's imagination. My heart goes out to the two sisters who suffered this saga. It also reinforces my belief that when a life is on the line an extremely high standard must be met. Mr. Grisham had me hooked into this saga as surely as if I was reading one of his many fiction bestsellers. Note: This book is not for the squeamish as it tells a tale more sinister and horrid than any fiction writer could dream up. I had to put it down in several spots because of horror that this could be true. But I was captured by needing to know the ending and I kept at it."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"In grueling detail Grisham tells of the horrors of our \\"justice\\" system.I wish everyone could read this book and be inspired to work for reform in our courts, prisons and the death penalty. Not an easy read, but a very important one."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I am not a fan of Mr. Grisham's fiction, but he writes about real life quite well. I'd like to see him write more non-fiction."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I loved The Painted House and A Time To Kill but those were fiction. About halfway through The Innocent Man, I started speed-reading and finished in about 20 minutes. Maybe real people are boring?"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Someone suggested I read this book because of my strong opinions about the criminal justice system. She felt that I'd like it, but I browsed through the book, and although sometimes the language is repetitive, I bought my first audio book hoping it would be more exciting to read this way. Indeed, it was. While I'm reading the reviews that say this book is \\"boring,\\" the criminal justice system locking people up from big words and blood tests that I'm not convinced are 100%; the government not giving any money or even an apology to those who were wrongly convicted; and the way prisoners are treated in the prison system makes this book relevant and interesting. I didn't even need to hear the author's note to know this book was based on a true story. I hear stories such as this one time and time again, and I'm glad that Grisham pointed out within this read how rare it is to find White men who are accused incorrectly of crimes such as this, but how typical it is for minorities or the poor to constantly be accused and convicted with little or no sympathy for those who really are innocent. I read reviews saying they were bored with Ronnie's depression and alcoholism, but imagine giving up 12 years of your life for a crime you did not commit, being bipolar, and prison guards making fun of you through the night in addition to the government not letting you have the correct medication.While I do wish there was a cleaner conclusion, the truth of the matter is that many crimes like this remain unresolved, and this is why the government is so set on pinning the first person that looks a little funky. I enjoyed this book a lot. Thanks John!"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have read better true crime and I have read better John Grisham. I found the book rather redundant. Shocking to say the least, as far as for the life of Williamson and the ending was on a very sad note. Only read this if the life of a mentally ill person is considered entertainment for you - it was not entertainment for me. Therefore, only three stars, there are better reads out there."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I am the type of person that prefers to read a true story, or at least the most realistic stories possible. This one fits the bill and is an eye opener of a situation which should not happen. There were situations within this story that made me fearful of our system and Grisham always knows how to bring such points home to us.

One character in his book is named Dennis Smith. He worked for the OSBI and contributed to the conviction of Williamson and Fritz. In the book, Mr. Grisham indicates that Dennis Smith is dead.

He worked for the OSBI and contributed to the conviction of Williamson and Fritz. In the book, Mr. Grisham indicates that Dennis Smith is dead. In fact, Dennis Smith is now the DA of Custer County, Oklahoma. Can someone explain why the book says he is dead? Here is Mr. Smith's resume:Dennis A. Smith is the duly elected District Attorney of District #2, having started his first term of office on January 6, 2003.Mr. Smith has a varied background that over the years has covered many different sides of the Criminal Justice System. Mr. Smith started a law enforcement career as a Deputy Sheriff in Woodward County in 1974. In 1977, he joined the OSBI and was stationed in Oklahoma City. In 1978 he was transferred to Clinton, Oklahoma, as a Resident Agent. Mr. Smith attended Oklahoma City University Law School from 1983 to 1986, and was employed as a Legal Investigator for the late Pepper Meacham during this time. Following Mr. Meacham's death in 1984, Smith returned to the OSBI as a Special Agent.Following graduation from the OCU School of Law in December of 1986, Mr. Smith became an Assistant District Attorney in District #2 with the Custer County District Attorney's Office in January of 1987. Mr. Smith was an Assistant District Attorney in Custer County until 1994, when he left the D.A.'s office to go into the private practice of law as a solo practitioner. Mr. Smith worked as a private attorney until he joined Richard Dugger's staff as First Assistant District Attorney in October of 2002 to facilitate the transition of a new District Attorney in District #2."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have read most of John Grisham's books and this is so far the ONLY book which I didn't finish reading within 48 hours. I find it dragging and boring. I know it's non-fiction but it doesn't have to be written like this. It's a bit of a disappointment because I've been waiting for this new book. I am a loyal fan of John Grisham, I buy and collect his books. When I get hold of a Grisham book, I normally read his book within 48 hours and for days I think about it in my head. Well he is forgiven."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book was incredible for me in two ways: 1) it opened my eyes at how prejudicial distric attorneys are towards people with mental illnesses and 2) I could not believe the stupidity of the publisher, Double Day, in putting all the photos in the middle of the book and thus giving away the trial outcome and story conclusion. This book is definitely worth the read because it opened my eyes about the number of innocent people who have been railroaded in small towns by D.A.s, judges, and juries. Just make sure you don't look through more than the first third of the photos or you're ruin the suspense of the story. Shame on Double Day!!!"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I listened to the book on audio CD after hearing Grisham speak eloquently on the subject recently. The way Grisham learned about this case was very interesting. The book was not as engrossing as the author unfortunately. There was too much detail and the story really bogged down in several places. I kept thinking I had put in the wrong CD because of repetitive, almost verbatim passages. As another reviewer mentioned, an index would have answered a few questions I had about the research and where Grisham got many of his statements and facts. While I think Grisham draws attention to a sick justice system, I think it's fair to point out that the system finally worked thanks to a few determined people, and it freed a couple of innocent men in this book alone. The failure of the mental health system is another thing, however and I was horrified at its failure in Ron Williamson's case. Taken as a plea for better mental health care and for abolishing the death penalty, this book is successful. Taken as a riveting true crime story alone, it misses the mark. Grisham should have used some of his fiction skills to move this story along."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"While not a huge Grisham fan, I appreciate his work and have enjoyed some of his other work, most notably \\"The Firm.\\" Therefore, I was happy to pick this one up, and looked forward to another well written legal tale. Somewhere along the way I actually missed that it was non-fiction, so for the better part of the book I just followed along and waited for the story to get going. It never really did, and overall it was a fairly depressing read. As a fiction work it would have been totally a wasted effort. But when I found out it was TRUE, the shocking brutality of a justice system gone wrong left me feeling ill, and that's a tribute to Grisham's talent. I didn't personally enjoy the book, but it opened my eyes and I'm glad I read it."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I am an avid mystery and thriller reader. I didn't realize this was a nonfiction book when I purchased it, but still had hopes for a good read. I found the book slow, repetitive, and I found myself after about three-fourths through just just scanning the remaining pages. Like others, I found the book disturbing as it portrayed the law enforcement officers and prosecutors in this book, and it is scary to learn that such approaches to criminal cases could actually exist in the way described in this book. Maybe if you are a true crimes reader you will like this book more, but for me this was one of my disappointing reads."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I'd heard about this book months ago, and finally got a chance to read it yesterday over a period of just over eight hours I had read it cover to cover. I went into the book not knowing anything about the man Ron Williamson, but I walked way from the book after finishing it more informed. I was honestly surprised that despite the fact that he was an innocent man, that anyone would want to cover the life of someone so mentally deranged as he was.Reading the book, I thoroughly enjoyed the life story of the man. However it occurred to me that no matter how sick he was, if one does not wish to change, they are never going to change. Dennis Fritz was able to overcome his time in prison, Roy Williamson was not.It also covers three other people who were wrongfully convicted - Greg Wilhoit, Tommy Ward, and Karl Fontenot. Glen Wilhoit has been freed, and despite the finding of the body of the woman Tommy and Karl \\"killed\\" and not in any place or way the two \\"confessed,\\" the latter two are still sitting behind bars to this day for the murder.This book has done nothing but reaffirm that the death penalty is not something that America - or the world - should have as a burden. Let the final judgment come before The Maker, not at the hands of an independent contractor who hides behind a curtain and pumps some chemicals into another person's body. The original purpose of capital punishment was to deter other killings - that was why there were public executions. It didn't work then, and it doesn't work now that no one can see them.This book will give you a good reason why capital punishment should be abolished."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Having as I do all of John Grisham's work, likely I expected too much, forgetting that he was taking me on a true journey and not one of fiction.

For those interested in that sort of thing it should be excellent reading."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I sailed through the beginning and end but middle of the book was a bit slow. I was disappointed that Grishman let readers know the fate of Fritz and Williamson near the beginning so the story was a bit anticlimactic. However it is still a fascinating well written story. I have not been able to develop a definitive opinion on the death penalty until now. It opened my eyes to some of the injustices of the legal system. Like everyone else I knew it was flawed but The Innocent Man made those flaws really sink in."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I picked up this book overlooking the fact that it is a non-fiction book. It was not until I got to the pictures in the middle of the book did I realize this book is a true story. It made this awful story even more awful.This is the story of murder and injustice in a small town with normal people who have dreams and see those dreams derailed by bad choices by themselves or by others. Grisham shares the pain and suffering of families who have lost daughters to rape and murder. It also shows how people make assumptions or judgments and innocent people go to jail or even worse to death for the crime of another person. This could happen and does happen in many other small towns and cities as well for that matter. Police and law officials have almost impossible jobs to do. Sometimes they get it right and other times, they get it wrong. This is a book of getting it wrong. Innocent to proven guilty thrown right out the window in America. It shows the serious, deficiency of the the legal and prison system.You may not want to read this book."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Shades of Nifong!

It may be non-fiction couched in many lies to help support a certain agenda, eg., anti-death penalty or to sell books...or an historical novel. One thing is certain: this is a one-sided novel.

Although I'd never read Grisham before, I have loved every movie based on his books and wanted to jump right in. But this book read so matter-of-factly, that I was losing my mind with boredom! I understood that Ron Williamson loved baseball and was going to be the next Mickey Mantle and all, but how many times did this have to be mentioned? How many times did the author have to say that after 2 months on his own, Ron had to be committed again, or Ron committed himself only to leave early, or Ron's sister came to get him or his mother let him stay with her? It read like a blow by blow police report that was too tedious for me to complete. I couldn't stand it anymore! The author had Ron slipping so deeply into manic depression that there was nowhere left for him to go so, the author took the story around again! Also, there was no depth of characters, no glimpse into the real killer's mind, no building up to a final conclusion. I was highly disappointed. John Grisham should stick to fiction.

It almost appears that Grisham first started to research this character in order to write a similar type fiction novel he is so famous for, then changed his mind and submitted his notes for publication. It was a \\"60 Minutes\\" type report that certainly didn't help to advance his writing career. It's been a long time since his last novel, his fans were anticipating another fine fictional thriller, and Grisham failed to deliver.

I wish I had never read The Innocent Man. I wish I had those hours of my life back. Although I wholeheartedly agree with the premise of the book that an innocent man should not be sentenced to death row and I support the Innocence Project's objectives, I had an extremely difficult time with the individual that Grisham chose as the basis for making the point. The problem for me is that I never felt that concerned about this man. He obviously deserved to be behind bars for the rapes that he committed, so I never felt that connected or concerned about the man. I felt like it was a complete waste of my time to read about his despicable life. Sure he didn't deserve to be on death row, but he certainly belonged behind bars for his other crimes.I think this book would have been much more powerful if it had been written about someone that the majority of us could empathize with or that resembled someone like ourselves that could be wrongfully accused. I think it would have been more impactful had Grisham selected someone similar to the man that was recently put to death in Texas for arson that killed his children when in fact the fire was not caused by arson and the deaths of the children were accidental. Now, that is the type of situation that truly drives home the point that an innocent man could be wrongfully prosecuted and put to death due to faulty evidence. I have always been in favor of the death penalty, and Grisham's book did not persuade me to change my opinion. However, I am rethinking my opinion after hearing about the Texas case, because with that case I can see that \\"there but for the grace of God go I.\\""},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"While the topic of this book is worthy of being exposed to the public, Grisham's writing is clearly biased to put the investigation and prosecution of the Innocent Man in the worst possible light. His writing is full of his, or other's opinions, and he does not just stick to the facts. It is obvious that he has attempted to sensationalize the event, rather than just honestly report the events and the facts of the case. There is no bibliography to record his sources and the reader has to just take his word for it regarding where he got his information. This is not how this subject should have been reported, nor is it the approach that should be taken when writing non-fiction. My impression of the book is that Grisham is trying harder to make a political statement regarding law enforcement than trying to write an actual, legitmate, non-fiction book."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Mr grisham really lost it this time,it like reading a criminals rap sheet.

There is nothing glamorous about seeing two innocent men being railroaded into prison where the cumulative effect was to drive one man mad and the other to wish for the time he had lost in his former life. Coupled with the consummate stupidity and cruelty shown by the local officials in Oklahoma makes me very glad that I was not born there. I am dumbfounded to believe that the local officials still are in power and the population of Ada and the surrounding area still believe the Ron Williamson and Dennis Fritz were guilty of the crimes when there was no evidence placing them at the crime scene. The real murderer, Glen Gore was eventually tied to the crime by DNA evedence, tried and convicted for the heinous crime. Don't these people read their own papers?It was a very hard book for me to read mainly because of my anger at the obvious injustices. Along with Mr. Grisham, I would vote that he return to fiction, a much safer and saner place to be.Pat Renaud"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Sometimes, after reading a book like this, you wonder who the real criminals are.

Or, are they the people who we pay to maintain justice in our nation?Reading these well written chapters, you wonder out loud: how often does this happen? Is the Ron Williamson story a unique case? You'd like to believe that. But Grisham seems to hint that thinking that way is wishful at best.

I could barely put it down. Personally, I prefer nonfiction to novels and this did not disappoint. Like Grisham has said in interviews and in the back of the book, he could not have made up better or more interesting characters or even the story all together. While it was a truly sad story of what happened and the so-called justice system that sends clearly innocent people to jail or doesn't investigate fully the facts, it's still a great read. I was so frustrated at the actual events, the ignorance of some of the characters and the lack of assistance from the attorneys and legal system, but provoking emotion is what I think a good read should do.

If I hadn't seen that on the cover, I wouldn't have believed it. This is story of a man, Ron Williamson, and his alleged accomplice, Dennis Fritz, both wrongly accused of rape and murder in a small Oklahoma town. The local police and judges, as well as the state and federal systems, all rushed to justice to convict someone and failed to look past their noses to find the real killer. The ineptness of everyone at every level is disgusting and unbelievable...the stuff of fiction. After years on death row, Williamson was a physical and mental mess, but he finally got help from the Indigent Defense System, a group of legal eagles who help indigent, wrongly accused inmates.It's any eye-opening story; you aren't necessarily innocent until proven guilty in this country."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"THE INNOCENT MAN is a biography of Ron Williamson, an athlete who made a failed attempt to go pro (Grisham's first non-fiction). Two major reactions constantly emerged in my mind.First, many readers (even death penalty supporters) are embracing the position that THE INNOCENT MAN is a strong argument against the death penalty. I think such a perspective is extremely short-sighted. THE INNOCENT MAN forced me to question the adversarial system that we find in the criminal and civil courts. The first cause of the Williamson's dilemma can be reduced to a theme of \\"lust to win.\\" Prosecutors are acculturized to win cases. Thus, they wear blinders that seduce them to support a particular legal theory rather than search for the truth. THE INNOCENT MAN is not merely an indictment of the death penalty; it is an indictment of the entire system. The culture of our adversarial system is the reason that American physicians have to pay outrageous malpractice premiums. In my mind, THE INNOCENT MAN is the strongest argument for the US to move to a British/Canadian system of justice. I am convinced that the cost of justice would be significantly reduced in terms of economics and human tragedy. In the end, Barry Scheck would have less work to do and would have fewer road blocks for seeking the truth.Second, this adversarial system exists in sports. Perhaps, prosecutors like Bill Peterson attempt to compensate for the lack of physique and physical coordinator by defining the courtroom as sport. The mentality of winning in athletic competition creates a delusion of invincibility and Pope-like infallibility. With a history of winning, the athlete, like the lawyer, develops a core personality fortress with the motto, \\"How can I be wrong?\\" This delusion (that includes a history of success) is contagious. Others are infected by the delusion and are inhibited to question the veracity of the prosecutor/athlete's position. The bold and the confident are the only ones who can cripple the history of success of others who are bold and confident. In THE INNOCENT MAN, we have the successful prosecutor meet the falling athlete in the adversarial sport of the courtroom. In comes Barry Scheck (bold and confident) who stops the infection.Because of Grisham's command of the written word, I fear that THE INNOCENT MAN will become the catalyst for instituting additional systematic, time-consuming and costly measures to review death sentences. The problem we see in death penalty decisions are found throughout the judiciary. THE INNOCENT MAN is not an indictment of the death penalty; it is an indictment of the adversarial court system. We do not require more review or the elimination of the death penalty; we need to replace the entire system. Get rid of the adversarial component, and we will see less innocent men facing the death penalty, lower malpractice premiums, and less contentious divorce proceedings."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I loved this book, read it in two evenings. Anyone raised in an American small town can really relate to the justice that befell Ron Williamson, Dennis Fritz and the others. How many lives are affected nationwide by this system is hard to estimate. As I read, I was constantly thinking that except for just a little better luck, there I could well have went. My local judge and many others at the time sent us malcontents to Vietnam to \\"grow up\\". Those that survived, indeed \\"grew up\\" and incurred a dose of reality that many, like Ron Williamson, never recovered from. This is a very uncomfortable story of our country, but it is simply overwhelming for me to realize how many similar stories are walking the streets.If you share the belief that everyone is doing the best they can within their unique circumstances, you'll empathize with the book. If you feel the unfortunate just need to suck it up more, you probably won't like the book, you're not even on the same page as the rest of us."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I received an incredible education by reading this book.

I cannot believe some people who gave the book a bad review do not understand how important it is."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Growing up in 50's/60's small town America gave me the feeling that an unlocked front door, or a bicycle with no padlock and chain, or a kid left in a car while Mom went in for a carton of cigarettes was no cause for alarm. When an unfortunate episode did occur, the police were on the case and the DA got their man.Not so fast, Eliot Spitzer.The time of this crime was a bit fast forward, but not the setting or the feeling. It was Ada, OK during the early 80's, and while Jay McInnerny was living large under a Bright Light in a Big City, Ron Williamson was wandering, having blown his chance at pro baseball and harboring a mental illness left mostly untreated. As a free man he was last seen pushing a three wheeled lawn mower for blocks and playing his out-of-tune guitar with his future partner in non-crime, Dennis Fritz. His neighbor had been raped and killed and Bill Peterson, the then and present DA (see below), needed a man to point to; his safe little town needed a simple solution, so he looked to the odd man on the street and employed jailed snitches to root him out. Before you can say \\"I'd like to see my attorney,\\" Peterson coerced Ron to perjure a confession out of a dream (yep, a dream) and got the death penalty. What followed was hell on Earth and a game of brinkmanship that brought the dreaded needle only days away from his prodigious, talented throwing arm.Grisham is a fine storyteller, but this tale was a bit newsy for my taste and in spots became repetitive, unlike his fabulous fiction, but the story of Ron Williamson won't leave me anytime soon and will make the reader rethink his/her position on the death penalty and how safe we really are in small town USA. Mr. Peterson continues to work as a prosecutor in Ada, an old buffalo nickel in a world of shiny new pennies. With folks like him behind the wheel, we all should reconsider our innocence and lock the damn door."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book is a great read! For anyone who believes that the death penalty should be outlawed throughout the world, especially in a country like America this book is a must read. Grisham shows how evidence can be manipulated by a system controlled by those who hold certain prejudices against parts of society."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"\\"If you believe that in America you are innocent until proven guilty, this book will shock you. If you believe in the death penalty, this book will disturb you. If you believe the criminal justice system is fair, this book will infuriate you.\\"Ron Williamson was a deadbeat. He was useless. A drain on the system. An alcoholic, and a petty criminal. But, he wasn't a murderer.Williamson and Dennis Fritz were convicted of murdering Debra Sue Carter in 1988. Williamson was given the death penalty, and Fritz faced life in prison. Of the two, Grisham chose to focus his book on Williamson -- a local baseball hero turned mentally disturbed small-town criminal. Though, I found the story of Fritz more compelling (Fritz's wife was murdered several years before he was accused of killing Carter, and the killer was never captured), in hindsight, I understand why Grisham chose Williamson.Williamson was everything a jury would dislike and hate. He was a burden on his family. A burden on his town. A burden on what few friends he was able to make and keep. He was loud, obnoxious, and irritating. Mentally disturbed and lacking treatment for a majority of his life - both in and out of prison. (Note: The book is also an interesting study on the problems with the mental health care system in the United States.) His behavior was awful, and at times, it was almost impossible to sympathize with him while reading the book.He's exactly the kind of person an individual sees and thinks, \\"Why isn't he in prison.\\"But, even the town drunk deserves a fair shake. Even the town deadbeat deserves justice. Even someone you hate, loathe, and despise, doesn't deserve the death penalty for a crime he did not commit. And, in between the shock and horror you feel when reading about how badly the police and DA botched the investigation, how disturbing it is that one could be sentenced to life in prison and death on such flimsy and circumstantial evidence, that's the message Grisham is sending.The book starts out as a slow read. I'm a very fast reader, and I found myself having to trudge through the first half of the book. The trial begins about halfway through the book, and that's when the pace really picks up. I zoomed through the second half of the book in one sitting.The lack of evidence against Williamson will appall you, particularly when you consider the fact that he was sentenced to die for his \\"crime.\\" The lack of evidence against Dennis Fritz was even more grotesque.Throughout the book, Grisham makes no attempt to hide his bias. Then again, I think anyone that wasn't involved in the initial investigation would be biased against how it was conducted. The details paint a horrific picture - no embellishment is needed or necessary, and it shows just how wrong the justice system can be when the individuals charged with finding justice are more interested in obtaining a conviction of the person they deem guilty, despite everything the evidence is telling them.The second half of the book details Williamson's and Fritz's life in prison, their appeals, and eventually, the involvement of The Innocence Project. It closes with details about Williamson's & Fritz's life after prison and exoneration.Local reaction to the DNA exoneration seems to range from embarrassment, anger (at Grisham), disbelief, a continuing belief - despite DNA evidence - that Williamson and Fritz were guilty, sadness, and outrage. If you are interested in reading local reactions, you can find them by searching the Ada Evening News archives.Overall, Grisham did a bang-up job telling Williamson's story. And, despite the early pacing problem, this is definitely a book that everyone should read."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"this book is very moving and unbelievable, especially because it is true.

Even if you know the outcome already and the writing style isn't out for suspense. The nonfictional narration is constructed as a history of a criminal case and less intended as a thriller. In the English edition in midsection there are photographs of some participants which help a lot to put oneself in there place and empathize with them. It is a book that gives a deep insight in the touching life of a wrongly convicted person, who is hit hard by destiny several times - the burst dream of a baseball career, alcoholism, drugs, women, schizophrenia and eventually the condemnation for death penalty. It is a distressing factual report of a human tragedy, put together from many conclusive pieces of a puzzle. To my mind no page is too long and no excessive information is given. Anyway I can recommend this book warmly to every empathic, humanely and politically interested reader."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I could not put this book down, it was an amazing read.

It concerns the wrongful conviction of Ron Williamson, a former baseball player, fallen on hard times, for the murder of waitress Debbie Carter.The book gives a great insight into the small Oklahoma town of Ada, where the crime took place, and how the local police, and District Attorney, were hell bent on getting a conviction for the murder.There is also, great detail given to the trial, and Ron's life on Death Row, but it always stays interesting, throughout. If this book was fiction, I would have found it a great read, but as it is factual, it makes even more compelling reading."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is an exceptional true book that John Grisham has given to his readers. The Innocent Man causes the readers to place themselves in the position of a prisoner when they are not guilty but have been charged as guilty and sentenced to death or life without parole. It is not a place anyone would want to be in but rather be FAR from it. The story occurs mostly in Oklahoma in and near the city of Ada. Peggy Stilwell's beautiful daughter, Debbie Carter, was one that liked to live by herself and do things that she wanted to do without her mother or anyone interfering. She wanted to be independent. Some of the places at which she worked or hung out were not the best places in town but as I said, Debbie was a free spirit.When Peggy Stilwell found her daughter nude, bloodied, raped, and dead on the floor in her own apartment, she was horrified. The investigation began by tracing her activities from the time she got off work early to when her body was found. In 1982 many of the present day tools for tracing clues were not available but the shoddy work done by the inexperienced police force in Ada did not help the situation at all. Many possible suspects were interviewed, many of which were let go without close investigation. After several months the trail finally got to Ron Williamson. Ron had been a baseball nut, playing for his schools wherever he went and being quite successful until alcohol started dimming his ability to play. He would not accept that his career was over no matter how old he got. His mind always retained that he was a great baseball player and still could play with the best.As time went on, his drinking and drug use became a huge detriment to his living and his ability to keep friends. His short-term marriage ended. He went from one rehab center to another. Eventually Ron Williamson and Dennis Fritz were arrested and charged with the murder of Debbie Carter and the police suspected they were also involved in some other rapes and murders. Dennis Fritz was not nearly suspected as much as Ron so most of the attention and investigation and some very shoddy police work was done against Ron Williamson.Ron was out of prison at times but he was repeatedly rearrested, again because of the uncertain evidence gathered by the police. Eventually Ron Williamson settled into his prison life while getting more and more mentally unstable as every week passed. He was sent to various psychiatric hospitals and was interviewed by many shrinks all of who thought he was very unstable. Life in prison was a nightmare for any inmate but especially worse for someone in Ron's condition. He aged very fast even though he wasn't an old man.This true story will guide you though Ron Williamson's life from youth to his final days and all he endured in and out of prison. Another book that is hard to put down. Knowing it is a true story makes it even harder to absorb and makes one wonder about our justice system. Please read this great story by a terrific author."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is a compelling indictment of our so-called justice system. The supreme court says it is better that a guilty man go free than an innocent man be wrongly convicted. Yet this happens all the time; the police/prosecutors fashion the evidence to fit their theory of who is the guilty party and judges go along with this. To get a guilty verdict is a means to career advancement.John Grisham tells this story with compassion and shines a light on the disgraces that occur every day. Even in the rare event of a reversal of a guilty verdict, as with this case, there is a ruined life which cannot be reclaimed."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have read many of Grishams books and they are all really good.

I could not put it down!"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"First, the good news. As a courts and legal affairs reporter the past 40 years, I have covered thousands of criminal cases and trials. And I remain fairly confident that the grotesque miscarriage of justice so artfully detailed in this nonfiction masterpiece is a rare occurrence. After all, if it were not, the injustices of Ada, Oklahoma, would not have triggered publication of this best-seller and two other books of outrage.But, here's the bad news. The Innocent Man is nonfiction and this grotesque miscarriage of justice actually DID happen. No patriotic American can be proud of a system in which events like these can occur. To learn that the prosecutor and the cops at the center of this legal mess had the stones to sue for libel just adds insult to the injury of The Innocent Man. They should have slunk off quietly into a sunset of anonymity and hoped to heaven no one could ever link them to the cases from this book.Grisham has performed a public service by lending his legal-fiction rock-star status to the story of this transgression. I hope he donated some of the revenues from The Innocent Man to the Innocence Project so that group can continue its valuable work.And, I hope every prosecutor and cop in America reads this book carefully as a reminder that their true role in the system involves serving justice not just closing a case."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I had long ago stopped reading John Grisham's novels. I think it was \\"The Pelican Brief\\" that ended it for me. I always though his first, \\"A Time to Kill\\" was my favorite. And in some strange way this new non-fiction book seems to be a worthy companion to that novel. But here Grisham is mad as hell and not going to take it any more. He asks how we can have a system of justice where those who are sworn to uphold justice do so much to undermine the process. Leading as it does in this case to so many innocents on death row. With a power of his convictions Grisham tells of the case of Ron Williamson who is falsely convicted of rape and murder. (Did not Alfred Hitchcock love these kinds of plots?) Along the way Grisham undermines the \\"common sense\\" belief in confessions, eye witness testimony, and failure of police investigations and the power of the government over those who can not afford to hire the best defense. This is a riveting and powerful read. I can only say many thanks to him for bring these events together in a simple, compelling narrative that only a novelist can many time provide. As a best selling author I am sure a wider audience learned about this injustice and the further revelations of the deep problems in our criminal justice system."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is a very disturbing nonfiction book about our judicial system, a heinous crime and a wasted life. It showed how several innocent men were convicted of murder and that in reality, one is really guilty until proven innocent rather than the other way around. It is a very sad documentary about a talented high school athlete who really ruined his life with drinking, drugs and got framed for murder, and developed mental and physical illness. It's unbelievable how these innocent men spent 12 years in prison while the appeals courts kept upholding the verdict in spite of all the bungling and lack of evidence in the first trial. The main thing I learned from it is if you ever get brought in for questioning by the police, don't answer any questions without an attorney present, even if you are innocent and have nothing to hide! The fact that this really happened makes horrific. I recommend this to anyone interested in legal thrillers, the justice system, or prison life."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I can't say that I enjoyed reading this book.

The book mainly depicts five wrongful convictions for murder. Of those five cases, there is one in particular that gets highlighted: Ron K. Williamson's. Ron is a former athlete bedeviled by mental illness that gets railroaded in a murder case in a small town courtroom in rural Oklahoma.There were irregularities all the way from the police investigation to the prosecution and, even later, during the incarceration period. Ron Williamson's ordeal as a Death Row inmate elicits the sympathy and compassion of the readers towards him. John Grisham, the author, is an accomplished writer that keeps the reader spellbound throughout the book."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is the very first book that I have read by John Grisham and since then I bought all of his books."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Marvellous audio book!My wife and I bought it to listen to on the way from Texas to the East Coast oif Florida via auto.

Very revealing and important reading for all the prosecutors...etc. My low opinion of American justice system has found deeper understanding. I have seen worse only in third world countries."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I was trained as a lawyer and am a member of the bar (although I don't take private clients), but I haven't had much contact with criminal law. As a law student, I once assisted in the defense of a mentally handicapped man accused of attempted murder. From that experience, I was struck by how poorly the criminal justice system is designed for handling those who have mental problems. I wrote my J.D. thesis on that subject. This book brought all of those issues back to the front of my mind.In recent years, many have been astonished to learn that DNA evidence has exonerated large numbers of people who have been convicted of murder and are residing on Death Row in one state or another. The legal theory is that ten should go free rather than one innocent person be misjudged. Clearly, the reality is nothing like that. Although there are many career criminals (that's how they earn their living), those who don't seek to commit crimes daily are often mistaken for those who do. For example, people with various mental problems will \\"act up\\" in ways that violate the law. Put them in jail, and they may attack a guard . . . making another law broken. The downward spiral can be pretty fast and dangerous for all involved.In The Innocent Man, John Grisham has chosen an intriguing subject . . . the life of Ron Williamson, a favored son whose life once spread in potential glory before him as a professional baseball player. Due to chronic mental problems, Mr. Williamson's life began to unravel while he was still an athlete. After his athletic days were over, he often sought solace in alcohol . . . and sometimes drugs. Two women had accused him of rape, but he beat the raps. But when a local woman was murdered not far from his home, the police liked Mr. Williamson for the crime . . . even though he had an alibi from his mother. From there, a frame-up followed . . . for which Mr. Williamson later collected a large sum from the legal authorities. While in the criminal justice system, Mr. Williamson didn't get the treatment for his ills that he needed. As a result, he couldn't help defend himself. His lawyer was blind and seemed to be having a bad week, which made matters worse. Soon, he was convicted based on a faulty \\"confession\\" during which he described a dream and misstated descriptions of hair sample \\"matches.\\" The death penalty was ordered for him. Over the course of many years, he endured inhuman treatment, abuse, and what amounted to torture while his physical and mental states declined.Thanks to the dedicated work of those who do appeals for Death Row inmates, the conviction was reversed, and he was cleared by DNA evidence on retrial. A parallel story looks at the effects on his family and friends, one of whom was implicated in even flimsier \\"evidence\\" and sentenced to life imprisonment (who was also exonerated through the DNA evidence).So who was the murderer? It was the main accuser who made up the testimony to avoid harassment by the D.A.So should you read this book? If you think that the criminal justice system works like the show Law and Order on television, you should. Television doesn't capture the reality of what criminal \\"justice\\" is all about. There are major problems with how the accused are treated and what happens to those who have been convicted.Will you enjoy this book like one of Mr. Grisham's thrillers? Probably not. This is a sad, depressing tale. And there's no happy ending. Novels are prettier.As a nonfiction book, The Innocent Man has some flaws you should be aware of: Mostly, Mr. Grisham tries to tell you too much. For example, you'll read about dozens of instances of mistreatment on Death Row . . . not just enough to give you the idea. The same detail is provided for each aspect of Mr. Williamson's life during his ordeal. At the same time, in places Mr. Grisham tries to tell you with too little information. As a lawyer, he decides he wants you to appreciate the legal wrongs involved. But he doesn't give you enough background to understand what the legal rules are, why they are that way, and why you should care when the rules aren't followed. So you end up knowing more than you ever wanted to know about incompetence issues, but not enough to understand them.This would have been a better story if it had focused on what it felt like to be Ron Williamson . . . but that wasn't really possible because of his mental problems. So the book's ultimate weakness as writing comes down to having selected the wrong person to write about . . . to some extent. But I'm glad that Mr. Grisham did write about Mr. Williamson. The story should be told, and most people will pick up the subliminal message in the book: This could happen to you!"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book keeps you thinking long after you've finished reading it. Grisham tells this nonfiction story with the same flair he has for fiction. It keeps your interest and leaves you wondering how many other people are in our correctional institutions who are truly innocent."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Both excellence and depressing are two words that can be used to describe John Grisham's recent true crime book. Grisham has done an outstanding job in analyzing the unlucky life of one Ron Williamson who went from baseball prospect to being framed for a murder that he did not commit. Ron Williamson has never known any real peace away from the game of baseball. This is because he eventually became insane and suffered from the poor state of America's mental heath system. Grisham does an outstanding job of describing both how Williamson was framed for murder, sentenced to death and how he was ultimately exonerated.This is a book that you learn a great deal from. This book is laded with facts that all Americans need to be aware of. This is a book that educates us about the sad state of both the American justice system and the nation's mental heath system. If you can open your mind, this is one book that can stay with you for quite a while after you finish it.This book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book is a vibrant, fact-filled story that goes right to the bone. The key issue, in my reading of it, was how can prosecutors and judges be allowed to carry on their personal vendettas without oversight from rational, legitimate entities. For some unknown reason, the prosecutor had an intense dislike for the two whom he later sent to prison, and, all the evidence and testimony was skewed to fit his purposes. It was not until years after the trial that anyone finally gave the conduct of the trial an objective look, and found that everything about the trial had a nasty, illicit taint to it.Does this book present a good argument for abolishing the death penalty? I think that the main impact of the book is to show the arrogance and immorality of people who should be objective in solving and punishing crimes. Some of these cases reach the public, such as the current issue involving a prosecutor's zeal in the Duke \\"rape\\" case and the promotion of crass personal agendas in opposition to over twenty thoughtful and legitimate decisions made by duly constituted judicial bodies in the Terry Schiavo incident.What is the best way to identify and remove those who stand in the way of justice? Maybe that should be the subject of Grisham's next book."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Just when I'd given up on John Grisham he writes he best book yet.

Two thumbs up for this one."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I think Grisham did the best he could with the sad characters that he had to work with. He could have come down a lot harder on the lies told by the D.A. and the arresting law that interrogated the suspects. I din't find his fact filled work any more tedious than Ann Rule that writes true crime stories also. How can you dress up the depressing facts?"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I suspect reviewers offered a 1 star rating because of political differences. If you consider yourself a staunch supporter of the death penalty and capital punishment, you'll probably dislike the book. A political difference does not mean the author has written a bad book though, so I would recommend looking past the 1 star ratings.With that said, The Innocent Man is John Grisham's first attempt at writing true crime. The story revolves around two murders in small town Ada, Oklahoma and the accompanying trials. Although four men were initially charged and convicted, the focal point is on Ron Williamson - a stand out athlete from Ada with psychological disabilities. Local authorities are pressed to solve the cases as quickly as possible and so they resort to very questionable interrogation tactics. A very impartial jury convicts all four with scant evidence linking them to the crimes.The story is both compelling & sickening at the same time but I do have complaints about Grisham's style. He's extremely heavy handed against the prosecution and in the defendants favor. Also, footnotes and/or a bibliography would have given the author considerably more creditability. This book is so heavy handed it made me wonder whether or not Grisham was as honest as prosecutors portrayed in the book. It's also not quite the page turner as some of his novels.For the record, this is not a novel. Novels are fictitious."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"The Innocent Man took a lot of nerve to write, especially the way John Grisham did. He's raw. Grisham tells everything, even if it hurts. This true story makes one smile, laugh, cry, scream, and think. Wonderful."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I seldom read Grisham but found his first non-fiction work hard to put down. The story of Ron Williamson has no happy ending. Not for Ron nor the young woman who was so brutually murdered.Grisham does an excellent job of drawing us into the story. If you have never experienced justice (or lack of) in a small town you need to read this book. Had Ron lived in New York City or even Dallas he may have gone unnoticed wandering the streets and babbling like a mad man. But not in Ada, OK."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Overall this was a very good read. It really opened my eyes to the injustice many men and women go through. It isn't a page turner like many of Grisham's novels, but I enjoyed reading it. Although, I was very confused on why the publisher chose to put pictures in the very middle of the book giving away the ending!! If you choose to read this book and don't already know the story, skip the photos until you finish the read."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This new and non-fiction work from Grisham is a must read for people who vote and care about the ever present fear of creeping injustice and lack of mental health services in their own hometown.Grisham chronicles the life of Ron Williamson, a small town sports hero with mental health problems through years of injustice centered around a Good ol' Boy legal system and community groupthink.The Orwellian doublespeak manufactured by the town's District Attorney is finally unraveled by a group of mostly women attorneys and journalists who were determined to seek the truth for Mr. Williams and all those who suffer from mental health challenges and false criminal charges.The description of the underground death row facility in Oklahoma is not to be believed and is a appropriate way to see 'The Innocence Project' in the USA in context of real people with real needs."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"John Grisham says on the book jacket that this book will shock the reader and it does as it takes a man who is mentally ill accuses him of a murder he didn't commit, the small town police officers make up evidence that doesn't exist and until DNA appears he is confined on death row. As he says at the end of the book in the \\"author's note\\" this could happen to anyone living in a small town who has any kind of a mental or physical disability. Not only do the police officers make up evidence but the so-called judges ignore information that should have been given to the defense attorneys. As to \\"death-row\\" any one might go insane confined as was Ron Williamson. In some places there isn't any daylight, no windows, and no air-conditioning. Some prison guards retrict the amount of food portions prisoners get and they become malnourished. I realize some people think murderers deserve whatever they get but how do you live with yourself after this person has been killed and maybe they were innocent? I think John Grisham wrote this book as an eyeopener to what can actually happen! In the ending chapters he tells that Ron is released and is overwhelmed in trying yo readjust to being \\"free\\". Ron was only 51 years old when he died of cirrhosis of the liver. He didn't develop this just for the little time he drank in his life but because his medicine was often not given or he was given too much when the guards wanted to quiet him down. Ron always maintained his innocence, he was a strong survivor and he was wrongly convicted. Would you want this on your conscience?"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I am amazed at the other reviews that I have read here. I loudly applaud John Grisham on a gripping story. I have read all of Mr. Grisham's fictional work and am a big fan. I approached this book with some trepidation because it was non-fiction but I was quickly rewarded. I read the entire book in one day. I could not put it down. A phenomenal piece of writing and highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I had to read this book, because I read everything John Grisham writes. I knew it would be different, since it is non-fiction. I can hardly put it down. It arouses in me such a myriad of emotions - shock, pity, anger, disbelief, hopelessness - toward the \\"innocent man,\\" his family, the victim, her family, prosecutors, judges, law enforcement officers, inmates. Grisham is a great writer, and his approach to non-fiction is still spell-binding. If you're prepared for a serious read that will awaken in you an understanding of how our justice system can go awry, get this book!"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"You'll hate reading this, but it's very good. If you \\"get it\\" this book will stay with you for a while.Some find this work of nonfiction disappointing. This is apparently because Grisham requires himself to work with the characters as they really are, rather than dolled-up and dressed in drag for an audience that thinks \\"CSI:Miami\\" depicts real law enforcement, ER is real health care and god protects good people. His sentences are short; his tone is almost clinical. In some ways it reminded me of reading a legal brief. This is part of what makes it so frustrating to read, and so spellbinding. This is what happened. Painting a pig doesn't make it a puppy. Grisham's use of language in this story conveys, at least to me, the enormous restraint his \\"fiction writer\\" side must have exercised to maintain the discipline of this writing style.Grisham forces us to deal with the unvarnished truth by refusing to varnish it. What happened to these men is what happens when human beings become so convinced of their righteousness that they think the rules no longer apply to them; that they have some sort of dispensation from ethics or the rule of law. Or they become so lazy that they just don't give a damn. Combine that with poor or sick defendants, inadequate defense resources, lazy bureaucrats and cruel and subhuman penal authorities, and two men rotted for more than a decade in a penal system that is about as rotten as they come. Grisham didn't need to embellish this story. You can't make this stuff up.And if you can still support the death penalty after reading this, you must have an interesting way of seeing the world."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is a must-read book! It will change your views about equal justice for all. It is non-fiction, but as compelling as all Grisham's novels. Grisham holds a certain point of view about our criminal justice system, and unashamedly and eloquently unfolds in a real-ife example why he holds these views. Five stars for a brilliant expose.Not surprisingly, this book has attracted some strong negative attention; from the Ada District Attorney, Bill Peterson, who has put up a website to refute the book; and from the NDAA (National District Attorney's Association). You should read John Grisham's book, Bill Peterson's website (google on \\"bill peterson da ada\\"), and the Wall Street Journal article, \\"The Page-Turner as Polemic\\" (google it) written by the vice president of the NDAA, and reach your own conclusions. I recommend, however, that you read them in the reverse order of their listings here. That way, when you read the book you know what to watch for.Many folks hear both sides and get confused. Who is right? This is entirely unnecessary. It is not difficult to know which party is right if you keep a couple of critical issues uppermost in your mind.When you read Peterson's rebuttals, simply remember to ask yourself if the innacuracies he claims Grisham made are the ones that would have made or broke the case? Ignore the inaccuracies that are not case breakers. They are just \\"smoke\\" and \\"window dressing.\\" Remember that the lower review courts stated that Peterson made errors -- many of them -- but they happily dismissed them as not being case breakers. Peterson owes Grisham the same latitude. And Peterson owes it to the public to address the case breaker issues -- which he studiously avoids on his website.Key to your decision is to ask why Peterson never addresses the failure of the police to take hair and blood samples from Gore, the last person Debbie was seen alive with? No matter how you slice, dice, and recompile, this was incompetence. They'd already made up their minds who was guilty, and focused all their attention that way. This is not good police work. Period.Then ask yourself if Peterson explains why he withheld exculpatory evidence, which is against the law and a violation of the defendant's Constitutional rights? He does not deny this. He ignores it.All the other \\"errors\\" Peterson points out are, in my opinion, diversionary.The evidence is clear that the gross miscarriage of justice was discovered and understood BEFORE the DNA analyses were ever proposed. The Habeus Corpus reviewing judge flatly stated that there had been a gross miscarriage of justice, by which he meant deliberate violations of the defendants' Constitutional rights. The processes by which they were convicted were unjust. Their convictions were in the process of being thrown out -- before the DNA evidence.This is different than saying they were not guilt. It is simply a statement that their convictions were invalid. Peterson could have tried the defendants again. But the justice system clearly understood that Peterson and the Judge had denied the defendants their Constitutional rights.Why is it important to point out that their conviction was being overturned before the DNA evidence came in? Because Bill Peterson is using it as a screen, pretending that he was just doing his job, mistakes are made, and he was astounded ... but happy to see the error corrected before it caused their death. Bah! The call for reversal of their conviction -- prior to the DNA analyses -- clearly shows that he used illegal tactics to gain their convictions. And now he pleads that he just made a mistake, like all other prosecutors inevitibly do. No. The Habeus Corpus judge's ruling tells us he went beyond what the law allows in his zeal to convict. Peterson would now have us believe that his willingness to have the DNA analyses done shows his openmindedness. But there is another more compelling interpretation, which is simply that it demonstrates he was utterly certain they were guilty. He had no doubts whatsoever. This is not a good trait in a prosecutor possessing such flimsy evidence.When the DNA evidence came back, Peterson still believed the two defendants guilty. And there is good reason for this. The secret lies not in the evidence he believed so strongly in; but in the evidence he suppressed or ignored, or never bothered to collect. It is this ignored and suppressed data that is crucial.There are two kinds of people in the world: 1.) the ones who quickly make up their minds what is right (usually what is in their interests) and thereafter exclude all other information that contradicts what they now believe; 2.) and those who tentatively make up their minds, but keep their minds open to new information. A prosecutor must be of the latter type, else he/she will be an instrument of gross injustice. It is the attitude of \\"Screw (and suppress) the contradictory evidence; we know they are guilty! Now go find me more evidence that will convict them!\\" that makes the former kind so dangerous in such a position of authority.Recall that District Attorneys can't be sued for their mistakes, unless they act outside their legal scope of authority. Peterson needs to explain why Ada paid handsome compensation to the two defendants in the lawsuit brought against him -- for acts outside his legal scope of authority? Because it was cheaper than a protracted trial? Yah, sure! Gimme a break. It is to the shame of the Ada citizens that they can't see through the smoke and discover the truth. Sometimes such obtuseness is willful; that is, this is the form of justice they prefer. Bill Peterson is still in office.Don't forget to check out the review of Grisham's book by Joshua Marquis, another small town DA (in Astoria, Oregon), and vice-president of the NADA, who calls Grisham's book a polemic. Apparently Mr. Marquis can't see that a DA who violate the law and a defendant's Constitutional rights deserves to be slammed. He misses the most important point. Every prosecutor makes mistakes, and the law protects them when they make mistakes within their legal scope of duty. But that is not why Grisham slams Peterson. He slams Peterson and the Judge for illegal acts and incompetence -- framing a defendant (very hard to prove in court, but not hard for \\"reasonable people\\" to see that it happened), incompetence (proven; else Gore's fingerprints would have been taken and checked against those in Debbie's room), hiding exculpatory evidence (proven), and denying adequate representation (proven). Sadly Mr. Marquis thinks Grisham should not pass judgement on these miscarriages of justice. Hopefully the voters of Astoria, Oregon will be as unsatisfied with his view of fairness as I am, and relieve him of office."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"John Grisham has demonstrated once again why he is one of the greatest writers of our time in his courageous study of the American Legal System in this thrilling yet disturbing expose' titled 'The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town'. With great insight and a sharp direction to the blindness of injustice, Grisham portrays not just the life of two innocent men, Ron Williamson and Dennis Fritz, both convicted of a crime they were not guilty of, but more importantly, the author demonstrates how our criminal justice system, though considered by many to be the best in the world, is filled with great fault and injustice due to the fact that the very same system we trust is at times run and operated by individuals who are not concerned with the truth but with self promoting record keeping . . . for some law enforcement - getting the arrest . . . for some prosecutors - getting a conviction. In directing his overall efforts at the discrepancy and faults of the U.S. criminal justice system, author Grisham is very clever in picking the heartbreaking stories of Mr. Williamson and Mr. Fritz since the small town politics and \\"cowboying\\" of law enforcement that unfortunately occurs from time to time is not immune to larger populated cities. Ada, Oklahoma, the town where Mr. Williamson and Mr. Fritz were tried allowed the author to put the local system under a careful microscope . . . and just like politics being local with a grander scheme, so too is this country's legal system.In raising the benchmark by citing the horrendous case of former baseball star-in-waiting, Mr. Williamson, Grisham shows the beauty of the American dream: the pursuit of your dreams followed by the efforts in obtaining your goals followed by the inevitable fall from grace and the limited support of an unforgiving society at times keen on the blind eye of injustice. After his departure from Ada, Oklahoma to the major league baseball farm systems of the Oakland A's and the New York Yankees to peruse a potential big-league career, Mr. Williamson eventually returns home due to a career ending injury (a great statement made by Grisham to young athletes pursuing their dreams; get your education). Broken with shattered dreams, Williamson ignites himself by embarking on a world of self-destruction many former athletes are all too familiar with: drugs, booze, unemployment, etc. Soon after, Williamson along with his partying friend, Dennis Fritz, is arrested for the murder of a local waitress and are essentially railroaded with great urgency through the justice system: the local prosecutor and corrupt police officers not interested in finding out the truth. With precision, Grisham shows how a limited investigation by local police and prosecutors interested in furthering their own career by obtaining guilty convictions for both Williamson and Fritz. Williamson is order to be executed and Fritz ordered to spend his life in prison. The prosecutors were able to obtain the convictions despite no credible evidence. This is nothing new to our legal system. It darn well should be, though.And so it goes in today's American legal system; too many innocent persons being found guilty of crimes they didn't commit and too many individuals are being coerced to take a plea for something they did not do in order to stop the insanity of prosecution . . . especially when the prosecutor's office has an unlimited amount of funding to make the charge, and the typically charged person has limited financial resources to defend themselves. I also want to point out Mr. Grisham rightfully makes it a point that the vast majority of those who work in the legal system are honest men and women trying to make a positive difference in the world. Not all players are self-egomaniacs: but their negligent influence on the system has deformed the very nature of 'blind justice'. Earlier today, and to my surprise and shock, I just read a fascinating story coming out of Chicago about two brothers, Brian Gaughan Jr. and Kevin Gaughan, who were being charged by local law enforcement with minor crimes of trespassing that were eventually turned into assault on a police officer. The facts appear that the two boys were victims of police brutality, as indicated by the fact the arresting police officers resigned from their job. ABC, CBS, and NBC news have all reported that the Gaughan brothers soon after their arrests filed a civil suit against the local Marengo, Illinois police and the State police of Illinois in juxtaposition with their ongoing and two year old legal battle defending their innocence. Once this happened, the State of Illinois police involvement in this small-town case elevated to mind-boggling levels, as both prosecutors from Illinois and the State Police of Illinois began to throw wave after wave of financially crippling motions and actions against the two young boys - and shockingly threatened the stand-up civil servant parents of the two boys: Brian Gaughan, Sr. (a well respected firefighter and local IAFF president working in Cook County, Illinois), and Carolyn Gaughan (a corrections officer working in McHenry County, Illinois) with criminal prosecution of their own unless the large and seemingly rightful lawsuit against the State of Illinois is dropped. In correlation to what Mr. Grisham has clearly written in 'The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town', the Gaughan brothers case and many others like it across this great nation scream out: Where is the accountability of out of control prosecutors and law enforcement officers? What system or controls can be put into effect to better serve those who have been victims of crimes (remembering that if an innocent man is convicted of a crime, then the guilty party is still at large)? What can, if anything, individuals facing tsunami like prosecution do in retrospect to a system set up more like a cattle ranch interested in getting the steer off the land and into a cage than seeking out full justice? Where is the accountability in a system so many individuals in society believe in and why is it that many citizens are freely willing to simply take as final truth what is reported by police or on in the news?I applaud Mr. Grisham in his aim at the big picture that is the injustices of the American legal system and in taking aim at demonstrating how the system itself is in need of great reform and how without a more checks and balance system in place, there exists an all too much frequency for innocent men and women to be convicted of a crime regardless of their innocence. An interesting point by Grisham and one that I feel must be addressed, is how at times self-serving prosecutors use the financial inability of a criminally charged individual to plea to a conviction of a lesser charge in order to better serve their own prosecutorial record. In many ways, Grisham takes a giant swing at the machine that is the criminal justice system and the multi-billion dollar industry that has been created. Clearly, prosecuting crime in the U.S. has become a big business in this country, as opposed to much more needed efforts geared at rehabilitation and social re-entry. A second issue that Grisham brings out is how the use of DNA has changed the landscape of this country's prosecution of those who have been charged with a crime. With legal advocates such as lawyers Barry C. Scheck and Peter J. Neufeld bringing out DNA oriented truth vehicles such as 'The Innocent Project', the issue of prosecutors using more purposefully and openly DNA is widely held as an important part of the investigation process for certain crimes.'The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town' is more than a case study of the faults of the American legal system. This is a story of strength and perseverance. It is a skillfully crafted story written in Grisham's familiar southern style of the nature of the human soul and spirit. It is a story of right v. wrong and good v. evil. Mr. Grisham has outdone himself in this non-fiction story of the wonderment, pain, and most of all the fragileness of human life. An absolute must read . . . a must think . . . and critically, a call for dialogue to make a change for better accountability in the policing system we need to trust. The brotherhood and sisterhood of the men and women who wear a shield are made up of some of the finest individuals and leaders in our society. I am personally most grateful to many and have family members who work in different areas of law enforcement. What John Grisham has pointed out is that the limited actions of individuals not acting on their duty as members of the court can and will continue to jeopardize the legal system in the United States. It is up to both those who work in law enforcement and those who work independently outside of the system, including the press, to point to issues that can change the system for the better. Similar to what George Washington said the night of his first presidential inauguration on the steps of Federal Hall in New York City that \`liberty is a great experiment entrusted to the American people', it is clear that the American justice system is a continual experiment continually evolving. It is up to the keen efforts of individuals working within and from outside the system to hold accountable this great experiment called liberty - which the criminal justice system is a part of. In John Grisham's The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town we have an extraordinary book by an extraordinary man who happens to write - and make us think a bit more."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book is a compelling story of a prosecutor and small-town police force out of control. The question of how our governments should respond to the story is not as easy as the outrage one feels mid-way through the book.Grisham's first non-fiction work uses techniques from the muckraking tradition, and makes no apologies about it. Often over-the-top, full of preachiness and indignation, he could have had a greater impact simply telling this powerful story.Thankfully, the author did not succumb to the current non-fiction fashion of inflating the book to a thousand pages. It's a quick read -- and it's worth the read, and it should be required reading for every prosecutor. (Full disclosure: I'm a prosecutor.)The harder issue is what to do about the manifest injustice detailed in this book. No system is capable of preventing injustice when the actors in the system are corrupt. But this story involved a clutch of bad actors in one community, all with authority. It does not follow that this is a systemic problem, nor that a systemic solution is called for.Making policy on the basis of anecdote is foolhardy. This book makes the case for a prosecutor's disbarment, not the abolition of the death penalty."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Unlike most of the known reading universe, I am not particularly a John Grisham fan. I like his writing, but his subject matter, legal thrillers, does nothing for me and in fact I avoid such subject matter by any author like the plague. This of course is a matter of personal taste and in no way is a comment on those who do enjoy his fictional work. On the other hand, in reference to his fictional work, I did read A Painted House and found it to be one of the best books I read that particular year. I noted that the primary body of Grisham fans hated that book as it was not his usual offering. Again, this is a matter of taste. I also note that we now have something like 421 reviews posted for this particular book, so, following my usual practice I will not go deep into plot, etc. That all being said.....This, for me, was one scary book. It is a pretty well documented work showing just how our legal system has broken down, how there are different standards applied to different social classes of people, and how easily power can be abused in our system. I fully admit that Grisham has probably put some spin on some of the facts here, but the underlying story hit pretty close to the truth. I live in a small town near the area most of the action in this book takes place, i.e. Ada, Oklahoma, and I am quite familiar with \\"justice\\" in many of the small communities in the area. Quite a number of cases here in S.W. Missouri could be made into just as a compelling story that Grisham uses here. I am also quite familiar with the village of Ada, and trust me, Grisham has pretty well nailed the place correctly. I am also quite familiar with some of the individuals in this book, including Ron Williamson himself, and again, the author has them pretty well nailed also.Overall, the book is pretty well written, although I must admit that the author dose ramble quite a lot and the book could probably have used some heavy handed editing. At times it gets so repetitive that I wanted to scream and simply dump it. It is an odd book though, despite this, I simply could not put it down once I got started. I think the story of these unfortunate individual was so compelling, that sifting through the endless repetitive details was quite worth it. I cannot imagine being placed on death row, setting there year after year, knowing I was completely innocent. I did, unlike some other reviewers, enjoy the authors description of jail and prison conditions. Having visited many over the years, I felt the author's observations were quite accurate. I also felt, unlike some others, that the Grisham was probably overly kind to the local District Attorney. If you live in small towns in this part of the world, you will find that almost all of them have at least one horrid little person of his ilk on the payroll. This is sad, but true. If you really want to read some funny \\"squirming,\\" you should go to Bill Peterson's wed site. It is not only funny, but rather pathetic.Overall, I have to give this one four stars. Not the best I have ever read, but then again, not the worse and it is well worth the read. For those of you that are not inclined to dig through the book, I might suggest the CD, which is unabridged and well read by Craig Wasson. I both read the book and listened to the CD while driving. I actually enjoyed the CD more."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"... but it's not. It only looks like fiction in bad taste. Instead, this truly happened as described.I'm not summarizing the story as the editorial reviews and most reviewers before me are quite descriptive.May I just say that I think that every judicial system has its share of faults and flaws, but what's revealed in this book is simply astonishing and unbelievable from beginning to end. I can only hope that it rattles a few consciences whilst increasing awareness to prevent disastrous consequences for those involved.As it always happens when I read J. Grisham's books, I've appreciated and enjoyed the clear and well structured narrative, even more so on this occasion. Being a real-life story, I'm sure it must have been quite a task to extrapolate all the relevant facts from all the interviews and paperwork generated by this case during the years, in order to present them clearly to the readers.Unless you already know the epilogue, try not to peek at the photographs published right in the middle of the book. Some are quite revealing for the yet-to-be-read rest of the story. They don't actually \\"spoil everything\\" -in fact, whatever unfolded after turning those pages kept me on the alert and as incredulous as ever- but I still think it would have been preferable to print them at the very end of the book.A part from that, \\"The Innocent Man\\" is highly recommendable."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book is fantastic. It reads easily like a fiction novel, but you are always aware that these events are true. That knowledge makes the suspense and twists and turns that much more thrilling.I highly recommend this book for those on both sides of the Death Penalty and believe it should become required reading in law schools. How can our legal system go so wrong with a defendant who was so ill? How could a man who was arguably at the pinnacle of every boys dream-come-true in America's Pastime - baseball- drop so far?At the very least, this is definitely a good legal thriller."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I've never read John Grisham, so I didn't know what to expect. I am not a fan of fiction. I understand many of Grisham's regulars are disappointed that he wrote a tedious and depressing non-fiction book.When I think about the ordeals that Ron Williamson has gone through I am reminded of the seriousness of a potential habeaus corpus suspension. Wrongful convictions happen regardless of whether we wish to be reminded. To me the reactions expressed to this book are more shocking and depressing than the book itself. As Grishams states, Barry Scheck's Innocence Project has freed 180 prisoners by DNA testing and has inspired 30 more innocence programs. Obviously, Scheck cannot save all the innocent, and the job gets harder everyday. We live in a time when freedoms are placed on the table of sacrifice for a very minute piece of security.It is not my point to be hard on the others that have reviewed \\"The Innocent Man\\" negatively. I would have hoped many would have read Grisham's book and thanked him for the enlightenment cast on the subject of habaeus corpus. Perhaps since Grisham did not add more commentary readers miss a big part of the book.This book includes eleven years of Ron Williamson's life on death row. There can be little optimism here. However, knowledge is power, and you will benefit from reading this book."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I bought this book because his stories are based on the legal aspects of life and I like that aspect of his writings.I admit I'm a serial Grisham reader.This book however,is an interesting departure from his previous fare.'The Innocent Man' is of Capote's 'In Cold Blood' genre, andthis book imo, tells a story that reminds/informs it's readers about the injustices that have/are being committed in our legal system.It's an important work in that it reveals how prosecutors have an almostunrestricted power to send people to their death, and how the innocentdefendant's only hope of exoneration depends on a handful of sharplegal minds in the Applellate Court apparatus.This is a thought provoking and informative book and I highly recommend itto fans of True Crime stories and people interested in the legal profession and death penalty issues."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book is a keep-you-up-all-night read. I received it as a gift on Sunday and by Tuesday evening, I was reading Grisham's notes at the end! Grisham-wise, I'd compare my total attachment to this book to the grip The Firm had on me back when it first came out...but BETTER!Grisham's produced a shockingly beautiful piece of nonfiction. I plan to draw on this book to instruct my English students in the use of rhetoric. Each page contains example upon example of items that I know my students can relate to. I expect a couple of them will enjoy a good read at the same time. I know this is a book that I will enjoy working through more carefully a second, third, fourth...time.Thanks, John Grisham. This book is an inspiration and a wake-up call. I can't wait to discuss/debate the death penalty with my students."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I've read nearly all of Grisham's books and loved them all. This one is no exception.In this book, he takes on a different writing style. You know the end from the very start - it's curiosity about the truly absurd details that make up the story that kept me reading. There are no plot twists - it's a straight-forward, shocking story. Grisham's sarcasm and disgust with the situation is clear and unquestionably appropriate.This is an intense story...and although approached in a manner that differs from his other books, the quality is still exceptional."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book won't settle the argument of capital punishment, but one should come away from this read adamant that such cases are heard with only the most thorough and qualified people in the legal system allowed to hear and argue them.\\"The Innocent Man\\" reveals so much about how horrific incompetence from police detectives combined with a prosecutor totally uninterested in the real facts of a case all in the name of politics nearly killed a man.The sad part is, many people have been incarcerated and executed for crimes they did not commit. Hot heads in the towns where the crimes occurred and pressure on local law agencies to catch someone, anyone, and hopes for reelection in the case of prosecuting attorneys are a terrible combination, as this book shows.Grisham is a brilliant writer and this book will rattle a lot of readers, which is good, since Grisham is probably the nation's best selling author.One hopes that the real bad guys in this book, the Ada, Oklahoma, police detectives, the district attorney (all three of whom should have been sent to prison themselves for their unbelievable conduct), and the jailhouse snitches (you'll have to read the book) get what's coming to them."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"OK, as some reviewers noted, this book does tend to be somewhat long and repetitive. I must admit I skipped over quite a few paragraphs here and there.And real life defendants just don't lend themselves to storytelling. They're ordinary people, often with mental problems, who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Ron Williamson comes across as a tragedy. We can recognize that he contributed to his own misery: had he accepted a college scholarship instead of a signing bonus, who knows what would have happened?The worse tragedy was Dennis Fritz, a guitar-playing school teacher, who visited Williamson at a low point in his own life. Once his name was tied to Williamson, the police hounded him non-stop. Ironically, career criminals often fare better with police questioning because they know the angles and they know who to call. Fritz, like most innocent people, thought, \\"I'm a law-abiding citizen. If I just explain what happened, everything will be okay.\\"Not okay. The police even managed to get Fritz fired from his job. Both he and Williamson served time for crimes they didn't commit.Because Grisham uses a creative fiction novelistic style, readers may get the idea that this situation is unusual. It's small town America, close to the southern US. The police and DA are determined to get a conviction so they find whoever's conveniently available. Somehow they never get around to getting DNA samples from the man who was last seen with the murder victim.Can't happen anywhere else?Rent the videos After Innocence and Capturing the Friedmans. Injustice is everywhere. The New Yorker reported the story of an Arizona district attorney who lied under oath to put an accused man on death row. He was suspended from the bar for three years. DA's have little accountability, it seems.The Innocence Project, briefly mentioned in this book, estimates that 5-6% of prisoners are innocent. Some have been accused of crimes that won't be solved by DNA.If you read this book carefully, you come to realize that (as many legal scholars have pointed out) the DA comes to court with enormous advantages. Defendants can be represented by attorneys who resent their assignments. They don't always have access to laboratory tests that will allow them to rebut prosecutory evidence. In fact, jurors need to ask what resources were available to defendants before filing a guilty verdict. They need to be trained in the limits of eyewitness identification. And most of all, they need to recognize that prosecutors are not infallible.Recently a friend -- an educated professional -- told me about his jury experience. \\"We had no problem finding him guilty. The ballistics tests showed he fired the gun at such-and-such angle...\\"So, I asked, did the defense present ballistics evidence? No? Why not?It hadn't occurred to him to ask, let alone question the prosecutor's tests.That's why we need this book and a whole lot more. I feel more strongly than some because, about 50 years ago, one of my relatives served time for a murder she didn't commit. She was literally in the wrong place at the wrong time, with no family or friends who understood the criminal justice system. So from an early age I knew it could happen to anyone. I still do."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"A must read, you see exactly how innocent men are convicted, and you don't have to be black. It will open anyone's eyes to the judicial system, and how this case went so wrong, but in the end was victorious."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I started reading this book with out any knowledge of the subject matter other than the jacket cover. By the time I finished I was suprised, appalled, and thankful. Suprised by the extent of the prosecutors need to \\"solve\\" the crime, appalled at the extent of American \\"Blind Justice\\" and thankful that there are people willing to assist in the defense of Death Row inmates. I am not surprised at the inability and ignorance of the judicial system to recognize mental illness. It is not the police who are responsible for this, they can not turn a blind eye but the judicial system should not be blind or corrupt. I care for a family member who was jailed for an extended periods of time by the judicial system as a vagrant and a drunk (his only crime), when in reality he is bi-polar and schizophrenic and doesn't drink. In this book I see him and am glad that he is not on the street at the mercy of the judicial system. Grisham does a good job of presenting the story in a manner that is not preaching against the death penalty but instead making a case against the process for those who can not afford the best legal counsel."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"\`The Innocent Man' refers to the true story of Ron Williamson, a young man from a small town in Oklahoma who was wrongly convicted of murder back in the eighties. Along with friend Dennis Fritz, the two became the prime suspects. They were tried, convicted, and incarcerated for a crime in which the prosecutors said was overwhelmed with evidence, though in reality, consisted of evidence that was fabricated and practically nonexistent.After living the life of an admired high school student and baseball hero, Ron's careless off the field behavior led prosecutors to reel him in as main suspect for the murder of a pretty hometown girl. He was then subjected to years of harassment and litigation by authorities who blatantly ignored the existence of real evidence pointing elsewhere, a legal system that also ignored the progressive mental illness that inflicted Ron throughout the trials, throughout latter life as well.Though Ron was often a known deviant and rebel rouser in his younger years, one who the local police saw as trouble, the fact is, he wasn't a murderer. It's good to see that justice finally prevailed once the case left the ignorance of the small town courtroom and caught the eyes of a more insightful legal system. That's what saved Ron's life and reputation.\`The Innocent Man' is an important book for at least two reasons. 1) It's good that John Grisham was able to depict the truths about the legal system and how easy it is for an innocent person to find him/herself a convict on death row, mainly because of the incompetent and fraudulent activities of those supposedly there to enforce law and order. 2) The story of Ron Williamson is such a travesty of justice that it's good the truth behind it was put into proper perspective for all to read, and that the guilty and irresponsible parties involved could read it as well, and see their names mentioned and characters described and ridiculed for what they truly were."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Loved the book hated the horrible things that happened to all these wronged men.

A tragic occurrence of injustice and terrible police work led to two men being wrongfully convicted of murder. It is a heart breaking story and an eye opener. It is obvious from reading this book, and Grisham's \\"The Chamber,\\" that he is against capital punishment. This book will give you second thoughts about the death penalty.

Perhaps that's what the critics should have done. Not my normal type of book, I admit, I prefer fiction, for me Grisham along with Harlan Coben is the best there is in the modern world. But nevertheless I picked up the book, a present from Father Christmas.The book pulled me through page my startling page. I gasped... my mouth fell open on more than one occasion. I applauded Grisham's words, his research, HIS open mind and his perseverance to bring these cases of miscarriage of justice to the world stage when he could have so easily written himself a ten million dollar cheque with another work of genius fiction.Grisham takes the reader down the road where sanity ends and insanity begins and more importantly what happens when a corrupt and lazy County judicial system opts for the easy out.The line of least resistance.The town - the county - the country - wanted a conviction.So let's try the nut!Easy peasy, Ron Williamson was so mentally imbalanced they must have thought they were on to a winner.Ron Williamson.My heart went out to him as I recalled my early twenties when a friend of mine set path on the same route when all around him could do little but proffer their support and lend an occasional ear.I sympathised with Williamson as I did with my friend.I screamed no! On more than one occasion and I'm not ashamed to say I cried at one point. This type of book is necessary to bring to the attention of the so called civilised world that injustices do occur. And shame on you to the prosecutor and the police department and to the individuals with no heart and a huge slice of apathy and sheer laziness. I just hope you continue to sleep straight in your beds at night. And my biggest criticism of all, levied for the church who preach forgiveness and compassion on a daily basis and in particular the small town church in Ada where the Williamson family including Ron attended and prayed and preached for generations ...and Ron Williamson a committed Christian during his whole life, embracing Christianity before, during and after his incarceration, shunned by the very organisation he loved and respected.Irony... his reward, God's answer to his prayers... a terminal illness just a few months after he tasted freedom after eleven years of hell on earth.To the church of Ada and to the Pastor who remains unnamed (for the best) in the book, may your Lord forgive you!And for Grisham, a brave and compelling piece of work and because of his illustriousness, one that will ultimately be read by the masses. And so it should be."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I'm not sure what people expected of this book. A number of the reviews complain that \\"The Innocent Man\\" is merely a compilation of facts, whereas others lament just that.I found the story of Ron Williamson's life and sad journey through the legal system captivating, and am thankful Grisham chose to write about it.

I wish he would write more of these than those boring mystery/thriller novels.This book is an excellent look into capital punishment in America, esp. when those who have been convicted were convicted with faulty evidence, bad testimony from witnesses, and small town investigators out to solve crimes quickly, and not without error due to public pressure. This is the one book that outrages you, and makes you wonder about your current system. The one thing that really made my blood boil about the true story in this book is when it was proven that the 2 men in this story who were wrongfully convicted were subject to threats from the victims family & the KKK, and the public ridicule from their places of worship.I'd have to say that this is the true crime novel of the century, and with very sensitive subject manner that will make you rethink your position on capital punishment."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"There were high expectations when I picked this up. The story looked pretty interesting. It turned out to be just that. And highly repetitive. The thing was, what was interesting, stayed interesting. But it still stayed highly repetitive as well. So as well as talking about a potential baseball player who never had a chance, Grisham offers more. He gives his view concerning the death penalty, prisoner's rights, DNA analysis, police conduct, and more.So here you have poor Ron Williamson, a man sent to death row for crimes he never committed. He was a potential baseball player, with all kinds of talent. The problem was that I had trouble feeling sorry for the man all the time. You read about his childhood, and about how he got practically everything he wanted. You read about how he was your basic spoiled brat. But he remained spoiled in his adult years. It almost seemed like he set himself up in a way without even knowing it. Always wanting to get drunk, always wanting to be the life of the party. Never content in one place for too long. But he was still wrongfully convicted, and served some hard time for a long chunk of his life. A man named Dennis Fritz joined him on this journey. While it hurt Ron a lot in the long run, his mental illness was never undermined. And it makes me question that if Ron, like a lot of other mentally ill people, played off his illness at times, and knew a lot more then people gave credit for.This was something I was glad I picked up, but would probably never buy in the future. It takes you to the depths of death row, to piles upon piles of beer cans, to contently playing guitar and singing a song. It also speaks of a man who didn't give up, and was one to die hard. When Ron Williamson lived his life, he lived his life to the fullest. I wish that John Grisham could've made this more interesting. It seemed as if he'd taken scripts from \\"America's Most Wanted,\\" and wrote the book that way. In the end, there will probably be day to day wrongful convictions. That's no secret in today's world. My opinion will never change on the death penalty. I believe it needs to stay for those who actually deserve it, and make no mistake about it, there ARE those who do indeed deserve it. In the end, I feel sorry for the family of Ron Williamson who put up with all this, and I commend them for hanging in there."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Grisham writes non-fiction about a wornlgly accused Yankee Baseball player accused of murder.

Grisham raises some valid and troubling evidence about how law enforcement officials and the judiciary will sometimes cut corners and abridge people's rights to get a conviction in a high profile case. The many injustices done to Ron Williamson and Dennis Fritz are inexcusable and outrageous. In the forefront is the fact that Williamson was convicted of murder on multiple occasions when it was clear to all present in court that he was mentally ill and desperately needed help. The police denied treatment to Williamson, preferring to make fun of him and play games with him while he was in prison. Grisham's storytelling abilities are on full display as each chapter of this story further enrages the reader with all of the blatant injustice done to these two men.Grisham is a master storyteller. The action and pacing are crisp. The details are revealed as they need to be, for maximum effect. His earlier novels have been the literary equivalent of candy, but this is book is a masterwork, and will hopefully inspire changes in the way justice is meted out in small towns.This is a great read for anyone interested in a good story and social justice."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I am probably one of the few that did not know this was a non fiction book when I first got it.

Kudos to Grisham for taking on this project and hopefully making thousands of people aware of the injustice going on around our country....."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have mixed feelings about this book.On the one hand, it is a shocking look into the very real problem of wrongful convictions and their impacts on everyone involved, particularly in death penalty cases. Unlike most such cases we hear about, this is an account of how a small-town, white sports hero who became mentally unstable was railroaded by white cops, prosecutors, judges, and juries into a death sentence for a murder he had no involvement whatsoever in. Even worse, the authorities knew who actually did commit the murder, but did nothing about it for nearly twenty years.The story illustrates an important truth: Rather than being innocent until proven guilty, we are actually innocent only until we are suspected of being guilty; at that point, we are guilty until we can somehow prove we are innocent. Too bad for those too poor or too unstable to defend themselves.Ron Williamson came within days of execution and was saved only by the dogged work of a team of lawyers who became convinced that he was wrongfully convicted. This is a sobering lesson for death penalty advocates. What happens when there is a mistake-- or, even worse, deliberate misconduct-- in the process and an innocent person is sentenced to death?On the other hand, this is not a very enjoyable book to read. Its structure is confusing and repetitive. Williamson's erratic, self-destructive behavior is described again and again. Perjured testimony from the trial is repeated many, many times. In short, the book is nothing whatever like Grisham's fiction, which features very tight writing.I suspect that this is the result of his obvious outrage at what happened to Williamson. In his \\"Author's Note,\\" he says that he had never previously thought much about the problem of wrongful conviction. Apparently, the facts of this case overwhelmed his writing skill. He says he could have written 5,000 pages, but, thankfully, he did not.So, I think this is an important book about a critical issue. However, I can't say that enjoyed it very much."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I thought Mr. Grisham's first Nonfiction book was excellent. In my opinion Mr. Grisham should be applauded for educating the public on how our legal system can go terribly hay-wired. The dominance of this book takes the reader on a journey into how ordinary people can have their lives ruined by a miscarriage of justice. This is a major page turner and the author's deep feelings of disdain toward the criminal justice system are very apparent.I'm thankful that Mr. Grisham decided to write on this worthwhile subject. A must read book for everyone!"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This was an eye opening & shocking story. Some of the timeline of the subjects' lives was a bit tedious & hard to get through, but their story is important to know. The book was, in the end, a satisfying read; however disappointing at how some things & people turned out."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"4.5 out of 5 stars. John Grisham has done a wonderful job of telling the story of convicted murderer Ron Williamson and the people connected with his case. While I enjoy the occasional Grisham novel, this nonfiction is my favorite book of his so far. Incredible bungling by those in charge as well as intentional lies and misleading meant Williamson spent years on death row, not getting the help he desperately needed for mental issues. How sad, and how frightening knowing that it could have happened to any of us. All it took in this case was for those in charge to believe Williamson and Fritz were guilty and were determined to convict them, the legalities and ethics be damned. And even sadder that the case was not an isolated one. While as interesting and fast-moving as any Grisham novel, this story is also an important cautionary tale."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I've enjoyed Grisham's novels for their fast pace and gripping plots (although sometimes he seems to be following a formula). This, his first non-fiction book, seemed long and often redundant. It is as if he had to do a lot of research to get it right and, having done so, wants to make sure you are dragged through it in laborious detail. The point could have been better made (for me) had he more crisply handled the material with a few of the more dramatic examples of the his subject's experiences rather than many virtually identical experiences belabored."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"John Grisham changed courses with his writing and wrote this true account with as much style and fascination as any of his books.

Its also a good story that shows how shocking events reorient a young man's life."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book is a gripping, slow-burn, experience. If you want fast cars and glamorous characters, stick to Grisham fiction. This is a well structured book and the author leads you through the complex and intertwining stories with skill.

It is a Pandora's Box, because justice has been steadily eroded and it seems there are way too many innocent people in prison either by being in the wrong place at the wrong time, or because prosecutors and police seek successful prosecutions or plea bargains to the detriment of truth. Another book to look at is The Tyranny of Good Intentions: How Prosecutors and Law Enforcement Are Trampling the Constitution in the Name of Justice, by Paul Craig Roberts and Lawrence M. Stratton. Another good read."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I found this book boring and repetitive, unlike Grisham's fictional works. Near the very beginning I concluded that DebbieCarter's killer was Glen Gore. Of course, my method of prosecution might not hold up in a formal courtroom procedure. If anyone other than John Grisham had submitted this manuscript for publication, it would have been rejected."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Although I'm not usually a fan of Grisham's fiction, I'm glad I kept an open mind regarding this work of nonfiction, a true-crime story of the conviction of two innocent men in 1980s Oklahoma. Grisham tells the story straightforwardly and lets the tension and the outrage build up. There was essentially no evidence against former baseball star Ron Williamson, who sadly began to suffer from mental illness and alcoholism, yet the pressure in the small town of Ada, Oklahoma, to solve a grisly murder mystery was too great. Had it not been for the advent of accurate DNA testing, Williamson might well have been executed or at least spent his entire life in state prison. The legal system can and does fail on occasion. That's a lesson from this important book."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have just now read this book due to attending grad school for several years and thought it was one of the BEST, if not the best book I have ever read. I have always liked Grisham's fiction books because he is an amazing storyteller and his books are fast and easy reads. However, this book should be required reading in ALL law schools and for anyone who may think innocent people seldom get convicted. If Grisham NEVER writes another book, he has made a valuable contribution to our society by exposing the corrupt nature of one of the many legal systems in our country.After reading this book, I can honestly say that I have a totally new perspective on how prevalent corruption can be in the court system and I have reassessed my views on the death penalty and treatment for all prisoners. In addition, I have witnessed and been the recipient of cruel and unfair treatment from superiors within the school system for 25 years. This book made me stop and think that while working under dictators was frustrating and stressful, the outcome was nothing compared to being on death row or in prison for 11 years for a crime I did not commit.On a positive note, the caring and goodness of mankind was ultimately demonstrated by all those who worked tirelessly and unselfishly for many years to get Williamson and Fritz released from prison.A MUST read."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"It reads like a fiction but it is a documentary, eye opening.

I was pleasantly surprised, since I had sworn off wasting any more of my time on Grisham books.This non-fiction offering, his one and only, turned out to be quite the surprise. Maybe it doesn't rate a 5 star review, and maybe someone can find flaws, but the bottom line is that the book was a enjoyable read. Yes, it may be to some extent depressing, perhaps anger inducing, but mostly it is memorable. I recall and share the story with others."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This in my opinion is a must read; however I'm a huge fan of John Grisham. I think once you've read even one of his novels you'll feel you need to read them all."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I think one of the things I missed most about this book was the John Grisham charm. He still added his touches to the story, but you could tell it wasn't his story.Still, I am shocked and saddened at what happened in this story. Not only the inhumane treatment that Ron suffered at the hands of the guards at McAlester, but just in general that he and Dennis sat in jail and on Death Row for almost twelve years before they were proven innocent. I was outraged everytime I saw Bill Peterson's name, knowing that he surely had screwed something else up. I can't believe he's still the District Attorney in Ada! I was shocked everytime Judge Jones made yet another bad ruling. From not pointing out that maybe Ron wasn't mentally competent, all the way to the ridiculous ruling he made on the Brady issue. What a disaster! And then for two Appeals Courts to uphold the death sentence was incredible. What pleadings where they reading? Obviously not the same ones as Judge Seay's office, since they saw the incredible injustice.I am glad that Greg Wilhoit got back on his feet, as did Dennis Fritz. It saddened me to hear that Ron never really found his way after baseball. And I am still deeply disturbed by the fact that Tommy Ward and Karl Fontenot are still serving life prisons as I sit here typing this. The entire story, I was actually more caught up in their ordeal and though John Grisham said early on that when Tommy went into the police station for his lie detector test, it was the last time he'd be a free man, I still read the entire story thinking that must have been a typo. Surely he and Karl would be freed as well. :( That whole town appears to be a disaster. I know it's not just Ada, it's just that this time they had the spotlight on them. Bill Peterson surely isn't helping matters. His name alone makes me angry.I still can't believe how many people still believed that Ron and Dennis were guilty even when DNA evidence proved their innocence. Some people are so set in their ways that they can't look at the obvious. I hope in today's time, with DNA being used so often, that they now know how definite the proof is, and that they know finally that these two are innocent. Of course Peterson ranting and raving about how they were still suspects surely make it harder for the townspeople to believe that they were innocent. I look at that photo of Ron and Dennis when they were set free, and indeed you can see the hatred and the anger in the faces of the people in the courtroom. It's very sad.Overall, a good book, one worth reading, though I thought it was a little slow moving. Too much time spent on Ron and Dennis' lives growing up and not enough time spent on the trial. And hears hoping one day by some miracle, Ward and Fontenot are released."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"The Innocent Man is John Grisham's first venture into non-fiction, and it is not clear that he really understands the difference between fiction and non-fiction. All in all, it is a good book. I can see how Grisham was attracted to Williamson's story, a small town Oklahoma star baseball athlete who washed out in the low minors and then went into freefall.Williamson spent years on death row convicted of rape and murder, finally exonerated by DNA evidence and set free, living a few years until a young death from the effects of his earlier drugs and drinking. The evidence that sent him to prison was weak in the first place, mostly jail house snitches, dream confessions, and unreliable hair analysis. It is hard to imagine a jury finding a peer guilty on this but people need closure and Williamson had previous rape arrests and was serving time for forgery.All of this is a typical story of wrongly convicted man eventually exonerated by new evidence. What makes the Williamson case more interesting is the high profile nature with this book shining a strong light on the town of Ada, Oklahoma. Since the publishing there have been nasty public letters and lawsuits between Grisham and the locals in Ada. If you read the DA's web site, he is pretty effective in refuting and explaining a lot of Grisham's claims. I am not a lawyer, but the DA points out that Grisham has not been a lawyer in many years and may not understand the finer points of the Oklahoma rules. Even more remarkable is that in addition to Williamson, several others were convicted in Ada with similar approaches, some exonerated and some not."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"As time passes and DNA and other testing gets better, the number of innocents will rise.

Who didn't already know that our justice system makes mistakes? Who didn't already know that small southern towns foul up investigations? Who didn't already know that people frequently ignore the silent cries for help from family and friends and instead serve to enable disfunctional behavior?But even if you can believe that the point of the story wasn't already obvious to anyone with an attention span, how can you excuse the plodding along of this book? I appreciate that he is writing non-fiction, but that doesn't mean it has to be devoid of engaging narratives and dialog, does it? I felt like I was reading a very (very) long newspaper article and that I knew the end of the story after the first two or three paragraphs. At no point was I able to connect with anyone in the book at a personal level, which is what good story telling is about and is what this book was completely devoid of.I recommend that Mr. Grisham stick with story telling, and if he can't tell true stories in an engaging manner then go back to making them up. Don't waste your money on this book."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book made me so angry, I couldn't finish it.

Murder and Injustice in a Small Town. And Grisham does cover both, although not as well as it could have been done. It becomes very obvious that Ron Williamson is poorly treated, not compliant with care when it is available and is railroaded--it doesn't have to be repeated over and over to get the point. But the story actually weaves between two murders, and it is the other murder and its outcome that is more interesting and perhaps more unjust. For reasons never explain, in that case one man will be released and the other never will be even though the circumstances and lack of evidence are just as glaring as they were for Ron Williamson. To some extent it comfuses the story--why tell both stories but not complete one? I liked John Grisham's first couple of novels, then lost interest. I am usually love reading about justice, true stories, nonfiction. I kept reading this one hoping it would get better. It never really did, but let you unsure of what the ending really was--did the two murdered women ever get real justice?"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I am a huge Grisham fan but the way the story was written did not hold my interest."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This was a pretty good book,but I was finding it hard to finish at times."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"John Grisham, in his first nonfiction book, writes about the 1987 trial and sentencing to death of Ron Williamson for the murder and rape five years earlier of 21-year-old Debbie Carter. Mr. Williamson's appellate lawyer succeeded in getting his conviction overturned based on claims that his first trial lawyer was inadequate. While preparations for a new trial were being made in 1997, newly available DNA testing established that neither Mr. Williamson nor his friend and co-defendant, Dennis Fritz, was the killer.In Mr. Grisham's novels, the characters usually divide into two groups: the good guys caught up in evil conspiracies and the villains who concoct them. \\"The Innocent Man\\" is no different. Thanks to his abundant storytelling skills, the author delivers an account that is as vivid as the Grisham fictional fare sold at airport kiosks--but it is also, alas, just as oversimplified as his novels, and it distorts the justice system in the same way. Make no mistake, \\"The Innocent Man\\"--with its blunt subtitle (\\"Murder and Injustice in a Small Town\\") and its author's long-professed zeal to attack capital punishment--is not simply a legal thriller drawn from real life. It is a polemic.Ron Williamson was a promising high-school baseball player who in 1971 was a second-round draft choice of the Oakland A's. His family and his hometown, Ada, Okla., shared Mr. Williamson's high hopes that he would become a baseball superstar. But Mr. Williamson sputtered in the minors for a few seasons before abandoning his dream and beginning a slide into a dissolute life of drinking, drugs and crime. There were two formal charges of rape in 1978, neither charge resulting in conviction. In a letter (not mentioned by Mr. Grisham) that Mr. Williamson wrote while on death row to the prosecutor who put him there, he claimed--apparently trying to illustrate how the justice system can indeed fail--that he had gotten away with one of the rapes.The crime that sent him to prison unjustly was discovered when two of Debbie Carter's friends found her in her apartment in a grisly scene all too common in sex murders. Police went down many dead ends while investigating the case, and after four years it remained an unsolved killing in a small town--until someone pointed a finger at Mr. Williamson, who had frequented a bar where Ms. Carter worked. His incriminating statements and a strand of hair that seemed to match his own convinced police that Mr. Williamson, along with his friend, Mr. Fritz, were Debbie Carter's killers.One of Mr. Grisham's heroes in \\"The Innocent Man\\" is high-profile attorney and Innocence Project co-founder Barry Scheck (\\"...and Barry Scheck was coming to town! Scheck's fame was growing enormously as the Innocence Project pulled off one DNA exoneration after another\\"). But despite the author's cheerleading for Mr. Scheck's involvement in the Williamson case, the DNA testing that set Mr. Williamson free was in fact prompted by defense attorney Mark Barrett and District Attorney William Peterson. Far from having railroaded Mr. Williamson, as Mr. Grisham implies, Mr. Peterson--the chief prosecutor in the case--was convinced that DNA testing would further validate Mr. Williamson's conviction.The DNA sample turned out to match that of another man, Glen Gore, who had hung out in the same bars as Mr. Williamson and Mr. Fritz and who was in prison on other charges. Mr. Williamson and his co-defendant were freed in a highly choreographed media event in April 1999; they sued the government agencies involved and settled in 2002 for an amount that was rumored to be in the millions of dollars. Two years later, Mr. Williamson died of cirrhosis at age 51. Though Mr. Grisham, publicizing the book, has said that Mr. Williamson \\"drank himself to death,\\" he suggests in print that Mr. Williamson's death was caused by medications that the author variously claims were overprescribed or denied to Mr. Williamson while in custody.You would hardly know it from \\"The Innocent Man,\\" but the same district attorney's office that Mr. Grisham vilifies for its eagerness to prosecute Mr. Williamson with shabby evidence (\\"it was remarkable that Bill Peterson, an officer of the court and charged with the duty to seek the truth, could elicit such garbage\\") went just as earnestly after Glen Gore for Debbie Carter's murder. Prosecutors had to try Mr. Gore twice; the first conviction was overturned when a judge ruled that Mr. Gore's defense should have been allowed to raise the possibility that Mr. Williamson and Mr. Fritz had murdered Debbie.These attempts to bring Mr. Gore to justice, and even the murder of Debbie Carter itself, are very much sideshows in Mr. Grisham's story. He is much more interested in depicting how the once-bright dreams of Ron Williamson were destroyed by police and prosecutors who were inept at best but more likely corrupt. Yoking together the Williamson affair and the 2001 drug conviction of an Ada police officer--who was not involved in the murder investigation--Mr. Grisham cries: \\"When will the good guys clean house?\\"The one-sidedness of \\"The Innocent Man\\" is a shame, for two reasons. First, because it feeds the popular perception--nurtured by Hollywood and the news media--that death rows are teeming with wrongfully convicted men who just await DNA testing to set them free. Second, by skewing his tale, Mr. Grisham missed an opportunity to tell a well-rounded and perhaps more interesting story than the one he delivers. The author is not a journalist, and it shows: He doesn't maintain even a pretense of detached reporting. He didn't attempt to get Mr. Peterson's side of the story, though hearing from the supposedly irresponsible prosecutor might have been illuminating. Indeed, Mr. Grisham seems to have given a wide berth not only to prosecutors but also to the police and even to the judge in Mr. Williamson's trial.Opponents of capital punishment will point to \\"The Innocent Man\\" as vindication of their views, but it's not clear that their cause, in the end, is well served by Mr. Grisham's heavy-handed proselytizing. The freeing of Mr. Williamson and Mr. Fritz was the result of the legal system's checks and balances; it is characterized by Mr. Grisham as a lucky fluke in the never-ending battle between plucky defense attorneys and bloodthirsty prosecutors. While that outlook might make for fiction that readers just can't put down, it misses the fact that in the real world of complicated heroes and villains, life does not imitate art.(appeared orginally in WALL STREET JOURNAL on 10/10/06)"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I am disappointed that John Grisham did not do justice with the plot because the story in and of itself is amazing.

Justice seems to be blind in some cases. Although in the book Last Words from Death Row, the story there shows that Justice is totally blind, and that there is no pardon after death.

As such, I was and am very disappointed and can't understand how this book became a bestseller at all. I won't buy any of his book again. This book totally turned me off."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I bought a new hardcover John Grisham book from this company, a week later I get a used paperback copy.

I've read and enjoyed his \\"legal thrillers\\" as well as his other efforts such as \\"Bleachers\\" and \\"The Painted House\\". \\"The Innocent Man\\" is, I believe, his first effort at writing non-fiction.Based on this effort, Mr. Grisham should return to fiction and leave non-fiction to others. Most, if not all, of Grisham's books are a pleasure to read. They fall into the \\"can't put down\\" category. This book on the other hand has been difficult to slog through; I've been attempting to finish it for a couple of weeks.As I read the book, I was struck by the seeming incompetence of the law enforcement officials, and their zeal to get convictions in spite of what appeared to be inadequate evidence. After doing a little poking around on the internet, I think I've discovered why.

The title does not do justice to the story--it is much more interesting than it sounds.As usual, the author paints vivid, fully fleshed-out characters. What's really neat is that these are actual people, most of whom he hasn't met. He wrote this story based on extensive research of case files, and yet he depicts these people as if he's intimately acquainted with them.There are so many people who I wish would read this book--health care professionals, judges, public defenders and prosecutors. Upon reading this I think you'll see why.Bravo, Mr. Grisham!!!"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book was a great change of pace from Grisham's regular fictional courtroom thrillers. Because it was a true stroy, it was shocking. I guess my only frustration was the lack of dialog amongst the characters, but it was understandable considering the author was not present for any of the action. I suppose had there been any, it would have been an artistic liberty, and tainted the book. Overall, it was a worthwhile purchase."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"A story of what happens when small town law enforcement cannot solve a crime with hard work, talent and brains. The result is grasping at the first feasible motive and suspect rather than admit they can't solve the crime.This book was especially interesting to me as I grew up less than 30 miles from the town where the events in this book took place. I enjoyed reading about many of the places that I have visited. As most non-fiction, this book is often tedious in explaining the background and surroundings for the major characters.

More than half the book is about the background of the two defendents which to me was twice as long as it could have been. The trial didn't even start until after the midway point of the book. Grisham himself stated that he was captivated by Ron Williamson's story because if his background in law. Eventhough my opinion was that the story was longer than it could or should have been, I would still recommend this to anyone who is a fan of stories about murders, the legal system, and/or injustice."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"He's not Truman Capote, but, who is? Grisham did a competent and thorough job of relating the primary story of a huge travesty of justice that occurred in Oklahoma from 1982 through the 1990's. Basically, before DNA testing, law enforcement officials in Oklahoma used flimsy to nonexistent, sometimes manufactured, circumstantial evidence to convict defendants on felony crimes.Moreover, the penal system maintained these people in inhumane conditions, much worse than dogs in a kennel. Prisoners had no heat, no air conditioning, no fresh air, uneatable, insufficient food and no medical care. Oklahoma figured that these prisoners were going to be executed, so why not treat them as dead.Of course, the convicts paid the price of the State's actions. Ron Williamson spent 12 years in the Oklahoma penitentiary, mostly on death row, where he lost 90 pounds (he wasn't overweight when he was arrested), his teeth, and completed the deterioration of his mind. Williamson suffered from well-documented mental illness. The prison guards deliberately, for their own amusement, verbally harassed Williamson, causing him to scream of his innocence for hours at a time, until he lost his voice.The State denied Williamson medical treatment. In prison, he lost both his health and his mind. Grisham completes the picture by describing the suffering also inflicted on the relatives and friends of the prisoners resulting from the State's abuse.Injustice was not limited to the felons. The family and friends of the victims, as well as the general population, were also mistreated and were left unprotected, since the actual perpetrators went free due to the false convictions.In short, this book documents the pain and destruction caused by incompetence and abuse of power in the State judicial, law enforcement and penal systems during a relatively recent period. Grisham performed a great service in using his popularity as a storyteller to bring this shameful episode to light."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I normally like to read my books and not listen to them read by someone else.

The pictures are in the middle of the book, and the captions gave away much of what was going to happen further in the book.Sad, depressing and maddening story that Grisham does a great job relating to the readers. It's definitely NOT your typical John Grisham book, but he does the story justice with his attention to details and obvious in-dept research.Worth reading...for sure."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I purchased this book without knowing that it was a non-fiction book and without knowing what the contents was. To me, it was a John Grisham book that I hadn't read yet. It didn't take me long to realize that this was a real case because I felt like I was reading a documentary that was pieced together without much of a smooth flow. The story contents in itself about Ron Williamson and the police/justice system was very insightful but it was not one of the better books of his that I have read. I'd recommend the book to anybody who likes reading true crime novels but if looking for an exciting novel with twists and turns, this is not the book for you. I do have to commend Mr. Grisham though for bringing into light the seriously fatal flaws in our so called Justice system."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Shows the ineptness of police; very good read though.

Although very convenient, the clarity wasn't good, so that coulpled with the fact, I'm partially deaf meant I REALLY had a hard time hearing it.

Grisham does extensive research and gives such a great overview of the entire story. Once you finish the book you feel like you spent the last 40 years with Ron Williamson. It is sad how an innocent man can be in Prison for 12 years, Death Row none the less, just because people like Bill Peterson have a hunch. If you want to read a great True-Crime book, look no further, this is it. You will be finished in no time, googling the names of the people in the book, and wanting to know more.

What a sad and scary mid-west biograpy, with Grisham going over details that were maybe purposely overlooked."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This compelling tale, of which I read the last 335 pages nonstop, seems to have inspired Grisham's novel, The Confession, which has a similar plot. But this true story required much more research and at least one assistant to organize and to keep track of all the data gathered from interviews with those involved and from local newspaper accounts. Truth may be more improbable than fiction, but this account requires no suspension of disbelief at all, let alone one like that necessitated by the fictional perpetrator's partial, cane-disposing recovery. This work inevitably reinforces the perceptions that prosecutors (1) rarely seem to fulfill their responsibilities as objective, truth-seeking court officers sworn to protect the rights of defendants, especially innocent ones -- the recent dismissals in the U.S. and France of all charges against the former head of the International Monetary Fund notwithstanding -- and (2) often appear to \\"get their rocks off\\" by pursuing victory at all costs and through all available means. The novel is laced with the humor and pervaded by the author's healthy skepticism, and it easily qualifies as one of Grisham's finest achievements."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is the first book written by Grisham that is non-fiction, although the victims names were changed. The narrative chronicles the twelve year saga of a wrongful conviction and the chain of incompetence that extended Ron Williams' stay on death row. Admittedly, I had read this book previously so this was a second perusal of a topic with which I am all too familiar as a retired forensic scientist, crime scene investigator and deputy sheriff. It is therefore difficult to view this as a normal citizen and I review it with that caveat.The writing is typical Grisham, clean and straightforward. No wordsmith, Grisham lays out the facts and tells a good story that is perhaps more interesting than fiction. But Grisham is also sold on the necessity of putting his name before the public in exposing problems in the criminal justice system in order to give it greater exposure, for which he should receive credit.In short, this is an important book, not because of the specific story of Ron Williams, but because it should be read by everyone. The liner notes say it best: \\"If you believe that in America you are innocent until proven guilty, this book will shock you. If you believe in the death penalty, this book will disturb you. If you believe the criminal justice system is fair, this book will infuriate you.\\"I received a copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Grisham goes into such detail and development of each character the book becomes too tedious. Add to that, the dark and depressing plot, it was hard to keep plowing through the book. Whereas I have enjoyed Grisham's other books, this one was hard to keep reading. I only hope that the corrupt legal system that is core to the book is not wide spread.JAK"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"In many ways, 'The Chamber' may be Grisham's finest hour as a writer, but this book may be his most important book to date.The Innocent Man is the story of four men who were wrongly convicted (three received the death penalty) but the primary focus is certainly Ron Williamson and his rather devastating encounter with 'justice' in America. Ron is not what we would call an upstanding citizen but he certainly appears to have come from a loving family and absolutely struggled with mental problems.\\"The Innocent Man\\", through Ron, explores the failure of our criminal justice system. Families who want justice find themselves hating the wrong people while the real criminals in the case pay no penalty. How does this happen? Well in this case its a function of incompetence, desperation from prosecutors and pressure from a public demanding answers. The answers the public get are a result of torturous interrogations, jail house snitches -- never reliable, in addition to outright lying and deceptive practices amidst a general circus of corruption. I think what is most shocking is the end result. When all is said and done, the innocent suffers, those who committed these heinous acts of injustice go unpunished, meanwhile the public still believes that the right person was punished. How does this happen? Grisham offers no exact answers. He is there to write a story. It is really us, the public, who should be asking these questions; otherwise, we ourselves could be the next victim of this terrifying ordeal.Finally. My only complain of the book is the ending. I think the ending was too sentimental and lacked the ending punch I was expecting, but this is a minor issue compared to the brilliance of this book."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"When I began listening to this in the car I did not realize it was non fiction and I couldn't understand why the narration was like a documentary. Then I realized midway in the first disc that it is a documentary. I was completely engaged from that point.This audio book tells the story of Ron Williamson and another man, an acquaintance more than a friend, who are wrongfully accused and with planted and circumstantial they are convicted of a brutal rape and murder. The book description above summarizes the gist of the story. The documentary report pulls together, from the beginning days of the crime to the arrest, the facts that resulted in this travesty and the slow research and assistance that finally exposed the corruption and resulted in the release of the two men eleven years later.If you like to follow a trail of evidence and can stomach the injustice this is an excellent audio.

Having read some decent reviews, I was expecting a gripping and eye opening read.Eyeopening it sure was in regard to the travesty of justice, but, wow, what a tedious and laborious read. Was this even the same writer who crafted such engaging stories as \\"The Testament\\" and \\"The Brethren\\"? Quite honestly, this read like one really, really long, dry, newspaper report. Did he forget he has the ability to even engage the reader - fiction or otherwise? Does a blues musician forget he even knows how to play guitar just because he's decided to try and do a rock number? I wanted to put the book down so many times, but decided I had already invested so much time into getting so far it would be a shame not to see it through just to read the conclusion. But I'm not sure the feeling of a marathon is what Grisham was intending to create when he wrote this thing....and here's my biggest dislike with this book: The sarcasm contained within. Credit goes to Grisham for tackling this and he is entitled to feel strongly about it and say what he thinks. But surely someone as gifted in writing could have come up with better language and text to try to persuade the reader to agree with his personal viewpoint. I felt I was being talked down to on many occasions - not pleasant - whether or not I agree with his viewpoint. I'll watch TV news reports if I want someone to think for me and slant it with their tone of voice. My thought is if you are doing a straight documentational work, stick to the facts and credit the reader with the ability to draw the correct conclusion. Honestly, this made me gag.I'm not saying the book shouldn't be read, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone I know because of the way this was done. Such a shame, when the subject matter itself is so important that I think it should be shared with everyone."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"The Innocent ManThis is the best of Grisham's great books; a true story, truth is stranger than fiction and it could happen to you or someone you love."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I find many of the reviews in this thread amusing. One should not compare non-fiction with fiction. John Grisham has written a masterpiece of legal non-fiction. His journey through transcripts and the history of this case is equivalent to a public service. I am confident he could have written several fiction books in the same time that this book took. His royalties would have been much greater with fiction.I rarely read fiction because non-fiction is about real life and not about imagination. A person generally favors one over the other and to analyze them with the same standard is unfair. One should read what s/he prefers and decline to impose the same standard on works that are totally different in concept.I note that some reviews criticize the fact that Grisham spent time detailing the personal history of Williamson and Fritz. The reason for that is Williamson and Fritz were/are real people with actual histories. Victor Hugo's description of Jean Val Jean was somewhat detailed also. :)I am familiar with the cases referenced in the book and know some of the persons involved. An elected public official is under tremendous pressure to convict someone when there is an heinous crime. The elected official and his supporting staff can become convinced that someone committed the crime and lose his/her objectivity. The elected official often rationalizes his/her conclusion by the opinion that the defendant may not be guilty of that particular crime but is probably guilty of some other crime for which s/he has not been charged.Is the elected offical a malicious person? Generally not. But the results can be extremely malicious. The conviction of an innocent person is reprehensible but equally disturbing is the fact that the actual perpretrator remains free and no one is looking for him/her. The saving grace in the Williamson/Fritz case is that the actual perpertrator ended up in prison for another crime before his involvement was discovered.The use of jailhouse snitches would be comical if it was not so serious. A jailhouse snitch has no credibility but the prosecution will use them and jurors will believe them. It is incredible that their testimory is given any weight. The use of hair analysis is similar in nature. It is just one step away from letting a clairvoyant testify.Most people think they are lawyers. They have watched television and think they understand the system. The actual practice of law is totally different. The stress of defending an innocent person with minimal financial resources is incredible. The system is geared to convict and the concept of the presumption of innocence until proven guilty is a fiction.If any of you ever have the opportunity to sit on a jury, I pray that you will fulfill your duty with your head and not your heart.Thank you John Grisham. If someone else had written this book, it would not have received equal publicity.Read the Dreams of Ada as a followup to Grisham's book."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is a fantastic book.

The mindset of many people in Ada? It is hard to put down. The writing is so fluid and compelling. It takes guts to write a book like this. I admire John Grisham for this work.

Can't wait for the next one!"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"The Innocent Man is the author, John Grisham's, only non-fiction book. He says he chose to write it because it was a compelling story about a man on death row, sentenced to die for a murder he did not commit. The man, Ron Williamson signed a contract with the Oakland A's and thought his life was going to be set as a major league baseball player.After some setbacks at the Farm system level Ron came back to his hometown of Ada, Oklahoma a failure. Feeling embarrassed at not making it in the big leagues he began to hang out in bars and drink heavily. It was here in this setting he met a young waitress named Debbie Carter. When Debbie's body turned up brutally raped and murdered at her apartment Ron was charged with the crime. After five years of looking for debbie's killer and nothing but dead ends, the authorities arrested Ron Williamson and his friend Dennis Fritz for the murder. One small detail the police and prosecutors failed to realise....Ron Williamson was innocent. Both of the men were tried and found guilty as the prosecutors used junk science and the testimony of jailhouse snithches to convict them. Fritz was given a life sentence, while Ron was sent to death row.Grisham goes on to tell of Ron's struggles with mental health and the horrible conditions of his tenure in prison while on death row. Many times while reading this book you find yourself appalled by the tacticts used by the autorities to manipulate any attempts at justice for Ron's freedom. You wonder how this could be happening to him, while at the same time holding a secret desire to see him vindicated of the murder and the real culprit caught and found accountable for young Debbie's death.There is a feeling of pending futility sitting in a cell awaiting your death for something you didn't do. You want to scream loudly for someone, anyone, to come to your rescue and stop the painful anxiety driving you to maddness as each day brings you closer to the date of your final demise. I found myself pulling for Ron to get out of prison and begin to put the broken pieces of his life together again.Mr. Grisham does a worthy job of presenting Ron's life and struggles. He is to the point, reporting the findings of the case, as they happened, interjecting enough emotional moments of deprevation experienced by the family as they prayed for Ron's release. I wanted to see the men who did Ron dirt through their false testimonies and trial maipulations in pursuing his continued incarceration dealt with by the law, either themselves thrown in jail or disbarred from any future involement in the criminal justice system for the remains of their lives. There is no equal compensation for taking a person's life away from them, as they cannot buy back one hour of youth once time has trampled over and left it in history's rear-view mirror.Charles Hamilton Sr. Former Executive Director of Northwest Teen Challenge and author of From Darkness To Light and A Step Of Faith.

Did I have to work harder to remain in the same horror I felt when started the reading? Or, maybe Grisham could trust me a little more and make the message less didactic? Or, maybe I'm just too the impressed by completely fictional but so trueThe Green Mile : The Complete Serial Novel?I love all Grisham's books, especially his classical prose having no action but a lot of meaning and real craftsmanship, likeA Painted House.

All of his books have been so throughly written that in the past I always feel that I have learned something from each.I bought this book BECAUSE Mr. Grisham wrote it, but I wasconfused and disoriented every time I tried to read it. I happened to be traveling and I have to admit, if I had brought another book on the plane, I would have gladly abandoned this one. I felt that his thoughts were all over the place, one minute talking about Ron, then his family,or his friends, then on to other cases, then back to Ron.I had to re-read some chapters just so I could stay on track! He repeated so many discriptions and symptoms, I wondered if he had started to need fillers, however he mentioned at the end that he could have easily written5000 pages- in my opinion, Thank-goodness he did not!I managed to finish the story, and I am sure no one would dispute the horror of Mr Williamson'slife and unfortunate dealings with the justice system.He started as a manipulative and spoiled athlete, then as an abandoned mentally ill man, treated unjustly by a small town's version of justice.None of the horrors should have happened, however,they did, just as they probably still happen to people somewhere everyday. No one ever claimed that ourlegal system is without flaws, but it is still better that other countries by leaps and bounds.I will continue to read John Grisham, however after this non-fiction, the next time I will use the library instead of my checkbook."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"The story is truely compelling and the book needed to be written, but would have been better if it followed the format of \\"Skipping Christmas,\\" a small, quick read.Instead, we have an edition of Dateline that just never ends.

And, please realize that such a review comes from someone who owns all first edition hardcovers of previous books and I've taken into consideration \\"A Painted House,\\" a book I was unable to finish due to severe bordom."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Obviously, this was a miscarriage of justice; however, if Grisham's agenda was to argue against the death penalty, he does not convince me. Whoever killed this girl (Gore?) should die as a matter of justice. Ironically, it is the new techniques that Grisham documents that tell me that we have less of a chance of executing an innocent man than ever before. Simply put: murderers do not deserve to live. Innocent men should never be punished for crimes they have not committed. I've always thought this and still do."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Grisham had better stick to writing fiction.

I knew this was a true story but I thought it would be told in a fictionalized format similar to Grisham's best selling thrillers.

Just be aware, this is not typical Grisham."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Please bring back the real John Grisham. What is this? I feel like I just read a summary of a \\"60 Minutes\\" script. Okay, there is injustice in America. Imagine that! Is this the same guy who wrote \\"The Partner\\"? I didn't see any redeeming value in the telling of this story. There isn't much relating to be done with any of the characters in this book. The book is written well, I guess, but the story is just not worth it. At the end, Grisham says he had so much research and testimony that he could have written much more. Thank goodness, someone with sense edited it out. The book was plenty long."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Just seeing the name Grisham led me to pre-order this book from Amazon so I'd have it in my home as soon as possible. When it arrived, I felt like a kid at Christmas, but was soon disappointed. I actually got halfway through the book before calling it quits and going right to the end. Although the story was well written, it dragged on and on, eventually losing my interest altogether. Boring would be a good word to use at this point. I was actually relieved to put it on the bookshelf and select something else to read.Maybe pre-ordering isn't the best option to use."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"this is an excellent book, is a shame to think that only the poor are on death row, any1 can get away with a crime as long he /she has money, the justice system only apply depending how big is ur wallet"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"What a poorly written book. It is fragmented and incohesive, jumping in-between story lines of the different characters and timelines with no warning or transitions. What an appalling mess. It really isn't even a novel at all. But it gets even worse: Grisham beats you over the head so hard with the same redundant material throughout the book, trying to make his point, that you will simply get sick of hearing it. For instance, he never quits harping about Ron Williamson's mental status. In fact, Grisham focuses so much on minor historical details about his alleged mental deterioration, his treatment and refusal of treatment, all while trying to elicit sympathy, that he completely destroys the flow of the story. You begin to wonder if you will ever learn the outcome of the story, because the book is really just a long laundry list of complaints. But there is another major problem: his so-called facts are as confused and conflicted as he purports the evidence at Williamson's trial to be. One minute he's writing that Ron is lucid, developing friendships and convincing his lawyer that he is innocent... in short, behaving normally. The next he is telling us Ron is suffering from serious illness and so mentally unstable he's flinging his own feces. Both can't be true, but Grisham flip-flops between the two stories so often my head was spinning. He seemed to use whichever story as the truth whenever it happened to suit his point. Ron Williamson bounces back and forth between being mental competence and incompetence that I have no doubt he was simply playing the system and using his so-called illness to win an appeal. When things were going his way, he was perfectly fine. When he didn't get his way, suddenly he was mentally ill. Just look at his testimony in his last trial. For a man on the brink of madness, suffering from years of abuse, he certainly sounded a heck of alot smarter than me on my best day! Grisham was a fool to believe his story. The man was a life-long conman from his early years, who shamelessly used his own family for his own advantage to get whatever he wanted through a combination of charm, threats and abuse. The man may have been innocent of murder, but he was a violent career criminal and most likely a rapist. Lastly, the pace of the book is beyond ponderous. Prepare to be bored to death with the same redundant details and complaints, doled up and rehashed over and over again. For some reason the author feels that if he doesn't snipe at the injustice of the system every ten pages, the reader will forget about it. Ultimately the book does illustrate the profound wrongdoings of the people involved in the case and the flaws in the legal system, but it is as sloppy and disorganized as the system it seeks to criticize. Trim 100 pages (seriously) and you might actually have a decent book."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"John Grisham is an extraordinary writer... of fiction. Granted, The Innocent Man is a story that needed to be told, just not by Grisham. Starting with the first few paragraphs, it quickly becomes apparent that Grisham's exceptional talent for fiction is inversely proportional to his aptitude for non-fiction.I was actually quite surprised by the awkward phrasing and apparent unease that the author seemed to undergo in his telling of this horrifying true story. Grisham's repeated use of short, choppy sentences were almost reminiscent of (sorry, John) James Patterson's continuous dribble of lifeless prose contained throughout his last dozen or so books. Though Grisham's writing does come to life a bit toward the end of the book, it's simply too little, too late.John Grisham has rightfully earned millions of fans that look forward to his inspired and brilliant storytelling, but he needs to just move on and leave the writing of stirring non-fiction to the future Truman Capote's of the world and get back to his phenomenal gift for telling thrilling tales."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"More absorbing than \\"The Client\\", more suspenseful than \\"The Rainmaker\\", and more heart-pounding than \\"The Last Juror!\\" John Grisham's \\"The Innocent Man,\\" grabbed me by the heartstrings and would not let go!While reading this engrossing story I had to remind myself, constantly, this is not fiction, it is real life!

In all of his earlier work (The Partner, The Pelican Brief, even non-legal works such as The Bleachers, and A Painted House) there have been strong enough background details to keep me amused and in suspense to the point where I couldn't put the book down.

The truth in this book should help change things but I doubt it."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Although I have always enjoyed John Grisham's novels, this true crime story was just average.On the plus side, Grisham does a good job of exposing a very corrupt and inept criminal justice system in Ada, Oklahoma resulting in the wrongful convictions of Ron Williamson and Dennis Fritz for the 1982 murder of Debra Sue Carter. He does an adequate job of documenting police corruption, ineffective lawyer by the defense team, amoral zealotry by the prosecutor, and incompetency or worse by the trial judge. This case was full of misdeeds on the part of virtually everyone involved. It involved a horrible situation: One person sent to prison for life and one to a death sentence for a crime that they clearly did not commit.On the negative side, Grisham turned a potentially compelling true crime story into one that is anything but riveting. Some parts are repetitive and overall it is just not a well done true crime book. Certainly Ann Rule and Vincent Bugliosi are among those who far outshine Grisham in this genre.The other problem is that the author lets his personal political biases take far too prominent a role. As he did with his anti death penalty crusading in 'The Chamber', Mr. Grisham again turns a book into a platform for his own views on prisons, the death penalty, etc.In spite of the negative aspects, I recommend this book. It is valuable in terms of enlightening readers about the incredible potential for abuse by police and prosecutors who have made up their minds and try to fit the evidence or lack thereof to their own theory."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Read Rob Warden and David Protess' books \\"A Promise of Justice\\" and \\"Gone in the Night\\" instead.

But he cannot keep himself from commenting on the lousy work done by the police and the DA's office. There's no mystery to the plot because the author has already revealed what he thinks about the characters. Descriptions of the \\"innocent man's\\" behavior have to keep recycling because he never really changed that much.Frankly, I would rather read Grisham's fiction, which is taut and memorable."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Grisham should stick to fiction. He seems to have well vetted his recitation of the facts in the case, and it brings attention to innocent people which are no doubt behind prison bars. However, many writers could have recited the facts of the cases with some background thrown in the mix, but duties or causes such as these could be done just as well by any number of writers. Grisham's talents are best used in the area of fiction, spinning fascinating yarns on real issues facing the law and lawyers with the latitude given him in the fiction arena.I pre-purchased \\"The Appeal\\" , and chose to include \\"The Innocent Man\\" in the same transaction. I am only on the second CD of his new novel and he has already reminded me why he is among the most entertaining writers today.(Both of these audio books were listened to in the unabridged version, the only audio version that deserves consideration.

This book is the account of those who are not, particulary one man, Ron Williamson, who after spending 11 years on Death Row, and the rest of the time avoiding the cops, confides to his sister that he would have rather \\"never been born.\\"I like the book, except for the first chapter, where Grisham writes \\"the people of Ada....are a pleasant blend of small-town southerners and independent westerners.\\" Woah, I think to myself. \\"The people of Ada?\\" How about SOME of the people of Ada? Christian fundamentalists are pleasant? Corrupt cops are pleasant. Lazy lawyers and crooked judges are pleasant? How about prosecutors and DAs that are meaner than junk yard dogs? For this strange sentence, I only give four stars.Still, Mr. Grisham is obviously very good at charming people, and winning their trust and confidence, otherwise he never could have written such a complete and thorough book.The subject matter here is really dark. Two lives put on hold for 11 years, one life totally ruined. This is the story of a couple of poor Oklahomans who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, namely, in this case, in their homes where they belonged. Doesn't matter. If the cops are out to get you, they will.Only after DNA evidence absolved them of their murders were they finally let free from prison (one from Death Row, where he come within days of receiving the dreaded needle).This book has it all: bible thumping small town folk, corrupt cops, lazy prosecutors, vicious attornies, lots of trailer trash, bounced checks, drinks on the house, vignettes of jailhouse life, bad gums and bad teeth, nicotine stained fingers, baseball, small town courtroom proceedings, titty bars, just about everything except gratuitous sex. Oh, and I almost forgot. A real grisly murder.Four stars. Definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Grisham has an auspicious way of carrying a book on. Readers are always waiting to turn the page. The Innocent Man did not reach those expectations. The title alone told the whole story. The only thing I did not know about Ron Williamson (the main character) was that he played baseball and was a junkie. The one component that irritated me about this book was that in the middle section there were pictures that gave the whole climax away. I knew that somewhere in the end Williamson was going to be re-tried as not guilty, but why ruin it for the reader? Why continue reading if you know exactly what is going to happen? My reading habit isn't as fugacious as this one was, but I stopped at page 240. It became too redundant. Call me a quitter, nah; call me a guy who is highly disappointed with a book that was labeled a \\"NY Times Bestseller.\\" Trying to read this book was like waiting to watch a new Law and Order episode, but a repetitive rerun comes on. I still enjoy your writing Grisham, but I had to make clarity with this one. Nothing new happened in it for me.

John, 306 were 250 too much.I enjoy Grisham's novels, but \\"The Innocent Man\\" was a laborious read. The repetition was amazing. Yes, we get it. The \\"protagonist,\\" Ron Williamson was an alcoholic, and drug addict, mentally unstable, etc. If Grisham wrote this once, he wrote it 50 times. The book would have had much greater impact had the story been told succinctly.This is the second \\"true crime\\" non-fiction book I read in 12 months (Douglas Preston's \\"The Monster of Florence\\" the other) and both centered on bumbling investigations into several murders. Both weren't so good.What happened to Williamson and Dennis Fritz, the other \\"innocent man,\\" was appalling no doubt. The hell they went through to prove their innocence was excrutiating. But as Grisham repeated the fact over and over, I just got to the point where I didn't care."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is a tragic look at a tragic life and the tragedy of lazy law in the US.I cannot accept that the lawyers and police were as corrupt, inept, arrogant, and ignorant as John has portrayed them in this tale. If I am wrong and this was 100% accurate, then God help us all.John does not hold back. He makes it well known how little he respects those responsible for this miscarriage of justice. As that consistent 'hatred' is layered throughout the book, it begins to wear on the reader, it begins to seem petty. That was the reason for the 3 star rating, I wanted to go higher, but couldn't.In summary, the police department and county attorneys in a small Oklahoma town use a combination of corruption, arrogance, ineptitude, and ignorance to send four men (two separate cases) to prison and/or death row. Through the tireless efforts of those at the Innocence Project, two of those men were set free. While the other two are still languishing in prison. I firmly believe, if all the events are accurate, that those responsible for this tragedy need to be imprisoned themselves. There is no excuse for those men and women to have abused their positions of power to utterly destroy the lives of those men and their families.We are told we live in a society that is governed under the tenet of innocent until proven guilty, this true story tells us the frightening FACT that this is not true. While other law enforcement agencies may not be as transparent in their actions, they will occasionally focus on \\"their guy\\" and work backwards to the crime, ignoring evidence that doesn't match their assumptions.Side Note: If you are EVER asked to submit to a polygraph, decline. I know from experience that the results are immaterial. They will use the graph paper as a way to bully you into a confession, or trick you into some other kind of admission that they can use against you as well. Polygraphs are inadmissible in court almost everywhere, so why waste time and money. Also, try to have a lawyer present anytime you are being questioned. Had Fontenot had a lawyer next to him, he and Tommy Ward would still be free men. If Ron would have had counsel during the interrogation, neither he or Dennis Fritz would have ever seen prison.In all, a sobering and frightening tale of what can happen when justice doesn't matter to law enforcement as much as the PERCEPTION of justice."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book started out in the town of Ada where Ron Williamson was to be the next Mickey Mantle. He played all through his young career and became good enough to become a professional baseball player. He then left his small town to make his dreams come true and soon he signed with the Oakland A's. He returned to his hometown a couple of years later because he fell into the bad habits of alcohol and drug use. He couldn't maintain a job anymore and ended up moving back home with his mother.In 1982, a waitress named Debbie Carter was murdered. The police were clueless of who the killer was, but they suspected Ron Williamson and his friend Dennis Fritz. Then the two were charged with capital murder and were sentenced to the death penalty.In my opinion, the truth about the criminal justice system in America will shock you.John Grisham did a great job in writing his first non-fiction book.

Similar to West Texan \\"Rabid Reader's\\" comments I couldn't help but feel compassion for Ron, Dennis, their families, and the family of Debra Carter (the victim). It's sickening to think that a police force and prosecutor's office can botch and mishandle so many leads and so much evidence. And then for the verdict to be upheld through the appeals process for more than a decade, I just don't know which scenario is a worse reflection on our legal system.

The story begins with Ron returning to his hometown, after a failed attempt at playing for various minor league baseball teams, including the Oklahoma A s and the Lauderdale Yankees. A bout of depression led in by this failure resulted in a drinking problem.Very early in the morning of December 8, 1982, Debra Sue Carter, another resident of Ada, was raped and murdered in her bedroom. After five years of false starts and shoddy police work by the Ada PD, Ron was charged in 1987 (along with his 'drinking buddy', Dennis Fritz), tried and convicted of the rape and murder charges, and sentenced to the Death Row (Fritz, meanwhile, was given a life sentence). Since a death row conviction automatically sets in motion a series of appeals, a fresh look into the details of the trial, especially by the The Innocence Project, exposed several glaring lacunae in the prosecution's case, the credibility of the prosecution's witnesses, and a Brady's Convictionthat had been ignored till after the sentencing. A retrial was ordered by Frank H. Seay, a U.S. District Court judge; After suffering through a conviction and 11 years on the death row, Ron and Dennis were finally exonerated by DNA evidence, and released in 1999.Ron Williamson suffered deep and irreversible psychological scars during his incarceration and eventual wait at the death row. He was intermittently treated for manic depression, personality disorders, alcoholism and mild schizophrenia. It was later proven that he was indeed mentally ill (and hence unfit to be either tried or placed on the death row in the first place), but the state never treated him. The State of Oklahoma never admitted its error, and even threatened to re-arrest him.Another criminal from Ada, Glen Gore, was eventually convicted of the original crime.Williamson sued and won a large settlement in 2003 from the City of Ada. By 2004, he was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver, and died soon thereafter. Dennis Fritz, meanwhile, returned to Kansas City, where he lives with his daughter, Elizabeth to this day.The story also includes accounts (as sub plots) of the false conviction, trial and sentencing of Tommy Ward and Karl Fostenot in the abduction and purported murder of Denice Haraway, as well as the false conviction of Greg Wilhoit, in the rape and murder of his estranged wife, Kathy. All the men were, at one point of time, incarcerated under the Oklahoma death row."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I love Mr. Grisham's books. I get excited when I see that another will come out soon. When I heard about this one and had a pending road trip planned, I decided to get the audio book. I feel Mr. Grisham writes a compelling book and his books always make me think. I have to admit I was a tiny bit disappointed that this was non-fiction but got over it when I realized it was about a true story in Ada, Oklahoma. I was born and raised in this state and have never lived anywhere else. I take personal offense when those who have never lived here poke fun at my state. Obviously I have state pride. I do not recall hearing about this case when it happened so the book was \\"new\\" to me. But after finishing this book all I can say is what an embarrassment. To think these innocent men were imprisoned for all those years based on flimsy evidence and our justice system makes me cringe that it happened here. I'm very glad Mr. Grisham did state this does happen in every state. Small satisfaction hearing that though when I think of the years taken from those innocent men."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I picked up \\"The Innocent Man\\" not realizing that it is non-fiction. This is a poignant and important story that I appreciate his telling.I do have a general comment that applies to Grisham's most recent works. Does anyone remember James Michener's \\"Hawaii\\" and how wonderful and fresh that novel was at the early part of his career? I believe that Grisham has moved into the \\"I don't really have to try any more\\" in the same way that I feel Michener did.Grisham's move to non-fiction could be important and I want to say -\\"Please give the real your best efforts now as you did the imaginary when you began your career as a novelist.\\""},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I've read (or in this case listened to) every John Grisham book that has been published. For the most part, I've enjoyed them; some more than others. It seems, however, that lately he has had an axe to grind and my enjoyment of his writing has suffered as a result. Make no mistake; this is a polemic against the death penalty. Where necessary, facts have been distorted or even changed as necessary to achieve the underlying goal of converting the reader to a death penalty opponent.Everything is black and white in Grisham's world. There is no room for interpretation, compromise or misunderstanding. You are either as pure as the driven snow or as evil as Lucifer. If you are a corporation, you are greedy, conniving, criminal beyond redemption. There is no limit to how far you will stoop to poison, defraud or murder your innocent victim. And certainly, mouth breathing booger eaters from places like Oklahoma have no business serving on juries.If you are a criminal defendant, it goes without saying that you are innocent. You are faced with police and prosecutors who are not only inept and laughably incompetent, but invariably crooked and criminal. Such is the case in this novel. We are presented with a heinous murder and a clear suspect. The person she was last seen with, in an argument no less. Yet the prime suspect was only cursorily interviewed and was not even among the dozens from which fingerprints or DNA samples were taken. Are you serious? Two patsies are subsequently rounded up, convicted and sent to prison, one to death row.Now, if this was a novel, I'd give it two stars for implausibility and lack of any finesse, but lo and behold, it is based upon a true story. Given Grisham's obvious distaste for prosecutors and police, however, you have to ask to what extent it has been \\"enhanced\\" or \\"dramatized\\" to place the police and prosecutor in the worst possible light. Indeed, in trying to ascertain the accuracy of Mr. Grisham's account, I was directed to[...], a website maintained by the prosecuting attorney in this case, in which Grisham's misstatements and mischaracterizations are identified. Of particular interest is a Wall Street Journal review of the book that alleges that Grisham has, in fact, skewed the facts and circumstances of the case in an attempt to advance his own political agenda. Grisham never even interviewed the investigators or prosecutor in his research for the book. From Mr. Peterson's account:\\"We have all seen countless books and movies advertised as being \`based upon actual events'. Does that mean such works are non-fiction? Of course not. To declare in good faith that a work is non-fiction, much more is required than just a nod to real occurrences. A book advertised as \`non-fiction' implies a promise that the pages contain an accurate narrative of events built upon a good-faith examination and analysis of facts. A prospective reader of such a book is entitled to expect that the narrative will be, at the very least, reasonably objective and balanced. When objectivity and balance are unduly compromised in favor of dramatic license, the truth suffers, accordingly.The majority of folks who read The Innocent Man will conclude that our local law enforcement, the people of Ada, Oklahoma and I are a bunch of crazed, bigoted rednecks who will convict anyone of murder just because somebody has to pay. Heck, had I not known better, I would have formed the same opinions when I read the book.\\"Aside from the bias and sensationalism, the book drags, particularly in the telling of Ron Williamson's life story. The fact that Mr. Williamson spent 6-8 years in and out of mental health and alcohol rehabilitation centers as he spiraled further and further into psychosis is dragged out to consume fully 20% of the novel. Do we really need a blow by blow description of every single instance in which he got intoxicated or was arrested or did something wacky?The fact remains that two innocent defendants were convicted of murder and served 12 years in prison. The system failed. However, before accepting Mr. Grisham's characterization of the parties involved, I urge you to become better acquainted with the facts. Again quoting Peterson:\\"I cannot change the reality that two men were convicted of a crime they did not commit. To that extent, John Grisham's book is based upon actual events. His narrative, however, is riddled with so many inaccuracies, innuendos and falsehoods that calling it \\"non-fiction\\" is tantamount to false advertising.So, why did John Grisham go to such lengths to manufacture such a dysfunctional landscape for his book? The only answer I can come up with is money and to advance his anti-death penalty position. He did not write this book for his health, nor did he write it to help those two men, for they were exonerated long before he strolled into town. Simply put, he saw their misfortune as his opportunity.\\"In fact, the entire first chapter of the book clearly identified Glen Gore as the most likely suspect (and the actual killer) in the case. It does so in a manner that makes the police and investigators look like fools for not acknowledging this obvious fact. However, he fails to point out that all of the facts set out to implicate Gore, so clearly presented in Chapter 1, were not discovered until after the defendants in this case were ultimately exonerated. Unsatisfactory investigatory work perhaps, however not the Keystone Kops, or criminal negligence that one would assume reading Grisham's account. Again, from Peterson:\\"Throughout his novel, Grisham sets out facts that occurred and uses these facts to criticize my actions. However, he does not point out that these facts did not become known to the prosecution during the Fritz and Williamson investigation. For example, on page 6 he states that during a dance, Debbie angrily walked away from Gore. He also states that a month earlier, Debbie had told Mike Carpenter that she was afraid of Gore because of his temper. These facts only became known during the investigation of Gore after the DNA testing had freed Fritz and Williamson.The information from Ms. Graham about Glen Gore's feelings did not become known to law enforcement until after Fritz and Williamson were freed and Gore was charged. But Grisham writes about it in the time frame of the crime, 1982, as a reason the police should have suspected Gore. Grisham uses Gore's history of violent crimes against women as another reason the police should have suspected Gore, but these crimes did not occur until 1986 and 1987. In a pattern that repeats itself throughout the book, Grisham writes about an event without saying when it happened. He then uses it as a reason that the police or others should have known or suspected something, when in fact the event did not occur or become known until years, if not decades, later.\\"Now, it is entirely Grisham's right to publish anything he wants, to oppose the death penalty and to despise police, prosecutors, conservative judges and businessmen. Some would applaud his activism and his willingness to fight for what he believes. And it is my right to observe that the quality of his novels and my enjoyment of his work have declined with his conversion to sainthood. His writing lacks subtlety and his sneering and condescending tone do not make for compelling reading in my opinion. His characters are two dimensional, simplified caricatures of themselves; they have no depth or nuance. In this respect, Grisham is marginalizing himself in much the same way as political writers and commentators named Beck and Limbaugh.If I read non-fiction, or history, I want to know that I'm being presented an accurate, unbiased account. I want good research and to hear from ALL the parties and come to my own conclusion as to whether the mistakes that were made in this case were founded on evil and malicious intent. Of course, speaking to ALL the parties involved and presenting a balanced narration of events wouldn't be nearly as scintillating or spectacular, nor sell as many copies. As a result, we have a non-fiction set of events produced into a sensationalized novel; another bestseller."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have been an avid reader of Grisham's fiction for years and eagerly look forward to each of his new contributions to the legal genre.This true story did not engage me as much as Grisham's fictional tales. Exhaustively researched and told in exacting detail, the book is a revealing and somewhat horrifying tale of the ineptitude of the police department and legal system that sent an innocent man to prison and basically destroyed his life. However, I never could really develop much sympathy for the victim with all of his flaws and addiction issues.I did enjoy the legal detail relating to the trials, appeals, etc. which display Grisham's joint talent for comprehending and explaining legal processes.The book is bound with 8 pages of photos inserted into the center which should be labelled as \\"plot spoilers\\" so that you can skip the photos until you have finished reading the book. A glance through the photos reveals the outcome of the story."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This was a book truly out of character for Grisham yet left you not wanting it to end. It is a true story and, having heard it, realize why he chose to write about it. It really leaves you shaking your head about so many judicial systems .. especially those in small towns!"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I am absolutely captivated by John Grisham's latest book. I find it incredibly heart-wrenching to read about the hardship innocent men were facing when wrongly convicted of horrendous crimes. I also find it absolutely appalling the extent of judicial injustice that prevailed in the county and the deplorable conditions experienced on death row. To see pictures of these men in real life and to read about what their lives were like before they were harrassed by the police and arrested, makes it that much more salient. I have not yet finished the book, but I eagerly read as much as I can every day. John Grisham did a stellar job in his first venture into the world of nonfiction. Anything this man writes is a page-turner. I recommend this book to any fan of John Grisham or of true-crime stories."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I bought this book only because it was a John Grisham. It is frightening to believe this really happened and maybe still does.

He definitely has researched this story well and it is an incredibly sad and eye-opening look at our legal system and some of its failures. Although the content is heart-breaking, I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Great story!

I have to admit, this book was very interesting to me, I assume because it was a true story. I am not much of a non fiction fan, however, this book was given to me as a present. I am glad that I read it and was astonished at how one city could have so many wrongly convicted people. Without ruining the outcome of this book for anyone, I strongly suggest that if you love non fiction books, then, you will love this one."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"A wonderfully researched book that kept my interest throughout. This book has prompted me search even further and do some personal research on the topic of the Ada murders."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"John Grisham is a lawyer who has written 18 novels, many have been adapted to films. This true crime book lacks an index and a table of contents. A cast of characters would be helpful. Grisham learned about this case when he read an obituary (p.307). This true story was more rich and complex than any work of fiction. He began researching this case and soon wrote this book. Wrongful convictions occur every month in every state (p.308). Grisham lists the reasons but doesn't mention the actions of the press. DNA testing can't help in those cases where there is no biological evidence. The most important cure for those faults is to provide Forensic experts to the defense to counteract \\"junk science\\". Term limits would allow rotation in office. What can be done about prosecutorial perjury? Should there be tests to avoid incompetent defense lawyers (p.198)?On December 7, 1982 Debbie Carter left a local dance hall and saloon. The next morning they found her murdered body. The police gathered the evidence then began investigating the people who were at that honky-tonk. The last man seen talking to her was not a suspect (p.6). [Was he protected by the local police?] Eventually the police pinned the crime on two men who were convicted [against the evidence] and sentenced to life and the death penalty. In turn the appeals led to overturning this verdict and a new trial. Both had the charges dismissed. This book tells the story of this crime. The 'Author's Note' acknowledges the people who helped with this book. Was the real killer overlooked because he was involved in drug dealing with a high-level police officer (p.309)? Who watches the watchers?Barney Ward, Ron Williamson's defense lawyer, knew that the last man seen with Debbie Carter was not considered a suspect (p.180). The angry personality of the defendant may have biased the jury against him (p.181). Appeals are automatic in capital cases (p.204). [Because the system can't be trusted?] Chapter 13 discusses the legal rulings on the trial. Could evidence be compromised to protect the authorities and cover up an injustice (p.264)? April 15, 1999 brought the national media to Ada OK and the exonerations (Chapter 15). Their new trial ended when the charges were dismissed. What did the church elders do (p.274)? Later they sued for violation of their civil rights (p.291).James Michener's \\"Sports in America\\" noted that professional athletes are in better physical shape than most people but die younger than average. Could it be the drinking and drugs that do this? Or the extreme physical activity? You won't learn about this on TV. Ron developed incurable cirrhosis of the liver, probably from the very strong psychotropic drugs (p.302). If anyone wrote this story as a novel it would be unbelievable because it goes against our accustomed assumptions. But it is all true, even if this book has a few pages too many."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I bought this book at the airport because it was the latest from Grisham. I did not even read the blurb. I was about 50 pages into this book before it started to dawn on me that this book was non-fiction, and then I noticed the pictures. I wound up spending the next 14 hours of travel reading, and only put the book down when my eyes were too heavy too stay open anymore. The story reads like fiction, but is mostly true. The fact that this book was slanted heavily against the police and prosecution was self-evident, but at the same time, I understood his tendency toward that. I really feel that Grisham could have been a bit more objective, but then again, the police and prosecution were possessed of a frightening competence in convicting innocents, and also a frightening maliciousness and/or incompetence in not pursuing obvious investigation paths.I finally finished the book and was so intrigued that I started doing researching the cases for myself, and found that it was indeed true that Grisham had slanted the tale more heavily than he should have, but also felt more slanted against the police and prosecution myself. There is absolutely no remorse to be had from them, and so one is left with little sympathy for them.This book puts as much light on the plight of the mentally ill in the \\"justice\\" system as it does on the plight of the unjustly accused and convicted. It should also make one take the next step, and wonder how many people are innocent of lesser crimes, which while not as devastating as a murder conviction, still damage and destroy people's lives every day. I myself have been witness to friend's and family unjustly convicted of lesser crimes, and have witnessed the years and even decades that it takes them to recover.The \\"justice\\" system of this country is, for the most part, one of bringing lambs to slaughter, and if you are unjustly accused and can't afford AND find a very good lawyer, the chances are very good that you will be convicted and forced to pay for the mistakes of others. I say afford AND find, because finding a truly good lawyer, one who will fight the good fight, and not simply set up a plea-bargain, can be very hard, and while a good lawyer is almost always expensive, an expensive one is not often a great one.If you are expecting Grisham's usual, smooth story-telling, you may be disappointed with this book. It is also not a \\"feel-good\\" story. I was saddened, depressed, and then angered at this tale, and when I felt I could get no angrier, I felt fury. If you are expecting a clearly defined good and evil, you may also be disappointed, because the main protagonists of this story are not the kind of people most of us would want as friends.I feel that Ron Williamson, though clearly not culpable in the crime he was convicted for, could have easily wound up raping and/or murdering someone, had he not been locked up, but then again, who's to say that he would not have reached rock-bottom before then, and recovered from the downward spiral he was in? That is to not imply that he deserved what he got, but only to give some indication of the unsympathetic feelings that this man brings out.In summary, I feel this is a good book, only held back from greatness by the author's obvious lack of objectivity. That said, I don't feel I could have remained objective myself, had I spent 18 months researching and writing it."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is not a real book. It is a long detailed story about something that happened. Very boring. It is not a typical Grishem book. It is more like a long exhausting magazin artical.

It get realy confusing some times.I hardly made it to page 200, and from then on, just flip quickly through the pages, to get the general Idea of what will happen.Sham... Sham.. Sham. Glad to see that 17 other people gave only a single point to the book.I have the feeling that the book was Co-Writen, by others for Grishem.

I wanted to get involved in the plight of the defendants, but just gave up after 2 of the 5 discs. I didn't even know that it was a true story until I looked at the reviews on this page. Perhaps this book would appeal to some lawyer types who love legal proceedings and courtroom details, but not to this 60 year old grandmother."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I was given this book for Christmas along with a few others. As I began reading the book, I was taken with the story, as well as the direction it was heading. While I knew it was non-fiction, I made it a point not to try to find anything out about the case, until I finished the book.Halfway through the novel, there are glossy pages with pictures. Seeing as the placement of the pictures within the book would seem to indicate that the pictures were relevant to events currently taking place in the story (a court trial), I looked at the pictures. While viewing the pictures and reading the captions, it became extremely obvious (a little too late) that the pictures showed a timeline of the case, as well as the results of the case, and things in the story that were yet to be revealed, essentially ruining the entire story.As a result, there is little to no reason to continue reading the story. I'd advise anyone considering purchasing this book to keep in mind, NOT TO EVEN LOOK AT THE PICTURES.Thomas McCann"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This was a disappointing read because I have come to admire and enjoy the suspenseful work of John Grisham. However, there is no suspense or thrills as mentioned in the interview above. It was written with no creativity or passion for the injustice in the small town. The news accounts by journalists were written with more life than this story.True stories CAN be told with much more passion. Check out: EXIT TO FREEDOM by Calvin C.

I also knew going into it that this was a work of non-fiction, not of fiction, so I expected a very different book than I normally get from John Grisham.However, this book was a huge disappointment. This book read more like a textbook, or a series of random notes and observations, than a story. Even a true story, it could have been written as a story. Instead, Mr. Grisham takes the approach of just presenting \\"facts\\" and not performing character or story development at all.In addition, while the injustice described in the book is a *real* injustice, this book is highly biased in this direction. If Mr. Grisham would have presented a more balanced view of the story, his credibility would have been much higher and the injustice still would have been clear. Instead, Mr. Grisham takes a very one sided view, and does not spend any time exploring the issues around why this injustice happened.Very disappointing."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have read all of Grisham's books. Some better than others, but all were enjoyable. The Innocent Man is one of the very few books that I could not finish. Not only is it boringly repetitive, but halfway through the book there are several pictures of the subjects. The pictures reveal the outcome of an upcoming trial. That's when I quit, though I had struggled to get that far. Sorry, but I could not possibly recommend this book. Grisham has failed with this one. I doubt I will bother to buy another of his books."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"John Grisham does a great job creating fiction in the world of attorneys and their trade.This is the first non-fiction book I've read of his and I have to say, those that voted one-star basically got it right. It was a boring tale, a tale we've all read about these days; wrongly accused exonerated and returned to society, trying to fit in.My problem with this book is the main character: Ron Williams. Honestly this isn't a person you can conjure up much compassion for. He's depicted as a spoiled, self absorbed drunk and womanizer. A person who manipulated his parents and his sisters for his own benefit his entire life. A guy that couldn't seem to rise above spending any money he ever earned in bars and strip joints, wishing for what could've been, (major league baseball career). That he died of cyrosis(SP) of the liver is telling.I just wonder what motivated Mr. Grisham to spend the effort on this person or this case, as I said, cases like this are rampant in our judicial system. In the Author's Notes section of the book Grisham says he could've written 5000 pages on this case. Like many others I think he could have cut this book in half and it would have still been too long."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Well, first off a warning. If you are buying this thinking that it looks like another John Grisham novel, it isn't.This is a non-fiction account of rape and murder in which the wrong people were convicted. It is relatively interesting, but long, drawn-out and NOT a fiction novel.I was open-minded when I realized that I had gotten a non-fiction book instead of a fictional novel - thinking that Grisham might have written the non-fiction in his usual style. But it really isn't. I found it dry and difficult to stay interested in after a while and eventually gave up on it.In short, be aware of what you are getting. You may love this if you want to read a non-fiction book of an account of rape and murder in a small town several decades ago, but you will be disappointed if you are expecting another Firm or Rainmaker."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"The Innocent Man was one of the worst books I've ever read by John Grisham.

In Grisham's book The Innocent Man you know from the beginning based on the title, the tone of the story and even the book jacket left little doubt as to how the story was going to end. Grisham did not do a good job of connecting the reader with the characters of in the story. I personally will not jump to purchase the next novel.I'm hoping Grisham will use his imagination next.

Unfortunately, John Grisham has let his love of baseball, and those connected to it, block his view of how much this man does not need to be remembered.

His years as a trail lawyer have given him a wealth of information and knowledge about the law, the courts and human nature. Most of his books are titled \\"fiction\\" to protect, I guess, the innocent and the guilty.In 2006 he wrote one of his rare non-fiction books, \\"The Innocent Man\\". It is one of his best and yes, it is based on a true case.Two murders of young women in the small town in Oklahoma leave the police clueless. But a blend of extremely circumstantial \\"evidence\\", terrifying crime scene photographs, (don't believe everything you see -- or read!), questionable experts, jailed liars and faked confessions extracted in a cruel fashion help the police blame four young men for the murders: two per murder.The \\"innocent man\\" Grishman writes about was a high school baseball star with dreams of being another Mickey Mantle. But foolish youthful errors including liquor and women leave him a mentally confused young man easy prey for the grossness of injustice in a small town.Grishman captures all the drama of what ensues.The abuse of police power, early unjustified single-minded focus on particular suspects, the paucity of assistance for defendants,and on and on make for a gripping tale. And no one is better than Grisham to relate it. A master with a story to be told.One can not read this horrible tale without muttering \\"there but for the grace of God go I.\\""},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book, like all Grisham books, is a great thriller, but for me it really can't compete with the real thing. I have just read former NYT journalist, Raymond Bonner's, 'Anatomy of Injustice' about how an innocent man was sentenced to death nearly thirty years ago and remains in jail today because of the incompetence of court-appointed defense attorneys, a virulent prosecution, and more importantly, misplaced and contaminated evidenced. It's the true story of Edward Lee Elmore, a semiliterate, mentally retarded black man convicted of murder and a feisty attorney, Diane Holt (who makes Erin Brockovich look like Cinderella) who is still trying to get him justice and have him set free. Read this story and get angry like I did and read this story and weep at the injustice like I did.

In his usual \\"can't put it down style\\", but because of the continuous unjust decisions made by authorities and the poor mental health of the subject it becomes a little difficult to follow. It is scary in that it deals with police action that is not only unjust, but downright self-serving and completely untruthful.

Every American who believes the judicial system is working just fine should be required to read this book. It should be required reading for anyone who is going on jury duty as well. Just because the testimony is coming from an officer of the law does not necessarily mean it is the truth. Our society thinks that if a defendant has made it all the way to a court room, then he is guilty. We need to all read this book and learn to have an open mind when entering a court room. It might just save some lives."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book was extremely fascinating! Great characters that set up a terrific story. You get a background of the \\"Innocent Man\\" Ron Williamson and you follow his life as he found guilty of a crime that he didn't commit.Ron Williamson is the best baseball player in the county and one of the best in the state. He sets out to make it in the bigs only to have dreams of the Major Leagues and his life shattered and he is unable to stop it. As his life starts falling completely out of control it leads him to drugs and causes him to become pyschological unstable so when a murder in a small town that leaves a lot of questions and not a lot of answers he becomes a prime suspect. However, due to shotty investigative work and an unreliable eye witness he becomes more than just a suspect he becomes the defendant.John Grisham tells this story beautifully and while it is certainly a little different than his usual work, it still provides the same amount of entertainment.Grade: A"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I read this book while awaiting action on my own son's claim of innocence before the North Carolina Innocence Inquiry Commission. The circumstances of Williamson's arrest and conviction are hauntingly similiar to my son's case... Police target a suspect without any probably cause, and then seek to build a case against him. Overly zealous District Attorneys and incompetent defense attorneys are a virtual \\"death sentence\\" for anyone accused of murder. The system is not really seeking justice, but merely to convict someone and close an open case. We - the public - sit ignorantly and idly by and applaud our officials for being \\"tough on crime\\" without regard to what is really going on. Watching those crime shows on TV just adds to our complacency.Grisham has eloquently focused on the terrible faults within our criminal justice system. The actions by the DA in Ada Oklahoma border on criminal, yet he escapes with his job intact. (As of the writing of the book, the DA was still in office - obviously returned in election by his voters who are satisfied that lies and injustice trump the truth.)This is a must read for anyone who cares about truth and justice. Non-fiction is a departure for loyal Grisham fans, and the pacing and narrative are different and take some getting used to, but we should all know this story well, and remember it if we EVER sit on a jury.As a side note: My son's case was heard by a 3-judge panel in NC, and on February 17th he was declared innocent of the murder he was accused of having committed in 1991 and for which he served 17 years in prison. Other states are considering forming similar Innocence Commssions, and I encourage your support."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"How sad to think that this is a true story and can happen in this country!

The book was very depressing and really makes you wonder what could happen to you. He did a great job of letting the slackers know that they were just that and he also let the world know that jerks those attorneys and police in Ada were. The only thing that I would change, if I had been sitting up the book, is where the pictures are placed. I am reading this book wondering what is going to happen to Ron when all of a sudden here are some pictures that show him getting set free. I feel that the pictures should either have been spaced throughout the book in the proper places or at the end of the book after the ending.I am hoping that this turns into another movie and I can't wait for this next book.Thank you for writing about these families."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I loved everything about this book! EVERYTHING!! As I was reading it I couldn't help but get mad at the extremely stupid, lazy, and idiot policemen and what they did. To call thier work \\"research\\" is a freaking joke! To call that trial \\"justice\\" would be an INjustice to the word. I love Grisham as a storyteller and to have a story already \\"made\\" for him just made things more perfect!"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is a true story about a man convicted of murder and sentenced to death by lethal injection. It's a good example of the law in a small town trying to solve a case in a hurry because of pressure from the public. They wrongly accused two men of a horrible crime without any proof. Ronald Williams was a baseball fan who loved to play the game. His dream was to make it in the majors, but that was not going to happen. His baseball career had been cut short much to his surprise. I think the way John Grisham tells the story of this man's injustice is excellent. It left me on the edge of my seat and at times in tears."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Once I was a firm believer in capital punishment. Four people I have known were murder victims. An eye for an was my motto. But as I grew older I learned the many prosecutors and police were just as corrupt as the people they claimed to protect us from. Today I believe capital punishment is justified only when the accused has received a full and fair trial and had an adquate legal advocate - which is practically never.Where I live, dozens of convicted murderers have been set free because DNA has proven they could not have committed the crimes ther were accused of and tried for. The man in charge of many of these prosecutions is the current Mayor of Chicago. And Chicago, of course, has the distinction of seeing one of its judges convicted of accepting a bribe to fix a murder case.John Grisham writes of injustice in Ada, Oklahoma, a town of about 16,000 where law seems to have been perverted for decades with no one noticing.Debbie Carter was raped and brutally murdered in 1982. Grisham recounts the \\"investigation\\" of the murder by Ada police and agents of the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation (OSBI). The police quickly come to suspect - with no factual basis - Ron Williamson. Williamson has some very obvious mental stability problems. The police theorize - again without a factual basis - that Williamson could not have committed the crime alone so they had his friend, Dennis Fritz, to the list of suspects. All two of them. The police are fixated on these two men and ignore everyone else. The abuses by the Ada police and OSBI are nothing less than appalling - and to anyone who follows the legal news, distressingly familiar.Another woman from the town goes missing and the county district attorney pushes to please the public with what are essentially show trials, throwing defendants to the wolves to preserve his reputation.Williamson and Fritz go to trial and amazingly are convicted without a shred of physical evidence and the testimony of jailhouse snitches seeking a better deal and junk science experts. Fritz is sentenced to life and Williamson to death.Grisham puts you in the cell with Fritz and Williamson and to a lesser extent with other men unjustly convicted in Ada, Oklahoma.Williamson is within a week of being executed when a diligent federal court issues stay of execution. For the next year, the court of Judge James Seay reviews the Williamson trial and finally reverses. Concurrently, the new at the time science of DNA conclusively establishes that neither Williamson or Fritz could have been the killers.This is a depressing tale superbly told by Grisham. It echos current headlines as Michael Nifong, the politically motivated prosecutor in Durham, NC, watches his plans to imprison three young men for a rape that apparently never happened fall apart. But so many other prosecutors literally get away with state sanctioned murder.For anyone who thinks the justice system is fair, this is a must-read. For everyone who believes that every accused deserves their full measure of Constitutional protection, this is a must-read. Innocent people are swallowed up in the maws of incompetent or corrupt police and prosecutors every day. There are thousands of judges who allow innocent people to be railroaded into prison.There are other books detailing innocent men and women being wronged by the judicial system, but this one by Grisham is among the very best.Jerry"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Grisham has always had a chip for justice on his shoulder. In the world of shadowy lawyers and ethics, it's come as some reassurance to fiction readers that there are lawyers who care, who believe in the system, and want a world based on certain moral foundations. From \\"A Time to Kill\\" to \\"The Last Juror,\\" Grisham has explored these themes in entertaining ways.Along comes his first nonfiction book. Again, Grisham explores injustice through the efforts of men and women with muddied motivations. This is the real story of Ron Williamson, a man with deepening mental problems who became the target of a criminal investigation. The authorities seemed to go out of their way to make fit every piece of the evidence-puzzle. The incompetence is staggering. The story is enough to make any American see red.And yet, Grisham's narrative reads more like a 350 page Time magazine article than a work of creative nonfiction. It lacks the entertainment value that makes his novels stay in our minds. Some may appreciate the journalistic approach, but I would've preferred a few nods toward the school of Truman Capote. Instead, Grisham sticks to the facts and nothing but the facts, adding some personal feelings only in the last few chapters--usually with understated sarcasm. While the end result is satisfactory, even incendiary, the book losses some of its long-term impact through Grisham's plodding style.In the end, this is an important book, worth the emotional and time commitment. This glimpse into the justice system and its failures--particularly in the heartbreaking case of a few young men in Oklahoma--is one that should be considered for years to come by all people...criminals, lawyers, judges, cops, and those of us who hope that innocence will be enough to avoid such travesties."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"There have been many books, and movies, about bad cops and twisted prosecutors. What Grisham has done is document a choatic mess that was created by a pig-headed/incompetent prosecutor and lazy/incompetent cops who were unwilling to do the work that they were hired to do. The scary part is that this happens too often. The real crime is that so few have the connections, the savvy, to figure out where to reach out for help. This statement does not refer to criminals who milk our system, who should be behind bars--it refers to the person who has a run-in with the law and is really clueless in how to get out of the mess they've found themselves in--like the \\"deer in the headlights\\" syndrome. Were these men positive contributors to society? Not really. Were they destructive and a threat to the public? No. Yet what they went through, the years behind bars, the lack of medical care and the obvious injustice should spook anyone. To insult to injurt, the prosecutor and cops are still employed...what are people thinking ... that it won't happen again?Judith Briles authorThe Confidence Factor andMoney Smarts"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"The Innocent Man demonstrates the extensive research Grisham did in preparing his book about small-town justice gone awry. It also demonstrates Grisham's heavily biased point of view on capital punishment. There is no question that a horrible injustice was done to the main character and the devastating impact it had on his life; however, Grisham's telling of this story is too slow-moving and oftentimes repetitive in making a point (especially when it supports his viewpoint on capital punishment). For me, it read more like a well-researched report on the subject than a good true crime book; e.g., strong character development, some excitement and suspense regarding the investigation of the crime and subsequent trial, etc. As a result, I found The Innocent Man to be somewhat tedious and boring. Perhaps, it would have been more interesting if the main character was a person I really cared about. Prior to his being arrested and convicted of a crime he didn't commit, Ron Williamson at an early age was on the road to letting life defeat him. He could never grow up and get on with his life after being disappointed that he wasn't going to fulfill his dream of being a major league baseball player; and thus lived a life consumed with alcohol, drugs and carousing. Basically, he was a \\"sorry figure.\\" Obviously, however, Williamson didn't deserve the tragedy that he ultimately had to deal with. It is the subject matter of the book that is important; although, as mentioned, The Innocent Man is too slow-moving and repetitive in telling the story."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is a very intriguing story. It is a tragedy, and reveals the most horrifying aspects of the American justice system. This is NOT like Grisham's fiction novels, and although it is good, it is much longer and more tedious than it need be. I think I enjoyed it as much as I did because I am a law student and therefore followed the procedural aspects very closely. If you are looking for a light, classic Grisham read, this is not the book for you. However, if you want a deep look at the American legal system, its flaws and its tragic impact on one man's life, it is a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"No matter what style John Grisham chooses for his books, they are all great.This has all the things you want in a story.

It just keeps flowing one page to the next and you realized you are lost in the story and are reluctant to wait til the next day to see 'what happened next'I have passed this book along to two others to read and they also loved it. Some 'true crime' type books are the most enthralling.I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a story of a true crime, injustice and the good guys v the bad guys.

I can't say I enjoyed this book. I found it very disturbing. There were times when I wanted to just set it aside because I knew how everything turned out. But I felt I needed to keep going to experience the terrible injustice it describes. I am a former Police officer from a big city police force and can say I have never seen anything like the incompetence of this small town police force. You should read the ending of the book 1st. It doesn't spoil anything but enhances what you are reading. There are parts that are easy to skim through so it doesn't take long to read. This is an important book and will force anyone to think through their position on capital punishment.

In The Innocent Man, Grisham offers readers an indepth view into the legal wranglings of a murder trial; and how, with the manipulations of prosecutors, police and other officials, an innocent man can be wrongly convicted....and sentenced to death.Other reviewers have comment on how this book was opinionated toward the prosecution. This is true, but within the first few pages readers can definitely understand why. I don't think Grisham is slanted against ALL prosecutors, just Bill Peterson and his team in Ada, Oklahoma; especially since the convictions of Ron Williamson and Dennis Fritz (the main story of this book) were not his first false convictions based on manipulated evidence and testimony.If you're a fan of Grisham or just a true crime fan, this is a must read! For true crime readers, it will be a refreshing piece of work to read about someone who actually DIDN'T commit the crime, yet heartbreaking to read the hardships of those falsely accused."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I normally don't read Grisham because I find his books often too wordy.

John Grisham does a masterful job of reporting the story of corruption in the judicial process in Ada, Oklahoma. I had read \\"The Dreams of Ada\\" when it first was published, and was interested to read this book because it also takes place in Ada. I can tell you I wouldn't go to Ada for any reason, for fear of catching some police officers eye on a bad day. Both books should be read by every person in this country. I am glad that The Dreams of Ada has been reissued because of the publication of The Innocent Man. Please, my fellow citizens, read both of these books."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"When set against previous Grisham works, The Innocent Man lends more a feeling of narration of the facts than to a crafted work, as it should.

It was a book that I was not in a hurry to get to the end! Did not know it was a true story!! Once I figured that out, I really wanted to read it. Going through what an innocent man on death row had to endure was heart wrenching and quite an education. I am glad I didn't give up on it in the beginning.

But when I was about halfway through something began gnawing at me- everything seemed too one sided. As a retired trial lawyer and trial judge it was hard for me to imagine a DA as either naive or evil as Mr. Grisham pictured the DA, Bill Peterson. So I went web surfing and found this site: [...].I read the site thoroughly and when I finished the book I read it again. Mr. Peterson does a creditable job in defending his office and even partially defends the Ada police and the OSBI. So at the end I had more questions than answers.Grisham's book is worth reading about how justice can run amok. But to be fair if you read it, you should also read Peterson's site and then make up your own mind."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I first dismissed this book because Grisham's fiction has never appealed to me. As an attorney, I've found that my daily working life interferes with the exciting premises I am asked to accept from legal fiction. As a result, I almost made the mistake of skipping _The Innocent Man_. Grisham's first nonfiction work about families in Oklahoma brought together by unfortunate circumstances will shake your faith in the justice system. I've read elsewhere that the Supreme Court at one point almost lost its collegiality because of a split in justices who refused to affirm any death penalty conviction as a matter of principle. This book provides some insight into what the Supreme Court during Thurgood Marshall's time must have been seeing to create that kind of schism.Grisham begins by with a plot that could have come straight out of _Moneyball_--i.e., a talented kid from the Midwest with a powerful arm gets discovered by the A's and negotiates with prudent management for a decent signing bonus. When the bonus is sufficiently raised, Ron Williamson, brimming with confidence, chooses money/salary over a college education and a scholarship, but when he is injured, his entire life is then spent fighting for a spot in the minors. When the various stints in the minors fail, Ron goes into a destructive spiral and overzealous law enforcement connects him and his friend to a gruesome murder.I've heard lawyers say that the criminal justice system favors the prosecution because everyone assumes the D.A. only brings cases where it is sure to convict. As a result, it is terribly easy to buy into the paradigm of Eliot Ness cops arresting violent miscreants, and more difficult to imagine a perfect storm of egotistical D.A.s and the forensic specialists who could be biased because they are on the same county or public payroll and work closely with law enforcement.What was especially stunning to me was how much the prosecution used inherently unreliable hair samples. Even as an attorney, I did not know how unreliable some so-called scientific data was, and this book was a good education for me and exposed bias I did not even know I had. Overall, an excellent book, and one that is sure to make you question the criminal justice system without the typical pointing to race as a factor."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Having stopped reading Grisham many years ago (found his work too formulaic and similar), An Innocent Man was recommended to me by a friend from college (we both graduated from Oklahoma State). I found this to be an extraordinary book, both in it's story and the writing. I had to be coaxed to read it and yet finished it within two days. The story is heartbreaking. It's astounding that in this day and age, small towns are still allowed to make and break their own rules with such ease. The fact that four men were convicted on absolutely no evidence whatsoever is unfathomable. To those who found it boring or a slow read, I can only surmise that they were seeking the fast-paced fiction normally produced by Grisham and not prepared for something that actually shook so many lives to the core. My hope is that Bill Peterson finally accepts responsibility for his actions and rues it for the rest of his days. I highly recommend this book for anyone who has an interest in crimes, mysteries, thrillers, or justice. John Grisham has made proud the people of Oklahoma who do not and will not tolerate this type of injustice."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"After reading many of Grisham's other novels, this was by far the most gripping. Perhaps because it's a true story and that all of us have a fear of \\"being in the wrong place at the wrong time,\\" or perhaps it's his writing style that keeps the reader captivated... it's most likely a combination of the two.In The Innocent Man, Grisham chronicles the trials and tribulations of Ron Williamson, who started out his life with poise and promise. After a failed go at a career in baseball, he quickly falls into debaucherous ways and ends up in prison for a crime he didn't commit. Right there... enough said. Any one of us could have been Ron Williamson. We've all had aspirations, we've all had goals, and we've all had failures of some sort...As Grisham's seminal depiction of a true story, he certainly made it his best. He runs you through the full gamut of emotion, from happiness, to frustration, to anger and back to happiness. It's a must read suspenseful-thriller.Have fun,David TobiasRedondo Beach, CA"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is a fabulous book and another page turner by Grisham.

Never did I expect to be hit so hard in the stomach as I was toward the end of \\"The Innocent Man\\". And I certainly did not expect my views to be challenged and then changed. For the past 4 days as I have read each word, I found myself caring about Ron, Dennis, their families, and looking at the included photos dozens of times. The characters became real because they are real. My lack of compassion for those convicted, (they wouldn't have been convicted unless they were guilty, right?) has brought me to tears as I have examined my heart as well as my head.

I thought this book was fascinating, well researched and well written. It held my attention and I couldn't wait to read the next chapter to see what was going to happen next. Mr. Grisham was able to use his background in law to help make sense of the endless legal wrangling and see through the BS the police department used to convict Ron Williamson to make an well crafted story and good read. Yes, it's clearly one sided, but after reading it you will no doubt know why and Grisham has never concealed his comtempt for those in the criminal justice system who are corrupt anyway.Highly recommended, particularly if you enjoy true crime."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"The book, as other reviewers have stated, needs to be read by everyone, especially those who cling to the necessity of having the death penalty. And for many of us, it might be a case of \\"there but for God go I\\". This is a captivating story, on both a personal and more importantly legal level. And yes, it stands as evidence that all those \\"cliches\\" about who gets convicted and who gets off in our legal system aren't figments of someone's imagination. And one is left to ask again: How many deaths of innocent people justify using the death penalty? I'd also add that it probably won't please those people who are so quick to compain that people condemned to death spend so much time on death row, or for whom the Innocence Project is a waste of time and money. Sure, at times it might seem to be too fact-laden (if such is a fault), and the style drags at times. But so what? I've read about half the reviews of the book on this site and am amazed and dismayed by people who apparently are disappointed that this doesn't \\"read\\" like a work of fiction, be it Grisham's books or novels in the Dave Robichaux series (as one such reviewer states). And to mitigate the seriousness of the subject matter by claiming \\"we still have the world's best legal system\\". True or not, as long as incidents such as the one presented in this book exist - and receive so little public outcry, our legal system is horribly deficient. On a more personal note, I spent the first 17 years of my life in Oklahoma; while it's sister state to the south has a seemingly insatiable appetite for executions, Oklahoma is not far behind (and ahead on a per capita basis). And whereas Texas has some redeeming qualities to it, there are none to be found in Oklahoma. Just look at who they send to the US Senate and that says it all.

Whom would you turn to if you were convicted of a crime based on circumstantial evidence and shoddy legal tactics? Whoever believes we are all innocent until proven guilty hasn't truly been put to the test.John Grisham's newest legal masterpiece hits home--and hits hard. Temporarily forgoing his status as a legal thriller novelist, he delves into a non-fiction tale that could be almost anyone's story. Ron Williamson had to rely on officials of a system that was corrupt and desperate, and he paid a terrible price. Twenty years of his life. Haunting, chilling and foreboding, The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town gives us a glimpse into the life of a man hounded by police, found guilty because of fraudulent testimony from convicts and sentenced to death row.Williamson isn't the only man wrongly convicted and sent to prison. Over the years, many cases have been appealed, and with new DNA testing and other evidentiary sciences in place, both Canada and the US have released convicted felons with little more than a \\"we're sorry\\". Grisham, a former criminal defense attorney, reveals a world of political power and policing agencies that show very little remorse for getting it wrong. It's hard to imagine that even now there are people waiting on death row or in prisons who are innocent of the crimes of which they have been convicted.

This is not a brilliantly written legal thriller. It is an excellent piece of investigative journalism, and it is very clear that John Grisham has invested a huge amount of effort into his investigations.He tells the true story of several wrongful convictions, concentrating mainly on the central character, Ron Williamson, who spends a considerable proportion of his life on death row and in other detention centres.Grisham exposes the flaws in the American justice system, which is under constant pressure from the conviction-hungry public who will not allow the truth to stand in the way of their passionate pursuit of somebody to blame for any heinous crime, who, whether innocent or guilty, will receive the heavy punishment that such a terrible criminal would deserve. This leads to deliberate, and institutional, incompetence amongst the investigators and the lawyers.For me, the book is far too long. I think that Grisham could have condensed the results of his rigorous investigations into about half the pages that he has filled. It is clear, from early on, what the outcomes would be.

Lies, fundamental errors, fake science, and failure to provide basic mental-health care ruled, until a reviewer in the federal court system took the time to realize that a serious miscarriage had taken place. Even then it took another four years for the two to be freed thanks to DNA evidence (the prosecutor still fought their release), and still another four years for the real killer to be convicted - even though his strong likelihood of guilt was obvious at the beginning (last person seen with the victim, and in a conflict mode) and absolute DNA proof available when those falsely imprisoned were released.Two lives were ruined - a travesty that likely would have been avoided if the judge and prosecutor involved had not been so anxious to save $7,200 on expert rebuttal testimony. Grisham also briefly referenced two others ensnared in a similar web that eventually won freedom through DNA, as well as two others that probably would have were the evidence available. Nonetheless, Oklahoma is back to \\"business as usual\\" - executing more prisoners/capita than any other state, including Texas.The good news is that DNA testing has since become much more prevalent, and the justice system also has people like the federal court system reviewer who originally flagged the case, Barry Sheck, and others. Also, kudos to the relatives of the two falsely accused - they provided invaluable psychological support, and to Grisham for revealing the sometimes startling weakness of our criminal justice system."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"There are plenty of guilty parties in John Grisham's exploration of two murders in Ada, Oklahoma; corrupt police, inept and egotistical prosecutors, vindictive investigators, incompetent judges and lazy attorneys.The research is impeccable and Grisham's biting commentary is poignant. This is a vital book on how the public trust in institutions pledged to uphold justice is ripped to shreds and the fate of the many victims left under the tracks of this runaway train."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I picked up this book at the library not realizing it was non-fiction. I enjoy Grisham's fiction, so I checked out the book. I couldn't put it down. My husband, who seldom reads non-fiction, couldn't put it down. I had Amazon send a copy to my mother, who is from that area of the south and who reads totally different books than I do and she couldn't put it down.This is a story that needed to be told and I think Grisham did an excellent job in telling it. I highly recommend the book to fiction and non-fiction readers alike."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I cannot judge Grisham's writing since the story is so appalling that to judge the writing of it is missing the point. I give it 5 stars because I found it to be well-told but more importantly because Grisham had the guts to tell it how it was. Others here have stated that the story is at times hard to follow. Nonsense. It was a complex story told with great clarity. If a reader had problems with the compexity, that is not the author's fault. I also saw here in reviews that at least one reader was disappointed in Grisham's writing since they \\"expected more\\" because of his fiction writing. The truth is not always lovely and it should not be presented in such a way as to take away from that truth. I thought Grisham kept back from trying to grandstand his own writing ability by being straightforward in his style. The only thing I did not like about the writing part was the occasional use of exclamation points. I don't like exclamation points when they are not used within dialogue! That is just my pet peeve.The point of this story was to expose the rampant nonsense that goes on within our legal system. If you, as a reader, want more from this book, you miss the point of it and you are wasting your time reading the story. It is a sad and depressing commentary on how prominent people can screw over those who are poor and have mental problems.Yes, Ron Williamson was indeed a problem person and he had an enormous amount of personal issues. That does not excuse our legal system one iota. I don't care how hellish your behavior is, you deserve a fair trial by people in power. Period. Without this, you might as well slit your throat now and call it a day. The reading of this book made me angry because the people that put a man on death row for over a decade are still in power; quite specifically, the district attorney that prosecuted the case for years. That is the saddest part of this entire story mainly because it leaves little hope for justice in the true sense of the word."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is Grisham's attempt at writing his own \\"In Cold Blood,\\" and in many ways it is a better book. Both deal with the horrors of the death penalty. Capote's criminals were guilty, Grisham's isn't The photos reveal a handsome young man turned, by age 51, into a sickly, gaunt, white-haired \\"old man.\\" What the state of Oklahoma put him and a friend through is so hideous that it is hard to believe that Oklahoma has somehow worked its way into the civilized world. Texas executes the most death row inmates. but Oklahoma has the highest per capita rate of executions. Interestingly, the two states geographically adjoin. Must be something in the water! The town is Ada, a no-fun-here jerkwater place on the prairie. Most young people's goals are to get a high school education and then get out of it and the state that contains it. Ron Williamson's tool to get out was superior athletic ability. He becomes a member of the Yankees' farm team in Fort Lauderdale. Like 97 out of 100 minor leaguers, he never plays a major league game. His dreams dashed he returns to Ada, takes to booze and drugs, gets himself into minor scrapes with the law, and finally is accused of killing a young woman he barely knows. He's easy-pickings for District Attorney Peterson who without any evidence manages to get him convicted and sentenced to death row. Grisham implies that there are too many unsolved murder cases on his desk, so he's hell bent on \\"solving\\" at least one. Also, the town wants Ron off the streets. The torture in the prison system, mainly by the guards, is so horrendous that Ron just wants to die. No such \\"luck.\\" He is finally found not guilty in another trial more than ten years later. Freed, he vacillates between peaceful existence and getting even. The town is afraid of him while the real murderer continues to roam the streets. In a touching scene just before his death, ABC brings him to New York to tell his story on air, then he is taken to Yankee Stadium, the place where he was supposed to wind up playing in the shadows of Mantle, DiMaggio, and Maris. He knows the Yankee statistics better than his guide does. Back in Ada, he dies of liver disease at age 51, a truly wasted life. I agree with an earlier reviewer who said that anyone who supports the death penalty and can still support it after reading this book should be instituionalized. The United States would not be allowed to join the European Union because of its support of the death penalty. Governor George W. Bush executed on average one inmate a week during his tenure. Bush is a \\"devout\\" Christian, and the governor of Oklahoma during this period was a \\"devout\\" Catholic. Seems like they missed something along the way."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"The Innocent Man, by novelist John Grisham, is an important and dispiriting work. At one level, it shows how the American system of justice can, on occasion, malfunction. At another level, it suggests that we ought to have some skepticism about our law enforcement system, since there are certain incentives to actors in the judicial system to twist facts to produce a favored outcome.This is a book that focuses on a trumped up murder charge being lodged against Ron Williamson and Dennis Fritz. The former was given the death sentence. The infuriating aspect of this work is that the police botched the investigation, did not pursue a more obvious suspect, and misused their investigative powers to bring the two to trial. The prosecutor is also portrayed as an opportunist, who had an extremely weak case and, nonetheless, pushed forward. Furthermore, he violated established Supreme Court guidelines on evidence in the process.This is also the story of dreams destroyed. Williamson was looked at as, potentially, the \\"next Mickey Mantle,\\" based on his high school baseball exploits in Oklahoma. After a wonderful high school baseball career, he was signed to a contract by the Oakland Athletics. However, he found it difficult to hit professional pitchers, he started drinking and partying to the point where whatever natural skills that he had were not up to the challenges of professional baseball, and the early signs of his mental illness began to manifest themselves. He tried a comeback in the New York Yankees farm system, his dream team for which Mickey Mantle had played. But he could not hit professional pitchers--even in the minor leagues--and he had a sore arm that prevented success as a pitcher. At the same time, his mental problems began to emerge further and make success problematic under the best of circumstances.He drifted back to Oklahoma. A violent murder was committed in his hometown of Ada, and he became a suspect (along with Dennis Fritz). Desperate for an arrest, after some years of failure in apprehending the perpetrator (and an embarrassing fiasco in prosecuting the wrong persons in another case), the local police and prosecutor trumped up a case against these two. Later, the city paid a heavy price as a result of a successful law suit on behalf of the two falsely convicted victims.Eventually, the system exonerated the two convicted men. However, Williamson ended up, as a result of his mental illness, declining and dying. This is a tale of tragedy, of police misuse of authority, of a prosecutor who ignored professional norms, of defense attorneys who were uneven. And an innocent person ended up on death row. This does not represent America's finest hour in law enforcement; it reminds us that there are times when innocent people can be condemned to death. It raises questions that need to be discussed widely in this society. It demonstrates why we should all wish law enforcement and judicial actors to be forced to \\"follow the rules\\" in criminal cases, to prevent this situation from occurring."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"WARNING: This review gives away the ending. If this is a problem for you, read elsewhere.This book of non-fiction describes the sad case of Ron Williamson, a small-town misfit who ends up on Oklahoma death row for a rape and murder. In the end, he is exonerated and released, and he dies a broken man at around fifty years of age. Other reviews below describe the story eloquently and in more detail, so I'll leave it at that.This book was riveting and kept me up past my bed-time. I recommend it highly. The decline of the main character, before and after his incarceration, was beyond tragic - this despite the fact that he was not a sympathetic person.This story raised several issues worth pondering:1. Williamson was exonerated beyond a shadow of a doubt by DNA evidence, which also conclusively showed that the real killer was a person the police never considered or even interviewed, even though he was the last person seen with the victim when she was alive. Nonetheless, the prosecutor never gave up pursuing Williamson and continued to threaten to re-open the prosecution after his exoneration. And a large fraction of the community never forgave Williamson, either, or felt safe after his release. These facts stun me. I can almost understand the response of the community: you grow to hate and fear a person who has committed a violent crime against a friend or loved one. Letting go of that when he is proven innocent must be very hard. But it's the only moral thing to do. The victim's mother was able to do this. The behavior of the prosecutor, though, is harder to accept and forgive, given his power. The police, prosecutor, judge, and defense attorney committed just about every error and injustice imaginable in order to get a conviction. In order to win a case like this - one with a hideous crime and very poor evidence - you have to be aggressive and committed. The focus and intensity must lead to a kind of professional blindness - one to which dishonest, incompetent, and insecure people are perhaps more susceptible than others! I was reminded of the concept of \\"diagnosis momentum\\" sometimes experienced by medical doctors, as described in the recent book How Doctors Think by Jerome Groopman. When a thin woman with a long and well-documented history of nausea and diarrhea brings in a pile of paperwork describing her as only neurotic, how many doctors can break free of the diagnosis and consider other possibilities - like a wheat allergy? In both cases, going with the professional momentum solves the professional's problem: he can sign off on the paperwork and get home for dinner. The doctor gets paid; the prosecutor gets praised in the newspaper.2. This book constitutes a strong argument against the death penalty. The problem of executing innocent people is obvious. But this story reveals a second and more subtle problem: the death penalty de-humanizes the executioners, and, by extension, all of us. Ron Williamson's jailers deliberately withheld psychiatric treatment and medication, exacerbating his severe mental problems. They took endless delight in taunting him over the intercom in his cell, pretending to be the victim asking why he killed her. This would trigger tantrums in which he pathetically shouted his innocence for hours at a time. By the time he was released, he had lost 90 pounds, his teeth had fallen out, his hair had turned white, and he was a helpless, ruined wreck of a man, shuffling slowly and hoarsely whispering his innocence. My intuition is that the people who enjoyed doing this to him had lost the capacity for insight or regret by the time he was proven innocent and released. This is what can happen when you have the legal power to kill someone.3. We rely on the police to protect us from crime and to save us in emergencies. But if a detective starts to pressure you to confess to a crime, you have to view him as an adversary and repeat the magic words: \\"I will only answer questions in the presence of my lawyer.\\""},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have read only one of Mr. Grisham's novels, but the nature of this horrible story compelled me to purchase it and devour it in on a recent flight from LA to NYC. This well-told tale of a frightening miscarriage of \\"justice,\\" occuring not in some third-world country under a despotic military ruler, but in late 20th-century Oklahoma, will leave you shaken to the core of your being. If you are at all familiar with the criminal justice system, and not, as some of the reviewers of this book seem to be, simply by watching \\"CSI\\" or other such drivel on television, you will appreciate the skill with which Mr. Grisham researched his material and presented it clearly, concisely, and with a minimum of finger-pointing. That is rare indeed today in the world of non-fiction writers. I also do not understand why some of the reviewers of this book have called is \\"depressing,\\" or \\"dark\\" - it's not a novel, it's real life, folks! And yes, it is about some of the most miserable of human beings, our death row inmates - and there are no clean-cut Hollywood stars, or pretty locations, or sexy starlets to pepper its pages. This is a dirty, blood and guts story out of the heartland of America and should strike fear into the heart of anyone who reads it, as we are all potential victims of a system than can sometimes go terribly awry. As an attorney, I applaud Mr. Grisham for making Ron Williamson and Dennis Fritz's story more widely available to the public. It shames the jurisdiction of Ada, Oklahoma and the corrupt police force, prosecutors, and judges who sentenced these innocent men to over ten years behind bars on the flimsiest of evidence while neglecting to pursue the most likely suspect in the crime. Justice? Absolutely not, for even after their charges were dismissed, the only apology they received from the great state of Oklahoma was in the nature of a monetary settlement, and then only after a civil rights suit had been filed on their behalf. This story should be compulsory reading for every law student and attorney in this country - a reminder how much power can corrupt and sway \\"reasonable men\\" to commit atrocitices in the name of justice. I rarely give any book a five-star rating, but \\"The Innocent Man\\" clearly deserves to be read."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I am a fan of Grisham's fiction, and have always appreciated his ability to explore the corrupting influence of power, the law, and money, while still being entertaining. He does this as well in the non-fiction The Innocent Man which is about how the justice system in small-town Ada, Oklahoma, sent a unpopular local drunk Ron Williamson, to death row after a quick and perfunctory trial. In the trial the weak evidence presented by a police force and zealous prosecutor anxious to solve a brutal and notorious murder on behalf of a scared and anxious public led to a wrongful conviction, and quick sentence to Oklahoma's Death Row in 1988. Seemingly, there are no heroes in Ada. Prosecutors were willing to ignore exculpatory evidence, a public defender system tolerated incompetence, and a jail and prison system created and then tormented the mentally illOn the surface, the bad guys in The Innocent Man are the individuals working for the police, court system, small towns, and even the local newspapers. However, look more deeply, and you will see that Grisham is really pointing his finger at a public which more than justice and protection from murderers, wants vengeance, at any cost. Ada, just like thousands of jurisdictions in the United States, gets exactly what the justice system they want when jurors willingly ignore evidence, voters elect politicians ready to demonize town drunks, and townspeople buy newspapers for their capacity to inflame rather than inform.In short, the problem is not just the bad guys, town drunks, sloppy prosecutors, lazy defense lawyers, corrupt police officers, or scurrilous newspapers editors. The problem is us. Anyone having an interest in the American justice system should read this book. Is The Innocent Man always balanced in its presentation of Williamson's case? No, it is not. But so what? The case made by Grisham is against us in our role as citizens, and our responsibility as humans to both protect the least among us, and especially avoid persecuting them. In the public Grisham makes a great case. I for one in my middle class comfort plead guilty to too often hoping for the best of our criminal justice system, and assuming the worst of those who are arrested. The wrongful convictions of people like Ron Williamson tell us that we should be more thoughtful and careful as citizens, voters, and jurors. Grisham's point is that for the criminal justice system to be effective, we cannot demand the emotional comfort of prosecution, at the expense of justice."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Having never read a John Grisham novel, I didn't read this as a fan. I read this as a person with a mental illness. Despite what people make think of the main character, this book drives home extremely important points.First of all, our justice system is terribly flawed. Secondly, innocent people are being sentenced to DEATH. Thirdly, the mentally ill MUST have some sort of special assistance once they're put in the criminal system.Mental illness is one of the few disabilites that has such an ugly stigma attached to it. Interestingly, people usually don't attach such judgemental attitudes towards those suffering from Alzheimer's Disease or Epilepsy. Both, by the way, are also mental illnesses.Most mentally ill inmates are poor & cannot afford a competent attorney. As a result, they're shoved into the prison system like cattle. In prison they have problems: outbursts, violence, delusions, etc. As a result, they're kept in prison longer for these infractions.Once released, they have great difficulty complying with the terms of release, ie: staying sober (many self medicate), staying in contact with parole officer (many become homeless or psychotic).Our prison system is NOT made for those with serious mental illness.John Grisham wrote a much needed book. It's about time writers such as he take the time to write about the injustices in our society. Someone must speak out for those who cannot do so for themselves. This book does just that."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I love anything by John Grisham!!

Thank you John Grisham for being the conscience America needs!"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"It is John Grisham's first nonfiction book and it is a page-turner. I think that all prosecuting attorneys and their staff should read this just to keep themselves in perspective as to what their jobs really are. Too many people seem to think that if the District Attorney decides to prosecute, it does not automatically mean that the defendant is automatically guilty. \\"Proof beyond a reasonable doubt\\" does not mean that if the prosecuting attorney comes up with a \\"reasonable\\" story that is all that is needed to convict. Evidence should be collected, completely documented and defended as being relevant and supporting of that \\"reasonable\\" story before the reasonable doubt can be established. Quite often, an unprepared attorney tries to hide behind the term \\"common sense\\" and attempts to substitute that for \\"beyond reasonable doubt\\".A really good book and in addition to attorneys, taxpayers should also read this an learn how their tax dollars are being wasted by lazy efforts by both defense and prosecuting staff in trials. I will complete this comment by adding a quote from the book.\\"Wrongful convictions occur every month in every state in this country, and the reasons are all varied and all the same - bad police work, junk science, faulty eyewitness identification, bad defense lawyers, lazy prosecutors, arrogant prosecutors.\\""},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"While a huge John Grisham fan, I was a bit disappointed in Grisham's personal slant to this story. While the wrongly convicted Williamson and Fritz evoke a great empathy and disgust with the judicial process in this instance, and while this is nothing short of a travesty of justice, Grisham's personal views on the death penalty came forth in what was at times editorializing, his comments sarcastic and somewhat sneering of prosecutors, law enforcement, and the judicial process as a whole, and although well-deserved in this instance, I felt he was giving an opinion more than relating the facts alone, not something I expected in a nonfiction piece. I would have preferred a presentation of the admittedly horrendous facts and come to my own conclusions on the judicial system, the death penalty, and the wrongfully convicted."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"John Grisham did a good job of telling the story of a man wrongly convicted of a rape & murder along with his friend. I actually had more sympathy for his friend, Dennis Fritz because Ron had so many behavior problems due to his never-under-control mental illnesses, alchohol and drugs. I longed to hear more about Dennis. Ron was also so self-centered and at times amoral that I almost grew tired of him. Dennis, as well as 2 other men in the book who were also wrongly convicted of a similar crime were more interesting and likable characters. The sisters of Ron were so long-suffering...what caring, patient women they were especially Annette. It's a frightening thought that this injustice could happen to someone, but unfortunately it has happened to many innocent men in the U.S. prison system. A worthwhile read."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is my first John Grisham book. Therefore, I cannot speak to how it compares with his novels. I do understand some of the complaints about the writing in this book. Many times, Grisham merely \\"tells,\\" when he could have \\"shown\\" with words. Here is an example: \\"Mary Long testified that Ron Williamson was a non-secretor... With some effort, Barney pinned her down on the exact number of people she had tested and arrived at a total of twenty, including the victim. And of that number, twelve were non-secretors, or 60 percent of the pool. He then had some fun with the math\\" (p. 200). This conversation could have been a whole lot more riveting if he had written it as dialogue (he had trial transcripts) and explained how \\"fun with the math\\" was done. I also wish he had written neutrally and let the facts speak for themselves, saving his personal opinions for the author's note at the end. Yet despite these issues, I am uncomfortable with the suggestion that it was \\"not suspenseful enough,\\" thus not worth reading, as some people have suggested. I take issue with the idea that someone else's nightmare and something this important should be rejected and ignored because it was not entertaining or suspenseful (or the deeper interpretation that I *should* be entertained by someone else's wrongful conviction). Knowing it was non-fiction, I did not read it to be entertained but to be informed. If you adopt a similar attitude before reading, it is unlikely you will be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"It is amazing how John Grisham can produce such high quality reading on a regular basis.

Sad that this happened only 30 years ago!"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have only read two books by John Grisham, this one and Skipping Christmas, which are totally different from each other and from what I hear, very different from his other works. This is his only non-fiction book, and while it has a lot of detail and does not flow as easily as a typical novel might because of the way the novel's plot is crafted, it is nonetheless a fascinating and very important work. Very depressing and appalling, but important. Obviously Skipping Christmas was a much easier and faster read, but that's not what matters here.The story is about two pairs of men in Ada, OK who were each convicted and sentenced to either death or life imprisonment for murder of a woman they had nothing to do with, but mainly focuses on how this affected one of these four, namely Ron Williamson, who was also at one time one of Oklahoma's best baseball prospects but then spiraled downhill into mental illness and uncontrolled drinking when the baseball thing didn't work out.Throughout I was appalled at how dead set the police and especially the prosecutor were to get this guy, whom they regarded as a bum and a nuisance, plus his friend Dennis Fritz, despite the existence of a perfect alibi and the total lack of incriminating evidence. They basically believed spurious hair data and a bunch of morons in the local jail who claimed that the two confessed. Then they forced Ron to live in inhuman conditions on death row, with the guards tormenting him constantly, and worse yet, the prosecution withheld important exculpatory evidence, to the point of the judge holding a Brady proceeding after the trial was over! My jaw was dropping all the way. I wouldn't have expected justice this poor in the worst third-world country, let alone America.Of course, as Ron was suffering through his many years on death row, his mental illness worsened considerably. He was eventually exonerated through DNA evidence and even won a big chunk of money in a civil suit, but it was too late - the combination of strong medicines and too much liquor eventually destroyed his liver and killed him in 2004, a totally wasted life. And Bill Peterson, the prosecutor, has not apologized to this day, even though they eventually got the real killer. Why that guy was never fired and thrown out onto the street in total disgrace I will never know.Bottom line is, I used to mainly support the death penalty, but my mind has changed. Maybe if someone already in jail for life for murder kills again while in prison, okay, because there is no other punishment available at that point. But otherwise, absolutely not. The guy could be innocent, especially if the prosecution and police and even the defense laywer and judge are as incompetent and vicious as they are in Ada, OK. More than that, I now have very serious doubts about the basic integrity of the US justice system in general. No other book has caused this big a jolt in my worldview, ever. This is true even though it is not clear to me that Grisham wrote this as a polemic.I urge you to take the considerable effort required to read this book, even though the basic story is well-known and all over the web.

He had a great start in life going for the \\"Big Leagues,\\" and was well on the way to that dream when it all started unraveling. He had some bad habits with drinking and drugs, and a record with the cops as a result.When the murder of Debbie Carter happened, the cops were well on their way to blaming Ron, and his friend Dennis Fritz. Debbie was murdered in her apartment one night after having a big fight with her boyfriend Glenn Gore. Debbie was always complaining about Glenn and having abusive problems with him for some time. From the start of this book, it was so obvious who murdered her, yet, these other two gentleman Ron and his friend Dennis were accused all the way.When cops first questioned Ron, they did not even give him a chance to explain anything, and kicked him around in the questioning room for hours on end. He didn't even know Debbie Carter from Adam, but the cops were convinced the evidence pointed mostly to him, and Dennis Fritz that it wasn't even funny.The two were convicted and sent to prison where Ron went steadily downhill. His emotional state had always been very rocky at the best in his life, but with prison, he grew more and more eccentric, wild, and even suicidal many times.He and Dennis Fritz were eventually both placed on death row and kept in the worst prisons possible with hardly a thing to eat, drink, or a bed to sleep on. As the decline kept on happening, there was a lawyer who took a real interest in these cases. It took a long long time, but finally the cases were re-tried, and an appeal was made which could totally turn the case around. Ron was innocent, as was Dennis. But until the right person found the right evidence, the men would be suffering greatly. Especially Ron when he went into a psychiatric hospital for treatment several times before this whole nightmare was over."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"A real move away from what I have come to expect from Grisham, but artfully done. Draws one into the maze of bad police work and prosecution. Very scary as to what happens when prosecutors are misguided and shows what can happen, if you don't have the money to find the right attorney and even if you do, how costly it is when the government decides to \\"make it happen\\" dispite the facts or lack of evidence. Wish that he had had more pages to develop more of what he found out and alluded to.Well worth the reading."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"John Grisham opened my eyes to how through political pressure innocent men can be framed. Also, how terribly people are treated in prison!!! This poor family and all that they endured should never be wished upon anyone! I felt so sorry for Ron Williamson and his family. I cannot believe anyone would chose to treat human beings in such a way! This book really made me think about how DNA testing is so important and how many innocent men are still out there!"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Grisham's first take at non-fiction is an amazing success. Just as gripping as his prior fictitious tales, The Innocent Man is a true-life shocking tale of violence and a broken justice system. I could barely put this sad tale down. Another fiction book I read recently, \\"Death Angel\\" by Martha Powers, had a similar feel to it - murder in a small town, false accusations, and an enthralling story. I recommend this book as well, especially if you end up liking The Innocent Man."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I think Grisham did a really good job projecting a clear and concise chronology of the injustice that was done, not only to Ron but to about 4 other innocent men who spent time (some are still spending time) in the most horrific conditions of incarceration. The thing I like about Grisham is, he has a way of describing complicated legal terms and events in an understandable way so that your average reader has no problem comprehending it. I think this is why his audience is so broad.This book brought up several controversial subjects such as the death penalty, prisoner's rights, junk science, shoddy police work, abuse of power, unsatisfactory legal representation, mental illness and the influence of inmate snitching and it's impact in the decision of these cases. I was surprised that the prosecutor, Bill Peterson, is still allowed to practice law. I am surprised that there wasn't more compensation given to these men and their families for the wasted years spent in prison. I am surprised that there wasn't criminal action taken against those who showed such inadequacy at their jobs, that it cost these men a good portion of their lives. Although I am a supporter of the death penalty, I do agree with Grisham that there are some major flaws in the US penal system regarding this issue. It makes you wonder how many innocent men are put to death? Is it the same as the amount of guilty that are still in our society roaming free? If the Williamson family could feel that anything positive has resulted from telling this story it would be the fact that it may prevent another life from being ruined by the mentality of a system that a conviction, whether it's legitimate or not, is more important than finding out the truth."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This first non-fiction work by Grisham proves (if proof needed to be obtained)once and for all that he can write.The book is fast-paced and ultra-informative. I (like Grisham himself) had never heard about Williamson and Dennis Fritz unfair situation.It's a sad history all the way. How can someone like Williamson lead such a wasted, troubled and unfortunately sick life is a tragedy, a tragedy that happens everyday and with millions of people.One of the thing that shocked most is that the government never even apologized to Williamson and Fritz. Another factor is the Wasrd / Fontenot case and the third most striking point is how the prosecutor mantained his job after it was proved how incompetent and foul play he was.I read it in just two days. It's that good."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I think there is a good reason why I prefer a novel to a docudrama. The Innocent Man is a good case in point. This is a very well written book, as well as very eye opening about how bad our system of justice can be abused. That being said, this is not a book that I enjoyed on any level. I was just tragic, and while the \\"Innocent Man\\" and his friend are eventually vindicated of their convictions, this a story where there aren't any happy endings, and justice is not really served. This is just a tragic tale of a young mans slip into mental illness, and a corrupt group of law enforcement agents, adjudicators and prosecutors way of making him go away.If you like true stories about a failed system, you may be happy you read this tale, if you want an enjoyable read pass it by."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"John Grisham chose a compelling story to feature in his true crime book about Ron Williamson's scandalous treatment at the hands of Ada, Oklahoma police and prosecutors. It's too bad the book is not quite as great a read as it is an important and empathetic discussion of justice gone awry. Now I understand he's signed onto a movie deal for the book, a film that I'll no doubt rush out to see. Grisham may write better when he relies on his imagination rather than the record, but I'm truly thankful that he made the effort to write this book and I'm pleased he's apparently gone on to help the unfortunate soul who was convicted with Williamson, Dennis Fritz, sell his own book about the experience. Don't give up on the true crime genre John. You'll get even better at it."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I'll admit it: I had never read a John Grisham book before. Thrillers are not my cup of tea, although I read The Da Vinci Code, and thought it was entertaining. Still, when I heard about this fascinating case -a man who gets sentenced to die for a crime he didn't commit, as the evidence clearly proves--I thought that an author who's made a fortune writing thrillers would deliver a fascinating, fast-paced book. Boy, was I wrong.The first part of the book is slow, slow, sloooow. I had to force myself to keep reading. The pace picks up eventually, and the case indeed is fascinating. In the hands of a good author, this could have been an extraordinary book, but Grisham only delivers a mediocre one. I didn't expect John Grisham to be Tolstoy, but neither did I expect that his writing would be so dry and boring."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book was not what I expected as a huge John Gisham fan. But once I got into it ,I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Really interesting book. Scary too, because it's a true story. It could happen to any of us."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is the first non-fiction book that I have ever tried to read. Kudos to John Grisham for learning about this story and for writing it. I have always heard of people going to prison for crimes that they did not commit, but have never known anyone. This story will make you open your eyes.This novel is based on Ron Williamson, baseball hero in the small town of Ada, Ok. Ada had high hopes that their hero would be taken to the top in baseball. However, in his twenties, Williamson becomes a drunk and loses all hope of living as a major league baseball player.Williamson starts living off of family and friends. He is unjustly arrested for the murder of a local girl and most townspeople believe that Ron did it. His family sticks by him, but it was very difficult for them.Time happens and Ron remains in jail, on death row - for a crime that he did not commit. Ron develops a mental illness.If you have never heard of this case, then I suggest that everyone reads this novel. I was shocked to find out that this really happened and had never heard of this before. I will not ruin the ending to the book, which is obvious if you pick up the book and read it. However, the life long struggle of Ron is worth reading about and it makes you think twice how your actions can lead you in the wrong direction in life. I pray that the Williamson family has found closure on the matter and that they have found peace. Sad, sad story. Pure injustice!"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I admire John Grisham for his work and depth here. It doesn't read like one of his thrillers, but it is gripping. I did find some areas a bit repetitive, but overall this is a fantastic narrative presentation of the facts, exactly how I like it in my favorite book type, true crime. I'm one of those softies who tends to really believe in innocent until proven guilty, and unlike Nancy Grace, I don't believe in circumstantial evidence for homicide cases. It'd be really interesting to get John Grisham (an ex defense lawyer, right?) and Nancy Grace (an ex prosecutor) together on a show. What a match that would be. The book feels long at times, but never bores, and I actually felt so sorry for the victims in this book. It was really interesting to see the photos of Ron Williamson before and after his ordeal. I was so captivated by this whole story, I actually went to the website of the prosecutor mentioned by the author in the book. It is interesting to see him defending himself. Please write more true crime, Mr. Grisham."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"John Grisham writes good fiction books that I always read when travelling, fast paced interesting stories with plots twists that keep the pages turning. While some are better than others, I will pick up a book of his when I see his name on the cover. I did that with this book not realizing that it was not his non-fiction standard fare. It was a good purchase because true events make this book even more gripping.Though it is a story that is often heard both in fiction and non-fiction works rlating to people who are innocent of crimes (trials, police investigations, and the rest), the fact that this is non-fiction makes it all the more powerful. It also brings to light things that we have all heard about regarding the justice system.The book is full of details that are important to fully understand the subject and though not as quick/easy reading when compared to his fiction, including them to me just made the book more intriguing and worthwhile.I am glad that I made a \\"mistake\\" and picked it up."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I honestly didn't know that I was reading non fiction until I was about 30 pages into this book. It kept me interested from cover to cover and it really made me think. It is so terrifying that innocent men and women can go to jail on such little evidence...I will not look at a deathrow inmate the same again. I'm so glad that John Grisham decided to write this amazing story!"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I've admired Grisham from the beginning, but this first non'fiction book of his raises his stature even higher in my estimation because he uses his talents to portray a gross miscarriage of justice. The fact that such an event can happen to an ordinary citizen is certainly chilling enough. But the aftermath is even more chilling as we see the attitude of the authorities after the innocence of two men was basically proven. Also chilling is how the citizens of the town reacted to the acquitta. This is a brutal look at law enforcement and the judicial process and certainly deserves being widely read."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Great story but was expecting something different from John Grisham so a disapointment in that sense. Sounded like an Ann Rule book. I know authors like to stretch themselves and try different things, but when I pick up a book from an author, I go for the known style. I have many Grisham books but I won't be keeping this one."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"The only thing I didn't like about this book was the fact that it was a true story and therefore an innocent man was nearly put to death for a crime he did not commit. The lack of evidence was appalling. Right from the beginning it was clear that Glen Gore was the guy they should have been looking at.What irked me was the arrogance of Bill Peterson and the fact that even after DNA proved Williamson and Fritz's innocence he refused to acknowledge that they played no part in the murder.I have no sympathy for Glen Gore, simply because he knowingly assisted in putting an innocent man in jail for a crime he himself committed.I highly recommend this informative and well researched book."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This real-life story is very emotional, rousing and compelling and in my opinion also very exciting. Even if you know the outcome already and the writing style isn't out for suspense. The nonfictional narration is constructed as a history of a criminal case and less intended as a thriller. In the English edition in midsection there are photographs of some participants which help a lot to put oneself in there place and empathize with them. It is a book that gives a deep insight in the touching life of a wrongly convicted person, who is hit hard by destiny several times - the burst dream of a baseball career, alcoholism, drugs, women, schizophrenia and eventually the condemnation for death penalty. It is a distressing factual report of a human tragedy, put together from many conclusive pieces of a puzzle. To my mind no page is too long and no excessive information is given. Anyway I can recommend this book warmly to every empathic, humanely and politically interested reader."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I was very disappointed in this story, about 100 pages too long, the details were repetitive and I had to struggle to keep reading. Had it not been a John Grisham, I would have given up about a third of the way through it but I kept thinking it must get better.Next time I will check his book out at the library first. I gave this one away a few minutes after completing it. Big sigh of relief that I was done with it!"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"The Innocent Man is the real-life story of Ron Williamson, a man who was charged with a crime he did not commit and who was sent to death row as a result. This is Grisham's first work of nonfiction. It is investigative journalism at its best.Upon reading this book, your eyes will be open to the world of wrongful convictions. One would think that this could not happen in the United States. Unfortunately, as this book demonstrates, this happens all the time, and according to Grisham, with increasing frequency.In this book, we follow the life of Williamson through his trial, imprisonment, and life on death row, and to his eventual freedom weeks before his execution.This is the sad story of a man who simply withdrew into his own private hell of dope, booze, and women only to encounter depression and hopelessness.This book reads like a novel. A must read!"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book highlights a number of disparate points about the pursuit of justice and about lives lived on society's fringes: none of which make for comfortable reading.It is made very clear to readers that Ron Williamson was mentally ill. It is also clear that the truth about a murder became lost and an innocent man came close to execution. In the meantime, a number of lives were destroyed while simultaneously some very admirable and decent human beings emerge.This book raises, potentially, a number of issues about the death penalty in the USA, about the misuse of science in assessing evidence, and about accessing justice. The story I focussed on primarily was that of a mentally ill man who, because he could not work within the framework of the justice system, was denied justice during his trial for murder.That Ron Williamson lived long enough to be exonerated is in many ways a tribute to his own inner strength, to his family and to a small group of people who believed him and supported him as best they could.'Strong Survivor' indeed.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I usually don't read John Grisham. Long ago, I read his very popular threesome, A Time to Kill, The Pelican Brief, and The Firm. The books are entertaining, light, and fun. In other words -- popular. I picked up this book because it is Grisham's first piece of non-fiction. The overall voice and structure of the story remind me of how other books I've read by him are styled. I come away feeling I've been told a story, not that I've had a story revealed to me. By this I mean, Grisham lacks a sophistication I've felt from other authors. I feel he leaves little to the independent intelligence of the reader and explicitly states things that should be left for the reader to find on their own. Despite the fact The Innocent Man is non-fiction and derived from interviews, documents, etc.... I still felt Grisham's way of story telling is not as mature as it could be.What happened to Ron Williamson is truly an outrage. He was clearly taken advantage of and inhumanely manipulated by Ada authorities and prosecutors. His right to a fair trial was not protected by the judge whose job it is to make sure each person before him receives a fair trial. To me, the most offensive act was the Ada guards manipulating his medication dosage for his manic-depressive/schizo condition to make him susceptible to agitation during times he would appear in court.By the time Ron arrived on Death Row, the system chose to view and treat him as already dead, rather than as a citizen entitled to inalienable rights. Ignorant guards would bully and torment him for their amusement by using the intercom in his cell to call to him \\"Ron, this is God. Why did you kill Debbie Carter?\\" His response would be to scream for hours \\"I did not kill Debbie Carter!\\" And for years on Death Row Ron was deliberately denied adequate mental health treatment by penny-pinching Wardens. He was made to wait until the Death Row guards tired of hearing and seeing him to be okayed for the basic right to treatment for his mental disorders.I am from Texas and shortly after James Byrd was dragged to death I had a conversation with the political humorist Molly Ivins. She wrote about Texas politics for her entire life. I asked her if she were able to tell each citizen one thing about Bush Jr., before they cast their ballot for president - what would that one thing be? Her answer was something like, \\"I don't think he's an ignorant man. I just don't think he has the intelligence to be President. When someone is the governor of the state with the most statistically racist criminal justice system in America, and can't even admit to the type of inherent flaws and prejudices in the system, then there's a problem.\\" Grisham's book reinforces her response to me. The system is not infallible. People who make decisions based on their knowledge, experiences, and beliefs run it. If you are disenfranchised, then chances of you being processed and sustained with little notice are quite high.There is no doubt, this is a story that needs to be told and the staff that read the habeas corpus case and issued a stay of execution are truly heroes. I think Grisham puts it nicely in the Author's Note: \\"Ada is a nice town, and the obvious question is: When will the good guys clean house? Perhaps when they get tired of paying for bad prosecutions.\\" This certainly cuts to the heart of the matter. Maybe good guys out there will read this book and be compelled to actually do something.This is a good book, a good story, and written in a fairly predictable John Grisham style."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"For those of you complaining about how boring the book is--I bet you did not cry when \\"Old Yeller\\" died.

This would seem to fit with the MO.If you want to read a compelling account of injustice then read this book. It moved me to want to do something about this kind of problem. Peterson should be sent to death row for his most egregious actions.All interrogations should be video taped from start to finish. Any person should be able to ask for a review of these tapes.Great book Grisham. Public sensibilities need to be pricked.If you want a good read that is senseless entertainment read Harry Potter.

I am certain that I have made mistakes on my side of the courtroom. But, even with what I have seen in the name of 'justice', I was stunned at how bad this prosecution and law enforcement behaved in this shameful episode. Sure, many of the people we represent are, in fact, guilty. Everyone in the courthouse knows this to be true. But with the backdrop of the presumption of innocence, too often prosecutors and cops -even judges - ignore this presumption and just assume that because so many people are guilty of their crimes, they all must be.Grisham paints a vivid, frightful, and stunning picture of the fragility of our legal system. Armed with the truth and the facts, he describes how the prosecutors and cops almost killed 2 innocent men because of the inertia that resulted from ego, arrogance and pride. It is a wakeup call to all those who may one day serve on a jury that your function is not that of a rubber stamp, but is instead a sacred duty to scrutinize and question everything you hear - from both sides. It is perhaps the most important function of our civic responsibility and Grisham accurately describes what happens when we accept things at face value instead of using our talents as discerning beings to critically question what we see and hear.But while I was reading the remarkable tale of Ron Williamson, I could not help but think about all those other cases out there - the routine felonies and non-violent crimes. What about the rush to judgment that exists in many of those cases?Barry Scheck's Innocence Project is an exemplary outfit that saves lives. And in his successes, he has exposed fundamental flaws in our system that are systemic and at the non-capital level, result in turning some innocent people into felons and ruining their futures. If DNA has exonerated 190 people through Scheck's group, how many indigent defendants are serving time - or have been denied a future - because of the same arrogance exhibited by the DA and cops in Grisham's story? Something to think about.I guess it goes without saying that admitting you got the wrong guy never got a cop promoted or a DA re-elected.Grisham made me stop and ponder these questions, and that made it a great book for me. What a great job and public service. Thanks John."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"In many ways, I agree with Amanda's review - this is not as exciting a read as Grisham's fiction, but the story is one that should be told.Many of Grisham's novels take the view that lawyers who are already wealthy should not simply continue taking the kind of cases that made them wealthy, but should find ethical goals. After reading a few of these excellently-crafted books, I wanted to ask him whether he thought that an author who was (I assumed) already wealthy should simply continue to write the kind of novel that had already made him wealthy, or should find ethical goals. With this, he has done so.I think it was Amanda who said something to the effect that 'Law and Order' would have told the story in 47 minutes. They do so by fictionalizing the story, rearranging events for the convenience of the story, as Arthur C. Clarke described in his forward toGlide Path: To The Heart of Experimental Technology..In WWII!. I do not think that would have been appropriate for this case. Here a man was apparently deliberately framed by the police and prosecutors, who nearly succeeded in having him executed for a crime that was apparently actually committed by a man who the police wanted to shield because he sold them illegal narcotics for their private use. To know that this can happen in this country is appalling, and I am glad Grisham gave me the evidence without rearrangement. Given that this was what he was trying to do, I'm not sure the book could have been much shorter.Essentially, Grisham wrote the case for the prosecution of the police and the court. It was the best thing to do, and he did it as well as it could have been done. If it makes the reading less exciting, so be it. I will remember the events he describes long after I forget the plots of his novels."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Very eye opening and disturbing to know how there are so many careless investigations and rush to convict.

Grisham's an excellent researcher and Grisham captures a judicial situation that leaves one with mouth hanging open and wondering about \\"innocent until proven guilty\\".I regularly read Anne Rule's true crime books, and she manages to get the story across without drawing the reader into the morass of bad feelings, lets you participate as a spectator. Grisham has a problem with that, and, in attempting to engage the reader in the \\"wrongness\\" of the situation, to the extent that he is shocked and outraged, he falls into the trap of repetitive detail.Thus, a hard read, but a believable start to a potential nonfiction career for the popular author.quidrock"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I'm not going to write a plot summary since others on Amazon have already did that. I enjoyed this book but expected more from Mr. Grisham. It was an interesting case that he could have did so much more. I got tired of his constant writing about Ron's mental illness but not going into it. If you are going to mention it that many times then you would think you would explore it deeper. I wish he would have used more court transcripts and transcripts of his interviews with the different subjects of this story.

Two young men, good friends, are identified as the prime suspects, investigated, tried, and convicted for the crime. The case eventually draws national attention, including that of a famous writer who decides to write the true-crime drama of their story. Does any of this sound familiar, an eerie shadowing of a murder committed in 1959 in small-town Holcomb, Kansas and examined by Truman Capote's masterpiece of literary journalism, IN COLD BLOOD? It is difficult not to believe that John Grisham, the notoriously successful author of potboiling legal thrillers, must have thought of Truman Capote at times during his writing of THE INNOCENT MAN. Sadly, Grisham is no Capote, and his shortcomings in that regard are only amplified by the similarities of his subject matter to that of IN COLD BLOOD.\\"The village of Holcomb stands on the high wheat plains of Western Kansas, a lonesome area that other Kansans call \`out there.'...The local accent is barbed with a prairie twang, a ranch-hand nasalness, and the men, many of them, wear narrow frontier trousers, Stetsons, and high-heeled boots with pointed toes. The land is flat, and the views are awesomely extensive; horses, herds of cattle, a white cluster of grain elevators rising as gracefully as Greek temples are visible long before a traveler reaches them.\\" These sentences are excerpted from just the first paragraph of IN COLD BLOOD, and there's not a single sentence in THE INNOCENT MAN's 300-plus pages that even comes close to Capote's richly layered prose. Oddly, given Grisham's past literary successes - THE INNOCENT MAN is little more than a cold fish, dead and gutted. The writing is straight out of Jack Webb and the old Dragnet TV show: \\"Just the facts, ma'am.\\" The sense of place never exceeds that of being vaguely small town America, the main victim is little more than a defiled corpse, and the reader's empathy for Ron Williamson and Dennis Fritz arises far more from their desperate circumstances than from any emotional connections established by Grisham's writing. The research is there, no question, but the writing is perfunctory, drab and uninspired.Despite the book's literary shortcomings, THE INNOCENT MAN does indeed offer a cautionary tale about the American criminal justice system and capital (death sentence) crimes. The story of Ron Williamson's and Dennis Fritz's false arrests, kangaroo trials, and multiyear incarcerations on Oklahoma's death row demonstrate virtually everything that can go wrong, especially for indigent defendants - poor police investigative work, civic pressure to find anyone on whom to pin the crime, a prosecutor more interested in getting a conviction than in finding the truth (even to the point of manufacturing eyewitnesses and withholding exculpatory evidence), incompetent and financially hamstrung legal counsel, criminally one-sided judges, death row confinement under conditions that violated the Geneva Conventions, and an indifferent prison system (and a supportive statewide populace) whose enthusiasm for executions can only be described as macabre. Shame on Prosecutor Bill Peterson and his staff, shame on Ada police detectives Dennis Smith and Gary Rogers, shame on Judge Ronald Jones, shame on defense lawyer Barney Ward, shame on Appeals Judge Gary Lumpkin, shame on the numerous low-life witnesses who perjured themselves and put two innocent men on death row, and shame most of all on the twelve men and women of the jury who chose to let willful ignorance and prejudice blind them to truths that would have been patently obvious anywhere outside the Bible Belt.Two lessons jump off Mr. Grisham's pages. The first lesson is the inherent unfairness of the death penalty with its accompanying danger of wrongful execution, a barbarism that America alone among the developed Western world still practices. The degree to which the suspects Williamson and Fritz were railroaded into false convictions with the tacit approval of a grossly negligent judiciary demonstrates a criminal justice system at its inhumane worst, nearly capped by the ultimate injustice of death by lethal injection but for the intervention of Mark Barrett, Janet Chesley, Judge Frank Seay, and Barry Scheck (yes, he of O.J. Simpson trial fame). The second message is equally clear: \\"Oklahoma is NOT OK.\\" As if we didn't already have more than enough reasons to avoid that fundamentalist, creationist, book burnin', Bible-thumpin', intolerant, holier-than-thou neck of the woods, John Grisham has provided yet another.Bottom line: Mr. Grisham should stick to his m&eacute;tier as the Stephen King of legal thrillers, and prospective readers should stick with Truman Capote rather than endure this 300-page police blotter of a story."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Having read all (or at least most) of Mr. Grishams previous books I was anticipating a good read. Instead I was treated to a confusing mix of characters and locations thrown at me in a more or less random fashion. You, the reader, must work hard to keep track of who is who and how they relate to which murder at which time or place. Too much work! I stopped at the halfway mark because it was giving me headache.Of course the publisher fails to mention it's non-fiction anywhere on the cover and even though it does say it inside the sleeve (at the top) most readers, like me, just read the description which of course fails to mention this fact. They are, of course, banking on previous novels to sell this one and don't mind a little trickery to do it. The bookstore put it in the fiction section, natch.Save your money and buy something else, anything else actually because this book is the pits in my opinion."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I've enjoyed reading almost all of John Grisham's books. However, the switch to non-fiction was not a good one. The book was very dry and I had little desire to continue reading, other than my hope that it would get better. The story itself was very serious and deserves to be told. But if you're looking for a good John Grisham story, skip this one."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This was not John Grisham at his best. A very good thriller but still a bit under par from what we expect from the master of suspense. 3.5 stars"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I've read virtually all of Grisham's legal fiction and loved most of it. But this book is very different. Although it fits fits squarely in the world of courtrooms, lawyers, police and jails, it does not provide the enjoyable read that most of his books do.Of course, it's not supposed to; it's a wakeup call to let us know that our legal system can be perverted to convict innocent men. Okay, that's useful, but that doesn't mean that the story of these events will provide a good read. In fact, the characters in this book are mostly all people you would not want to spend any time with, including the time reading about them.As far as fulfilling its purpose of detailing the malicious conviction of two (actually four) innocent men, the book does its job. But it does it with a lackluster style that feels more like a dull recitation of facts, interspersed with outrage. And that gets tiring rather quickly.It's good to spread your wings and try a new challenge. But let's hope Mr. Grisham goes back to writing legal fiction, which he does so well."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I hated, hated it. It is the first book in years I did not finish reading. I can't remember the last time I gave up on a book but this one was horrible. I would not recommend this book to anyone. I am so disappointed in John Grisham's most recent books that I don't think I will read another book by Grisham."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Did not like this Grisham book. He rambles on and on about each character without developing much of a story!"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"As a fan of John Grisham's work (The Rainmaker is still my favorite of his), I must say that I am very surprised that he decided to write a nonfiction, something that he could easily do. But, won't that matter since his fiction books are already fun to read? So, I decided to give The Innocent Man a try. After reading halfway through the book, I was losing a great deal of interest in the true crime story of Ron Williamson and Dennis Fritz. Both are shady characters who have a rap sheet of some kind (Ron's is probably a mile long), and I am not surprised that they were the main suspects of the 4 year old cold case. Ron Williamson was somebody that I could care less about because he was a very egocentric person who made his family to suffer greatly from his overwhelming selfishness. To my no surprise, he eventually became a degenerate vagabond with a history of mental illness which was probably first triggered by illicit drugs. He also had a very suspicious history of his relationships with women (Shame on Grisham for omitting the valuable details of why he and his wife were divorced; if you are going to write a biography of somebody, better reveal all details, or don't write it in the first place). Thus, I must propose one question: \\"Does it really matter if he was locked up? Because during the time of his incarceration, it saved many women a lot of harm.\\" On the other hand, I realized more and more, in the final 150 pages, that Grisham was more primarily concerned about injustice and blatant abuse of powers. That was more of an interesting in-look of how criminal justice system can not work in favor of the defendants at times. I always love how Grisham sprinkles legal information throughout the book and makes the readers aware of how the law works. It's always the best part of the book. And also, he does an excellent job of painting the local, state, and criminal system history of Ada and Oklahoma. It is too typical of a town that doesn't value education very much. A lot of commendations should go to the lawyers and judges along with their assistants who made the overturning of the convictions possible, and they are the true heroes. All in all, The Innocent Man is an interesting read, but really, I didn't care much for the exonerated characters."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Not sure if he liked it-he didn't talk about it much-I think it's based off a true story though!"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I would have liked a paper back. My husband and I both read the book."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Typically when I read a Grisham novel, it is tough to put the book down--unfortunately this is not the case with The Innocent Man. It is like reading a history textbook for me, and I had a real tough time finishing this work. It was boring."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I'm a big fan of John Grisham, but this book is a dud! The story is fascinating and needs to be told, but by someone else. While Grisham seems to get the facts and the chronology of events across, the read is about as interesting as watching grass grow. Stick to fiction John."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"OK - \\"The Innocent Man\\" is not your regular John Grisham (JG) lawyers' book - this is a non-fiction book, therefore the atmosphere is different (at least to me).Not the usual legal mumbo jumbo lingo (still some)... but as you go along with the story, each chapter reviews what's happening to Ron (the main character) and the \\"imperfect\\" of our legal system. Either JG really hates the LEO/prosecutor/lawyers/judge in the city of Ada, or the LEO/prosecutor/etc really did screw up and an innocent man was sent to jail for over 10 years and sentenced to death.After reading the book, I did a Google search and found more information on the story. Interesting material."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"When I read \\"The Innocent Man\\" I could see how unfair it was to the prosecutor, Pontotoc County District Attorney Bill Peterson. But I didn't know the half of it. In an understandable attempt set the record straight, Peterson recently set up a Web site and set out in detail the ACTUAL facts of his involvement in the case:[....................]An analysis of what Peterson says confirms that Grisham was, indeed, remarkably unfair. Worse, it exposes the many, many errors contained in Grisham's account. Worst of all, every error cast Peterson in a much more unfavorable light than the facts warranted.Williamson and Fritz, the two men wrongfully convicted of a young woman's murder, were the victims of a tragedy worthy of Shakespeare and it is well that Grisham has told their tale in a popular book. But Grisham's having allowed his antiestablishment attitudes and his desire to tell a \\"ripping tale\\" mislead him into misleading us about Peterson's conduct is equally tragic. Peterson did no more and no less than his job. Grisham should be ashamed of himself for savaging a public servant who was caught in the same web as the sorry affair's other victims, Williamson and Fritz."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book reads like a 300 page newspaper article. It is a real - very tragic story about a wrong accusation which ruins a life but this book drags on forever and I actually had to flip over ca. 40 pages because I couldnt take more dry facts anymore that only lead to something that you already know because : there are photos in there which tell you the whole thing before you even start reading. It is shocking how in such recent past or even still the justice system here lacks of professionality and things like this happen - but this book is too dry to enjoy."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"First I would like to state this novel is nothing like any of his previous novels. Nothing like the Last Juror, which I loved, nor is it like the Painted House nor Skipping Christmas.I really liked ALL of his previous novels that I've read. This one is good too, but, it's a documentary journal. Maybe if you are a detective, you may enjoy this book more than I. In a way, the story is interesting. It makes me feel like as if I am reading ABC News' 20/20: How myriads of fumbling nonsensical yet so very true episode of one town's mistake in trying to put stressed out justice in front of rhyme and reason.I would recommend this book to anyone who is 18 or older who've graduated from high school - to expect what can happen and to learn to deal with zealous law officers - to be an educated citizen to halt any repeats of such embarrassing practice of authority."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"My wife and I listened to the audio version of The Innocent Man during a recent cross-country trip. Grisham may write compelling fiction, but here his writing style is pedestrian and repetitive--perhaps due to the fact that he conducted the research and wrote the book in only 18 months, according to the author's note.Fortunately for readers, the story of Ron Williamson and Dennis Fritz is so compelling that it soon overcomes the shortcomings of Grisham's telling. The two men went through hell, and Grisham ably documents the incompetence, arrogance and maliciousness of the Ada police and prosecutors and the lack of concern of the Oklahoma criminal justice system. Grisham does not soft-pedal the dark side of Williamson's character and his slide in and out of madness. Yet by the end we marvel at his ability to survive as well as he did given his severe psychological problems.The Innocent Man is a harrowing and cautionary tale that should make all Americans concerned about the fairness of a justice system we usually take for granted. Although Grisham may not have been the best writer to tell the story, his fame at least guarantees that the story of Williamson and Fritz gets the attention it deserves."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"In the middle of Chapter 9, it states that witness Gary Allen was being interviewed by Gary Rogers. Rogers was putting the pressure on Allen to identify the 2 suspects as the murderers. When Allen refused to do so, Rogers \\"brushed his coat aside from his hip so Allen could see his service revolver..... saying he might get lead poisoning if his memory didn't improve.\\"I find it impossible to beleive this is a true story. No cop would threaten to shoot a potential witness, ever. Especially one who was going to testify in court. Imagine if this witness stated in court under oath that he was lethally threatened to say the \\"right\\" thing. Not only is this cause for losing you career, it is also tampering with a witness, a felony crime. It does make for good fiction, though. I have found quite a few things in this book that are hard to beleive. I credit Grisham for trying to bring to light the fact that there are numerous innocent people behind bars. But let's not exagerate the truth. No wonder he was sued for \\"libel\\"."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I hope that this is the last non-fiction book that John Grisham writes. I have not read a book of his that I didn't like until this one.It reads like a bad episode of Dateline NBC. It's hard to keep up with all of the people involved. AND I don't know if I can emphasize this point enough, IT IS EXTREMELY DEPRESSING. Stories like this about fictional characters can be enjoyable at times b/c they are seperated from reality, but when it happens to real people it just makes you sick.Brief synopsis:A woman is murdered.A man's life begins to fall apart.A man's life continues to fall apart.Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse, it does.There's no nice neat bow on the end of this one. There are no answers. There is no final resolution.Pass."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Being a Criminal Justice Student I have really enjoyed reading this book. One of the best non-fiction in its Genre that I have read. Amazing story.I look forward to reading Journey Toward Justice and The Dreams of Ada."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Another great book by Grisham. Even though he's writing non fiction this time around he still manages to write in the same style Grisham fans enjoy. I've always enjoyed the way he describes a setting: small town feel, laid back people, slow moving days.One small complaint, the book includes photos very early on. If you don't know any details of the main character and hearing this story for the firs time without knowing how it ends, avoid looking at those pics. They kinda tell the story at a high level. I went into the story not knowing a thing about the guy or how it ends for him. After reading the captions below the pics about 1/4 through the book I did know how it goes"},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"An aberration from his usual style of legal suspense thrillers, Grisham does some fieldwork in this stirring true story about a man (Ron Williamson) who struggles mightily in life after the good old days of high school stardom. Ron was a high school baseball prodigy and everyone in Oklahoma knew his name. He was drafted by the Oakland A's and success seemed destine for Ron, however the pressures to make it in the big leagues take their tole on his psyche and slowly he becomes a shell of a man in need of institutional care after continuous failures to move up in the world. Forced to take some personal initiative to receive care, Ron never has a chance. I found myself in disbelief at the way the law enforcement operated and the truth about their sick intentions for the fate of Ron and others in the story. Of course Ron is convicted and sent to death row. Grisham, with his simplistic writing style allows the true events from Ada, Oklahoma's turbulent past pave the way for one of the most shocking true-stories ever told in U.S. history."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This gripping book examines injustice following the rape/murder of Debra Sue Carter of Ada, Oklahoma in December, 1982. With her outraged community demanding justice, police botched the investigation, overlooked prime suspect Glen Gore, and employed dubious techniques that led to the arrest of Ron Williamson and Dennis Fritz. Williamson was an unstable belligerent drunk with prior arrests for sexual assault, but Fritz was guilty only of being his friend. As the author shows, both were railroaded and convicted in trials based on scant, dubious evidence and so replete with procedural errors (not to mention incompetent defense) that they should have ended in a mistrial (Willamson) and outright dismissal (Fritz). Then we read of their incaceration, appeals, help from Project Innocent, plus Williamson's increased mental illness and near execution. Finally, the author shows how both were exonnerated by new DNA testing which essentially proved Glen Gore's guilt.I usually disdain criminals, but my contempt shifted here to the incompetent (or dishonest) investigators, clueless judges, and most of all, prosecutor Bill Peterson. The latter continued believing Williamson and Fritz guilty (and Gore innocent) after the DNA tests - Peterson now has a web site to revive his image given this book's indictment of his arrogant stupidity and inability to admit he was wrong.I'd have liked more information on grand juries, whether or not the cops, judges, and Peterson faced reprimands or even apologized, and whether those convicted in the nearby Denice Hathaway murder were similarly railroaded. Still, author John Grisham has written a gripping narrative that easily matches his best fictional thrillers."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Grisham never surpassed A Time to Kill, in my opinion, in his fiction writing, but I've generally enjoyed his work. The Painted House was a very good book, and although fictionalized, it was based upon a true story, and perhaps now that he's made millions, he can afford to spend the time researching for non-fictional works. I hope so.Several of Grisham's books, the ones I've like least, were written it seemed to justify his being able to write off a vacation. Those books had clumsy facts about places and people in foreign lands, here in this non-fiction book, he sticks to the facts and creates a very interesting and thought provoking book (which is also, sadly, entertaining to read in the same way reading Ann Rule is entertaining, not because the subject isn't tragic, but because the writing is good).As for the social consequences of this book, I'm shocked that the DA wasn't disbarred and kept his job, astounding as his errors were, he kept his job. Much of the \\"justice\\" in America is sadly dished out by people that are working on careers, on both sides, and the results aren't always fair or just, for either side.Hopefully books like this will continue to be written and people will start to look at libertarian philosophy and how taking that view of the state might improve our current affairs."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"Non fiction book about Ron Williamson, who was wrongly convicted of murdering a young woman in the 80s. The book also includes the stories of Dennis Fritz, implicated in the same murder, and a couple other people who faced similar charges while being innocent. Ron narrowly escaped the death penalty. This is a gripping story for anyone interested in the death penalty etc. Ron is an unlikely hero with severe psychological, drinking and drug issues. However his story and what happened to him is so unbelievable that you have to read it to believe it. This book really makes you think about the justice system and how people with a certain degree of authority and a personal agenda can destroy the lives of so many for no valid reason."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This was an excellently crafted book especially for non-fiction. The most important aspect, overall about the book is that the book didn't distort the real character of Ron Williamson. Grisham's descriptions about him Ron have been excessive but it did hammer home the point this was not a good person. At times, I tried to rationalize and blame the Ada authorities incompetence because of Ron's poor character. To be honest, at times I didn'r really feel that sorry for him.It is amazing to see how someone can be wrongfully prosecuted. After reading the book, I did some other research and found a website of the district attorney who prosecuted the case. The website does show evidence that the DA is virtually clueless. There is tons of rambling text but none of it seems to address the lack of evidence and why he prosecuted with such little evidence. The book doesn't appear to be exaggerate the facts to sell."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have read almost all of Grisham's books, so I was interested in this book simply as another Grisham novel. Then I read a description of the book, and realized that it is actually non-fiction. The story line still seemed interesting, so I ended up reading it. I had a few days off work, so I started reading it expecting to use it to fill up some inactive parts of the day. Instead I spent most of the next day-and-a-half reading, and I could hardly put the book down.This book isn't quite as exciting as Grisham's novels, but it is still very interesting. It doesn't take you very long to get into the story, and by the time Ron was put on trial, I was starting to get moody and upset because of what I was reading. I have to say that much of the book is actually somewhat depressing with the depiction of the \\"authorities\\" and their underhanded work. Of course, the whole book is biased in favor of Ron's innocence, so the evidence could be somewhat biased and misrepresented, but overall, I think Grisham tried to present the facts fairly.One of the main reasons that I did not give this book a 5-star rating is because of it's style. I'm not sure if it could be helped, considering it's non-fiction stance, but it was somewhat dry and boring throughout, and just enough drama to keep you fascinated.Another reason for the 4-star rating is because of the inclusion of the Ward/Fontenot(sp?) issue. It is an important inclusion due to it being the first \\"dream confession\\", yet Grisham followed Ward to Death Row (he was there part of the time Williamson was there), but then he dropped the issue and barely made another reference to that issue for the rest of the book. Grisham did put a link to a website for further information about that case in the ending author's note, but in my opinion he should have spent either less time or more time writing about that case. As it was, it started out as an important issue, then it completely dropped out of sight.Overall, I did enjoy this book, and I think it is a very important book. Few people think about the possibility of an innocent person being convicted. Of course, the advances in DNA evidence helps reduce the risk of convicting an innocent person, but it is still an important issue to be informed about. I highly recommend that people read this book."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"My first \\"true crime\\" book. And wow. I am really shocked that something like this can happen...that people this obviously innocent can be committed and even placed on death row. I suppose I'm a bit naive to the system but I'd like to believe that justice is better served.If this was a fiction book, I'd have never believed this story.I think I'll definitely try some more true crime books. This wasn't the most supremely written book I've ever seen, but it was good. It read well though the names got a bit confusing as there were a lot given without much \\"characterization\\" except for the main characters.

This is a story of the torcherous arrest, trial and conviction of two innocent men and the VERY LONG path that finally, almost too late, proves their innocence!! No one who reads this story can put it down without being moved by it!! And once you start it, you WON'T be able to put it down, while at the same time wanting to throw the book or SOMETHING across the room because of the obvious atrocities made by the law and those paid to uphold it!!

Admittedly, the prior works were fiction. The works were spell binding, informative,enlightening. This particular work did not measure up to what I have come to see and welcome from Grisham. It conveyed important history and succeeded in having troubling history and messages about our judicial system and the travesty for these innocent men resonate loudly.However, this book was lengthy, plodding and predictable. It might very well have been a more compelling and impactful piece (and message) if it had been half the length."},{"Title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is a very good book, however, it is not the usual type of book that you would expect from John Grisham. It is a true story of an innocent man being sent to prison (on death row) for a crime he did not commit. The book had a great amount of investigation to make sure the facts were correct and it was very interesting although some times it was a little hard to keep up with who was who. I really liked the part at the end of the book where pictures were posted so you could see the faces of the people you had been reading about.
