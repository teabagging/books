TolkienAs reviewed by Ross RichardWithin the first minutes reading this book, I knew it was going to be one of the best books I have ever read! I think this was a great story. I had to share how I felt about it with all of you. I feel that people who like to read fantasy, or about adventures, would enjoy this book (I recommend reading the back cover before buying the book). My personal reason I enjoyed this book is because it was about an adventure, I love to read about adventures. The story takes place in Middle Earth, in an area called \\"The Shire.\\" The main characters are Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf, and Thorin Oakenshield. The main idea of this story is about Thorin Oakenshield, a group of dwarves, Bilbo (a hobbit), and Gandalf (a wizard) achieving a quest. The quest is about the group trying to slay a dragon that took Thorin's treasure, and the dangers they encountered.One of the most exciting parts (my opinion) is when Bilbo has a dream about getting kidnapped by goblins and when he wakes up it happens! My favorite part about this book is when Bilbo and the dwarves get kidnapped by goblins and they lose Gandalf! (Gandalf, the wizard, has been protecting and guiding the troop to the destination point, you have to read it to find out). The reason I like this part is because it is very exciting and suspenseful, I couldn't wait to find out what happened.This book was written by J.R.R Tolkien. He also wrote many other books. The best known were the \\"Lord of the Rings series.\\" There are the sequels of what Bilbo's nephew and a group with him accomplish in Middle Earth. I think if you don't like stories that are fiction, to not buy this book, unless your teacher makes you read during the summer!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It is very nice to be able to read whenever I want on my kindle. there is no heavy book to lug around."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I am looking forward to the movie but nothing really compares to a book.

Tolkien's first could be the best!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Another must read, Tolkien's seminal work about adventure, friendship and discovering oneself. While the movie I'm sure will be great, I'd highly recommend reading the book first."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I wish we had a cozy place with a fireplace to sit before, while reading classics on cold winter nights. But at least there are treats like this, meant to be shared aloud to fully savor Tolkien's delicious alliteration, his pleasure in story-telling enriched by his knowledge of the deeper meanings of language. His gifts as a writer can be overlooking by the glitz of a contemporary lens, but these treasures lay in wait to constantly be rediscovered.\\"Still more suddenly a darkness came on with dreadful swiftness! A black cloud hurried over the sky. Winter thunder on a wild wind rolled roaring up and rumbled in the Mountain, and lightening lit its peak. And beneath the thunder another blackness could be seen whirling forward; but it did not come with the wind, it came from the North, like a vast cloud of birds, so dense that no light could be seen between their wings\\" (pg 302).And the journey just gets better withThe Fellowship of the Ring: Being the First Part of The Lord of the Rings, also best appreciated whist read aloud to fully savor Tolkien's poetic use of language. To further understand the creative spirit of Tolkien, I highly recommend Humphrey Carpenter's excellent works, such asJ.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography, as well as Tom Shippey'sThe Road to Middle-Earth: How J.R.R. Tolkien Created a New MythologyandJ.R.R.

I forgot how great of a story it was."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien displays a magnificent tale of a little person on a big adventure. The Hobbit tells about a hobbit that goes on an adventure with many perils. A hobbit is a creature that is about three feet tall. They don't wear shoes because the bottom of their feet is leathery. The top of their feet are covered in thick hair.Bilbo Baggins is the main character in the book. He goes on an adventure with twelve dwarves and a wizard. It all started when Bilbo was sitting outside of his house enjoying some tea when an old wizard walked up to his hobbit-hole, and asked if Bilbo would like to go on an adventure. Bilbo was taken aback and said he would never want to go on adventure. Then, Bilbo abruptly got up and ran inside his house and locked the door. Bilbo then firmly told the wizard to leave. The wizard just smirked and scratched a symbol on Bilbo's newly painted green door.The next day Bilbo heard a knock at his door, when he opened it he saw a dwarf standing there. The dwarf said, \\"Dwalin at your service!\\" Bilbo was shocked. He had never seen a dwarf before. Bilbo remembered his manners when he saw the dwarf and said, \\"Sorry to keep you waiting!\\" After a while, all of the dwarf's friends showed up. They all convinced Bilbo to go on their adventure with them. So he did. Bilbo was faced with many perils on the journey and overcame all of them.Overall, the book is excellent and full of heart-stopping danger. If you like books with swords, monsters, and treasure, then this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"In the only unabridged recording of the text, the reader provides an excellent voice to the masterpiece. Highly recommmended."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is probably the most underrated of all Tolkien's writings and it is not hard to see why. Hobbit is written in the style of a book for children and consequently, many people set it aside after the first few chapters. What a mistake! For Hobbit may be childlike in its writing style (in fact, children enjoy reading it tremendously) but there is nothing childish about it. On the face of it, Hobbit is the tale of an adventurous treasure hunt, sprinkled with wizards, dwarves, elves, dragons and of course hobbits. In actuality however, slotted (chronology-wise) between the Silmarillion and the Lord of the Rings (LOTR), Hobbit sets the stage for the climactic struggle with Sauron in LOTR. In fact, Gandalf in LOTR refers to the events in the Hobbit, both the finding of the Ring of Power and the destruction of Smaug. As compared to LOTR, Hobbit is a sunnier book, with hints of troubled times, yet filled with humor and adventurous optimism; hence perhaps its appeal to children too. For fans of LOTR, Hobbit is a must. It answers a lot of questions that LOTR raises about prior events. Do not get put off by its apparent lightness and you will find it rewarding. Ideally, read Silmarillion first, then Hobbit and finally LOTR. But even if (as most people) you first read LOTR, Silmarillion and Hobbit will still delight you. The Leatherette edition is particularly good with quality binding, paper and illustrations and would make a great gift."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Adventure, great plot, and likeable characters are all key factors in making &quot;The Hobbit&quot; an entertaining piece of literature. Bilbo Baggins is a character of many possibilities, he grows throughout the entire novel, from a homebody to a well-known hero. To read any of J.R.R. Tolkien's works, is an adventure within itself, for each of his books are connected. His talent for story-telling along with his creative nature have pieced together &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, a story, later followed by &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; series.This 272 page novel tells an interesting tale of a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, and a journey with his dwarven friends. Bilbo knows very little of the outside world, he has lived in the same area for over 50 years. As the reader should notice as the book progresses, Mr. Baggins is taking steps. Bilbo is slowly transforming from an quiet nobody, to a humble hero.I am rating this novel a 5 out of 5, because I found nothing that I disliked. The great plot, pleasant characters, and the fascinating adventure, each play their parts and keep the reader locked."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"honestly, havent finished the book yet... im halfway done but having read half of the work, i can already say how good the book is and i have already become a big fan of tolkien, and it encouraged me to read more of his works... so rare can one see a book as good as this..."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"During the course of our English Independent Reading Project, I have read the book, The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien. It is a fantasy story about a group of dwarves, Thorin Oakenshield, and Bilbo Baggins that must journey to the Lonely Mountain to reclaim the land of the dwarves. The group must be very courageous to overcome the dangers of their trip as they encounter goblins, trolls, and giant spiders. It is the teamwork and courage that finally gets them to Smaug, the great golden-red fire dragon, who is terrorizing the entire countryside.In The Hobbit, Smaug is controlling the land of the dwarves, finally the dwarves decided to take back their land and restore their homeland. They needed a little help, Gandalf had decided Bilbo Baggins was the perfect hobbit for the job, he would be the thief. Bilbo Baggins was a quiet peaceful little hobbit. All he wanted was to be left alone to his beautiful hobbit hole where he could eat lots of meals and smoke his pipe. Bilbo heard a knock on the door and before long he had thirteen dwarves and one wizard sitting at his table and eating all his food, it was then, without a choice, that Bilbo was the final man for the trip. As the journey started it seemed so simple because the great wizard, Gandalf was along. As soon as they were left to travel alone, they got themselves in a bit of trouble. They worked together to find their way and save each other from dangers. They met trolls who wanted to eat them, goblins who ate their horses and wanted them dead. Giant spiders that wrapped them up in a web so fast that only Bilbo had enough courage to fight them off. It was also Bilbo alone that had to confront the great dragon Smaug, the terror of the countryside.As expected, there is a lot of action that goes on in The Hobbit-such as when giant spiders became very angry because they could not see Bilbo, due to the ring, but could hear him making fun of them, calling the spiders \\"attercops\\". Bilbo is fearful of these spiders but he still finds the courage to sing \\"Old fat spider spinning in a tree! Old fat spider can't see me! Attercop! Attercop! Won't you stop, stop you spinning and look for me?\\" Bilbo found himself running around being chased, singing songs to get the spiders away from the dwarves, who are hanging on a limb of a tree from a web, cutting down the webs that the spiders are wrapping around the trees to trap Bilbo in, and killing these spiders all at the same time. Practically all the spiders in the place came after him: some dropped to the ground, others raced along the branches, swung from tree to tree, or cast new ropes across dark spaces. Not only that, but as soon as Bilbo had managed to cut down one of the dwarves, who at this point is very weak, the dwarf uses the rest of his strength to help get the others and stop the spiders. The Hobbit uses great detail. J.R.R. Tolkien really knew how to explain action seens so that a person could visually imagine them, probably almost to what the author wanted them to be portrayed as. Tolkien, gets you right into the story in the first chapter, introducing main characters and explaining the conflict. Tolkien starts his action off simple, with a confrontation with trolls, and ends with big action, like the big fight with Smaug. I believe that while Tolkien is wrote these fantasies, he somewhat relates the ideas of these actions to his life, real life. The Hobbit is a book that really kept my attention, so much was always happening and I didn't want to put the book away.You can see as you read this book, Tolkien wanted the courage of man to stick out, that bravery can get you very far. Don't hold back even is the fear is killing you. Work as a team and never leave anyone behind. Bringing peace and security will be your ultimate reward."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a fascinating adventure tale about wizards, elves, dwarves, dragons, and many other fantasized creatures. Burrowed inside a hill, deep within Hobbiton, lives a particularly interestesting hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. Being the jolly little hobbit that he is, Bilbo enjoys his peaceful life in the Shire until he is summoned by the old wizard, Gandalf, to go on an adventure across the lands. Bilbo accepts this adventure and sets out into the unknown on a quest for gold and riches. On his quest through the land, curious young Bilbo encounters many new things that are foreign to the Shire and life as he has known it. Traveling over the lands to strange towns, treacherous mountains, and dangerous forests the hobbit gains possession of a magic ring that he uses to his advantage on this journey for fortune.This novel has been acclaimed a classic through generations for over the past 60 years. The Hobbit is an adventurous book about strange lands from long ago in a time when things were very different than they are today. The book is sometimes a little hard to follow with its elfish dialect and some tongue twisting sentences, but it is nothing a couple of read-through's can't fix. You may hit some boring drawn-out scenes, but stick with it. Once you are into the heart of the story, you will find it hard to put down. If you have a vivid imagination and an interest in fantasy, than this book will become a classic favorite of yours too."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"You can not put this book down! For there is a lot of action and a favorite wizard Gandalf. You know from the movie &quot;Lord of the Rings.&quot;Well I give The Hobbit four stars out of five. My reasoning for this is because some parts get dall and you can't wait untile it is over; but then agian some parts you can not put this book down because of all the action.The Hobbit is like a spin off of the book &quot;The Lord of the Rings,&quot; because it has Bilbo Baggins going on this crazy adventure with the dwarfs to get reveng on a dragon. On the way to persue the dragon they have absocales to face in which caves to exploer and such. Well I enjoyed The Hobbitand if you pick it up and read it am sure you will like it too."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The book called\\"The Hobbit,\\" is a well written mythical adventure story filled with amazing detail, but it may not be for everyone. It is definately for people who can get deep into fantasy and like to use their imagination. It is the stunning prequel to the Lord of the Ring trilogy and an excellent book that can be used as an introduction to the world of middle earth. This is the story where it all began. Mr. Bilbo Baggins strikes out with his dwarves companions on a mission to retrieve dwarvish gold from the evil dragon Smaug. Along the way, they encounter more than their fair share of adventure, which includes Beron the Bear-Man, Gandolf, elves, trolls and even giant spiders. Not only is this book by istelf a good book, it it will also help you understand the trilogy better. It helps to explain how a simple Hobbit is transformed from a shy non adventurous person to someone who fights goblis, trolls and dragons. It also helps to explain how this shy Hobbit comes in contact with the dreaded ring of power. If you are a lover of adventure, travel, mystery and magic, I strongly suggest that you read J.R.R. Tolkien's, \\"The Hobbit\\". You can go on many great adventures, cross mountains over the lush lands of Rivendell, and the dark forest of Mirkwood. J.R.R. Tolkien creates vivid pictures that make everything seem so real. You can imagine yourself anywhere the author puts you. If you have read the Lord of the Ring series, but haven't read \\"The Hobbit\\", I would strongly recommend this book. Even if you have only seen the movies, this book will help the whole series come to life."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"In a hole in the ground, there lived a Hobbit . . .\\"To explore imaginary worlds and have adventures with the inhabitants, Tolkien's \\"The Hobbit\\", a novel filled with the author's imagination, is the one to read. Published in the 1930s, this novel is still loved by many readers and is known throughout the world, and its sequals, which are the Lord of the Rings trilogy, are famous as well. They were read during a time before \\"Harry Potter\\".Using his love of languages and cultures, John Ronald Ruel Tolkien created a world of his own, where the cultures of imaginary/mythical creatures, such as Dwarfs, Elves and Dragons, live in. In this book, we journey through the land of Middle Earth, and there, we are introduced to Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit, or, in other words, a halfling, a little man, smaller than Dwarfs and humans and lacking a complete beard.In the land of Middle Earth, the Dwarf, Thorin Oakenshield, is determined to recover his ancestor's treaures, which now lay in the hands of the Dragon, Smaug, a fearsome and evil creature. Yet Thorin is willing to go there. So he asks help from Gandalf the Grey wizard and the other Dwarfs, who venture into forests, fields, rivers, and mountains, getting caught by trolls and any other creepy creature. But Thorin is not the hero of this story . . .During the times of trouble in the book, there comes surprise help. During times of hardship, they learn patience and persistance. And on a mission like this, there comes the MOST unexpected idea for a hero!Filled with imagination and heart warming characters, The Hobbit is novel of epic proportions, and is one that your family will enjoy! With memorable scenes, you can laugh, especially when Bilbo picks on a troll's pocket. You can fell the humor as the as he faces Smaug, the action when the Elves battle the feared dragon, and in the end, you'll have sweet dreams after bedtime.

Not sure I ever read it as a young adult. Read in a few days so a fast read."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"What has always impressed me about Tolkien is the attention to detail he puts into his work, and The Hobbit is no exception. You almost get the feeling that there really is a 'Middle Earth' out there somewhere.The saying \\"out of the frying-pan and into the fire\\" comes to mind when I describe The Hobbit to you, because this is a very fast-paced story, though not in the sense that the book is made of one epic battle scene after another. The plot spans over about a year, but the journeying itself is described sparingly while their (often dangerous) encounters with monsters and other races are described in great detail. The downside to this was that the climax seemed a bit rushed,but I enjoyed it nonetheless.The narration is old-fashioned, yet perfectly understandable. It reminded me of my middle grade teacher who used to read out loud to us in class. Sometimes the narrator speaks directly to the reader by commenting on the current happening in the book and it made me feel as if the narrator was letting me in on a secret of his by sharing the story to me.I really liked that Bilbo was, ironically, a very unenthusiastic participant in his own adventure. Though his almost dormant Took family genes, who are known for their odd adventurousness, is what in the end makes Bilbo accept his job as \\"The Burglar, \\" I'd dare say he is pretty much dragged into the whole thing. Tolkien uses a simple but effective way to show the great character development that Bilbo makes throughout the story by comparing the two sides of his heritage to each other. When he starts out, Bilbo sees himself as a hundred percent 'Baggins', a respectful and proper hobbit, but later comes to acknowledge that there might be a bit of the adventurous Took in him after all.There are thirteen dwarves (and a wizard) that Bilbo travels with, a number which I found a bit unnecessary. I think that Tolkien could have used half the number of dwarves and it would still have made the same story. Overflow of dwarves aside, I really enjoyed reading The book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I finally got around to reading this book. Its been on my list for years now.

We sit down in the living room and proceed to get projected into the world of Bilbo and his friends. The kids always want to know what will happen next when I completed on chapter. Unfortunately for them, my throat is dry by that time and I think that keeping the suspense is perfect because they look forward about our time together to discover the adventures the characters are living.This book is definitively a classic. I remember reading it in French when I was younger. I enjoyed it and was looking forward to read it again. However, this time I am reading it in English and with my kids. Deep down I hope and pray that this book will become a classic that they will re-read again in the future. Knowing that the movie is coming up, my oldest son keeps telling me that he wants to see the movie. I think we will start with the Lord of the Rings which we have already at home. The Hobbit is the prequel of the series The Lord of the Rings.I highly recommend this book to everyone. If you have never read it, you have to discover this story.

Tolkien, &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is the first of a series of books that constitute Tolkien's legacy, one which, like many other literary masterpieces, has stood the test of time. The hobbit of the story, Bilbo Baggins, is forced to face his destiny by the wizard Gandalf; one that gradually gains him the respect of his companions (thirteen dwarves, along with the wizard) and many other characters in a year-long adventure through the dangers of facing the meanest creatures and walking through the most adverse places.Ultimately, the tapestry of events which Tolkien brilliantly weaves around Bilbo and his friends confront him with Smaug, the terrible dragon who has long seized the dwarves' treasure. Only the combination of luck, intelligence and a courage which he never thought he had, help Bilbo to sort through all he's faced with to come out as a better being, one that can see beyond the blindness that greed brings into smaller spirits (not necessarily because it affects dwarves more than it affects others in the story). It is there where the true greatness and universal character of the story lies.The best thing about Tolkien's fantasy books is that you can relate to them in so many ways that they no longer seem so distant from what could actually occur to you."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is the perfect fantasy book for readers! It has just about all you need to look for: A strong plot with smatterings of suspense, adventure, and mystery, wonderful characters described so well you can almost hear them talking, and a map at the beginning so you can track the journeys of the characters. The plot is this: Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit, is visited one day by Gandalf, a roving wizard. Although Bilbo insists he does NOT want the adventure Gandalf offers, Gandalf decides that Bilbo is perfect for the job, and brings along thirteen dwarves when next he comes to call. The dwarves are going to go off and reclaim their stolen home(and treasure) from a dragon named Smaug. They set off the very day after their visit at Bilbo's, with Bilbo a nervous and reluctant member of their party. Although Bilbo often wishes to be at home with the kettle singing for tea, he gets none of it as he witnesses Gandalf outsmarting trolls, gets taken down to Goblin Town in the bowels of the Misty Mountains, finds a powerful Ring that makes the wearer invisible, and has to fight giant spiders to save the dwarves. Eventually, all the dwarves are captives of the Mirkwood elves, and Bilbo is trapped inside their castle, always wearing the Ring to avoid discovery. He eventually rescues the dwarves in an ingenious plan: floating them down to the Dragon's mountain in empty barrels discarded by the Mirkwood elves. Bilbo and the dwarves are received ecstatically by the residents of a lake town near the mountain, but soon after Bilbo's birthday they are off to the mountain. Bilbo gets them all inside with a vital clue provided earlier, and drives the dragon nearly mad with frustration. The dragon is eventually slain by a lake townman, who convinces his townsfolk that the treasure is now rightfully theirs. This leads up to a climactic battle of five armies. This is a marvelous book for anyone who needs an escape from life's dreariness. I would recommend it to anyone who is old enough to read."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Surely, it's been scientifically verified that anyone who gives The Hobbit (and the rest of the series) ONE measly star is, simply, wrong. Tolkien's Middle Earth is rich and perfectly self-contained. He never violates the parameters he establishes for this fantasy world, which he fills with memorable characters and intriquing plot turns. What great escapist literature! I only hope you students who've expressed disdain for this book will later reconsider, and give it another reading. I suspect the circumstances (required reading, homework assignments) may have had more to do with your negative regard for the book than any shortcoming in the storytelling. Consider the (almost) universal positive regard for Tolkien's work. Sometimes the hype is warranted."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I'm looking for reviews of the audiobook. AMAZON, Whazzup? These are all reviews for the book, actually for several different versions of the book. Not very helpful!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I am a Dad who just finished reading this book aloud to my 10-year-old daughter. We took our time and read a little bit each night so it took a couple of months to get through it, because we didn't read every night because of homework and other stuff. Anyway, to cut a long story short, I had lots of time to think about what the book is about. My strongest feeling about this book is that it taught me about how every common person could be a hero. Bilbo is just a common hobbit, but he did some amazing heroic things. Stop and think of his bravery: with the trolls; the Wargs; the spiders in Mirkwood; the dragon. I mean, he is best buds with a wizard for goodness sake! The other important thing to notice is how Bilbo \\"stepped out of the way\\" during the great war that ended the book. Events of the day got too large for Bilbo, so Tolkein gave him a back seat while all the troubles of Middle Earth were solved by Bard, Dain, the Elvenking, the Great Eagle, and the other big boys. This does not diminish Bilbo's accomplishments, he is still a fantastic hero. A true hero does not have to solve all the world's problems. A true hero steps up to the plate when he is called upon, and gets the job done. And that is just what Bilbo did."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a book centered on Bilbo Baggins, the hobbit who is briefly seen in 'The Fellowship of the Ring' and 'The Return of the King'. Here is the main storyline:Bilbo is living quietly in his hobbithole when Gandalf and thirteen dwarves whisk him away and engage him to travel with them on a journey to the Lonely Mountain to recover the lost treasure of Thorin Oakenshield, the son of Thrain, King Under the Mountain, which has been stolen by a dangerous dragon named Smaug. The fifteen of them hike all the way to the Misty Mountains when they are waylaid by the goblins. While trying to escape from them Bibo gets lost and manages to escape Gollum with a ring that makes whoever wears it invisible(the Ruling Ring in the Lord of the Rings). Then the dwarves and Bilbo journey into the forest of Mirkwood(Gandalf is away, saying that he has some other buisiness to attend to) and there they escape capture by some gigantic, talking spiders and the Elvenking, all by the help of Bilbo's brain and his Ring. Then they finally get to the Lonely Mountain, Mr. Baggins has a few talks with Smaug, then the dragon gets killed(I am not going to say why, for people who dont enjoy spoilers), a few arguments start, and the Battle of Five Armies(Elves, Men and Dwarves vs Goblins and Wargs) takes place. Then Bibo travells with Gandalf back to his hobbithole, and there he lives Happily Ever After(cough, cough).There were more punch lines and funny bits in the Hobbit than in LOTR, which makes sense, because the Hobbit was written by Tolkien as a \\"children's book\\". Still, I really enjoyed the book, and I also liked the personality of Bilbo turning from comfort-loving, adventure-shunning Shire Hobbit to a brave, (some extremely smart)plan-brewing, and rich Hobbit. Also, the book sort of explains how Bilbo got the Ring in a fun way.Which all explains how The Hobbit got five stars, in my opinion:)"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit is the beginning of the stories of that race of halflings which is continued in The Lord of the Rings trilogy. It begins when Galdalf the Grey visits Bilbo Baggins' home, Bag End, followed within minutes by a company of dwarves. Surprised to find that they have come to include him in their trek to the lair of Smaug, a dangerous dragon, Bilbo at first declines the honor. After all, Hobbits never go on adventures.However, Gandalf has chosen well. Bilbo at last agrees to accompany the dwarves, in itself a most unusual circumstance. But it is not an easy trek they have chosen to undertake. Thirst, starvation, capture, and death await them at every turn. The most dangerous item encountered, however, is a simple gold ring which has not seen the light of day for many years. What will be the price if Bilbo liberates the ring?With The Lord of the Rings movies now being released, this is a wonderful time to revisit the beginning of the Baggins family adventures. For those who have never read Tolkien, his style may be difficult at first. The difficulty of the names may seem daunting. But once readers begin, these will not seem to be barriers. And, like most of those who have read and loved the Hobbits, they will return again and again.All fantasy readers should enjoy both The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, as they were the stories on which much modern fantasy is based. There are also numerous books, such as bestiaries and encyclopedias, which add to the experience."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"this is a great book. i say *is* because i havn\`t finished it yet. but what i have read is great.descriptions of the scenery are remarkably vivid, and you get to know the character\`s personality traits. if you want to read an excellent fantasy/adventure story, buy the book!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I also just read The Hobbit for schools. On the surface, it's a very simple, lighthearted, uncomplicated fairy tale, which is a large part of its charm. I guess when you look deeper (as many have failed to do) you will realize that it's more complex and imaginitive than it seems. A couple of lulls, but otherwise very engrossing and exciting in many places. I would like to read The Lord of the Rings trilogy now and I really hope they're just as good.To the people who saw similarities to C.S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia, here's something you might want to know: Lewis and Tolkien were freinds. They met often to read and discus their stories. Everyone says that their stories have deeper, Christian meanings.

Firstly, do not read this book if you're a jaded individual with an inability or unwillingness to appreciate an innocent and charming tale. Secondly, stay away from it if you're a hardcore fantasy reader who began with more modern writers. You'll likely be disapointed (conversely, if you don't generally care for fantasy, you may just love this book, as I did). Finally, don't even attempt to read it if you consider the TV Guide listings to be a challenging read with a complex plot and too many characters.

If you are having a hard time understanding this book, the reason is not that it is poorly written. The reason you are having a hard time understanding it is that you haven't been hitting the books hard enough at school. I first read this book in the 5th grade. I completed reading the Lord of the Rings trilogy by the beginning of the 7th grade. I had no problem at all understanding them. When I didn't know a word, I looked it up in my dictionary. If you are having a hard time now, I feel sorry for you. Do you realize how difficult it will be to get a college education if you are years behind in your reading ability?

I was utterly enrapt from the first page. Enthralled by the sheer genious and subtley of the novel I was compelled to salvage any vacant time by filling it with the adventures of what at first seemed and inapt hero. The sublimity and profound metaphorical meaning are woven with perilous happenings to create a tapesty comperable to such literary feats as a Tale of Two Cities and Siddhartha. I thought it impossible for a writer to render me so unable to set a book down as much as Dumas until I read Tolkien. I never would have believed this novel to be so meaningful before. This book truly astounded me and I, who was so reluctant to even try fantasy, was close to tears when I finished the book and will treat fantasy with alacrity where it was once met with scorn. If you have not read this book I adamently reccomend it to you even if this not your preffered genre."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is the best, it's even better than The Lord of the Ring (I know alot of people will hate me for saying that, but it's true).

This is because it has a depth that is unusual in a story aimed for kids.This story has humor and great characters and fantastic descriptions...it is simply put, great."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"When placed neatly beside The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, The Hobbit is usually given the precursor of \\"Introduction\\", as if it served no more purpose then to introduce us to critical characters of the upcoming trilogy as well as Middle-Earth itself. When film versions are made of Tolkein's masterpiece, The Hobbit is usually looked over in lieu of a brief summary during the prologue, feeling the only necessary element involved with The Hobbit is the meeting of Bilbo and Gollum and the eventual acquisition of The Ring of Power. This is a sad reality indeed for one of the single greatest fantasy stories ever written.The Hobbit: Or There And Back Again, takes place in the wonderful land of Middle-Earth, created in the imagination of J.R.R. Tolkien. Tolkien doesn't just create a world, but a history, a culture, and an entire new society and existence. Behind every rock lays a story one hundred years old, and the summits of every mountain are steeped in histroy and myth.The story itself begins with the meeting of Bilbo Baggins and the great wizard Gandalf Stormcrow (The Grey). Bilbo is a Hobbit, halflings with hairy feet, great appetites, and wonderful natures, completely against adventuring of any kind. Gandalf, one of the most powerful wizards in all of Middle-Earth, knows quite a deal about Hobbits and has an underlying belief that the creatures will play some role in the unraveling story of Middle-Earth, though he doesn't say as much here. He chooses Bilbo, much to the Hobbit's protest, to accompany a group of Dwarves on a mission to steal back some of their gold, which has been gaurded by the dreadful claws of Smaug, a deadly Dragon who slew their kin and destroyed their home years before. Though Bilbo finds himself in quite an amount of trouble early on, he eventually confirms Gandalf's belief in not only him, but the importance that Hobbits will have in the future as is seen in the terrific \\"Riddles In The Dark\\", where Bilbo meets Gollum and acquires The Ring.Though many dismiss The Hobbit as simply an introduction to The Lord of the Rings, don't allow yourself to fall into that trap. The Hobbit is an absolutely magical story of adventure, hope, and dreams which winds from the quiet hills of the shire, through the dark foliage of Mirkwood, all the way to the haunted ruins of Lonely Mountain and an encounter with Smaug and a war to end all wars. It is a must read for anyone who wishes to call themself a fantasy fan."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is an excellent prelude to the Lord of the Rings. Bilbo Baggins sets out on an adventure with Gandalf the Grey and a band of homeless Dwarves, to the Lonely Mountains to retake the dwarves' home and confront Smaug (a dragon). Bilbo had to fight evil orcs, salvage wolves, giant spiders, and gollum. He found a ring that could make him invisible. When they got to the lonely Mountains Bilbo, Gandalf, and the dwarves could find the entrance to the Dwarves home. Then after days of camping out they Bilbo saw the little tiny keyhole of the door. Bilbo went in alone and he talked to Smaug. Bilbo ran out because Smaug was trying to chase him. Smaug came out of the shaft and the dwarves, Bilbo, and Gandalf went in, but the key was outside. They had to get out through the front entrance. After days of walking in the place they came to the front entrance. The people of Laketown saw a small flicker of light. It was Smaug. The people cut the bridges to the town. Bilbo told a bird to tell an archer at Laketown to shoot at Smaug's left breast because it was open. The archer shot his best arrow and it went through Smaug. That was the end of Smaug. The elves and men learned of Smaug's death. They came to the Lonely Mountains to take the treasure, but the Goblins came also. The elves, men, and dwarves allied to fight the Goblins. A stone that hit his head knocked out Bilbo. When Bilbo wakes up he finds out that they have won, but some of the dwarves were wounded. Thorin, the leader of the dwarves was wounded and later died. Bilbo returned to his home and told the other hobbits about his adventure.I recommend this book for others to read because it is an interesting, adventurous, and great book to read. A moral from the story is to never give up and face your enemies. It also teaches you courage. Once you start reading this book you will probably keep reading to the end.My favorite part of this book is when the Laketown people were fighting Smaug. That's my favorite part because it has a lot of action. It tells how fierce a dragon could be."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I received my copy of The Hobbit from my ex, Lee.

It contains heroes, hardships and good vs. evil, which is were the 2 stars come from. I don't recommend it. While I was reading I had to make myself sit down and read. It wasn't enjoyable like reading should be.This fantasy story is about a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins who didn't like to be bothered. One day the wizard Gandalph and about 14 homeless dwarfs come visit him in his quiet little hobbit hole. They changed everything. He is soon pulled into their quest of fighting goblins, spiders, evil orcs, and wolves in hope of finding the treasure that the great dragon Smaug protects.Most of the book is dull and tiresome. In my opinion you could skip 5 pages every now and then and not miss a thing. For instance, Tolkien uses 24 pages to express what happened when the dwarfs first met Bilbo, when all that was needed was about 8. He wasted about 100 pages total in the book which has 304 pages.Although The Hobbit is a bit slow, it shows the never-ending battle between good and evil. Tolkien portrays this well. When Bilbo comes face to face with evil he uses poems and riddles, which are challenging to figure out.The Hobbit also has a worthy plot of heroes and hardships. This can relate to other books such as the Harry Potter series and Homer's Poem about Ulysses. Bilbo is said to be a hero many times when he is faced with a challenge. One of the dwarfs complain \\"I'm just going to lie here and sleep and dream of food, if I can not get it any other way...\\" They had many hardships such as food, shelter, and ways of transportation.All in all, i would not reccomend this book. Even though it has a few good qualities such as heroes, hardships, and the relationship between good and evil, it is still boring and dull. It only deserved 2 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"A story that will leave you speechless.Bilbo Baggins will make you beleve in magic again.

They want to reclaim the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar, even though Bilbo has never burgled in his life.So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable -- and dangerous -- adventure. The quirky little band ends up battling goblins and spiders, nearly getting eaten, and imprisoned by Elves, while Bilbo finds himself in possession of a magic Ring from the treacherous Gollum. But even with a magic Ring, can he defeat a monstrous dragon and win a war against multiple enemies?Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and ancient Men for years before he ever came up with Bilbo's quest. But it's fortunately that he did, because while \\"The Hobbit\\" is overshadowed by the epic sweep of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and the \\"Silmarillion,\\" it's still an entertaining story that lays the groundwork for his more famous works -- especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.Tolkien's writing is swift, light and full of songs and poetry-laden descriptions, such as interludes in the shimmering, ethereal Rivendell and the cold, terrible Lonely Mountain. The pace in this is much faster than in most of his other works -- not surprising, when you consider it was originally a bedtime story for his children.Most of the book's action is about Bilbo trying to keep himself and the dwarves from getting eaten, torn apart, or rotting in elf dungeons, but with some quiet interludes like a night at Beorn's mountain home. And the last chapters hint at the epic majesty that Tolkien was capable of, as well as the idea that even little people -- like a mild-mannered hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.This book also first came up with hobbits -- the peaceful fuzzy-footed countryfolk -- in the form of Bilbo Baggins. He's a likable little guy, if the last person you'd ever expect to be a hero -- initially he seems weak and kind of boring, but his hidden strengths and wits come up to the surface when he needs to. By the end, he's almost a different person.The dwarves are more comical, and the elves more whimsical in this book, but the supporting characters are still impressive -- the crotchety, mysterious wizard Gandalf, the dignified, flawed Dwarf king Thorin Oakenshield, and a Guardsman who becomes a king. Even minor characters like Beorn, Elrond and the menacing Smaug are given plenty of dimension.\\"The Hobbit\\" started as a fluke, grew into a bedtime story, and became one of the best fantasy stories in literary history -- a charming adventure in the time that never was.

For example, where did Bilbo find the ring? Well you're questions will be answered when you read the Hobbit. This is the exciting prequel to the Lord of the Rings. We meet Bilbo Baggins a hobbit who is thrust into an adventure with a band of dwarves and the wizard Gandalf. Gnadalf tells the dwarves that Bilbo is an excellent thief and so he must go on this journey. The dwarves seek the treasure that was stolen by the dragon Smaug. The dwarves are led by Thorin Oakenshield. Along the way they meet trolls, goblins, elves, and the dragon Smaug. This is the first book where Gollum is first introduced and where Bilbo finds the ring and uses it. This book is a masterpiece that draws you in to every battle and makes you believe you are part of the story. If you loved the Lord of the Rings you will certainly love every action paked page of the Hobbit. Tolkien has proven once again that he is the master of Middle-Earth."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a great book. My mother used to read this book to me as a child, and I also used to watch the cartoon almost everyday. I recently picked up a copy of this book just to read for fun and I loved it as much as I always have.\\"The Hobbit\\" is about Bilbo Baggins of the shire. One day he is disrupted by a band of dirty dwarves and the famous wizard Gandolf. This band is looking for a burglur to travel with them to reclaim the dwarves old kingdom and fortune from the dragon Smaug.Chapter by Chapter find Bilbo and his band of Dwarves facing a new problem. It is in this book that The one ring that rules all, or the ring of power is found by Bilbo, and starts the wonderful story of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". This book is wonderful. Do not pass it up.Do keep in mind before reading this book though, that Tolkien wrote this as a book for children. There is a lot of singing and whatnot in here that can get a little annoying at times. But other than that it is a good story. The plot is very uncomplicated, as it should be for children, but dont let this turn you away. I would highly advise this book before you dive into the Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This novel itself is one of the greatest works in the fantasy realm to date.

It contains many illustrations in the book which make it that much nicer."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I've already whined about not being able to give six stars out of five to \\"A Christmas Carol\\", given how much better it is than other books that I've rated five stars; given that this book is better than that one, (or at least, more fun, anyway) can I rate this one seven stars?Seriously, this book is one of the most enjoyable stories ever told. With all the attention that the new movie series is bringing to Tolkien's writings, there is a resurgence of interest in the \\"Lord of the Rings\\", but a great many of the newfound fans are failing to start with \\"The Hobbit\\", and this is a mistake; this book is a great deal easier to get into than \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", and once you're read this one, you'll likely find it much easier to enjoy that one.Granted, there are people who like \\"Lord of the Rings\\", but aren't fond of this book because they feel patronized by the easy, \\"children's book\\" writing style. If you don't enjoy \\"\\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" or C.S. Lewis's \\"Narnia\\" series (and if what you object to in the \\"Narnia\\" series is the writing style, rather than the blatant Christian symbolism) then you may not care for this book. If, on the other hand, you enjoy an occasional romp in a light-hearted style that still has serious plot, characterization, and deeper meanings, rather than insisting that all of your literature act its age and take itself (and the world) seriously, there are few books more enjoyable than this one."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit, by J.R.R. Tolkien, is mediocre at best. A hobbit of the shire named Bilbo Baggins, is sent on a quest by the Maiar Gandalf the Grey to help a group of Dwarves led by Thorin Oakenshield in order to defeat Smaug the Dragon. This book is incredibly well-written, however, I find the story to be very stale and ordinary. I recommend this book as a prelude to the incredible Lord of the Rings saga and the Silmarillion. Another good series is George R.R. Martin's &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot;."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I would recommend this book to kids, Elementary kids for the most part because it might be too childish for grown ups, yet to hard to understand for someone whos just too young. I found this book to be interesting; it kept me reading it and turning the pages. I thought the ending could have been alittle better because it was just too simple for the complexity of the book. Smog seemed to be a big force with a huge wrath but he was killed easily do to the lack of diamonds over the one part of his body that is the most vulnerable, his heart. I think there should have been a big war lasting days, carrying the drama out longer. This book was a bit slow in the middle and beginning but picked up at latter until the disappointing end.

This story tells of the hardships they encounter on their journey and the changes that each character, especially Bilbo, goes through. this book is wonderful because it ties in the world of fantasy with real life. The characters go through the same emotional and sometimes physical struggles that we find ourselves going through. The Hobbit is a great book that everybody can relate to in one way or another.

He, of course refuses, but after some thought about the possibility of the good outcome, he finally (but still somewhat reluctantly) agrees. The great dragon Smaug has been terrorizing the country and must be destroyed before his work of death can go any farther. Bilbo and the Dwarves go off to destroy this abomination. They are soon swept up in a quest filled with evil orcs, giant spiders, and much worse hidden dangers. Although Tolkien does well in describing the settings and characters, he doesn't really do too well with his action. Some authors, such as C.S. Lewis or J.K. Rowling, have the ability to create the sweeping kind of action that seems to just bring you along and keep you reading whether you like the story or not. J.R.R. Tolkien doesn't, no matter what you say. At the beginnning of the story, he seems to just drone on and on until by the time he's gotten to the point, you forget what he's really trying to say. Of course he does well in his description, but there is too much. And he does great while writing about the action areas, but afterwards it returns to that bleak nothingness of words that never catches your interest. J.R.R. Tolkien has created a work of art writing this book, but he fails at keeping the reader glued to the pages like some authors can."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I love the book,and sent it to my wife as a gift, but since it won'y display on her Fire, I have to give it one star.

Very very silly and why exactly did he have to be in this grand adventure that Gandalf insisted he be in. Nothing about Bilbo appealed to me and I absolutely found the style way to dry and dull to the point where I had to stop reading it for awhile just to get a refreshed feeling.The only part that was slightly good was with Gollum but I found a lot of the ways that Bilbo solved the riddles so really pathetic that I wondered what the point was.

Bilbo and company would get themselves in trouble, and the solutions and the ways they got out of seemingly overwhelming circumstances were&#65533; laughable at best. Trolls get turned to stone by the coming of dawn, giant spiders easily abandon their prey at the sound of a taunt, and even the dragon proves to be less than fierce. Very silly indeed. The writing style was incredibly repetitive! If I had to read, one more time that &#65533;Bilbo wished he was back in his hobbit hole&#65533; and not for the last time!&#65533; I would have had it. As it was, the repetition was really trying my patience. Also, the first person narrator bothered me. Who WAS this person? If he constantly refers to himself as &#65533;I&#65533;, then he should make it clear who he is, and how he knows all about the hobbit&#65533;s adventures! Even the storyline was incredibly linear and predictable.

I am a huge fan of The Lord of the Rings not only because of the intricate plot and the plethora of characters but also the stylized writing and the \\"invention\\" of a \\"language\\" with its relevant syntax and the fantastic, garagantuan history of all the characters.Where LOTR has all this and more to offer, The Hobbit comes across as a badly written tale with no sense of pace or plot. It is the most abyssmal plodding reading possible! I can't imagine the audience for whom the book was written-is it children? ... because it is terribly juvenile and silly [but definitely not in an enjoyable way-mostly annoying and idiosyncratic]...but if the target audience IS children, the stylized writing and archaic use of English completely upsets that purpose! And it can most definitely not be for an adult audience for it has nothing to offer to the current generation of fantasy readers.If you haven't read it and are thinking of buying it-my suggestion would be that you don't!And btw the foreword and backpage comments from famous authors mention that it is an exercise in \\"escapism\\" which is what the fantasy genre was called back when the book was written...please spare yourself. If you have children, please buy them Artemis Fowl or Pendragon or any of the Issac Assimov books. If you read fasntasy for your own pleasure-ditto. But then again LOTR is an undisputed masterpiece.

Bilbo's quest to find the dragon guarded treasure stolen from the lost kingdom of the dwarves in the Misty Mauntain along with a band of dwarves wanting to rebuild this kingdom is very excitting though overall this book is not as dark and dangerous as the LOTR trilogy.

It was for school. He liked it very much.....I will be reading it soon since it is on my kindle also."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I must preface this review by saying that I do not usually like fiction. I am primarily a theologian. But I loved The Hobbit.With the announcement that Tolkien's great prequel to the Lord of the Rings Trilogy will soon be made into a movie trilogy of its own right, I thought it was time to delve into this classic adventure myself. I am so glad that I did.Let's start with character development. Bilbo Baggins and Gandalf the Wizard are two of the best characters Tolkien has ever created. (And he has created hundreds!) In The Hobbit, we learn to trust each of them. Bilbo emerges as a reluctant yet heroic protagonist. He is hesitant, traditional, mannered, quick-witted, and yet shockingly courageous. This despite his diminutive stature! Drawn into an adventure larger than life--to recapture dwarvish treasure held captive by a murderous dragon--Biblo shows himself over and over again to be the most reliable compatriot of the band.Gandalf on the other hand is Biblo's perfect compliment. He is strong, indomitable, larger than life, and yet flighty and preoccupied. He swoops in at just the right moments to rescue the would-be treasure hunters. In chapter five (revised in later editions) we also meet the grotesque Gollum, bent helplessly inward by the ring's debilitating powers. The repartee between Bilbo and Gollum while the ring's fate stands on the line is deeply memorable. We only learn later that all of Middle Earth hangs also in the balance of this test of wits between the deformed Gollum and the sharp-tongued hobbit.In terms of visual drama and setting, Tolkien in unmatched. He is able to create vast worlds that seem both familiar and impossible to the reader. Throughout his works, the Shire, the Misty Mountains, the Mines of Moria, Esgaroth, and Mirwood are described with vivid imagery. Tolkien creates a world that can both enrapture and repulse his readers. Few fictional writers can create and balance such elaborate settings as Tolkien does. (Thankfully, the movies have not let us down in portraying these stunning worlds).Most readers will be not surprised to note that The Hobbit (like The Lord of the Rings series) contains a substantial amount of poetry. In Tolkien, this functions to create a timeless quality, blending Middle Earth's mythic age into current bends in the plot. The poetry often emerges in the form of dwarvish songs, assuring the reader that the characters themselves are captivated by myths and legends of their own. These poetic songs and tales are sometimes warning, and sometimes consoling the heroes along their path of destiny.The plot itself, primarily a dragon-slaying tale, never lags. In each successive chapter, Bilbo finds himself entrapped in another web (once literally!) that seems at first inescapable. Once Biblo and the dwarves--led by the overly confident Thorin Oakenshield--actually meet the dragon Smaug, the reader stands convinced that their gold-snatching feat will at last be impossible. Only the heroic resolve of a certain halfling will prove otherwise! But I won't spoil the tale for you here.The Hobbit ends exactly where the reader hopes it will all along: with a cataclysmic battle scene featuring all the forces of Middle Earth present. Men, elves, dwarves, wargs, gobblins, eagles, and one particularly irrepressible wizard all arm themselves for battle to the death for fame and fortune.No wonder this work is timeless!Matthew Everhard is the Senior Pastor of Faith Evangelical Presbyterian Church in Brooksville, Florida."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Through the use of voices the Hobbit comes to life.

Yes children can read this book and it is fun. How ever there is a lot more to this book than a cute story. And it has all the depth of the other Tolkien works with the exception of being shorter.Many people look at this story as a prequel to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", where in reality it is a stand-alone story with a perfectly good beginning, middle, and end. When you read \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" there is enough description to forgo \\"The Hobbit.\\" Personally, I find that reading The Lord of the Rings first gave me the in-depth background to better appreciate The Hobbit.Many of the creatures and adventures will put you on the edge of your seat. You will recognize the personalities and grow along will Bilbo as he faces new challenges as he learns to deal with life.A good book to read first would be \\"The Power of Myth\\" by Joseph Campbell.

Though it was not my introduction to fantasy, it was one of the first books of fantasy that I had read. Now, a couple decades later, I returned to the Hobbit in preparation for the movie coming out in December 2012.The story is straight forward. Bilbo Baggins, a respectable Hobbit living a respectable life, somehow finds himself part of an adventure. An adventure of all things! Adventures are not respectable. And yet somehow Bilbo is bamboozled into it. On the adventure Bilbo finds himself in the company of a wizard and 13 dwarves. Definitely not respectable company. This particular adventure involves trolls, endless roads, no chances for second breakfast, elves, men who turn into bears, goblins, more elves, and even a dragon. And of course, Gollum and a rather famous ring. Trying to write a review of this particular book without giving away spoilers is hard, but necessary. But you may be wondering what is the point of the adventure. Well now . . . the point of the quest is to reclaim the stolen dwarf treasure from the dragon, Smaug. If you've read the Lord of the Rings or watched the film adaptations then you probably know how things turn for Bilbo.The edition that I read was fantastic. It includes audio of J.R.R. Tolkien reading from select portions of the book. It also includes beautiful color illustrations. The book itself is short - a little over 300 pages -, but the memories that it will leave you with will last you a lifetime."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I've read this book atleast 25 times in my life, along with LOTR and all other J.R.R.

Thought it would on my new Fire HD yet, no.....kind of stupid. Yet, I've gone without audio forever so no biggie... but would be nice to hear Tolkien recite songs and passages."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"In a hole in the ground, there lived a hobbit.\\" Thus begins the most famous series in fantasy literature. For such a universe of high caliber, the sentence is a rather unassuming beginning for quite an unassuming, down-to-earth race known as Hobbits.Unfortunately \\"The Hobbit\\" has become overshadowed by \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", seen as an \\"enchanting prelude\\" to the more substantial sequel. C. S. Lewis said in \\"A Preface to Paradise Lost\\" that to accurately judge an item, you first must know its purpose. The books were written for different purposes - \\"The Hobbit\\" as an entertaining story for his children, and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", initially a seqeul to \\"The Hobbit\\", became much more a continuation of \\"The Silmarillion\\". For those who underestimate \\"The Hobbit\\" using the criteria of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" as their guide are missing out on a rich work.What are Hobbits, you may ask? If you go researching where Tolkien got inspiration for the Hobbits, you will soon get mixed up in \\"The Denham Tracks\\" (a 19th century list of various folk-lore creatures) and E. A. Wyke-Smith's \\"The Marvelous Land of the Snergs\\". Honestly, neither of these will get you very far.The Denham Tracks reads like a laundry list of folk-lore creatures, and though the actual word \\"hobbit\\" appears, there is no context for what a \\"hobbit\\" actually is. \\"The Marvelous Land of the Snergs\\" will get you a tad bit further. Snergs are creatures about half the height of man (like the Hobbits), enjoy their food (again, like the Hobbits), and there the resemblance ends. The World of the Snergs is far removed from Middle-earth, having more to do with 19th century adventure stories set in fantasy with such dispargant elements as a vegetation Troll (by far the best character in the book), witches, knights similiar to stories of King Arthur, ad a waylaid sea crew hailing from the ship [on the ship] \\"The Flying Dutchman\\"Tolkien certainly anticipated the question, for he answered this inquiry within the opening pages of this very book. They are a race two to four feet high, shy of \\"Big People\\", and have no beards, unlike dwarves. Hobbits are chubby, \\"dress in bright colours, (chiefly green and yellow)\\", and wear no shoes because of the hick tufts of hair and thick leathery soles of their feet. They eat as often as they can.The story of \\"The Hobbit\\" is well known, having been published in 1937 and continually in print (save only for a brief interruption in the early 1940s, when Great Britian were facing paper shortages due to World War II).\\"The Hobbit\\" began life as an entertaining story of Tolkien's children (as so many of Tolkien's stories began as well). Written between 1929-1933, the book details the adventures of Bilbo Baggins. Gandalf the Wizard meets with Bilbo in the opening pages, telling him he is looking for some \\"to go on an adventure\\". Bilbo, not quite as respectible as he would like to believe himself to be, tells Gandalf life was much more interesting when Gandalf was around, but no, he would not have any adventures, thank you very much. Naturally, thirteen dwarves show up, and ultimately Bilbo sets off to reclaim the gold that the Dragon Smaug has stolen from the dwarves. Like the later Aragorn, Thorin Oakenshield, the chief dwarf, is a king-in-exile, and wants to reclaim both his throne and his gold stolen by the dragon..The real meat of \\"The Hobbit\\", and one of the reasons why I believe the book has had such a long lasting appeal, is the book's transformation of Bilbo.\\"The Hobbit\\" shows the reader how an unassuming modern character ([for [all his]] though Bilbo lives in the far removed past, he is THOROUGHLY MODERN) goes from being an out-of-place bumbler in situations far removed from his life expereince to an equal among beings and races that belong only in the distant past [When - give examples of this]Although initially inept, Bilbo, just as Gandalf predicted, proves to be a worthwhile companion, coming through for the dwarves on several key occasions, such as freeing them from the Elven prisons, fighting back the spiders, and facing the dragon alone. He even eventually aids in bringing about a resolution to the growing distress between the Dwarves, Men, and Elves after the fallout of Smaug's demise (albeit, rather unconventionally, using the Arkenstone, the Heart of the Mountain and the jewel which Thorin prizes above all others). [the whole affair of ] This journey, this transformation of Bilbo into something more, something greater, is the true heart of the book. Tolkien himself said that he removed Gandalf from the story shortly after Beorn's house, due to the dramatic need for Bilbo to proove himself without assistance from the wizard. Fortunately, Tolkien was able to use Gandalf's absence as a springboard into more expansive story ideas when he began developing \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" after the unbridled success of \\"The Hobbit\\".Also, the book displays a moral complexity often not seen within the confines of children's liteature. By this, I am referring to the whole matter of Bilbo's handling of the Arkenstone, the chief jewel of the hoard that Bilbo and the dwarves are setting out to recover. The claims of the Elves and Men, and counter claims of the dwarves, and Bilbo's claiming of the Arkenstone and how he wants to use the Arkenstone to move the uprising [ever renewing] battle toward resolution are complex and startling legal in tone.For all its story-book qualities, \\"The Hobbit\\" is a much different work from its subsequent [work] heir, \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". Although early manuscripts explicility prove Tolkien was casting the \\"The Hobbit\\" in the universe of his mythology from initial composition, \\"The Hobbit\\" features several elements and passages that are altogether incongruous with \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", especially in the First Edition published in 1937.For one, the ring found in Gollum's cave is not the One Ring, the Ruling Ring of Sauron. The magic ring was simply that - a magic ring, a stage prop that, in the words of Tom Shippey helped equalize Bilbo in the archaic world he found himself in. Tolkien only began developing the concept of the Ruling Ring AFTER publication of \\"The Hobbit\\" when he was trying to come up with ideas for a sequel. When reading \\"The Hobbit\\", readers, especially those who know the sequel, may approach the Ring as though this was truly a dark and sinister ring, which the text does not simply support. Indeed, Bilbo's deception about the ring, so important in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", is not explicit in \\"The Hobbit\\".Next, and probably most fascinating of all, is the nature of Gollum himself. We all know he's a hobbit, long ago corrupted by his long possession of the One Ring. However, prior to 1951 when Allen and Unwin (Tolkien's publishers) published the revised version of \\"Riddles in the Dark\\" that Tolkien had written in 1947, not only was Gollum explicitly NOT a hobbit, we were not even sure what kind of creature he was (or what his physical size was). He was more akin to Tom Bombadil and Beorn, a one item category unique unto himself. There were no textual indications of Gollum's size in comparison to Bilbo, leading some illustrators in foreign editions to show Gollum as a much larger creature than he would later become.Then there's the matter of the original version of \\"Riddles in the Dark\\". Initially Gollum was going to give away his magic ring as a gift if Bilbo won the contest as well as show him the way out; after winning, Gollum is unable to find the ring (naturally, as Bilbo had already found the ring), so he showed Bilbo the way out, constantly apologizing. In \\"The Return of the Shadow\\", Book Six of \\"The History of Middle-earth\\", we find Tolkien trying to work within the parameters of this original chapter. Naturally, Tolkien ultimately abandoned the original conception and rewrote the chapter in 1947 as a specimen of what a new chapter could look like and sent this to his publisher. Tolkien was quite surprised to see that, four years later, Allen & Unwin published the rewritten version, and Tolkien accepted the text as authoritative.While that's the most interesting of the differences, there are still several passages at odds with Middle-earth as described in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". There is no Shire. There are references to policemen and an unnamed \\"king\\". The trolls fit more into fairy-book stories than Middle-earth, and, as Douglas Anderson points out in \\"The Annotated Hobbit\\", Tolkien references other trolls with multiple heads, a thing not found in Middle-earth. Then there are the stone giants, which only appear once and then are never heard of again in any other story, before or after. There is speculation that one of Bilbo's ancestors took a FAIRY wife, a conception wholly alien to Middle-earth. There are no fairies in Middle-earth. Then there's the matter of the ruins of the mysterious city upon which Lake-town is built upon. This ruined city is mentioned only in \\"The Hobbit\\"; it goes unnamed, unreferenced, and undocumented in any of Tolkien's other writings regarding his legendarium.Probably the single biggest difference between \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is there is no developed nomenclature in \\"The Hobbit\\". The majority of the names are simple descriptions of the things involved: Bilbo lives in The Hill, is traveling to the River Running, visits a city named Dale, as neighbors across the Water, etc. There are very few proper names in \\"The Hobbit\\". The thirteen dwarves names and Gandalf (with the exception of \\"Balin\\") are all simply lifted from \\"The Devergatal\\", a section of the Elder Edda In \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" however, nomenclature is king, and Tolkien spent vast amounts of time creating vast landscape, cultures, and races all with their own unique linguistic flavour.There are also some geographic inconsistences between the two works. From the bridge to where Bilbo and the dwarves meet the trolls is within sight; however, in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", this same spot takes Aragorn and company SIX DAYS to go from the river to the spot where the trolls are.Tolkien was aware of these differences, and in 1960 wrote several different passages and revisions to bring \\"The Hobbit\\" stylistically more in line with \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". These passages were published for the first time in 2007 with \\"The History of The Hobbit\\". However, he showed the revised passages to someone (it is unknown who) who discouraged him from changing \\"The Hobbit\\".Ultimately, \\"The Hobbit\\" is a much different experience than \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", much more akin to classical fantasy fairy tale books such as \\"The Wind in the Willows\\" and \\"The Marvellous Land of the Snergs\\" in both style and tone than \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". Too its credit, the success of \\"The Hobbit\\" was what prompted Tolkien to write the sequel.In the seventeen years between initial publication and the appearance of the first volume of its sequel (1937-1954), \\"The Hobbit\\" never went out of print (save only for a brief period during World War II due to paper shortages) and was a tremendous seller, without support from \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". It is indeed a rich work, and is an undisputed classic. This book is so much more than a \\"prelude\\" to bigger and better things. It's a keystone work in children's fantasy, and stands among the titans of literature."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This 75th anniversary edition is full of great original illustrations, maps and some full color illustrations which delight my children as I read this story.

However, prior to 1951 when Allen and Unwin (Tolkien's publishers) published the revised version of \\"Riddles in the Dark\\" that Tolkien had written in 1947, not only was Gollum explicitly NOT a hobbit, we were not even sure what kind of creature he was (or what his physical size was). He was more akin to Tom Bombadil and Beorn, a one item category unique unto himself. There were no textual indications of Gollum's size in comparison to Bilbo, leading some illustrators in foreign editions to show Gollum as a much larger creature than he would later become.Then there's the matter of the original version of \\"Riddles in the Dark\\". Initially Gollum was going to give away his magic ring as a gift if Bilbo won the contest as well as show him the way out; after winning, Gollum is unable to find the ring (naturally, as Bilbo had already found the ring), so he showed Bilbo the way out, constantly apologizing. In \\"The Return of the Shadow\\", Book Six of \\"The History of Middle-earth\\", we find Tolkien trying to work within the parameters of this original chapter. Naturally, Tolkien ultimately abandoned the original conception and rewrote the chapter in 1947 as a speciman of what a new chapter could look like and sent this to his publisher. Tolkien was quite surprised to see that, four years later, Allen & Unwin published the rewritten version, and Tolkien accepted the text as authorative.While that's the most interesting of the differences, there are still several passages at odds with Middle-earth as described in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". There is no Shire. There are references to policemen and an unnamed \\"king\\". The trolls fit more into fairy-book stories than Middle-earth, and, as Douglas Andersion points out in \\"The Annotated Hobbit\\", Tolkien references other trolls with multiple heads, a thing not found in Middle-earth. Then there are the stone giants, which only appear once and then are never heard of again in any other story, before or after. There is speculation that one of Bilbo's ancestors took a FAIRY wife, a conception wholly alien to Middle-earth. There are no fairies in Middle-earth. Then there's the matter of the ruins of the mysterious city upon which Lake-town is built upon. This ruined city is mentioned only in \\"The Hobbit\\"; it goes unnamed, unreferenced, and undocumented in any of Tolkien's other writings regarding his legendarium.Probably the single biggest difference between \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is there is no developed nomenclature in \\"The Hobbit\\". The majority of the names are simple descriptions of the things involved: Bilbo lives in The Hill, is travelling to the River Running, visits a city named Dale, as neighbors across the Water, etc. There are very few proper names in \\"The Hobbit\\". The thirteen dwarves names and Gandalf (with the exception of \\"Balin\\") are all simply lifted from \\"The Devergatal\\", a section of the Elder Edda In \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" however, nomenclature is king, and Tolkien spent vast amounts of time creating vast landcapes, cultures, and races all with their own unique lingustic flavour.There are also some geographic inconsistences between the two works. From the bridge to where Bilbo and the dwarves meet the trolls is within sight; however, in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", this same spot takes Aragorn and company SIX DAYS to go from the river to the spot where the trolls are.Tolkien was aware of these differences, and in 1960 wrote several different passages and revisions to bring \\"The Hobbit\\" stylistically more in line with \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". These passages were published for the first time in 2007 with \\"The History of The Hobbit\\". However, he showed the revised passages to someone (it is unknown who) who discouraged him from changing \\"The Hobbit\\".Ultimatley, \\"The Hobbit\\" is a much different experience than \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", much more akin to classical fantasy fairy tale books such as \\"The Wind in the Willows\\" and \\"The Marvellous Land of the Snergs\\" in both style and tone than \\"The Lord of the Rings\\".Unfortunately \\"The Hobbit\\" has become overshadowed by \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", seen as an \\"enchanting prelude\\" to the more substantial sequel. C. S. Lewis said in \\"A Preface to Paradise Lost\\" that to accurately judge an item, you first must know its purpose. The books were written for different purposes - \\"The Hobbit\\" as an entertaining story for his children, and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", initially a seqeul to \\"The Hobbit\\", became much more a continuation of \\"The Silmarillion\\". For those who underestimate \\"The Hobbit\\" using the criteria of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" as their guide are missing out on a rich work."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The book is fantantic, with lots of information and figures.The only issue resides on the missing habilitie of the kindle touch to reproduce the authors voice on poems and music inside the book, this can only be done in Fire version or Kindle for Iphone or Ipad, not even on Kindle for PC.

I did, however, found it really challenging to read by the second half. I felt like the book got a little slow and almost stuck, and was hesitant to continue reading. I made myself finish this book and was really happy I did because I thought it had the best ending. It was filled with the right amount of cute comedy and heart-warming friendship.Also, Bilbo surprised me at the end because he ended up not being as greedy as I thought he would be.I Loved...The fatness, clumsiness and crankiness of Bofur.I was also completely captivated by the Dwarves' names: Thorin, Balin, Dwalin, Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, Dori,Nori,Ori, Fili, Kili, Gloin, Oin,I Disliked...The scene where they are lost in the woods.

Salvatore or Terry Brooks or any more modern fantasy writer will probably be disappointed. There is action, but it is scant.

Few tales are better than the classic trip of discovery. Maybe Homer's epic poems started it, more likely it started long before him, a time so old that everything can be both true and not quite true, and men and Gods are interchangeable. This is one of those stories. A quiet Hobbit (Bilbo) lives comfortably (as Hobbits are prone to do), when a Wizard named Gandalf knocks on his door (as wizards frequently do in these kinds of stories). Much to his surprise, Bilbo is soon off on an adventure.Adventures, the things found out (and things found) do two things. They change the adventurer and they change the world around. This adventure does both. The quiet, shy, Bilbo becomes the leader of the adventure (much to his dismay), and as happens in good fantasy adventure stories, the changes have much more far reaching consequences than anyone (even Gandalf) could predict, and then there is the ring tha he finds accidentally while trying to escape from the trolls (but then that is the stuff of many later books).The people of Middle Earth, the trials and tribulations the world since the end of the 'good old days', the trials of the adventurer, and hints of the impact on the rest of the world are wonderfully described in a style that appeals to young and old alike. This is a story in the best story telling tradition. It's fun, it's easy to read, and it's a classic tale of adventure and growth. I'm only sorry I waited so long to read it!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This novel that the immortal Mr. Tolkien penned will abide in my heart forever.

The scene with Bilbo and Thorin near the end still pulls at my heart after all these years. As a prelude to the fantasy epic &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; books, it is an essential primer for them.

J.R.R. Tolkien must be proud of the story that started The Lord of The Rings, without it The Lord of The Rings wouldn't be so popular. This book may be great, but the reason that I don't give it 5 starts is this: The way Tolkien writes like he's telling a story is very creative, but at some points gets just a little annoying.

Yes children can read this book and it is fun. How ever there is a lot more to this book than a cute story. And it has all the depth of the other Tolkien works with the exception of being shorter.Many people look at this story as a prequel to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", where in reality it is a stand-alone story with a perfectly good beginning, middle, and end.

Some trimming would have worked for the better! --&gt; 7/10"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"The Hobbit: or There and Back Again\\" was my introduction to the extraordinary world of J.R.R. Tolkien. I have read \\"The Hobbit\\" at least four times in the thirty-five years since I first discovered it, and have never ceased to be thrilled by Bilbo Baggins and his brave cohorts. Their quest to destroy the evil dragon Smaug, recover stolen gold, deliver the enslaved people of Lake Town, and the strong bond of friendship they forge along the way, has thrilled millions of readers. Although \\"The Hobbit\\" is a prequel, of sorts, to the \\"Lord Of The Rings Trilogy,\\" it stands on its own as a wonderful tale of magical fantasy, and as a story of personal courage and growth.\\"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort. It had a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted green, with a shiny yellow brass knob in the exact middle. The door opened on to a tube-shaped hall like a tunnel: a very comfortable tunnel without smoke, with panelled walls, and floors tiled and carpeted, provided with polished chairs.\\" Tolkein's description of the Hobbit's home is important to form an understanding of Bilbo Baggins' character. Mr Baggins is the particular Hobbit of note, for whom the book is titled. He likes nothing more than comfort, and dislikes nothing more than change. What is a hobbit, you ask? Hobbits are \\"a race of small, plump people about half the size of humans, with furry toes and a great love of good food and drink.\\" Unfortunately they no longer live on Earth.Bilbo, who leads a very comfortable life at his home, Bag End, near the bustling village of Hobbiton, is rudely interrupted one day by a wise old wizard, Gandolf the Gray. Gandolf, with a great deal of pressure, persuades Bilbo to set out with thirteen angry, and determined dwarves, to reclaim their stolen treasure from a terrible dragon. The Hobbit, who has never stolen anything in his life, nor would he think to do so, is proclaimed \\"The Burglar.\\" And the skeptical dwarves are reassured by Gandolf that \\"there is more to Bilbo than meets the eye.\\"The troop ventures off, through various mysterious, mystical lands that no longer exist on Earth - Rivendell, the elves stronghold, the Misty Mountains, Mirkwood Forest, Lake Town and the Lonely Mountains. They meet and befriend numerous memorable characters along the way, and encounter fiendish enemies also. It is on this journey that Bilbo finds the all powerful golden ring, that plays such an important role in Tolkein's masterful epic the \\"Lord Of The Ring Trilogy.\\"Before Bilbo can return to the comfort and security of Bag End, he will fight many battles, change lives, influence the future, and undergo changes himself. The drama, suspense and sheer beauty of Tolkien's tale will captivate you. It is truly an unforgettable story, written in a most unique literary style, by a man who has created and peopled an entire world, and given its inhabitants a new language.

Their destination is the Lonely Mountain, in which lies the dwarves stolen fortune, guarded by a horrible dragon named Smaug.How easy is was to lose yourself in this world for awhile. I kept thinking about it every time I put the book down. It also wonderfully sets up the Lord of the Rings trilogy that includes two of the characters from &quot;The Hobbit.&quot; If you've never read this book like I hadn't, and are a big fan of either Harry Potter or the Robert Jordan books, you owe it to yourself to read this. It's great!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Now that I have read The Hobbit I must conclude that the reason for its apparent fame and renown was its novelty when it was published. Perhaps this book was the first of the fantasy genre, pioneering paths that would inspire and guide other fantasy writers for decades to follow. However, on top of this I must say that I personally found the book dreadfully unexciting. I am sure that if you have ever played Dungeons and Dragons or any similar RPG game you would have invented a story with a far more suspenseful, coherent, and intriguing plot than this one. Of course, the character of Bilbo Baggins (the hobbit) is cute and quaint to say the least, his character does not exceed the shallow heroes of most average science fiction/fantasy books (you know, that clueless maverick who despite his befuddlement always comes out on top)... Unfortunately, Bilbo's 13 companions are similarly left undeveloped in a story that could have brought out so much in them. I have heard that The Lord of the Rings trilogy is better, so I will read that next, but for now I have no further positive remarks about Mr. Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"When I first found this book it excited me. After reading it, I must say that I now despise it. After only a few pages, I began to see darkness under its shallow mask. I can't believe people would buy a book of this caliber. It irritates me to no end. Let me begin my journey.It was a sunny Tuesday if I remember correctly. I was taking my unicycle home and noticed an eight year old kid waiting for the bus. I didn't want this kid to beat me up, so I had to look bigger than him, as I do with most mammals. I approached the kid with an awry grin on my face. The lonely rider stared up at me with terror. My plan was working. To be honest, I was terrified on the inside, but I had to show this animal who's boss. I hovered over him, completely shrouding him in my shadow. I won. The kid broke. He ran screaming. That sure taught him. I grabbed my spoils from his seat. His backpack contained few items. Some of the better ones included some stickers, a ham sandwich, and this book. I beat my chest in victory, then proceeded to skip home.I sat down in my porcelain throne at my house and skimmed through the book. Seemed at the time like just a children's fable. How wrong I was. I flipped back to the first page and began to read it for real. The first thing that struck me was the book trying to explain what a Hobbit was. I swore the book and ripped out this page. I did not dare read that in fear of a satanic summoning ritual. I proceeded with caution.The first chapter starts out fairly simple. An odd rabbit creature (presumably a hobbit, but I was not sure) was living in a hole like the scum he was. Pretty soon, he is visited by an older gentlemen named GrandGolf, or something of the sort. This character is my favorite at the moment. Grandgolf sees the rabbit creature and is immediately disgusted by it, insisting this creature leave his home, or be slain by him there. The rabbit is enlisted into the army and becomes the slave of Grandgolf. He now must travel with Grandgolf's company if he wishes to escape an eternal damnation.The book only goes down from here my friends. The author tries to envelop us in creatures that I think he made up himself. What am I? Eight? How am I to believe these lies without proof? I feel saddened about how lonely this author must have been in order to imagine such divine creatures. Without anything backing it up, none of this book is solid. How am I to believe that things such as trolls, dwarves, and wolves exist? I must confess that many of these ideas made me confused throughout the book. However, I press on hoping it will pick up, only to find myself losing more of my sanity.Sluggishly I continued the fantasy story of Tolkein. It made me queasy to start reading again, but I trudged on with a vengeance now. The rabbit continued reluctantly on his quest, hoping to ultimately escape the powers of Grandgolf the wizard. Until then, he lays awake at night, hoping for someone to save him. Eventually the party must cross a mountain. This is where the rabbit decides to make his grand escape. Without thinking, he kicks one of the dwarves in the crotch and jumps down with reckless abandon. He must have hit his head on a rock or something because he wakes up later.He opens his eyes to probably the most beautiful site in the book. A small creature called a Gollum rests on a rock in the middle of an underwater lake bantering to himself. This character has got to be the most believable in the book so far. Having been driven mad from the illusions that had been fabricated by the heinous author, he now sits quietly and often has discussions with himself. The rabbit, now crazy as well, sees this Gollum as salvation from the overbearing wizard-kind. He approaches it without hesitation and quickly falls in love.The rabbit grasps the hands of the Gollum, and after several sloppy make-out sessions they get married and the Gollum gives the rabbit a ring. With the loot in hand, the rabbit decides he has everything he needs and decides to divorce the Gollum. The Gollum does not like this one bit. It goes into a raging fit and chases after the rabbit with but a broken heart. With his quick thinking, the rabbit puts on the ring, which happens to give it super powers. The rabbit turns invisible, leaving the broken Gollum to wallow in pity and self loathing. The rabbit makes his way out of the mountain, only to fall back into the clutches of the warlord dwarves. Normally, the rabbit would curse himself for being so careless, but now he had the upper hand. With the wedding ring of super powers he can finally take his revenge on those who he had called master.The rest of the book is quite trivial as the rabbit finds ways to kill off his owners one by one, eventually teaming up with a dragon to conquer the world. I didn't feel like reading the rest of it in fear of spontaneous combustion, but I can tell it wasn't going anywhere.From what I have read of this book I can tell that an amateur wrote it. With it's false ideals and creatures there is no possible way that any book in this manner can be taken seriously. It has okay characters overall, and the sex scenes were alright as well. I just wish that the author had highlighted the theme of rebellion in a more positive manner instead of taking the route he did.I believe that this book receives more praise than it should be getting. I can hardly believe that this book was based off the movie. The differences are very uncanny and it's almost impossible to see this book and the movie under the same title as one in the same. Without the movie, I doubt anybody would have heard of this book, and I find it hard to call this a classic in anything but age."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"When I compare this story to those in the Harry Potter series, the Hobbit fails to impress.

The Hobbit is definitely a Fantasy classic and a book that you have to read and take time with to enjoy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"THe Hobbit is what started my love for books. It wasn't a &quot;he went to the store&quot; book. There were adventures at every turn. In fact I read it in four days because I couldn't put ot down! I introduced my friend to it and she said she got hooked on the first page because of the details and description. Another one of my friends, who saw the movie awhile back said she doesn't remember much, but of what she does remember, she loved those parts. I recommend to anyone who likes reading about elves and magic, to read this classic by J.R.R. Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I really liked this book because it is full of adventure, and is VERY interesting. I'm not sure about how it would compare to other fantasy books because I haven't read any fantasy books lately, so I don't really remember to well about what happened. This is a great story about some dwarves, and a hobbit named Bilbo who go on a long adventure together, and, well... if you want to know the rest then you have to read the book. I would recoomend this book to anyone who likes to read, and even for people who don't like to because it's a interesting book full of adventure. Once you get started reading it you can't put it down. This is definitly a five star book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I am a avid fantasy reader and I loved this book. It catches the imagination of the reader so well and keeps you interested throughout the entire book. It is a great book and I would recommend it to readers of all ages."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It's the best book I ever read!!!!!It's full of action,adventure,and exciting suspense.My favorite part is when Bilbo fights giant spiders.I recommend this book to anybody.It's great!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Who can't love a story about little people with furry feet going off to fight a dragon!? This story is a masterpiece in itself. Second best book I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Like many people, I list \\"The Hobbit\\" as one of my childhood classics. Now those favorites from my younger days are curious things. As a child, they never seemed to grow old or stale. I read this book and several others until my copies were ready to fall apart. But upon rereading them as an adult, some of them have proven to be disappointing. Which isn't to say that books like The Chronicles of Narnia or \\"The Phantom Tollbooth\\" are bad, but they don't carry as much emotional punch as they could and seem a little tedious in retrospect.Not so with \\"The Hobbit\\". Having recently read it for the first time in more than ten years, I can say that this book is every bit as exciting and imaginative from an adult perspective as from a child's. It is amazing. It approaches perfection in so many areas that it daunts the imagination. For instance, consider how much Tolkien is able to accomplish in just the first chapters. He introduces all the important characters and gives them distinctive personalities, builds sympathy for the hero, provides all the necessary backstory, injects a little humor, and prepares you for the epic adventure ahead.And what an adventure it is! I marveled at Tolkien's amazing skill in so many areas. His action sequences are fast, short, and easy to visualize. His songs and poetry add a wonderfully quaint touch to the story. His simple descriptive writing paints perfect portraits of landscapes in just a few sentences. There is literally nothing done wrong in this story. The current crop of fantasy authors would do well to pause from their latest eight-hundred page extravaganza and remind themselves that Tolkien never repeated himself or included anything unnecessary. His goal was to write small and speedy, to always be providing something new for the reader.A note about the illustrations: some of the editions that they're hawking now include copies of the pen and ink drawings that Tolkien did for the first edition. Like many people, I was raised with the 1966 paperback that didn't include the illustrations. It's an unfortunate fact that Tolkien's skill as an artist didn't come close to matching his skill as a writer. Some of the drawings are decent, but others are almost laughably bad. I would recommend trying to find a copy without the illustrations."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Bilbo Baggins is the name of the Hobbit living in the Shire when one day a wizard appears and changes his life. He is invited to share with them a journey as a burglar. At first Bilbo turns him down but soon 13 dwarves are in his house and convince him to reconsider. He decides to go with them and hurries to meet up with them. The party's goal is to journey to the Lonely Mountains to retain a treasure stolen from their ancestor from the evil dragon Smaug. Along the way they are attacked by various fairy tale creatures and meet a creature named Gollum. Scared by Gollum's odd ways and trickery, Bilbo uses the ring that he has stumbled upon in the tunnels. Gollum goes crazy and tries to get him but Bilbo narrowly escapes. The journey goes on and things change for Bilbo and he returns to his hobbit-hole a totally different person. This is a great book that I recommend to older kids probably at least in 7th grade."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I first read the hobbit in 6th grade, so that i could have a head start on the Lord of the Rings series. I didnt really expect to like the book, but once i picked it up i could't put it down. The detailed writing of J.R.R Tolkien had me hooked. All of the magic, dragons, and other fantasy creatures were perfect for the type of book i liked to read. I would reccomened this book to anyone who loves fantasy or is just looking for a good read!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It bothers some people that so many of the characters in the Hobbit are undeveloped. Only Bilbo, Gandalf, and Gollum shine. This, however, is still workable. With Thorin as a distinct personality among the Dwarves, the others function all right as a group with whom Bilbo doesn't really interact on a personal level.A much more serious problem exists in the Hobbit - the mid-book action is too good! \\"Riddles in the Dark\\" makes such a memorable literary impression that following adventures, even if good, would pale. Worse, after Mirkwood, the book just peters out. The interview with Smaug stands out in an island of otherwise mediocre action. The Battle of Five Armies is almost skipped, definitely lacking the emotion of meeting the Goblins in the Misty Mountains. Bilbo's stealthy dealing with the Arkenstone adds some interest, but the end of this otherwise marvelous book just falls down.But don't mistake criticism for dislike. Even recognizing this, the Hobbit stands as an adventure akin to Treasure Island or the Wind in the Willows. The stay-at-home off to a grand quest makes for a wonderful beginning, the Trolls are fine, the eagles soar, Beorn is intriguing, and Mirkwood is haunting. The child who misses the experience of the Hobbit must face the only remedy - he or she must read it as an adult!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit, the prequel to the Lord of the Rings series, is a very well written book, but I recommend it only for those who are truly fans of fantasy books. Tolkein does a very well at describing the adventure of Bilbo and his companions, but sometimes he gets too descriptive and the book gets a little dull. Still, other parts in the book are very exciting. I ended up enjoying this book very much, but I have read better books. Overall, I don't consider this one of Tolkein's best literary works, but it deserves some recognition."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit, first published in the mid-1930's, is a wonderfully inventive story. If you're expecting it to be the same style and intensity as Lord of the Rings you may be disappointed. This story, while having it's dramatic moments, is more mellow and tongue-in-cheek than LOTR. In reading this you get the impression that Tolkein was enjoying himself as much as we have enjoyed reading it. I must have read this book at least 15 times between 1975 and 1990. It has been years though, and with the new release of the movie I decided to re-introduce myself to an old friend.The Hobbit is a tale about Bilbo Baggins (a relatively minor character in LOTR) and his adventures with 13 dwarfs to reclaim their treasure. Initially led by the wizard Gandalf the troop encounter trolls, goblins, elves, giant spiders, and of course THE DRAGON. What I liked the most about the story is that Tolkien really uses his sense of humor throughout, something missing in LOTR. Of course we get to meet two characters who play important roles in LOTR: Elrond, the Elf Lord, and Gollum. The story follow the group from the beginning of their journey in the Shire, their trek across the wilderness where they are waylaid by trolls, and over (and under) the misty mountains where they are captured by goblins. It is here that Bilbo finds 'The Ring' and his life changes forever. After their escape they make their way through mirkwood, where they are first ensnared by spiders and then imprisoned by elves. In both cases Bilbo is able to rescue them. And of course to the journey's end at the Lonely Mountain and their confrontation with Smaug the dragon. The tale ends on a sad yet uplifing note of redemption.Although you can read Lord of the Rings, or even watch the movie, without reading The Hobbit first why would you want to?It's just much more fun to read this beforehand. I would also recommend &quot;The Simarillon&quot;, Tolkien's mythology of middle earth. This book gives you the complete history of the elves and the first two ages, leading up to the events told here."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"After having recently re-read the Lord Of The Rings trilogy in anticipation of the movie, I bought the Hobbit again since I'd lost my copy. To read it after the trilogy was an eye opener. It was obvious that Tolkien's skills in writing about the Middle Earth were much more developed in the later books. Still enjoyable, but not as visual and gripping as the trilogy to come."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"When I was a kid, \\"Lord of the Rings\\" was a perceived boy book. Girls, instead, read \\"Little Women\\", \\"Betsy-Tacy\\", and \\"Anne of Green Gables\\". Ask a boy to read any of those series, and they'd gag. Those girl books, however, are still great contributions to the literary and imaginative worlds.*** So even though Tolkien hasn't reached me until now (and well past my childhood years), \\"The Hobbit\\" is a rewarding pleasure. It's the prequel to the Lord of the Rings trilogy (\\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\", \\"The Two Towers\\", and \\"The Return of the King\\") and considered gentler and more suitable for reading to young children than the subsequent installments.*** The Hobbitt is Bilbo Baggins who leaves his comfortable abode (his hobbitt hole) to go adventuring with the wizard Gandalf and a party of dwarves who have a penchant for breaking into boisterous singing during mealtimes.*** They're off in search of treasure with little more than an old map and a lot of gumption to guide them. Bravery emerges in a disarming way. Tolkien understands the homeliness of his hobbitt and the dwarves -- the sort of quality we, the readers, have as humans but spend a lot of time concealing as uncool. So when adventure prods the timid and the inexperienced into derring-do, we are swept along like participants ourselves. Tolkien shows that even the littlest, unlikely ones have a place with the heroes..."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Gave it a four star overall is a well written book ,good story a book that can be enjoyed by everyone"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I've read it many times and each time it gets better.

When I looked at some of the illustrations, they were originally printed in the hard copy so that they could be viewed from the side instead of up and down. Try looking at the illustrations from the side while using the Kindle or another similar device that always keeps the page right side up. On the plus side, the electronic version is very quick to read.

Picture it in your mind and then seeing it one the screen...very good!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I decided to reread the Hobbit in between viewings of the Hobbit movie, and I'm glad I did. This is definitely a good book, but it might not have held up quite as well as I'd expected. I'm still going to give it 5 stars for the nostalgia, but otherwise I'd probably give it 4. The writing style is just very detached, and it's very hard to get into the characters. I never felt like I was Bilbo Baggis, this was partially from the writting style, but especially because of the comments from the narrator. Instead, the Hobbit feels like a story someone is telling me. Maybe this is why it works so well for children/young adults, but reading it now I just felt detached from everything that happened. There's a lot that happens during the book, but it all goes by so quickly that it's odd. This is most noticeable for the ending, which I found to be poorly done. There's such a buildup to fighting this dragon, but in the end it's fought and killed in about one pages time. Then the battle where multiple main characters are killed is hardly described at all at first, and then it's just summarized by the narrator. Still, The Hobbit is a fun and easy read, that everyone should at least read once."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Fast paced and delightful read, full of both whimsical and terrifying characters whom the reader grows quite fond of.

If you are any part a LOTR fan or just a fantasy genre fan, you MUST read this magical book!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is at least my 4th reading of The Hobbit and each and every time it's just as memorizing as the first time. Tolkien is a genius and if you've never experienced his writing, YOU SHOULD!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It is a shame that J. R. R. Tolkien's great work, The Hobbit, has been overshadowed by his still greater work The Lord of the Rings. Nowadays, most people regard The Hobbit simply as the prequel to The Lord of the Rings. The Hobbit, however, is a great story even standing on its own.The Hobbit is the story of the Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, a staid, unadventurous member of a staid, unadventurous race. One day, Bilbo is visited by the wizard Gandalf and thirteen homeless Dwarves and somehow becomes their burglar with the job of helping the Dwarves recover their lost gold and home, stolen by the dragon Smaug.When they first set off on their adventure, Bilbo is not much use to the Dwarves and seems more a burden than a burglar. He can't seem to do anything right. Over time, however he becomes more confident and takes more of a lead. By the end of the story, he has helped defeat the dragon and has saved the Dwarves lives more than once.Tolkien shows great skill with the plot of the Hobbit, never allowing the pace to slacken but keeping the reader excited with Bilbo's adventures. Throughout the book, he shows the same keen ability to depict the natural world as he does in the Lord of the Rings, and so makes Middle Earth come to life in a way few authors of fantasy can. Bilbo's growth as a leader and a person are convincingly shown and Tolkien, at times displays a wry wit, especially with the politics of Laketown and Bilbo's conversations with the Dragon.If there is one fault with the Hobbit, it is that at times Tolkien was too aware that he was writing a children's book, and at times, his writing takes on a slightly condescending tone, the sort of tone that adults often use when talking to small children and which the children really don't like much. Overall, however, the Hobbit is an enjoyable book to read whether on its own, or as the prequel to the Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"read this book its way better than the movie but just by a little bit...best book ive ever read"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have always loved any of Tolkien's works but I think the Hobbit really has a special place in my heart because of the childlike innocence that is not as present in the Lord of the Rings.Much of the story is told rather light-heatedly and much the way a grandfather might regal a grandchild sitting on is knee with a story of a far away place and fantastic creatures. The plot and characters are not complicated in any way, and if you are looking for a novel that is dark, and grim, with complicated characters, than The Hobbit is really not for you.There is not much more that I can say that other 5 star reviewers haven't said. I do have the Kindle version and there are no formatting problems and the illustrations are clear and very pleasant. I've had trouble with older books that are later added to the Kindle, but I had none with this version of the Hobbit.

Granted, it is a children's book, but the kid in me loves it.

They come alive in this battle between good and evil. The story alone is worth five stars and therefore, this rating system doesn't do this book justice.It is by far one of the most superior achievements in fantasy art: mixed in with a magical story. The art work is surreal and absorbing. Alan Lee did a wonderful job and the art vividly portrays a magical world. It comes to life and the pages jump out at the reader in wonderful splender.An absolute must collecters item."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a wonderful book. Although it may be slow between action-packed spots, it is beatifuly written. The Hobbit is about Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit (you are probably wondering what a hobbit is. A hobbit is a little person about half our size, and no beard. They grow leathery thick soles on the bottom of there feet, and grow curly hair on top. Being fat in the stomach, they dress in bright colors, have deep laughs, and enjoy meals very much)who wanted nothing more than to sit at home and enjoy his pipe. When, Gandalf comes by and chooses him for a dangerous adventure. 13 dwarves come by his house for tea, and the next thing poor Bilbo knows, he is being swept out of his comfotable hobbit-hole! He encounters Goblins, Trolls, Giant Spiders, a dangerous dragon, and too much more for a hobbit to handle!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"When I heard that the trilogy that follows this novel, The Lord of the Rings, was being made into a movie and that Tolkien's books are some of the greatest literary works of all time, I bought LOTR and The Hobbit.Let me say this: The Hobbit (and Lord of the Rings for that matter) is not for everyone. One of The Hobbit's greatest aspects (or worst, depending on how you see it) are the vivid details of the scenery Tolkien provides the reader. This makes the reader feel as if he/she is in Middle-Earth as part of the party of 13 dwarves, one hobbit and a wizard. You experience everything the group does, and they do go through a lot. The downfall of this style is it may seem slow and boring to some, but not to me.Some say that there is not enough charcter development or that the plot is too thin. I beg to disagree. While there are many pages of wandering around Middle-Earth and descriptions of its locales, the plot moves at a fair pace with a main event present in every chapter. As for those who say that character development is non-existant in the novel must have skipped quite a few chapters. Do they not realise that the main character, Bilbo Baggins, goes through a tremendous change? At the very beginning of the book he has very little desire for adventure. He does not think of himself as brave or bold or resourceful. By the final pages of The Hobbit, he has become all the things he didn't believe he was.After reading this tale of travel and adventure, I now agree with those who say that this is the greatest literary works of the century. If you are open-minded and like fantasy in general or like the Star Wars saga, you should look into this book. And if you enjoyed reading this book you will also enjoy Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy. Finally, this is a great novel that is well worth your money, every cent of it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The first time I read this book was when I was nine years old. I hated it.The second time was last week, at the age of nineteen. The first thing I noticed about &quot;The Hobbit&quot; was that, to start with, it was surprisingly childish. Not surprising, as it is a childrens' story. However, athough I have never read Lord of theRings, I could sense something bigger behind the story. It was inexorable. Towards the end of the story, the tone changes dramaically (around Chapter 14). Quickly, the language becomes almost biblical in style, eg: &quot;Thorin bent his horn bow and fired an arrow at Dale; it smote in his shield and stuck there quivering&quot;. The juvenile language all but vanishes, and a grand epic feel is created. The character of Thorin is most memorable. This is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"What can someone say about &quot;the hobbit&quot; that has not already been said. I remember first reading this book when I was twelve and not being able to put it down. I read it three times in a row, each time being more thrilled with the book. I wanted to change my cats name to Bilbo (my mom said no). This is the best fantasy story, ever written in my opinion. About two weeks ago I found my 15-year-old son reading the Hobbit. I went and dug up my old copy and fell in love with the book all over again. This book is a must have for anyone's home library. One of my favorite parts is the riddle game between Gollum and Bilbo (what's its got in its pocket?). There is so much to explore and discover in this book. You'll figure something else out each time you read it. So do yourself a favor pick up a copy and escape into a world of lovable characters and high adventure!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"'The Hobbit' never gets boring. In fact, it gets better with each time you read it. It's a light hearted fantasy and is, in my opinion, one of the best books ever written."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit may be the most thrilling book I've ever read. I still wonder how J.R.R. Tolkiens thought of so many marvelous creatures, characters, and adventures, and weaved it in with wonderful writing and words. In The Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins is a very lovable Hobbit who goes on a very perilous adventure with a party of dwarves. It involves goblins, giant spiders, a dragon named Smaug, and many other spectacular things. If you love adventure you must read this book, or else you're missing out on a journey you'll never forget."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Every fantasy story you ever read will sound like a knockoff ofThe Hobbit--so read The Hobbit and don't bother with the rest. (Okay,then read the Lord of the Rings trilogy. But that's it.) As a kid Iread it about 20 times, and since then I've read it about 5 more--I'm coming due for it again!The Hobbit is the ultimate classic adventure tale: a mysterious wizard picks an unsuspecting hobbit to accompany a band of greedy dwarves, as they go to steal their gold from Smaug the dragon--and to kill Smaug, if possible. They journey through forests and under mountains, battling goblins and hobnobbing with elves, until finally they reach the lonely mountain where Smaug awaits.\`\`The eagles are coming! The eagles are coming!''"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit was a great book. It's for people who like fantasys. The hobbit (Bilbo Baggins) is sitting quietly at home when these dwarves walk in and they have a party; that's where the suspense begins! The dwarves take the hobbit across the land to Mirkwood, so they can fight the dragon. A lot of weird things start to happen in Mirkwood, and they meet a couple of friends along the way. The woods seem never-ending. Will they ever get out to defeat the the dragon? Find out by reading The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkein."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Tolkein was such a masterful writer. His outlandish characters, colorful imaging, original settings, and mesmerizing plotlines are among some of my favorite readings.The basic plot revolves around a young hobbit's journey with a company of thirteen dwarves and a wizard on a quest to regain the dwarven homeland. Amongst the many enemies they must face along the way are the Wargs, a vicious group of wolves; the orcs; and a fearsome and monstrous dragon named Smaug.If you like fantasy literature in the least, you should love this book. It got me hooked on the genre, and hopefully you'll enjoy it too."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit has always held a special place in my heart, even compared to Lord of the Rings. While The Hobbit obviously doesn't go as far in depth into the history of Middle-Earth as Lord of the Rings does, in many ways The Hobbit's simplicity is its charm. The book is quite simply the quintessential adventure tale. I love how the book begins quickly and follows with a series of short, ordered adventures. Tolkien handles the character of Bilbo brilliantly allowing him to become more adventurous, but also making sure that he doesn't lose his Hobbit roots. Best of all, Tolkien throws in a few twists that make the Hobbit far more interesting than most fantasy stories. The trouble doesn't end with the slaying of the dragon (for those few who haven't read the book yet, I won't spoil it). For readers wanting more than an adventure story, Tolkien also weaves a compelling commentary on the power of greed and the nature of adventures. No wonder this has become a classic. I can't wait for Peter Jackson's Hobbit movies to come out."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a great book, I very much liked the different style from the Lord of the Rings, and think that Tolkien did a great job of introducing the finding of the ring, and middle earth.The kindle version of this book is well done including the occasional images, and flow."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Excellent children's story, probably one of the finest ever written, and never condescending to the reader. Now, if this were intended as a story for adults, I'd probably give it 4 stars, but being that it was written as a children's book it warrants a 5 (and then some). If I had read this at a younger age I probably would have been moved to tears; as things go I first read it at 21 and still greatly enjoyed it, which should speak volumes as to its quality. There's much adventure, peril, and perseverance through camaraderie, and it's a treat to witness to Bilbo's slow transformation from timid homebody to valiant hero.Highly recommended. If you enjoy fantasy at all then this is a must-read. Of course, it's also a prequel of sorts to the darker, longer, and more mature \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", but even judged on its own merits is still classic fantasy and deserving of a spot in every personal library."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is awesome.

A year later, something happened when I picked up the book again. It was magic. Either a certain maturity level or a certain sophistication is necessary to appreciate J.R. Tolkein's writing. When I was ready, the book was wonderful. I don't hesitate to recommend this book to teens, but I might caution them that even though it might not be for them a this moment, they should keep it in mind for a second try as they get older. That alone can pique their interest.Bernardette CostaAuthor, The Six Colorful Annies"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I LOVE The Hobbit. I can't emphasize that enough. Love love love it! Now that I have my over-exuberance out of the way, I'll get down to it. This is a great book for all ages, though most of the younger children might have difficulty understanding it. I read it by myself and thoroughly enjoyed it, and I later read it to my 10, 8, and 6 year old nieces and nephew. They all enjoyed it immensely, and my oldest niece and nephew read it on their own as well. This is the edition I bought for myself and the edition I bought for them as well, and I didn't see any problems with it. However, like I recommended on the Lord of the Rings trilogy I wrote a review on, if different editions are of concern to you, since there are so many editions, I recommend looking at it in a bookstore where you can feel it and look at it and see which edition you prefer, then buy it on Amazon as you are likely to get a better deal on here. And of course on the off chance it's a better deal in the bookstore, you're right there with it. But chances are you'll get it cheaper here. Still, if you're picky about binding, typeface, maps, glossaries, and yada yada, you should physically look at it first. If not, buy this one. I like the feel of the pages. They aren't all slick and smooth where you can't separate the pages well. They have a warm feel to them, which I love! And the pages are easy to turn."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"As opposed to go on about different versions of The Hobbit publication, like some reviews obviously do, I am actually going to review The Hobbit book that includes illustrations from the 1977 animated movie, The Hobbit, by Arthur Rankin, Jr. and Jules Bass.Make note: this includes all the original text from Tolkien's wonderful book. It is not a publication of the Rankin-Bass film with its script and meager screen caps. And while this edition of The Hobbit does include some shots from the Rankin-Bass film, it is so much richer. This book includes concept art, art from the story boards and story treatments, character treatments. It even includes illustrations from the chapter \\"Queer Lodgings\\" and Bilbo's surrender of the Arkenstone, scenes which did not make it into the final cut of the Rankin-Bass film.Even if die-hard Tolkien fans had a grudge against the Rankin-Bass adaptation - and heaven knows, they and Tolkien himself have always been squeamish about talk of adaptations - I still highly recommend this edition as a must for any library and especially for aspiring illustrators and animators. Rankin-Bass Productions, Inc. were behind The Thundercats and the adaptations of The Last Unicorn and The Flight of Dragons. Their style is unique in an industry where nearly everyone, from DreamWorks to Warner Brothers, just can't shake that Disney style, even though Rankin-Bass did work under Disney's subsidiaries.In summation, Tolkien's text is happily preserved, and fans will get a behind-the-scenes view into the animated version of The Hobbit. This book is worth its weight in hoarded Dwarf gold."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have a few students who need this to help them read the novel. They now understand the book better and get a kick out of the different voices and especially the songs."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I had never read any of Tolkien's books, only seen the LOTR movies. I could not put this book down. I read it in just a few days and loved every minute of it. I read the reviews from some of the diehards with their criticisms but felt this book was the right one for me and I am happy I did. I especially loved the drawings in the book which I am under the impression Tolkien did himself.Now I am reading The Lord of the Rings and I'll read the Silmarillian next.I am also going to look for other versions of The Hobbit that give more detailed explanations of the book's content and further insight into the story. I believe there are some out there, at least from what I can vaguely remember seeing in my initial research to decide which version of The Hobbit to buy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Myth throughout the ages has been a powerful tool for mankind, providing wonderful stories, presenting beautiful archetypes, and teaching lessons. Tolkien was a lover of the Norse myths, the Germanic, and his work shows it. The man, far from being just a professor, was a genius, creating his own mythology from myths that already came before hand. The Hobbit is a wonderful way to get started on his work. The Hobbit is very much a myth for our time, with the wise old counselor who helps the reluctant hero to realize his full potential.The story starts out with Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit, living a quiet life, only to have his life interrupted by a the wizard Gandalf and a group of dwarves. It appears a rather nasty dragon has stolen the dwarves' treasures and is now making his home in their lair. It's up to poor, little Bilbo to muster the strength that he never knew he had, so that he can help reclaim what is rightfully the dwarves, all the while dealing with goblins, trolls, and other uncomfortable situations.This is the perfect book for those new to Tolkien to start with. It's not as dark, dreary, and violent as Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" series or \\"The Children of Hurin,\\" (all of which are wonderful must read books: \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" being my favorite) or as complex as \\"The Similarion\\" (also a must read), but an excellent starting place for most ages. This is one of the most incredible books ever written, one of the most amazing stories ever told, and I've read it numerous times. This version, with illustrations by Alan Lee, helps accentuate the mythical world Tolkien created even more, breathing life and magic into the story. \\"The Hobbit,\\" is a book I look forward to having the joy of reading to my future children, sparking their imagination, awaking the magic within them, in the process. To those that like Norse/Germanic myths, there are plenty of things you'll recognize in names and tales. In fact, there is a little nod to \\"Beowulf,\\" in it. To those that just want their imaginations to soar, to be taken to another world, then this is the right book, as it has helped inspire today's fantasy books and video games. Read this treasure and enjoy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is one of the only books I can sit down and read for hours. It is one of the best fantasy books ever written.

It was the gateway to the likes of Donaldson, Eddings, Kerr, Feist and many others the sort of stuff which I specifically look for when I want to read something relaxing.

I have read it countless times in countless situations, in an airliner crossing the Atlantic, in the centre of Picadilly Square, on a bus, on the underground, in bed, by the campfire, during examination time, wether I'm exhausted or bristling with energy... this is stuff that anyone can enjoy at any time and in any surroundings or situation.

I especially love the language Tolkien used and how \\"friendly\\" it sounds, and as I understand the history, it was originally written simply as a story for his own children - not even meant for publication! But we're all much luckier that it did get published. So, since my family has started listening to books while on driving vacations, I wanted to share this much-beloved story with my own children (and my review is of the *audiobook* rather than the actual book).The reader, Rob Inglis, has a wonderful English accent that highlights how \\"English\\" the story really is, and he gets very theatrical in the many different voices he uses for the many different characters. But that's where the problems began. Most of the voices he used for the dwarves (13 different voices!) we found difficult to understand and not especially pleasant to listen to. His voice for Gollum was worst of all (very screechy - which is entirely appropriate to Gollum - but not at all nice to hear on a long drive in the car). Plus he reads it very slowly, which didn't engage the kids and made it very hard for them to tolerate. Unfortunately, and no matter how many times I tried, we only made it about halfway before my wife insisted I turn it off and not start it again (and none of the kids protested in the least). Sadly it made a very long drive \\"there and back again\\" even longer and I wish I'd have had a backup book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit Ballantine Books, 1966, 307 pp., $7.99J.R.R Tolkien ISBN 0-345-33968-1What would you do if you were taken by a band of dwarves?

He is the father of an entire genre, a genre that has been able to carry many of us through our darkest hours. Although The Hobbit came out over 70 years ago, it is yet fresh and vibrant. Dear Bilbo is still an enchanting hero and still unique--so many main characters are thinly veiled reflections of ideal selves, whereas Bilbo makes us instead rather want to become Hobbits.The Hobbit is less world-weary than the Lord of the Rings. It is also a more tightly knit story. For these two reasons, I prefer The Hobbit to the later saga, but I am still grateful that I am a better person for having experienced both The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings.In The Hobbit, we experience a series of adventures that are precipitated by an odd invitation from Gandalf, and through these adventures we see Bilbo pass from mere observer to central character. Tolkien was a master at many things: character, mythology, story; however, his observations of the essential qualities of human nature make his writings timeless and transcendent of societal changes.It was a joy to experience The Hobbit. I look forward to reading it to my girls.

When you read \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" there is enough description to forgo \\"The Hobbit.\\" Personally, I find that reading The Lord of the Rings first gave me the in-depth background to better appreciate The Hobbit.Many of the creatures and adventures will put you on the edge of your seat. You will recognize the personalities and grow along will Bilbo as he faces new challenges as he learns to deal with life.A good book to read first would be \\"The Power of Myth\\" by Joseph Campbell. Then you get a clearer picture of why the story progresses as it does.ISBN: 0395177111"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Rob Inglis has quite a talent: wonderful voices, and fluid, easy to follow storytelling. I would recommend this audio book with two thumbs up."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien's first published work set in the fantastic lands of Middle-earth, \\"The Hobbit\\" is an exciting tale of adventure, danger, and treasure. From the comfortable village of Hobbiton, to the final battle outside the Lonely Mountain, you are taken on a grand quest filled with imaginative creatures, grand battles, and the will to find courage in the midst of great danger. \\"The Hobbit\\" serves as an exciting, grand prelude to the greatest adventure of all: \\"The Lord of the Rings!\\"Grade: A"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is the best book I've ever read. It has lots of great songs and adventure.I'd mainly suggest it to people that like The Lord of the Rings. I was so interested in it that I was usally the last one asleep. I say read this book!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"A down-to-earth hobbit named Bilbo Baggins is recruited to go with a group of dwarves on an adventure. The adventure will hold many dangers and take them to an old kingdom. At this abandoned kingdom is a dragon that holds all the stolen wealth of unimaginable worth from the kingdom. Bilbo and the dwarves go on a long journey, which holds many hardships, to take all that treasure away from the dragon and give it out to everybody on the journey.I liked how much action and detail was in the book. I was able to picture everything going on throughout the entire book. I didn't have any dislikes about this awesome book.I think people who like adventure, magic, and aren't afraid to read a harder book would like this book. This book is a little like the Redwall series and also like the books written by Gary Paulsen. This book really isn't about magic, but the adventure itself."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I enjoyed reading The Hobbit very much. The characters in it are well developed and unpredictable. The details are plentiful enough to make it entertaining, but not overloaded as to make it boring. They do just enough to set the scene, and stop there instead of taking up pages and pages. It's the kind of book that no matter how hard you try, you can't set it down. If you've never read The Lord of the Rings books, then this would be the ideal starting point, for it explains a few things in that series. This book would interest those who like books about traveling as well as those interested in history and the Medieval Age. In essentials, this book is the prologue to The Fellowship of the Ring, and is a must-read for those who enjoy the Ring series."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Being an avid LOTR fan and Tolkeinphile, listening to the audio version of \\"The Hobbit\\" was delightful.

I've read it time and again, and I'm still not tired of it. It is one of my favorite books, right up there with The Chronicles of Narnia.Tolkien is excellent at creating an entire world , and making it unfold as you turn each page. I read it on Orgilion, er excuse me, ( pardon my elvish ) Saturday, and finished it by the end of the day. If you're an elvellon, oops, elf friend, or just a boookworm, I promise you you'll love this book. The elves, dwarves, dragons, wargs, hobbits, wizards; and orcs all take part in an exquisitely crafted drama that eminates in the Battle of the Five Armies. If you enjoy reading about adventures, instead of having them, or if you like a little bit of both, this book is for you. Unfortunately, I didn't notice any Christian parellels in this book,( unlike those in Narnia ) but it makes a great read anyhow. Namarie, darn, there I go again, I mean goodbye."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Bilbo Baggins is a well thought of hobbit.

But the hobbit did worry about the matter.The next morning 11 dwarves arrive at Bilbo's home.Bilbo is bewildered why the dwarves arrive and why Gandalf had not came.Then after a short canversation Gandalf arrives and they all have a nice lunch. Then the dwarves and wizard talk of a map and destinations of odd sort for many hours. While Bilbo is wondering why his guests are speaking of such odd things, the dwarves ask Bilbo of food and drink. after another fine meal bilbos guests start singing of mountains and treasures and terrifying dragons.Then Bilbo falls asleep. When Bilbo wakes up there is a great mess in the kitchen and starts cleaning thinking the last night was a deam.

He was there on urgent business and had to find a certain hobbit(small people that didn't wear shoes) named Bilbo Baggins. The Bagginses were known to not ever go on adventures or do anything bad. Soon he came to the door of Bilbo and he knocked on the door. Bilbo came outside in a hurry and Gandalf was talking to him about a meeting that would happen the next day at Bilbo's house.The next day a whole bunch of dwarves and Gandalf came over. This was now called the secret mission, for they were planning to go to the Misty Mountains to kill Smogg an evil dragon that killed a lot of dwarves and took their mountain.In the next couple of days they were off.

From where he lives, it is unrespectful of anyone if they go on an adventure. One day, a powerful wizard named Gandalf comes to his hobbit hole and invites over a team of 13 dwarves the next day. Hobbit holes are the homes of hobbits. They throw a large party, breaking pots and pans, tiring out Bilbo.They stay at Bilbo's home for the night, which had just enough room for them. Bilbo wakes up really late in the morning, to find a note that tells him to meet the dwarves in a few minutes. This is the start of Bilbo's worst times( with little or no food). I really enjoyed this book because it was really amazing with close saves and a good ending. Read this exciting book to see what is in store for Bilbo."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have recently added a classic to my all time favorite books list. And that is THE HOBBIT by J. R. Tolkien. This book was written all the way back in 1937 but still wows readers today. It is the prelude to the World famous Lord of the Rings series and contains many similarities and some characters.The book takes place in the magical land of middle earth where magical beings and strange animals run wild. As you read through the book you meet everything from evil lairs to villages and even vast forests. They help set the mood and are described in a very creative way that truly keeps your interest by leaving no detail untouched. This makes the book much more fun to read and keeps you entranced.The characters are also a crucial part of this book that makes it as great as it is.In the beginning there is just one main character but not soon after u are introduced to a wide array of main characters. As the group travels the encounter many tasks and adventures that set the pace for the book. But at one point in the book they split up and it is back to the single main character.Throughout the book the characters are trying to find secret treasure and travel the land. They meet new friends along the way and also have to fight off orcs and other dangerous foes. Then they arrive at the task of finding the treasure and they realize it's guarded by the giant dragon. Taking control of the treasure then becomes the main goal of the group.This book is a truly interesting one that will entertain people of all ages. The great plot, characters and setting will draw you in and ensure your interest. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"The Hobbit or There and Back Again\\" is the first story of Middle-Earth that was ever read by the masses.

For those who read &quot;The Hobbitt&quot; in their English classes and were bored, I feel pity. It is obvious that these young readers did not understand a word that Tolkien wrote. &quot;The Hobbitt&quot; was the vehicle that launched the entire genre of fantasy, and when viewed with that in mind, it becomes evident as to why &quot;The Hobbitt&quot; has a great deal in common with many other works of fantasy. To put it plainly, other writers have taken Tolkien's ideas, and put them to their own use. For those who had difficulty with the place names, just remember that Tolkien was a master of the English language -- don't expect yourself to understand everything he wrote, especially if you're still learning about the language. If you are one of those who thought Tolkien's grammar poor, then... well, you're just wrong. You have to know the rules in order to break them well, and Tolkien most certainly knew the rules. Finally, for those who simply found &quot;The Hobbitt&quot; boring, I would suggest that you read it when you are older; perhaps then you will begin to fathom the depth and richness of Tolkien's world."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I could not believe the content.

Tolkien wrote The Hobbit in 1937, but it was revised in 1966 to fit the plot of the later three books in the lord of the rings series. The revised edition was not printed until 1982. This fantasy is a prelude to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It is Bilbo's story of Thorin (son of Thrain son of Thror, king under the mountain)'s quest to recapture his grandfathers long lost treasures. Gandalf, a Wizard, received a map from Thorin's father on his death bead with instructions to give it to Thorin, the rightful heir of the map and helped him find a party to go on his quest. The group included Bilbo the hobbit-burglar, Killi, Fili, Dori, Nori, Ori, Bombur, Bilfur, Bofur, Oin, Gloin, Dwalin, Balin, and Thorin, all dwarves. They faced many challenges on their journey. They had a conflict with the wolves, the elves, old fat spiders that would love to eat dwarves for supper, and most of all Smaug, the dragon of the mountain.Tolkien chose third person omniscient to write The Hobbit. It is almost exclusively told from Bilbo's point of view. He also chose to have the narrator talk to the audience, which seems unusual for a novel.&quot;Well, you will see whether he gained anything in the end.&quot; Pg 2.Tolkien has a distinctive writing style:&quot;Bilbo found sitting on the doorstep lonesome and wearisome-there was not a doorstep, of course, really, but they used to call the little grassy space between the wall and the opening the \\"doorstep\\" in fun remembering Bilbo's words long ago at the unexpected party in his hobbit hole, when he said they could sit on the doorstep till they thought of something. And sit they did, or wandered aimlessly about and glummer and glummer they became.&quot; pg. 205-206.It is oblivious that he did a beautiful job incorporating description and the plot into the same paragraphs to create a story that is constantly moving, yet full of imagery.A less appealing aspect of his writing is the way the author gave oral storyteller foreshadowing such as the last sentence of this quote:&quot;\\"I am too fat for such fly-walks,\\" he said. \\"I should turn dizzy and tread on my beard, and then you would be thirteen again. And the knotted ropes are too slender for my weight.\\" Luckily for him that was not true, as you will see.&quot; Pg. 207This seems to take your train of thought out of the book. Foreshadowing should be something that requires the reader to scrutinize the dialog and descriptions for clues that can be combines to deduce how the story will unfold.I recommend the Hobbit to anyone whether they have loved or despised fantasies in the past. The plot will keep anyone interested in the book until the end, and it takes less than a dozen pages to develop.

Because hobbits are kind by nature he invited Gandalf (the wizard) to tea for the next day after refusing to go on the journey. Bilbo got annoyed because Gandalf wouldn't leave so he closed his hobbit-hole door, at that moment Gandalf put a sign on his door without Bilbo noticing. The next day an unexpected party of dwarfs showed up for tea and Gandalf came after the last dwarf. That's where the Bilbo's quest began with Gandalf and the dwarfs."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit, written by J.R.R. Tolkien is the best book I have ever read. The story of Bilbo's journey is exciting, adventurous, and keeps you wanting to read. The Hobbit has many thrilling stories inside the long tale. This book was just fun to read! It is easy to follow and understand, while it still vastly describes the world of Middle Earth, created by Tolkien. It gives a better understanding of Tolkien's world and is a good intro to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The Hobbit can be enjoyed by all ages and should be part of everybody's bookshelves."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"~The Hobbit is a great introduction to Middle Earth. The Hobbit is a much easier novel to read than the Lord of the Rings, and is just as good. The novel is also more lighthearted and aimed at younger readers. Tolkein is a masterful story teller, and I could sense the enjoyment he must have felt from telling his stories. The way he writes, the words he uses, shows the fun he had writing this novel. However, I feel there is somewhat less excitement in this novel than in the Lord of the Rings.~~ Maybe it is because the Lord of the Rings is longer or has graver consequences. Anyway, it is still a enjoyable read, and much quicker to finish than the Lord of the Rings.What is it about. Bilbo Baggins has an adventure, which is quite unusual for Hobbits. He with a group of dwarves set out to slay the mighty dragon Smaug and recover their treasure. There are many obstacles in reaching the dragon, and then the must find a way to rid their treasure of its guardian. Now that I have~~ read the Silmarillion and Unfinished Tales, one of my favorite parts of reading the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings is noting references by Tolkien to Gondolin or Beren or Turgon.If you have seen the movies, and are interested in Tolkien's novels, this is a great one to start with. His novels are the best fantasy novels I've read.~"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I am a 10 year old boy who read the hobbit. The book begins in the Shire were Billbo, Hobbit, lives.

Tolkien 0-345-33968-1How would you feel if a weird group of people came to your house and told you to come with them on a crazy journey? That is what happened to the hobbit Bilbo Baggines, in The Hobbit. Bilbo was one night quietly drinking tea at his home in the Shire when a group of dwarves came to his house. They were called Thorin and Company and were out to kill the dragon Smaug who had stole their gold. The next morning Bilbo hurries out his door to met with Thorin and Company. Their adventure starts when they met some trolls. Will they escape?! Well to find out read this brilliant fantasy.I enjoyed this book because it had action, suspense, and a good story line. I feel this book has eye-popping characters and settings. While I was reading this book some thoughts I had were are they going to make it to Smaug the dragon, if they are going to kill Smaug, and make it home safely. I think this book is special because the adjectives are amazing and so are the creatures. I recommend this book because I feel everybody can relate to fantasies. I rate this book as terrific.

They are also called halflings, and are very plump and like to eat about twelve meals a day. Our story begins with a hobbit named Bilbo and he gets a visit from a wizard by the name of Gandalf. They talk and the next day some dwarves come and they ask to go on a journey to get their gold and treasures back from a dragon named Smog in the lonely mountain. So he agrees and they go on a long an perilous journey. Along their way the meet a slew of different creatures; evil and good. For example they meet: orcs, worgs, trolls, goblins, and an evil creature named Gollum. They also meet good creatures like elves dwarves and eagles. So as they were going through the misty mountains, Bilbo meets this creature and his name is Gollum. Gollum wants to eat Bilbo so they play a riddle game and Bilbo gets the better of him and Gollum tries to find him but Bilbo found this ring and it gave him the power to be invisible. So he gets out and meets up with his dwarven friends and they continue to the lonely mountain. They get to the lonlely mountain by the expense of a couple of their friends. They fight Smog and it ends heroicly. It was a great book and I will reread it someday."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"For all of you people who have read the Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien, and want to know just how Bilbo Baggins came to obtaining the Ring of Power, this is the book for you. Immerse yourself into a world of fantasy where hobbits, elves, trolls, goblins, humans, etc. roam the lands of Middle Earth. Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit, is approached one day by the wizard, Gandalf. Bilbo must go on a journey where he travels over great mountains, through the depths of ancient forests, and inside dark tunnels where he obtains the ring of power. Bilbo's journey is full of peril and only his heroism will make him acheive his goal and finish the journey.A weakness in the book is that Tolkien can be describing an action scene but sometimes it can be hard to picture in your mind because everything happens so fast. I wish that this book gave more detail about gollum, because he is so cool, Precious.Overall, Tolkien's books bring you into a world where you feel as if you are part of the story. While reading this book, I felt as if I was right there with Bilbo, fighting off goblins and traveling Middle Earth."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"Far over the misty mountains cold, To dungeons deep and caverns cold We must away, ere break of day, To find our long forgotten gold\\". The powerful words of this brief poem describe, in depth, the storyline of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit. Its powerful words describe the storyline of this novel. The author tells the entertaining story of the adventures of a Hobbit by the name of Bilbo Baggins and a rag-tag team of dwarves as they travel to avenge their ancestors' deaths at the hands of an evil force. Their adventures take them through the deepest, darkest, and most vile places in a land called Middle Earth. The magnificence of the author's word choice allows the reader to almost hear the sounds of battle cries and water dripping in a dark cavern. This is clearly the work of a genius.The story begins in a place called the Shire, which is the home of our hero, Bilbo. The arrival of a famous wizard, Gandalf, disturbs his peace. Gandalf brings with him a party of uncivilized dwarves on a quest to reclaim the gold plundered by an ancient foe. They convince him to go with them into the depths of the unknown, fighting trolls, giant spiders, dragons, and even worse! When it comes down to it, Bilbo must make a split-second decision that could save them all, or condemn them all to death.The setting of the novel is one of the key elements in the book. The unreal location of the novel gives the story a much more fantasy tone, the intention of the author. The author creates a new world, completely different from the known world. This world that Tolkien creates is a magnificent world filled with secret doors in mountains, dark, dark forests, and rivers of water so murky that one could never to see the bottom. It is a truly marvelous spectacle.Spawned in this superlative land, are the characters of this novel. Each character shows a distinctive set of traits. No two characters act the same, which adds to the magnificence of the novel. The intricate detail that Tolkien uses in his imagery enables the reader to mentally draw a picture of each and every character.Tolkien's attention to detail flows straight into the plot, a riveting, spellbinding experience. The story flow is very fluid, with very few jumps or shifts. Each part either progresses the plot, or explains a trait of one of the characters. Unexpected twists and turns in the plot add to the splendor of the novel.Tolkien uses the language of the Middle Ages to make the novel a true work of art. Mostly associated with the Middle Ages, the Old English dialog flows into the novel, making it seem as old as the time of the setting.All of these elements combine to form a literary masterpiece, suitable for all. A spectacular adventure unfolds before anyone who reads this novel. Life and death, loss and gain. All of these and more await within the pages of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book was so entertaining. I couldn't put it down. The topics were so interesting and I loved when all 14 of them came to Beorn. The most interesting parts were when they were fighting the goblins while Poor Bilbo was facing Gollum in a riddle contest."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I received the Hobbit as a gift when I was very young. Reading it then, I was enthralled by the adventure and the action and the strange creatures. I couldn't help but wish I had a magical ring too as a child.I'm older now, and enjoy the Hobbit for the messages and the characters, as well as the excitement and fantasy. And, much to my surprise, I find it a much faster read than the Lord of the Rings. Like a magical fable, it simply flows from chapter to chapter until it reaches a magical completion.The Hobbit is much more lighthearted than its successor trilogy, and well-suited to children of all ages. All that is required is a love of fantasy and escape that's missing in today's world.

It is worth wild to read it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is simply the BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I just simply love it! My favorite part was the part where Bilbo challenges Gollum to a riddle game. The two had a deal. If Gollum won, Bilbo was lunch, but if Bilbo won, Gollum had to show him the way out of the gobin's layer. Bilbo won and then Gollum got mad. Gollum went a way to find his ring that could make one invisible. He was planning to surprise Bilbo and when Bilbo finally sees Gollum, it would be too late for Bilbo. But Gollum couldn't find it! Bilbo had it. He found out when he put the ring on and Gollum ran past him, trying to find his ring. Then Gollum sat down, whimpering the most horrible sound, whining the instructions to get out of the cave because he thought Bilbo already knew and Bilbo just wanted to get his ring. Bilbo followed Gollum's instructions and rode on Gollum's boat ( Gollum was rowing his boat to the entrance so he could find out if Bilbo had escaped.) The only problem with doing this was that Gollum wouldn't dare go near the goblins, though he sometimes ate them, but only with his ring on, so Bilbo had to jump. Unfortunatly, Gollum either heard or smelt him just when he was jumping. Gollum grabbed for Bilbo but missed. Bilbo finally got to the entrance but to his mishap, it was guarded by goblins. Fortunatly, Bilbo had the ring so he just walked past the goblins. Then the scariest part happens. The ring fails Bilbo and the goblins sees him. Luckily, he got out and returned to his friends. The reason why I like this part is because it makes you keep on reading and it is hair-raising. I could go on, babbling about the rest of the story but I can't because of the maximum of words. Still, I think you would enjoy it. You ought to read this book. It is, as I said, simply the best. No other book could out do The Hobbit, except for, maybe, the rest of the series.

I'm waiting to see if the movie does it justice. I will read it again after seeing the movie."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"J. R. R. Tolkien's The Hobbit is the epitome of classic tales of adventure. It allows the reader to venture on a journey impossible to take in the real world. Adults are reverted to their childhood ways while reading about the encounters Bilbo, Gandalf, and the dwarves face during their voyage. Tolkien's skill in entertaining was clearly shown in this literary work. Even though The Hobbit is not as well known or recognized like Tolkien's later work, it is still greatly acknowledged as the book that started a great series, and also launched his career as an important figure in entertainment.Tolkien's use of imagery is what helps this book flow so well. Tolkien, by using imagery and literary devices, displays a journey that the readers feel they are a part of. Tolkien's simple syntax gives the story an old-timely effect. This makes the story feel like it is a treasured legend recorded on paper. The simple syntax gives almost a play-by-play account of Bilbo's journey, allowing the reader to closely follow along with Bilbo and the troops' every action. This allusion makes the book more enticing, and engages the reader into the book. The author's expansion of certain made-up words, places, people, etc. keeps the reader informed and saves them from becoming confused and disinterested. These literary strengths make The Hobbit an extraordinary and classic adventure novel.Although The Hobbit is an interesting read, the plot itself has some holes that left the reader questioning what had occurred. These gaps, as minor as they are, still draw attention and create some confusion. The flow of the book is consistent, but it is clear that the middle to the end is more rushed than the beginning. In the beginning, Tolkien used great detail in describing context, characters, and plot that it set the reader on a steady pace. However, towards the end of the book Tolkien greatly quickened the pace of the events, resulting in a rushed feeling. Tolkien's flaws altogether are still minor compared to the literary strengths he displays.This book is a classic adventure novel that is altogether very well written. Tolkien, after gaining a reputation from The Hobbit, later goes on to write his famed trilogy The Lord of the Rings. While The Hobbit may be lesser known than his other works, it is a great read and undeniably entertaining."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"A lot of life makes more sense now.

Most of them focused on Tolkien's literary inspiration for certain stories and characters and only a handful had the cross-referencing to the Lord of the Rings which I would have preferred.

As i'm sure pretty much every one knows what a hobbit is but for the benefit of the people who do not the foggiest idea what a hobbit is I will type the books explaination .If you have read the book don't bother reading this explanation if you don't wan't to.They are (or were) a little people, about half our height, and smaller than the bearded dwarves. Hobbits have no beards. There is little or no magic about them, except the ordinary everyday sort which helps them to disappear quietly and quickly when large stupid folk like you or me come blundering along, making a noise like elephants which they can hear a mile off. They are inclined to be fat in the stomach; they dress in bright colours (chiefly green and yellow); wear no shoes, because their feet grow natural leathery soles and thick warm brown hair like the stuff on their heads (which is curly); have long clever brown fingers, good- natured faces, and a laugh deep fruity laughs (especially after dinner, which they have twice a day when they can get it).Many people say they prefer the hobbit to the Lord Of The Rings for two simple reasons.1) It is easier to read and a lot less complicated.2) It has a better story line.The hobbit is absoulutely fantastic!

I think (and if you read Tolkien's biography), that Tolkein started this prequil to the Lord of the Rings triliogy in a state of lymbo. Tolkien wanted to write this book (or story as it started out) in a manner so that his children could enjoy it. Nevertheless, when this story was started, many read it and were impressed by the imaginative descriptions that are in the book. People took interest, and the rest, they say, is history. Tolkien's character developments of both Bilbo and Gandalf seemed to be in this book, quite a bit more shallow then they later appeared in the following Lord of the Rings books. Tolkein had no idea where he was going with these books, and probably didn't even slightly consider the probility of continuing the Middle-Earth saga after the advent of the first book. Thus, as a result, Tolkein takes each character in the rest of the trilogy, and delves deep into the workings of their minds. Thus, the overall story turns into something epic, rather than your average fight-the-dragon-and-go-home-with-the-gold-later type of story. Tolkien was surely a master wordsmith, and will probably be considered for the rest of time. And only through Tolkien's imignation and variety do we get a great work like that of the Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have noticed that the people who have given this book a bad name have either had the book forced upon them by a teacher or just simply tried to be smart-asses.

High adventure for readers of any age awaits in these pages. An example, from my dog eared copy: While seeking shelter in a cave from a storm, Bilbo &quot;dreamed that the floor of the cave was giving way, and he was slipping--beginning to fall down, down, goodness knows where to. At that he woke up with a horrible start, and found that part of his dream was true. A crack had opened at the back of the cave, and was already a wide passage. He was just in time to see the last of the ponies' tails disappearing into it. Of course he gave a very loud yell, as loud a yell as a hobbit can give, which is surprising for their size. Out jumped the goblins, big goblins, great ugly-looking goblins, lots of goblins, before you could say 'rocks and blocks.' There were six to each dwarf, at least, and two for Bilbo; and they were grabbed and carried through the crack before you could yell 'tinder and flint.'&quot; The Hobbit is unparalleled as a fantasy children's book, and is adored by adults as well. It's even better when you read it to your kids!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a good one, this book. The Hobbit's title character, Bilbo, is a vertically impaired stout little creature of middle earth. His, as well as the entire race of Hobbit's philosophy is one of rest and good food (one I like a lot!) He intends fully on fullfilling this lifestyle, until one day a party of treasure hunters show up at his door and he is pulled into the adventure of a lifetime. This is an absolute fabulous fantasy book! Bilbo is one of the most likeable, (yet unlikely) heroes of all times! There are also many other fun characters, like Smog the dragon, Gollum and his &quot;precious&quot;, and the dwarf treasure seekers. J.R.R. Tolkien is truly the master of the old time fantasy"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Nice version of the story. It was difficult to find the basic Hobbit book since most of the selections revolved around the recent movie. We must remember to keep the classics available to readers."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"With Peter Jackson's movie, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, due to hit the theaters next weekend, I thought I'd do some homework and re-read the book.Normally I don't re-read books, because there's so many other stories I have yet to discover. Until now, I've only re-read two other tales, which were also in response to upcoming movie buzz: Starship Troopers and Lord of the Rings (which I count as one story).In this case, the version I chose to read was Douglas A. Anderson's The Annotated Hobbit, my sister gave me years ago. I first read The Hobbit way-back-when in junior high school and it was my first introduction to high fantasy literature. While I remembered the basic plot and all the major characters, there were a lot of details I've forgotten.Like The Hobbit was written for children in the UK back in 1937 (and was published a year later in the US). While the book is narrated as if it is being read aloud to children, the storyline is certainly one adults of all ages have enjoyed through the years--and continue to do so.This annotated version is especially interesting and helpful. There is a 28-page Introduction, which includes a short bio of J.R.R. Tolkien and a publishing history of the book (which makes up the bulk of the intro), along with some anecdotes on such things as runes and other mythological reference material.The narrative of The Hobbit itself is sandwiched between Anderson's copius footnotes. These sidebars contain information ranging from 1-sentence definitions to historical, literary and philological information, which can run for two or more pages.At first I was determined to read every footnote, so I could later brag about my scholarly knowledge of Middle Earth lore and Real Earth publishing history. But alas; I grew weary of having to step out of the story to read the sidebar stuff. So I limited my note-reading to only those items that interested me--and were a few sentences long. If I really need to know a piece of Tolkien trivia, I can look it up later."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"In a hole in the ground, there lived a hobbit.\\" J.R.R. Tolkien first scribbed down the opening line of this book on an extra sheet of paper.And years before \\"Lord of the Rings\\" was seen by anyone outside Tolkien's circle, Middle Earth was first introduced to readers. \\"The Hobbit\\" is simpler and less epic than the trilogy that followed it, but Tolkien's brilliant writing, magical world and pleasantly stodgy hero bring a special life to this early fantasy classic. And with the first \\"Hobbit\\" movie coming out in a few months, it deserves revisiting.Bilbo Baggins lives a pleasantly stodgy and dull life, in a luxurious hobbit hole under a hill (\\"it was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort\\"). He's the picture of dull respectability.But his life is turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves, led by the exiled king-in-waiting Thorin Oakenshield. They want to reclaim the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar, even though Bilbo has never burgled in his life.So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable -- and dangerous -- adventure. The quirky little band ends up battling goblins and spiders, nearly getting eaten, and imprisoned by Elves, while Bilbo finds himself in possession of a magic Ring from the treacherous Gollum. But even with a magic Ring, can he defeat a monstrous dragon and win a war against multiple enemies?Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and ancient Men for years before he ever came up with Bilbo's quest. But it's fortunately that he did, because while \\"The Hobbit\\" is overshadowed by the epic sweep of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and the \\"Silmarillion,\\" it's still an entertaining story that lays the groundwork for his more famous works -- especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.Tolkien's writing is swift, light and full of songs and poetry-laden descriptions, such as interludes in the shimmering, ethereal Rivendell and the cold, terrible Lonely Mountain. The pace in this is much faster than in most of his other works -- not surprising, when you consider it was originally a bedtime story for his children.Most of the book's action is about Bilbo trying to keep himself and the dwarves from getting eaten, torn apart, or rotting in elf dungeons, but with some quiet interludes like a night at Beorn's mountain home. And the last chapters hint at the epic majesty that Tolkien was capable of, as well as the idea that even little people -- like a mild-mannered hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.This book also first came up with hobbits -- the peaceful fuzzy-footed countryfolk -- in the form of Bilbo Baggins. He's a likable little guy, if the last person you'd ever expect to be a hero -- initially he seems weak and kind of boring, but his hidden strengths and wits come up to the surface when he needs to. By the end, he's almost a different person.The dwarves are more comical, and the elves more whimsical in this book, but the supporting characters are still impressive -- the crotchety, mysterious wizard Gandalf, the dignified, flawed Dwarf king Thorin Oakenshield, and a Guardsman who becomes a king. Even minor characters like Beorn, Elrond and the menacing Smaug are given plenty of dimension.The main distinguishing characteristic of this edition of \\"The Hobbit\\" is apparently that, while unabridged, it's small. Very small. About four by six inches.\\"The Hobbit\\" started as a fluke, grew into a bedtime story, and became one of the best fantasy stories in literary history -- a charming adventure in the time that never was. Brilliant."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This story was written by J.R.R.Tolkein as merely a bedtime story for children. But then he wrote further, resulting into one of the great epic of the world, The Lord of the Rings.The story tells us about the very first adventure of Bilbo Baggins out of shire and he got the Ring. After reading LoTR, I thought this story wont impress me much, but I was wrong. I was totally lost in this story as I was in LoTR's. It is a part of LoTR and a standalone story both. I loved Bilbo as much as I loved Frodo, infact, more than Frodo.The difference between other authors and Tolkein is that Tolkein wrote like he was actually telling the story himself and didnt write it just as a book or novel. You're sure to get lost in his world and feel yourself with the characters.Making a journey to Middle-Earth is one of the few good things you'll do in your life."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Have you seen the movies called The Lord Of The Rings Parts 1-3? Well, then you would like The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien. The Hobbit is where The Lord Of The Rings all began. In the fantasy world of The Hobbit the reader gets attached to the crazy characters through the eye of the narrator.The Hobbit's time period is the ancient time between the age of the faerie and the time of men. The Hobbits are little people with brown curly hair who wear bright colors. They live in hills and green lands and live near water. Bilbo Baggins was a respected member of the Hobbits.The story began when Bilbo is craving for adventure. Bilbo gets along with people and he has a funny side to him. Bilbo is a good character who is very nice to the people around him.Here are some reasons why you would enjoy The Hobbit. The book's characters are lively and funny. There are goblins who are not smart. There is adventure and mystery in the book. There are dark caves and different types of people like elves, Hobbits, and goblins. This book is a fantasy book that is a good fantasy book.J.R.R. Tolkien was one of the best twentieth century authors. Tolkien's writing is funny and his charters seem to have a real life. Some of his quotes are funny like\\"Don't be a fool Mr.Baggins if you can help it.\\" I thought that the book was enjoyable and funny. I would recommend this book to fantasy lovers."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"for me, this is a very enjoyable dramatization indeed. True, elderly, humorless, die hard Tolkein fans will probably find it corny - it was, a bit. Sometimes the sound effects are strange and laughable, but what's wrong with laughing? Given that it was recorded nearly 20 years ago you have to give it some leeway for less than perfect sound affects. For the most part I thought the acting was brilliant (save Gandalf, perhaps, whose voice might have better belonged to a man hawking fake Rolexes in central park), especially Bilbo. So, take my advice and give this recording a chance. My guess is you'll have more fun listening to this than listening to a bland but accurate unabridged reading of The Hobbit. Btw, if you have children and want to introduce them to Tolkein, but are reluctant to lay the whole epic at their feet quite yet, this would ideal for them."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It's hard to say why I never read the Hobbit before the age of 36. I was a sci-fi fan that dabbled in fantasy. I even played Dungeons and Dragons, but did so with an ignorance of its Tolkien roots. And no surprise, I had friends that were heavily into Tolkien as well.And then I saw Lord of the Rings...The Hobbit is an amazing read, telling the tale of a Mr. Bilbo Baggins of the Shire who cares little for adventures until Gandalf...Gandalf! ...arrives at his door. Soon Bilbo is swarmed by dwarves, and battles the uncertainty about his thieving skills by committing to join them and steal the treasure of the deadly Dragon Smaug.From this point we are launched into a fascinating tale filled with wondrous creatures and places, including the finding of the Ring, and end up with a multi-race epic battle.The Hobbit is a classic...there is no doubt, but what kept me from reading it all these years? I think the fact that many from my generation equated the Hobbit with the (often) geeky Dungeons and Dragons crowd.Whatever your reason for not reading the Hobbit, I ask you to reconsider. No avid reader, no matter what genre they favor, should have a book collection devoid of the Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The clarity of this audio version was absolutely wonderful.

This was a class assignment and I was able to listen to this with great ease."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"One of the best children's novels ever written, The Hobbit is a wonderful tale of Wizards, Dwarves, Elves, Dragons and of course Hobbits. The Hobbit is Bilbo Baggins and we follow his adventures as he journeys to the Lonely Mountain with Gandalf the Wizard and twelve dwarves.It is a tale where Bilbo discovers that adventures aren't so bad after all, and the Dwarves discover that there is more to Mr. Baggins than meets the eye. Although the Lord of the Rings is a sequel of sorts to the Hobbit, the Hobbit is a children's book and is written in a much different style than LOTR."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I just got done reading this. I loved this book! It's got moments when it's adventurous (?), funny, sad, and moments when these elements are mixed. Some people complain about how 'bilbo gets out of stuff to easy'. They obviously zoned out some when they missed Tolkien reminding us that Bilbo's luck was very high. Very interesting. Pulls you in once they actually begin their adventure.An interesting read. Five outta five! :)"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"The Hobbit or There and Back Again\\" is the first story of Middle-Earth that was ever read by the masses. And to this day it remains a beloved favorite due to Tolkien's exceptional writing, realistic and lovable characters, and the fantastic, complicated world with its unlikely hero: a fuzzy-footed hobbit.Bilbo Baggins lives a pleasantly stodgy and dull life in the Shire, in a luxurious hole under a hill. (\\"It was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort\\") But his life is completely turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves. The dwarves, led by the exiled king-in-waiting Thorin Oakenshield, want to regain the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug, who drove out the dwarves long ago. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar (even though Bilbo has never burgled in his life).So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable -- and dangerous -- adventure. Bilbo and the Dwarves battle goblins and spiders, are nearly eaten twice, are captured and Bilbo is forced to riddle with the treacherous, withered Gollum, and ends up escaping with a magical Ring. But even after these obstacles, the dragon Smaug is still in the Lonely Mountain, and Bilbo is not entirely sure what to do to deal with this enemy.Author J.R.R. Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and Men for years before writing \\"The Hobbit,\\" but \\"The Hobbit\\" is the first story that people had the opportunity to read. It began as a line scrawled on a sheet of blank paper, and then into a bedtime story for his children. And even though it's overshadowed by \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"Silmarillion,\\" this book is an essential link. It's definitely sillier and lighter, but it provides the springboard for a lot of the stuff in \\"Lord of the Rings\\" -- especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.The concept of hobbits started in this book -- the quintessential peaceful \\"wee\\" people, based on British countryfolk, with simple pleasures and unexpected depths of strength and resourcefulness. And, of course, fuzz on their large feet. Tolkien's Elves are a little more ethereal and less dignified, and his dwarves are a bit more comical and less grim. But Elrond hints at the full majesty of the Elves, and Thorin Oakenshield is still the most dignified, proud and impressively flawed dwarf there is. The last chapters of the book hint at the epic majesty of \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" and some of the same victory/loss themes. And of course, the idea that even little people -- like a hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.Tolkien's writing is quick and light, while providing sufficient detail to let you picture what's going on. The dialogue is less influenced by Old English, and the pace is a lot faster (not surprising, since it was originally read to his kids before bedtime). Bilbo is a likable little guy -- he seems to be the last person whom you'd expect to be a courageous hero, but he shows incredibly strength and smarts when he's under pressure. Supporting characters like Thorin, Bard the Guardsman-turned-King, the king of the wood-elves, and even Smaug himself are never cookie-cutter -- each is given his own quirks and strengths.With the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" movie trilogy solidly entrenched in pop culture, J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"The Hobbit\\" is now receiving a well-deserved boost of attention. Rarely has a bedtime story for children become such a beloved story."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"If you are looking for a good Fantasy story for the kids this Christmas, you would do very well in choosing The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien. Mostly, this is because of the way in which details are presented and built into the proceedings in a clever yet uncomplicated fashion, which adds a lot of variety to the reading experience.The start of the book is somewhat simplistic because of the writing style, but this passes after the first couple of chapters, and develops into writing as sophisticated as the best of those writing Fantasy today. And it is surprising how much of the book is used by others for their own creations.The Hobbit is also a good choice for those intending to read the Lord of the Rings, since Ganadalf and Bilbo feature extensively in both books."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit was one of the most fun books I have ever read.

Unfortunately, there's so many of them that they frequently appear a couple of pages after they're noted so you have to turn forward to find out that \\"South\\" was changed to \\"Southwest\\" and then you've broken the flow of the story. The Hobbit itself is a great read-aloud story and some of the annotations are surprising and interesting... but the mundane and boring annotations really weigh the book down compared to the annotations in Alice or Fairy Tales."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"The Hobbit\\" by JRR TOLKIENTolkien never lived to see the glorious acceptance of his labor of love, but it is as though the story poured forth directly from his heart into the hearts of a public much in need in a reaffirmation of the values we all share with his little people of the Shire: Food, presents, pipe and bowl, and tales of adventures to warm cozy evenings by a fire with tea and cakes. Somewhere, in Tolkien's heaven, his heart has rest, for all of this joy given cannot go unrewarded.I feel that Tolkien showed us, through various races which peopled his Middle Earth, the various phases of human development. The races are earthy, airy, watery, and finally, fiery. The amazing Hobbits seemed to hold the balance necessary. They valued gold without greed, friends without demanding power over others, and family lineage, wherein even those of a \\"Tookish\\" nature could find acceptance in a neighborhood. Fundamentally, they were farm folk and tradesmen. One cannot help but observe there was a minimum of financiers in the Shire. Everybody works in the Shire, and elsewhere in Middle-Earth, soldiering is seen.Only a children's story? A book for children of all ages is more the case. Though the story originated in the childhood imagination of Tolkien on the foggy downs of England, it shows us a very subtle construction, a woven fabric of esotericism. At the pinnacle of the weave is the great advancement of the Wizards. Wizards have every opportunity to develop as Gandalf, full of fiery power, yet ever-vigilant and self-sacrificing; yet, as we are later to learn, sometimes they become susceptible to selfishness, self-centeredness, and a megalomanical preoccupatin with EGO and power. Wizards can fall from the grace which elevated them.Essential to all understanding of the adventures of the Hobbit is the fact that Bilbo Baggins does not like adventures at all. When Gandalf chooses Bilbo to host Thorin Oakenshield's party of Dwarves, Bilbo gives his opinion of Adventures thusly:\\"Nasty, disturbing, uncomfortable things! Make you late for dinner!\\"The excitement is infectious as the troop encounters many dangers, for not all problems can be solved by the powerful axes of the dwarves. Sometimes, only the peculiar stubborn courage of the little Hobbit can get the troop out of harm's way. All along the journey, wondrous creatures are met; Elves, Men, and dangerous things of darkness and shadow, ending with an encounter with a dragon.****So How Does Tolkien Write So Magically?****Tolkien compresses TIME. Alternatively, he decompresses TIME. He does this by presenting history, events, and other characters through a very childlike perception of time. Sometimes vast epochs are explained in a single paragraph, or several generations of Hobbit, Dwarf, Elven or Human history are presented in a blur. Chronological events and occurrances are alternatively slowed or speeded up in the telling. TIME is magical for Tolkien. The reader is captured and fascinated, led along a narrative path like a child, sometimes fully awake, observing a blur of rapid action. Other times, it is though the reader is in a half-sleep, a \\"dreamtime\\" and unsure of the measurements of minutes, hours, days, years and epochs of time.This \\"child-time\\" is the distinct voice Tolkien achieves, causing many readers to view the Hobbit as a children's story, distinct from Lord of the Rings. It is not a different story. It is that the Hobbit represents the psyche before it awakens. It's primary concerns are creature comforts, rather than adventures.In the Hobbit adventure, it is far too early to present the power of Tolkien's purpose in its full revelation. Tolkien must allow us to wake up gradually. That is the adventure he invites us to take. The fullness of the truth is not yet shown. Tolken needs for the reader to develop an adventurous spirit.This shows itself by comparing the Hobbits. First is Bilbo Baggins, who grows by every adventure; but for Bilbo, the Shire can still be a home, at least, for many more years. Second, Frodo never expects to return to the Shire. Frodo lives, believing that only death awaits him, but his childlike psyche is now transformed into that of a fully-developed spiritual identity. Now he knows. The childlike dreamworld is gone. If Frodo fails, he knows Middle Earth will fall into despair. Frodo knows, what Gandalf and Aragorn knows. Bilbo had the assurance that the Shire would always be there. Frodo sees that if he fails his quest, all of Middle Earth will literally fall under the Shadow. Frodo's is not the psyche of the child-like Hobbit.Tolkien's masterpiece has much in common with C. S. Lewis' \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\". In both, martyrdom of self is very real. In LOTR, Frodo willingly marches to his own death, obeying the call to duty which bound the Fellowship. This compels him to an ultimate act of self-sacrifice, just as Aslan in the \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\" orchestrates his own martyrdom, to save a Son of Adam.The same device may be found in the tale of \\"Peter Pan\\" who claimed that he never wanted to grow up, and yet he fought a very real evil in Captain Hook.Tolkien & Lewis seem to have offered a clarion call to man, inviting us to transcend the mere pursuit of comfort, and to enter into the conflict between Good and Evil. It is nearly impossible to claim either author as superior. They are both exceedingly good.With childlike wonder we learn in this dear tale a simple truth that we find in other literature; the simple fact that conflict is seldom far, and Evil is always to be countered with courage. The reader may not remember the name of he who slays the dragon Smaug, but does it matter? A little reflection upon the character GANDALF will reveal much. --Bruce Bain"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This fantasy tale is actually a prequel or predecessor to Tolkein's famous epic, the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It is required reading for any serious student of fantasy or speculative fiction and I recommend it enthusiastically. J. R. R. Tolkein (1892-1973) was a noted philologist who was Merton Professor of English Language and Literature at Oxford University as well as a close friend of C. S. Lewis. &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; originally a story written for children, is a tale of the hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, and how he helps a wizard named Gandalf and a group of dwarves in their quest when traveling through a land known as Middle-Earth. Hobbits are little people who are smaller than dwarves, don't have beards, live in holes in the ground, and don't wear shoes. They have hairy feet which have leathery soles. One day, Bilbo is visited by Gandalf and his adventures began. The following day a group of thirteen dwarves, led by Thorin Oakenshield, visited Bilbo with Gandalf. They planned to travel to the Lonely Mountain to recover a treasure that had been stolen by the dragon Smaug many years earlier and they have decided to enlist the aid of Bilbo. In the travels of this troup, they overcome some trolls, find two ancient swords, meet friendly elves, and discover a secret message on their treasure map. They are captured by goblins and rescued by Gandalf. However, Bilbo is separated from the rest and finds himself alone in a dark cave where he meets the creature Gollum. After a contest of riddles, Bilbo escapes Gollum with the aid of a magical ring that he had found in the cave. Upon rejoining Gandalf and the dwarves, the travelers continue their trek but are soon attacked by Wargs (evil wolves). They are rescued once again, this time by giant eagles who fly them to safety.

Confusion is gone, and there is more understanding about certain events and situations which take place.I feel it is a fantastic read for anyone who enjoyed the 'LOTR' novels and wish to discover more of the journeys which lead to those events taking place. It can be a little hard to get into, but once you are there, everything falls into place and you don't want to stop reading."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I started to rate The Hobbit 4 stars, but after less than a minute of thought realized this classic work from my favorite writer deserves the 5 star treatment as the prelude to the best story ever told, The Lord of the Rings books.I didn't read the Hobbit as a child like most, it wasn't until I was 20 something that I did, but at the same time I believe this helped me appreciate the it much more.The tale of Bilbo is the ultimate adventure, and one that everyone can enjoy.Frodo lives, and so does Bilbo."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Bilbo Baggins is the main character in J.R.R. Tolkien's classic, The Hobbit. Bilbo is a quiet little hobbit in a quiet little hobbiton until the well known wizard Gandalf approaches him with the opportunity to go on an adventure. Gandalf is all knowing and knows that Bilbo is the hobbit for the job. Bilbo is reluctant but decides to go. He and Gandalf set out with thirteen dwarfs to retrieve an enormous treasure from the dragon Smaug which he stole from the dwarfs long ago. Bilbo faces many dangers along the way such as goblins, trolls, the infamous Gollum, and a couple of overgrown spiders. I have always enjoyed prequels because they show how everything got started. In this story, readers discover where Gandalf gets his magical sword Glamdring and Bilbo's, soon to be Frodo's, glowing dagger Sting. The most obvious is the bit about Bilbo and Gollum and how Bilbo obtained the one ring to rule them all. The narrator gives the story fairly light heartedly, so take it that way. Do not let the lack of seriousness discourage you from reading any more of the book, just take it for what it is. I liked the light heartedness because that is how I write. This is a great book for anyone who enjoys fantasies."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Ok, some you might think that if you saw the three Lord of the Rings movies you know the whole story, but they did not make the very first book a movie. This book goes right back to the beging of where it came from. \\"The Hobbit\\" tells what Bilbo Baggins did to get the ring, and what happen after that. This book is really a great book. Most of the people that might read this book will love it, and will be reading till the end.

The beginning was kind of slow, but if you keep on reading you can't put it down. I really like how he used the main character as a hobbit (or really small person), instead of this tall, masculine person, who works on a farm, and all the chicks dig him, because people like that have \\"a really hard time proving themselves\\".That why I like The Hobbit, because Bilbo proved himself even though he's three foot tall.It shows us that height and weight have nothing to do with our character. We could be four foot five and two hundred pounds outside, but a seven foot high one hundred forty pound body builder inside."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien was the fist book that I read on my own as a child and it therefore holds a very special place in my heart. The story is not just an adventure story filled with magic and strange and wonderous creatures. It tells the story of Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf and the gang of dwarves (Thorin Oakenshield, Kili, and Fili to mention a few) and their amazing journey to find the treasure guarded by the evil and selfish dragon Smaug. The story is a tale of self discovery, maturity and shows how much Bilbo Baggins changes as a man from the start till the finish. The descriptions used in the book are splendid and the small songs included add allot to the story (something I did not appreciate or understand as a child). I love the narration and I would recommend this splendid tale to not just fantasy fans but to anyone that fancies a good book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Truly a classic in literature.

In fact other than Bilbo's encounter with Gollum, this book has little connection to the trilogy that would follow it other than introducing readers to the world of Middle Earth. In fact, it is written in a completely different style. The prose of The Hobbit has more of a fairy tale feel to it than the straight-forward fantasy of The Lord of the Rings. This gives the book a large appeal to children, but it can still be enjoyed by readers of all ages.In The Hobbit, the wizard Gandalf involves Bilbo in an adventure (despite hobbits' aversion to such escapades) with a company of dwarves. They seek to repossess a treasure that is rightfully theirs and is currently in the lair of the dragon Smaug. Along the way, Bilbo and his companions encounter trolls, elves, goblins, giant spiders, and a host of other fantasy story creatures. Bilbo also encounters the strange creature, Gollum, in a diversion from the main story. In this part of the book, readers meet one of the most memorable creatures of all fantasy literature in a fateful encounter that sets the stage for Frodo's later adventures. Of course Gandalf and Bilbo also rank up there among the most recognized characters of fantasy literature as well.The Hobbit gives readers an introduction to Tolkien's world of Middle Earth which is probably one of the best developed worlds in fantasy literature. Every creature in his world is alive, even the plants and the birds. This gives an animated and lively feel to the world that keeps the reader engrossed in the story. Tolkien also does a masterful job of contrasting the feeling of safety and security in places like the shire and Elrond's home with feelings of dread and uneasiness that the reader experiences as Bilbo and his companions venture through such places as the Goblin caves, Mirkwood, and Smaug's lair. This draws the reader into the story and helps them feel like they are experiencing it with the characters.Tolkien only wrote four complete novels about Middle Earth, The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings trilogy. He also wrote a wealth of background material as well as several short stories about Middle Earth. For the new initiate to Tolkien as well as the young reader, The Hobbit is the place to start. And for those revisiting Middle Earth, The Hobbit reintroduces them to the fantasy world that is as familiar as it is wonderful."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I picked up \\"The Hobbit\\" to start my reading of the Lord of the Rings series. I decided to start at the beginning of the series where the Ring is initially found. Also I wanted to test out J.R.R. Tolkien writing before I dropped $56 on the hardcover box set. Plus my interests into the movies made me want to read the classics.Well once I picked this book up I couldn't put it down. It was very well written. As one of my friends described it \\"It is easy reading\\". It takes you through your imagination senses. Of course it does help to have watched the movies and have a visualization of the characters and the environment in which this tale takes place.The tale is about Biblo Baggins and his adventure with thirteen dwarfs to go after a dragons treasure. Biblo is reluctantly recruited as the burglar for this adventure by Gandolf. Gandolf insists that Biblo is perfect for the job and believes in him whole hardily. As Biblo gains courage in himself he proves to be a leader and is one of the biggest reasons that the group continues on in their journey. Bilbo's courage is amplified once he finds the ring and understands the power it posesses.I found this book to be an excellent read for all ages it truly is a classic. Obviously I give this book a 5 out of 5 rating and will be reading the next three books over time."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is JRR Tolkien's prequel to The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Though it stood on its own legs for 30 years, it is now difficult to disentangle this tale of Bilbo Baggins' adventuring with dwarves and finding of the One Ring from the grandly-scaled tale that would follow. This is a charming story, less an epic than a good old-fashioned tale, as Bilbo, Gandalf, Thorin Oakenshield and the rest trek to the Lonely Mountain to wrest dwarvish gold from the dragon Smaug. Along the way they encounter Beorn the Bear-Man, elves, trolls and giant spiders.This edition is quite beautiful, and would make a lovely gift for someone who has read the story and considers it something special. The binding is dark green and embossed with maroon and gold runes and an image. The paper is heavy and augmented by Tolkien's own illustrations."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit, the prequel to the Lord of the Rings series, is a very well written book, but I recommend it only for those who are true fans of fantasy books. This book is about the expedition of a hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, and a company of dwarves. A wizard, Gandalf, also accompanies the hobbit. They intend to travel to the Lost Mountains to recover the treasure of the dwarves from the dragon, Smaug. Tolkein does very well at describing the adventures of Bilbo and his companions, but sometimes he gets too descriptive and the book gets a little dull. Still, other parts in the book are very exciting. I ended up enjoying this book very much, but I have read better books. This book is not a light book and will take some time to read. Overall, I don't consider this one of Tolkein's best literary works, but it deserves some recognition."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I bought this leatherette edition along with The Lord Of The Rings leatherette edition. I must say, I am a bit miffed by some spelling errors or typos or incorrect tense in the text.

On page 183, Chapter Nine, &Ograve;Each dwarf was blindfold&Oacute;. These are just the ones that I noticed. Are these the errors mentioned in the original, first edition? Or are they new errors committed by Houghton Mifflin? I have read this novel several times in other editions and never seen these errors. The odd use of grammar at times, even ending sentences with a preposition is understandable although curious. But the wrong word entirely isn't likely coming from a Professor of The English Language. The workmanship of the book is acceptable and worthy of the price at Borders/Amazon. The unusually wide margins are a bit strange, but quite handy when holding the book open! The inclusion of the artwork of Tolkien is a welcome treat also.

His voice is clear, resonant and beautiful, and he has created unique voices for each character -- even the fourteen dwarves. He could relate the dialogue with no intervening narration and you would be able to tell who is speaking! In addition, he lends animation to the text, not reading in a dry style, but with appropriate inflection, humor and drama. It's a pleasure to hear this beloved book brought to life by such a talented actor.Minimal packaging of ten CDs, each approximately 1 hour in length.This is a wonderful way to introduce The Hobbit to children, to enjoy the book as a family, or to give to someone who, for whatever reason, can't read the book for themselves."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I just finished reading The Hobbit for the first time in several years and was surprised by it. This novel reads much easier than Tolkien's later books. For anyone who hasn't read Tolkien before and has become interested, the Hobbit is a wonderful place to start. Besides being one of the shortest novels, it also predates The Lord of the Rings, making it chronologically the novel to begin with.The Hobbit is the story of Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo is a hobbit who goes and a grand adventure. Unfortunately, hobbits do not like adventures and Bilbo takes a while becoming comfortable with the situation. The novel takes place predominantly in three parts. Tolkien develops his plot over the first part of the novel as the Dwarves, Gandalf, and Bilbo travel to the Misty Mountains. The second part deals with the adventures reaching the dragon. And, the third part deals with confrontation of the dragon. For novels this size, The Hobbit has more detail and plot than any self contained novel I have read.But, I am decidedly biased in favor of Tolkien. I have read all of his novels at least twice. The open a world full of tragedy and heros. The greatest of his work he never published. However, the Hobbit is the first and inspiration for the Lord of the Rings. Tolkien was a great author, and in writing the Hobbit wrote a novel that can be enjoyed by all ages."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I realize I will be tared and feathered by the hordes of Tolkien Fans but it must be said.... I've read better. The collector's edition of the Hobbit was a gift for my birthday...the book itself is beautifully bound with wonderful illustrations. I'm not saying that I hated the book. It had a wonderful story with interesting ideas and characters (and is a must read for anyone who wishes to attempt to read the Lord of the Rings &quot;series&quot; in it's entirety), but (yes there is a but here) the story can be slow going at times not to mention the big made-up words and names that totally through you off. True, when dealing with a new, made-up world you have new words/names , but you don't need to make them 14 letters long and unpronounceable.So what am I saying? If you want to &quot;collect&quot; books just to say you have them...buy the leather-bound collectors addition.

It is a great story about bravery, suspense, and drama. In the story friends have to trust friends to be able to stay alive. The author ( J.R.R.

But one day a wizard and dwarfes appear at his door wanting him to go on a dangerous adventure with them. At first he says no to the idea, but once he finds out how much gold is in it, he just can't resist. He and the dwarfes face many dangers.

This classic, along with The Trilogy (if you say The Trilogy, most sci-fi readers know you speak of The Lord of the Rings), continues to show its influences on popular science fantasy. I can't think of another series of books that have had such an impact on the world of science fantasy as these four. Even The Chronicles of Narnia come in second place.

If you like fantasy stories at all, this is the greatest. In fact, MOST other fantasy books I've read that have been written since follow this same flow that was established by Tolkein.Tolkein has often been (wrongly) accused of writing this and the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; as a commentary on WWI and WWII. However, the books are written with enought open thought patterns and plots to be applicable to many events and even philosophies that exist among us. You could even apply the though patterns to various religions if you wanted to take that step.

But, while Middle Earth is certainly more complex than Hogwarts, those who sneered at JK Rowling's godawful prose stylings might want to take a look back at Tolkien's first novel."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a prelude to the epic The Lord of the Rings, but it still stands quite well on its own. This story tells of the finding of the Ring of Power, though at the time it seems a mere piece of luck and comes in quite handy for Bilbo during his adventure. More important to this story is the journey of Bilbo and the dwarves toward their ancient home, the Lonely Mountain, where Smaug the dragon sits atop their hoard of treasure. Always, the goal of reaching the mountain and reclaiming the gold (somehow) is foremost in their minds, even though they become sidetracked several times along the way. This is a perfect adventure story, ideal for reading to children or for anyone of any age. Bilbo, a seemingly insignificant person of a seemingly insignificant race of people, is a wonderful hero, as he finds that he possesses more courage and wits than he ever imagined. This is one of those books that everyone should read, if not for its relevance to the Middle-earth saga, but also because it's simply a wonderful story."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a wonderful book to read out-loud. I dont' think I had ever read this before. I know it was assigned reading in middle school, but I never read it then. I have a strong anti-authoritarian streak evidently.I found that Bilbo was quite engaging, as he is somewhat like myself. He likes to eat, and entertain, but doesn't much like uninvited guests. When Bilbo gets a call from a childhood acquaintence, Gandalf the wizard, he gets quite a party of uninvited visitors that accompany Gandalf the next day for tea. The party sets in motion a most tumultuous adventure which is not very hobbit like.Throughout his adventure with the thirteen dwarves, Bilbo grows from a squirming dunderhead in leading his comrades into danger with the trolls, to the fearless leader whilst conversing with a dragon. He proves his bravery many times over. Despite the growth of his testicular fortitude, he remains a humble being. Which is a trait that is perhaps lacking in myself.Some people can go over the top with humility, and in their baseness turn humility into self-depreciation. This Bilbo never does, and I am glad of it. He does not boast of his successes, nor does he lament to long on his follies. The hobbit is too balanced for the everyman appeal, but is fun nonetheless."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"In a hole in the ground, there lived a hobbit.\\" J.R.R. Tolkien first scribbed down the opening line of this book on an extra sheet of paper.And years before \\"Lord of the Rings\\" was seen by anyone outside Tolkien's circle, Middle Earth was first introduced to readers. \\"The Hobbit\\" is simpler and less epic than the trilogy that followed it, but Tolkien's brilliant writing, magical world and pleasantly stodgy hero bring a special life to this early fantasy classic.Bilbo Baggins lives a pleasantly stodgy and dull life, in a luxurious hobbit hole under a hill (\\"it was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort\\"). He's the picture of dull respectability.But his life is turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves, led by the exiled king-in-waiting Thorin Oakenshield. They want to reclaim the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar, even though Bilbo has never burgled in his life.So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable -- and dangerous -- adventure. The quirky little band ends up battling goblins and spiders, nearly getting eaten, and imprisoned by Elves, while Bilbo finds himself in possession of a magic Ring from the treacherous Gollum. But even with a magic Ring, can he defeat a monstrous dragon and win a war against multiple enemies?Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and ancient Men for years before he ever came up with Bilbo's quest. But it's fortunately that he did, because while \\"The Hobbit\\" is overshadowed by the epic sweep of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and the \\"Silmarillion,\\" it's still an entertaining story that lays the groundwork for his more famous works -- especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.Tolkien's writing is swift, light and full of songs and poetry-laden descriptions, such as interludes in the shimmering, ethereal Rivendell and the cold, terrible Lonely Mountain. The pace in this is much faster than in most of his other works -- not surprising, when you consider it was originally a bedtime story for his children.Most of the book's action is about Bilbo trying to keep himself and the dwarves from getting eaten, torn apart, or rotting in elf dungeons, but with some quiet interludes like a night at Beorn's mountain home. And the last chapters hint at the epic majesty that Tolkien was capable of, as well as the idea that even little people -- like a mild-mannered hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.This book also first came up with hobbits -- the peaceful fuzzy-footed countryfolk -- in the form of Bilbo Baggins. He's a likable little guy, if the last person you'd ever expect to be a hero -- initially he seems weak and kind of boring, but his hidden strengths and wits come up to the surface when he needs to. By the end, he's almost a different person.The dwarves are more comical, and the elves more whimsical in this book, but the supporting characters are still impressive -- the crotchety, mysterious wizard Gandalf, the dignified, flawed Dwarf king Thorin Oakenshield, and a Guardsman who becomes a king. Even minor characters like Beorn, Elrond and the menacing Smaug are given plenty of dimension.\\"The Hobbit\\" started as a fluke, grew into a bedtime story, and became one of the best fantasy stories in literary history -- a charming adventure in the time that never was. Brilliant."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Most of us have seen or read the lord of the rings, but have you ever wondered what happened before this?

This story is about a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins and how an adventure changes him and the rest of middle earth.In the hobbit, Bilbo Baggins is met by a wizard named Gandalf, who sends him on an adventure with thirteen dwarves: Thorin, Balin, Dwalin, Dori, Nori, Fili, Kili, Ori, Oin, Gloin, Bifuf, Bofur, and finally, Bombur. These 14 companions are sent on a quest to travel to the Lonely Mountain for the purpose of regaining the dwarves' treasure from the evil dragon, Smaug. On this journey, they will travel across the Misty Mountains, through the Goblin Caves and into the Dark Forest of Mirkwood. They will encounter Elves, Men, Goblins and various creatures of all sorts as they travel across Middle Earth.One such event occurred soon after they left the Shirt. This encounter was with a group of three trolls. After hearing noises in the forest, the dwarves sent Bilbo to investigate. When he did, he found that the trolls were eating. So, he tried to steal from them while they were distracted, but was caught in the act. While a prisoner of the trolls, the dwarves, hearing the commotion, gave themselves away by trying to save Bilbo, causing them to be bagged and thrown by the fire. The trolls then started arguing on how to cook the dwarves and the hobbit. Little did the trolls know, Gandalf was hiding in the bushes where he kept the argument going by disguising his voice as their own. Gandalf kept them arguing until daybreak, knowing that trolls cannot survive sunlight and turn to stone. When daybreak arrived the trolls failed to seek cover from the sun and indeed turned into stone. After this, Bilbo and Gandalf freed the dwarves who were cranky, angry and upset from being in the sack all night. This was just one of many adventures in Professor Tolkien's book The Hobbit.This story has many strengths. I believe the biggest is how Professor Tolkien paints a picture of the character's surroundings. An example is: \\"The lands opened wide about him, filled with the waters of the river which broke up and wandered in a hundred winding courses, or halted in marshes and pools dotted with isles on every side.\\" Another strength is how he leads up to an action scene. An example of this is how he has the dwarves and Bilbo wandering around Mirkwood, chasing lights before they actually get to the spider colony where a battle follows. A third strength is how the author uses song to relate to scenes or stories written the book. An example is from the beginning of the story, when the dwarves are all gathered at Bilbo's house. During this time, Bilbo gets anxious about the dwarves no being gentle with his belongings. So Tolkien ha the dwarves sing a song about breaking his plates when they clean up after a meal. Evan though this is a great book, it does have some weaknesses. One weakness is how the book has more narration then dialogue. An example of this is how Tolkien focuses more upon Bilbo's thoughts during a conversation that he is having than the conversation itself.This book is similar to other fairy tale/medieval novels. This is because of the creatures, weapons, and technologies used. Also, they have castles and every \\"kingdom\\" is for the most part independent and uncaring of one another. It is different from these types of novels because this story is used more as a prologue to The Lord of the Rings than a full story in and of itself.I believe The Hobbit was written for all audiences. Although there can be big words and weird phrases, even young readers would enjoy this wonderful story. The genre of this book is fantasy. I know this because this book has many wonderful fictions characters and places in it. There is no other book in comparison to this one (with the exception of The Lord of the Rings).Ultimately, I believe The Hobbit is one of the best books I've ever read. I think this is because it's written very descriptively and the storyline is amazing. If you enjoy adventure and action, you should read this book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is incredible anyway, but the illustrations make it even more of a delight."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It must be over a decade since I last read this book- and nearly 35 years since I first read it. Yet, when I reread it this week I still became completely engrossed in it once again. Tolkien crafted a nearly perfect faery-tale here. In some ways it presages the Lord of the Rings, yet it is somehow different. It has a different feel to it. Had LOTR never been written this book would have still stood on its own as a classic.When I choose to reread this classic I searched out a copy of the edition that I first read in High School (a friend lent me his treasured copy.) This was the 1966 Houghton Mifflin hardcover edition- 25th printing. I had heard some negative reports on the quality of later editions and I knew that this one was first rate. It has Tolkien's own illustrations in it and on the dust cover. Plus, after over 40 years it has still physically held together- and probably shall for 40 more.So many books have copied this one over the years, but most of them are quickly forgotten while this one will last forever. But then, Tolkien said that he sensed that everything that he put into this book (and LOTR) had actually happened somewhere, sometime, and that he was just tapping into it..."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is fantastic. I have to read it at least once a year. It is very entertaining, very fun and never gets old. Each time I pick up the book to read it it feels and reads as fresh as it did the first time. Great book for all ages and the best place to start if you are interested in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" or learning more about Middle Earth. I'd recommend this book to everyone and it makes for a wonderful present for any and all occasions."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I really enjoyed this book I could never put it down. It's a good childrens book full of excitment. It's all about a group of dwarves going to kill a dragon who stole all their money and destroyed their town."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Absolutely beautiful work on the 50th anniversary edition. Should be a tresure for life to hand down."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Luckily for me, The Hobbit was my introduction to Fantasy (many, MANY moons ago). I wore that book out. Although definitely written in a different time, by a man from another age, there's a timeless quality to what Tolkien left for us. A quick read - and you'll be a little sad when you realize it's almost over. The Hobbit is one of the only books (well, perhaps THE only book) I've immediately restarted reading the moment I finished it. Well, after a couple minutes to sit back and soak it all in. Make some tea, toast a biscuit, sit back and enjoy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"What a great book! It's certainly a great improvement over the old beat-up paperback that I've been using. The color drawings are especially nice."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Correction from a previous review:The author of The History of the Hobbit is John Rateliff not John Ratcliff.YOu will find it easier to find in a search engine."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is the book that started an industry. Written for children, it is a wonderful piece of magical fiction that was loved by children and adults alike from the 1930s onwards. When Tolkien eventually wrote the more mature \\"Lord of the Rings\\" story, he went back and changed some parts of the Hobbit to tie in more closely with that story - and it was this revised version that I read.But this book works well on its own. Despite being written a long time ago now, it still reads well. It is exciting, hugely imaginative and with nearly all the classic story elements that make a good tale.Hobbits are a people who keep themselves to themselves, so a company of dwarves are confused as to why the wizard, Gandalf, chooses one Bilbo Baggins to be the company \\"burglar\\" in their quest to find and defeat the dragon Smaug. But before long Bilbo proves his worth.The final part of the book is amusing. I won't detail it to avoid spoilers - but it wraps up the grand adventure very nicely.The Hobbit is Tolkien's most accessible work. Many people skip it and go straight to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", but I think this is a mistake. The book was clearly written for children, but that should not put off older readers - there is plenty to enjoy in this book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Bought this book for my 11 year old son at his request. He was ecstatic. He raved about the original illustrations inside the book and on the cover."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Needed the book in a hurry for my teenaged son's school summer project. Book came in a timely fashion and in great condition. I was extremely satisfied."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Saw the cartoon as a child, and read for the first time in middle school. Have read a few times now (a very old copy i found that was my aunts in high school back in the 60's, and the book is falling apart. Reordered this for a 3 week trek in Nepal, its a great book for travels (there and back again, right!), and equally as good for sitting around at home.One of the greatest books of all time, and introduced me to the Lord of the Rings, which if you read the Hobbit and never get to the LoTR trilogy, you are selling yourself short (the movie is very accurate but a lot of the story had to be cut short due to time constraints).Cannot wait for the Hobbit movie to come out."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It's the Hobbit, not much else needs to be said. My only complaint, the semi cheesy splatter paint on the edges of the pages. Kind of odd for an otherwise nicely bound piece."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"We ordered this to make a 10hour roadtrip a little more tolerable. My wife and I both enjoyed it alot, even though we bought it for our 8yr old son. The narrator does an AMAZING job of inventing voices for all the characters, many voices (mostly Gollum) became noticeable from the Peter Jackson films (which were filmed much later).The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (Special Extended Edition)Made me itchy for the Hobbit movie coming out in 2012."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit has always held a special place in my heart, even compared to Lord of the Rings. While The Hobbit obviously doesn't go as far in depth into the history of Middle-Earth as Lord of the Rings does, in many ways The Hobbit's simplicity is its charm. The book is quite simply the quintessential adventure tale. I love how the book begins quickly and follows with a series of short, ordered adventures. Tolkien handles the character of Bilbo brilliantly allowing him to become more adventurous, but also making sure that he doesn't lose his Hobbit roots. Best of all, Tolkien throws in a few twists that make the Hobbit far more interesting than most fantasy stories. The trouble doesn't end with the slaying of the dragon (for those few who haven't read the book yet, I won't spoil it). For readers wanting more than an adventure story, Tolkien also weaves a compelling commentary on the power of greed and the nature of adventures. No wonder this has become a classic. I can't wait for Peter Jackson's Hobbit movies to come out."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Our 11-year-old son's first Kindle book purchase was a Gary Paulsen book(Paulsen is one of our son's favorite authors), and he really enjoyed that. I was unsure if \\"The Hobbit\\" would appeal to him after the Paulsen book, and he LOVES \\"The Hobbit\\" even more. We have read parts of it together - me reading aloud and him reading along on his Kindle, because of the sometime wordiness of Tolkien. I think the experience has built our son's confidence in his reading skills and has raised the enjoyment he gains from reading, and he's looking forward to his next Kindle book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I read The Hobbit when I was in High School, but I doubt that I had the cognitive ability to actually appreciate Tolkien and his amazing story. The Hobbit is a classic, a true gem in literature. The Hobbit was more amazing than I ever remembered and I loved revisiting this classic story."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"The Hobbit,\\" also known as \\"There and Back Again,\\" is a fictional fantasy novel by J. R. Tolkien that follows the journey of hobbit Bilbo Baggins from his carefree and cheery residence at the Shire to more mysterious and often sinister lands beyond, in the hopes of sharing a treasure guarded by the fearsome Smaug, an ancient and legendary dragon that draws chills from almost everyone who hears his name.It is believed that Tolkien's own personal involvement in World War I had significantly influenced the formation of his novel, and his incorporation of adventure, wits, romance, personal growth, and self-discovery blends itself to deliver a captivating journey that explains the wide critical acclaim it received when first published in 1937. In addition to winning a prize from the New York Herald Tribune for best juvenile fiction, the novel was nominated for the Carnegie Medal."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I love this book.

It's a great story of adventure and fantasy, and I had almost forgotten how many little songs Tolkien has peppered throughout the story! They were a lot of fun, and Bilbo's at the end is very sweet.

A hobbit is creature who likes peace, and quiet. Their most favorite hobby is of course eating. But one Hobbit changed how the world would see them forever.Bilbo Baggins was an ordinary Baggins as some Hobbits say. He lived in one of the biggest houses in the Shire. One day sitting on his porch smoking pipe weed. Gandalf the Grey shows up on his doorstep. Bilbo didn't know how much Gandalf would change his life. In the very beginning of the adventure Gandalf introduces the dwarves to Bilbo. At first the hobbit was shy and didn't like them, but towards the middle he thinks of them as best friends.The dwarves are very cool in this book. They all have different personalities but they all love two things, riches and most important FOOD. They are all funny and are really cool to learn about but the most serious is Thorin. Thorin was the leader of the dwarves and is the heir to the throne of his people. The reason he went on this adventure is because he wants to avenge his people by killing Smaug.Smaug is a dragon that terrorizes a country side to kill, and steal riches. The reason Thorin wants to kill Smaug is because he destroyed he home. Smaug lives in mountain and comes in and out as he pleases.One of my favorite books got to be The Hobbit because of one thing, it was unexpected."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It's been decades since I read The Hobbit last and, with the movie coming out soon, I thought it would be a great idea to pick it up and read it again. Additionally my five year old son had been begging me to read it with him and wanted to know all about Smaug.Do I seriously need to do a recap here? I will just for the sake of completeness. Bilbo is visited by Gandalf and a number of dwarfs who want him to be their burglar on a journey to steal the dwarves' gold back from Smaug. Bilbo very reluctantly agrees to go on a journey that has him confronting trolls, elves, goblins, and eventually the dragon itself.Is there anyone out there who hasn't read this? If not please go read it. This is where fantasy got its roots from and is a must read for any fantasy fan. This book has it all; humor, adventure, friendship, magic, danger. You name it. This is how I first met elves and goblins and other fantastical creatures.I was amazed rereading this at how much humor is in this story and just at how well the story is put together. The imagery is excellent and the story completely engaging. My five year old begged to read this book every night until we were through; the picture books were never picked up until we had finished this book. My son was desperate to meet Smaug and find out what happened to him. When we finished he wanted to start reading it again.I am also amazed at how well this story withstands the test of time. Yeah, it gets a bit wordy at parts and yes, there are some turns of phrase that are pretty outdated. But that is part of its charm. It was so much fun to see my five year old enraptured by the same story my dad read to me when I was young. Seriously this book shaped my taste in reading forever.This edition of the book is lovely, I got it as a gift from my parents, and there are many lovely and exquisitely detailed drawings throughout. They are every few pages and were really something to look forward to as we read the story.Overall still an absolutely wonderful read. This is a book that stands the test of time and is enchanting for all ages. This is where fantasy starts and it was wonderful to see my son enjoy it as much as I did when my dad read it to me. Hopefully one day my son will read it to his kids too! Highly recommended for everyone."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Wonderful book.

I feel sorry for everyone that just doesn't understand fantasy and gave it a 1. I guess that is the real test of a book though: does it draw out peoples emotions. Almost all the reviews gave it a 10 or 9, then the next most given was 1. This is a big leap: form best book ever writen to worst, not even something in the middle, only extrems. Another way to tell if a book is good is by reading all the reviews of it and how manny: a bad and unremarkable book is unnoticed, while a good book is talked about. All the other reviews told about the plot and it's merrits, read them and this book. If you like it, read LotR."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"When I was in 4th grade, I read and excerpt from this book in an anthology: the chapter entitled &quot;Riddles in the Dark.&quot; When I was in 9th grade, a friend was reading a book called The Two Towers. I asked what it was about, and when she said, &quot;hobbits,&quot; I remembered that I had always wanted to read the book from which that excerpt had been taken. So I obtained the Hobbit, and read it, and the books for which it is a prequel, The Lord of the Rings trilogy. I was swept up in the epic nature of the tale, in the characterization, in the heroism. Whether one likes the tale or not, and I've found few who don't, there is nothing here to criticize: no gratuitous violence and no sex at all (amazing). An old fashioned Englishman's tale of a world where manners still count, where education, poetry, music, and values such as loyalty, honesty and courage are still the stuff of heroes. I have read the books dozens of times. It is so easy to pick up one just to read a passage, and be swept up in the story again. I read the whole Hobbit and Lord of the Rings to my son, out loud, twice. Now he is a teenager, and has read them on his own several times. This is great literature, and will be considered classic some day. I only envy those of you who have never read it, because I would like to have the opportunity to read it again for the first time."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"My father read this book to me as a child...and I fell in love everything about it. I usually re-read it once every year or two...I enjoy Tolkien's very descriptive writing style...which has helped me in my creative essays about motorcycle riding....just a fantastic book, filled with creativity, imagination...all the best."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is certainly a classic which appeals to the adventurer in all of us."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Ah, the classic work of Tolkien's that started it all. While most LOTR fans may only be interested in this book because of the finding of the One Ring, there are many elements in here that make this stand apart from \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" This is, very much, a classic treasure hunt tale and a good example of the hero's journey, the hero in this case being Bilbo Baggins. It also has a better view of dwarf and hobbit culture than \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" if you don't includes the prologue and appendices from that novel. And it is far more accessible to the average reader than LOTR due to it's smaller size and somewhat playful tone. However, that playful tone is one of the drawbacks, in my opinion, about this book. Having just finished \\"The Silmarillion\\" and \\"The Children of Hurin,\\" with it's distinctly epic tone and scale, it is quite jarring to go from that to the childlike tone of \\"The Hobbit.\\" Not only that, but due to the fact that this was the first book to be published (ca. 1937), it didn't seem to benefit from Tolkien's extended revisions of his mythology that were published later. In fact, though he tries to put \\"The Hobbit\\" into his mythology, it seems clear that Tolkien didn't have it all fleshed out as he later did in LOTR or even \\"The Silamrillion.\\" Regardless, this is an enjoyable book and a necessary prelude to \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\""},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I usually rip jackets off of my books because I hate the way they feel and look.

But things change when Gandalf the Wizard drops by--along with thirteen dwarves, led by Thorin Oakenshield. Suddenly, Bilbo finds himself on a pony heading away from the Shire and into the great unknown, to defeat a dragon and score treasure.I Liked:WOW! This was such a beautiful, enjoyable book!The Hobbit has never been my favorite Tolkien novel, mostly because it seems so childish (of course, it was written for kids). But the audiobook (and listening to Eldest prior to this) gave me a new appreciation for this joy.Firstly, there are the characters, primarily Bilbo. Bilbo really strikes me as a relatable guy. He's comfortable, content to live at home, and uninterested in adventures. He has to be pushed out of his home by Gandalf in order to get in on the fun. It reminds me so much of how I can be: content to go along, not trying new things until my sister forces me on a new path.My favorite character, though, is Gandalf. I like how quirky he is, how smart and even caring he is to Bilbo. Gandalf knew that Bilbo was perfect for the job and wouldn't let Bilbo back out no matter what. Plus, it's awesome to see recurring characters from the Lord of the Rings.The story itself is so wonderful! Tolkien writes in a third person omniscient, which allows him to employ a great sense of humor. I love how he often directs comments to the audience (explaining hobbits, trolls, and the like) and how light-hearted the tone is. As for the story proper: a pleasure! There is so much adventure, excitement, intrigue...I've read this before, but I still learned new things or was wowed all over again. I loved the tale of how Bilbo and the dwarves evaded the trolls (so simple, yet showcases how brilliant Gandalf was), how Bilbo got the ring from Gollum, and the trek through the Forest (so scary!).And I love how this story fits into Tolkien's vision for Middle Earth. Elrond, Wood Elves, Mirkwood (Thranduil!), Gollum, the White Council...all these and more make appearances.And lastly, the narrator...ah, he was such a pleasure to listen to! I loved his voice, and I adored how he sung the songs and poems in the book! Not many could pull it off so convincingly!I Didn't Like:I don't have a lot of complaints, but there are a few. Firstly, there are thirteen dwarves, and most of them have little to no character. Fili and Kili were young, Bombur fat, Balin I believe had the best eyesight. Only Thorin had any development.One thing I've never liked about the Lord of the Rings or much of Tolkien's works was all the poetry. The Hobbit was no different; a few poems were great, but after a while, I grew tired of the lapsing into a poem.Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:None.None.While not graphic, there are some intense battles between goblins and the troop in the Misty Mountains and in the final battle.Overall:I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this book. I've never been a Hobbit fan, but this time around, I might be converted. It's fun, it's enjoyable, it's a piece of your childhood in novel form. Highly recommended for those who want to be kids again.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"A great story for all ages.

It got worse and worse by the minute. Soon Bilbo and the dwarves came to the the Lonely Mountains, and behind those mountains was the evil dragon Smaug. Many of the elves and dwarves feared him because he was of great evil and wanted to conquer the lands of all the creatures that lived in the forests and villages. He had to be stopped. The malovent dragon was very powerful and couldnt be stopped, but he had to. Bilbo didnt know what to do because he felt scared and frightened in many ways, but he did want to do the right thing. Soon Bilbo and the dwarves encountered a group of elves and these elves had a Elvenking, who was their mighty ruler. Bilbo talked with him about the malovent dragon Smaug and needed to be vanquished. The Elvenking agreed with him and decided to take a stand. So Bilbo went to confront the dragon. What will happen, and will Bilbo defeat the evil dragon Smaug?I thought this book was terrific! I thought it was really interesting, and I couldnt put the book down. I just kept reading and reading. The plot of the book was really neat. I think a story about good against evil is a good theme. I thought Bilbo was a good person in the story, obviously because he wanted to stop the evil dragon Smaug. Bilbo was brave by showing courage and I really like that. This story is a classic, and you cant put it down. I would get this book. It is worth reading and you cant resist it. I recommend this book for ages 8-30. It is a very descriptive book with great amount of detail. Adventure, fantasy, and imaginination are all in the book. Read The Hobbit , the prelude to The Lord of the Rings, both written by J.R.R. Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"First of all, let's dispose of a couple of widely-held beliefs about \\"The Hobbit\\". First, this book was written as its own story, stands very well on its own, and is far from being merely a \\"prequel\\" to \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" Second, although children certainly can read \\"The Hobbit\\" and enjoy it, this book can be read on more levels - and possibly with even greater pleasure -- by adults. So, to call \\"The Hobbit\\" a \\"children's book\\" is neither particularly accurate nor helpful. The fact that there's been a great deal of serious literary criticism written on \\"The Hobbit\\" should tell you something right there! Personally, I have read this book nearly a dozen times, starting when I was in college and just about annually for more than 15 years afterwards, and I still feel that I have not fully exhausted this book nor outgrown it. In fact, I very well may read it another dozen times in my life. Who knows?Now, what about the book? On one level, this is a fairly straightforward -- and excellent -- adventure story, with plenty of action, colorful characters (good, bad, and in-between), suspense, treachery, fighting, treasure, etc. On another level, this is also a kind of Freud meets Harry Potter \\"coming of age\\" story, beginning metaphorically in the womb (Bilbo Baggin's tunnel-like, comfortable, safe \\"hole in the ground\\") and ending up with Bilbo progressing via a series of challenges through childhood (burglar), into young adulthood (adventurer, with his new-found sword named \\"Sting\\" - hmmm, Freud thinks...sometimes a sword is just a sword?!?), and finally into full maturity (leader/hero). Contrast the beginning of the book, where Bilbo runs practically naked (\\"to the end of his days Bilbo could never remember how he found himself outside, without a hat, a walking-stick, or any money\\" or even his \\"pocket-handkerchiefs\\") out of his womb..er, hobbit hole, and the end of the book, where he returns much changed (\\"not the hobbit that you were,\\" according to Gandalf the wizard) and totally grown up (actually, presumed DEAD, with his possessions in the process of being auctioned off). So, in sum, this is an adventure story/coming of age book, which takes us from the main character's birth to his (symbolic) death, with lots of interesting life in between.But, if that was all there were to \\"The Hobbit,\\" it would not be the classic that it is, but merely an entertaining, well-written book, mainly for children. Instead, \\"The Hobbit\\" rises to a totally different - and much higher -- level on the basis of several factors: 1) the author, JRR Tokien, Professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford and an expert in linguistics and early English literature, Beowulf for instance, creates a work of tremendous scholarship, great thought and care -- well camouflaged as a \\"children's story\\" -- and, as CS Lewis wrote in 1937, \\"a happy fusion of the scholar's with the poet's grasp of mythology;\\" 2) this is a great work of imagination, which essentially imagines a world - Middle Earth - in many ways similar to our own world, and in other ways quite different; and 3) there is a lot of really interesting stuff bubbling beneath the surface here, some of which Tolkien hints at in \\"The Hobbit,\\" and much of which is developed further in his two other great works, \\"The Silmarillion\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" For instance, although great evils (and in fact the origin of evil - and much else) are hinted at in \\"The Hobbit,\\" they are left mainly for further development in other places. However, this does not lessen \\"The Hobbit,\\" per se, just gives it a sort of subconscious depth which is not often found in \\"children's books.\\"Just to provide one further illustration of how this is not merely a \\"simple children's book,\\" let's think about this for a minute in quasi-Marxist socioeconomic terms. Basically, what you have here is a comfortable bourgeois community of Hobbits - fat, lazy, happy, contented, ignorant, and kind of stupid. Then you have a bunch of mercantalist/proto-capitalist Dwarves enter the picture, who draw one of the bored-out-of- his-mind Hobbits (Bilbo) out of his comfortable hole and in search of their plundered (and now unproductive) capital, being closely guarded by the ultimate robber-baron, the Dragon. Other interesting creatures from this perspective are the \\"cruel, wicked, and bad-hearted,\\" machine-making, worker-exploiting Capitalists, er, Goblins (\\"they make many clever [things]...or get...prisoners and slaves that have to work till they die for want of air and light [to make]\\"). And guess what this all leads to, as Marx predicted? War, of course, which in this case is ultimately won (barely) by an unlikely alliance of the Dwarf and Elf proto-capitalists (led by various monarchs), the mercantilists/petty bourgoisie of Lake-town, and mysterious Other Forces (Beorn, the Eagles, Gandalf the Wizard). And, of course, lots of workers/proletariat types die in this war (which does, in the end, result in a long period of peace in Middle Earth). Given all this, is it any wonder that \\"The Hobbit\\" really became popular in the 1960s Vietnam War era?Anyway, this is just a partly serious, partly tongue-in-cheek example of why I think \\"The Hobbit\\" is a great book (like \\"Alice in Wonderland\\"), worthy of numerous readings, by both children and adults alike. The thing about great literature is that different people can get different things out of it. So, read this book, then read it again (and again), and, to paraphrase Tolkien, \\"see whether [you have] gained anything in the end.\\""},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The writings of Professor Tolkien are absolutely Timeless. These books are the gauge by-which all Fantasy books are measured. The Hobbit and The Trilogy have been the Inspiration for decades of works by other authors, yet I have not ever seen these works surpassed by anyone. Terry Brooks is the only author I have read who even compares to J.R.R. Tolkien and his epic style. I became fascinated with The Hobbit and Trilogy when I was in the seventh grade. I borrowed them from a friend and snuck them home. I was completely enthralled with the world Tolkien created. I was not allowed to read anything that was even remotely related to Wizards, Witches, Astrology, D&amp;D, etc., so these books were like nothing I had ever seen, before. I was captivated and felt the call to become a Writer. Previously, the poetry and such that we were studying in school BORED me to tears. I found my schooling to be mind-numbingly BORING and Tolkien became my Inspiration to Learn, create Poetry, Write stories, Study, become an Anthropologist, delve into Masonic Lore and so much more.... Throughout High-School, I had pictures of Prof. Tolkien on my wall and I desired to be like him. Not-only was he the Greatest Fantasy Writer the world has known, but he was &quot;Professor of Anglo-Saxon, at Oxford University, from 1925 to 1945....and professor of English Language and Literature....and a Fellow of Merton College from '45 to his retirement in '59.&quot; Check out his translations of (book title:)&quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Pearl, and Sir Orfeo&quot; (J.R.R. Tolkien) Also, Prof. Tolkien wrote wonderful stories like &quot;Smith of Wooten Major (&amp;) Farmer Giles of Ham&quot; for children. Pop those titles into the search box! I can honestly say that reading Tolkien changed my life...for the Better! Tolkien created the highest standards of writing for generations of authors....I am quite sure he would be deeply disappointed with the majority of books published today, with numerous spelling errors and pathetic grammar. I believe Tolkien is a god-send to English teachers. Perhaps, he can still inspire young people to elevate their Writing and English skills, from beyond. I would fight to keep his works on the shelves. I was not allowed to do my Senior Thesis about this author, despite the fact that he is such an amazing author and advocate of Literature. I lost interest in doing my thesis and threw something together at the last minute. Perhaps teachers should Recognize the potential for inspiring youth, via the works of J.R.R. Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is the be all and end all of fantasy literature...and it is one of the few works of fantasy deserving of the title literary work, for it is indeed that: A work of beauty, meaning and purpose. That Tolkien could write a children's story with such depth and resonance that anyone from 3 to 300 can read and enjoy is beyond nearly any other writer's ability, at least in this genre. The Hobbit stands alone as a beautifully written tale, but that it left so many tiny cracks that Tolkien could create an epic sequel and a complete land (With amazing history!) is beyond me. The Hobbit deserves reading once for entertainment, twice for discovery, and unlimited re-readings to delve again and again into a world that, beneath the magic, isn't unlike our own."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Since there are over 600 customer reviews listed below, I can't really say much more than what other people have already said. I am an adult who likes fantasy &amp; scifi and I liked this book very much. The story is quick moving and wrriten with a sense of humor. I liked the way it was told in a storytelling fashion, as if it were being read to you. I plan to read the other books in the series. I tried reading these books in the 4th grade, but did not enjoy them as much as I am enjoying them now."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I had heard so much from so many people about JRR Tolkien, his Hobbit, and his Lord of the Rings. I thought I'd buy the Hobbit and give it a shot. And then, I realized what I was missing all these years! Sure, Lord of the Rings is Tolkien's masterpiece (I myself am reading it right now), but the Hobbit is an excellent &quot;preface&quot; to it, and a magnificent fantasy story by itself! Reading this one, I NEVER found myself bored, but tucked deep in my seat, turning one page after another, feeling I just couldn't stop not even if a meteor hit me, I just wanted to see what happens next! It's very captivating, filled with action and very carefully written, the characters are great, and the plot is even greater. I'd recommend to *anyone* to just blindly buy it, and read it! And of course, when I finished the last page, and saw there was no more, I ran to my computer and placed an order for what is actually the Hobbit's sequel; The Lord Of The Rings!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I love Tolkien's works because hobbits are such an unusual race, at least in the realm of fantasy. As Bilbo once told Gandalf, &quot;We are plain quiet folk and have no use for adventures. Nasty disturbing uncomfortable things! Make you late for dinner! I can't think what anybody sees in them.&quot; Yes, hobbits do tend to be more fond of regular meals and comfortable beds than having adventures. Imagine Bilbo's surprise at being confronted with, first a wizard, then a large number of dwarves who show up for tea unannounced, threatening to stay a good while and (much worse, from Bilbo's perspective), wreak havoc with the crockery. Bilbo then finds himself actually going on one of those shocking and inconvenient things called adventures, and we must assume that he will be all the better for it by the end of the book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien does a great job at grabbing you and pulling you into the Hobbit. If you like books like the Never Ending Story or Narnia books then you would probably like this one. It sent a good message across, and that you have to stay together even when you don't like your colleagues. It is about a little hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, who goes on an adventure, which hobbits don't often do, with Gandalf (a wizard) and his company. He finds many curious things along the way, and learns some valuable lessons. Overall I liked this book, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes to let their imagination wander."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It is well documented that J.R.R. Tolkien despised allegory. Yet \\"The Hobbit\\" contains one of the greatest allegorical phrases ever: \\"the unexpected party.\\" Yes, life is a journey, a quest if you will--but it is also (when lived to the full) an unexpected party. And so it is that Bilbo Baggins is spurred on to leave his warm Hobbit hole to go on one of the most exciting and entertaining journeys in all of literature.Tolkien never thought this book would even be successful, much less attain its almost mythic status. In part, he was trying to write a story for children (and it is problematic even in this respect). No one however, can deny what a strange, original creation it is.The story takes place in a fully formed world (Middle Earth) of Tolkien's own imagining. It rings with the sound of ancient music and poetry. The elves, the dwarves, and men have all kinds of history behind them to give them depth. Only after finishing the Hobbit did Tolkien envision the importance of the Ring.What \\"The Hobbit\\" is--more than just being a prelude to the tale of the One Ring--is a great adventure story. An ancient people goes seeking to reclaim its home, a Hobbit discovers that he has more in him than even he ever expected, a people are freed from darkness at great cost, and something is found that was lost...all under the supervision of a mysterious wizard.This is a tale of good's triumph over many evils. A story about a seemingly forgettable little creature and his impact upon great events--a realization that: \\"So comes snow after fire, and even dragons have their ending!\\"I give \\"The Hobbit\\" my highest recommendation."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"1 wizard and 14 dwarves, how much adventure can you get from it?The Answer is alot! A hobbit who never been on a adventure and who is convinced in going on one by one wizard named Gandalf and other Hobbits. They all head on for adventure. The Adventure includes facing fantasy monsters like Goblins, stone giants etc. The author of this book is J.R.R Tolkien, The Hobbit is the first book of the series &quot; The lord of the Rings.&quot; There are 3 more books other than the Hobbit. The first of the three which is The Fellowship of the Rings recently just came out in the movie theater. The main character in this book is Bilbo Baggins a Hobbit. The adventure starts as soon as you pick up the book and read it.The Movie &quot; The Lord of the Rings : The fellowship of the Ring starts off with a brief introduction of The Hobbit a worth it movie to watch but before going to watch the movie maybe you should read the book first. The book is just as stunning as the movie."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is an amazing story, a true classic about hobbit Bilbo Baggins being recruited by wizard Gandalf to accompany a band of dwarves across treacherous terrain to do battle with a mighty dragon, Smaug, who had destroyed a small city and claimed it;s treasure. One of the dwarves, Thorin, was a descendant of a dwarf king of the city destroyed. There are encounters with giant spiders, trolls, wolves and goblins as well as a journey up a river in wine barrels! The goblins do battle with the elves, dwrves and men for possesion of lands shortly after the death of Smaug. The conclusion is to an extent sad, but staisfying. Several years ago here in Melbourne, there was a play about the hobbit featuring both puppets and peo0le."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I personally found this book more interesting than The Lord Of The Rings. His book is the prequel to it. It tells how Bilbo got the ring,his history with Gandalf, how he got the mail and where he found Sting and how it was named. Also, his encounters with drarwes, men, elves and a dragon called Smaug. If you read LOTR read The Hobbit. It is an amazing book. I recommend this book to all ages."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The hobbit is about the adventures of a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. A hobbit is a little person that lives in the land of Shire. It all starts with Bilbo Baggins, not found of adventures at all! He just likes to live in the comfort of his little hobbit hole. Then along comes thirteen dwarfs accompanied by a wizard named Gandalf. They come to him with a quest. A quest to get their town and treasure back from a dragon named Smaug. They just need one more person for their journey. That person is to be a burglar, and you guessed it, that burglar is Bilbo Baggins! The hobbit goes through many fasinating adventures in this book that are mind-popping and so enjoyable to read. Read the hobbit to find out about the adventures of Bilbo Baggins!Boy, I sure loved this prelude to the Lord of the Rings! It is so fascinating to read about the adventures Bilbo gets into as the book gets nearer and nearer to the end! If you read this and love it like I do, then I suggest you start reading The Lord of the Rings trilogy. But, read The Hobbit first! In this book, Bilbo finds a ring that somehow makes him invisible. But that's not all the ring does or creates! there is an evil master to that ring and put the two together, well Houston we got a problem! Frodo, Bilbo's cousin by blood, but now his adopted son because Frodo's parents died in a boating accident has a quest to distroy that awful ring in the fires of Mordor.Read the Lord of the Rings trilogy for more fantasy adventure!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Paul Jones is referring to the BBC version.

If you didn't like the book, you probably won't like this. But what are you going to do while you're driving to work if you don't listen to this ;-)? I give it 4 stars because I don't like opera and Inglis sings the songs from the book. Wonder where he got the music."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It had been probably ten years since I read Tolkein when I saw the film &quot;Fellowship of the Ring.&quot; Needless to say, I've caught Tolkein fever again and after the second time I saw the movie, I went directly to the bookstore. I was thrilled to see this book on tape, unabridged (which it really is). I don't think it's necessary to review the actual story; you've probably heard all that before. I am very pleased with Rob Inglis as the reader, though. His voice can be either powerful or gentle, or both as the story calls for. I was a bit surprised of his reading Gandalf as, honestly, a pretty cranky guy...but after a while I got to enjoy Gandalf even more because of it. Now, I'm not a musical person, I don't sing, and I don't really enjoy musical productions. However, I thought Rob Inglis did a spectacular job with the songs. When I read them, they were OK, I thought. But hearing them sung with such a wide range of feeling just made the story all the more powerful. The dwarven songs were particularly well done, deep and resonant just as you'd imagine they should be. On a more practical side, I really appreciated the announcememts (very brief) at the beginning and end of each side of the tape. Since I listen to these in the car, it helps to know exactly where you are and when you'll have to grab the next tape. I listen to a lot of books on tape, and I can say that this production is as good as it gets."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I won't go into how great this book is in this review -- if you're looking at the collector's edition, chances are you're either already a Tolkien fan, or you're considering this as a gift for someone who is.

I bought this edition as a gift for my husband to replace the beat-up paperback copy he'd had for years.This particular edition of _The Hobbit_ is a very high quality, handsome book. It comes in a slipcase, and the spine of the book is embossed in gold and metallic red. The cover is a textured, leatherlike material -- I am not sure what it is made out of, but it feels nice.

This edition of 'The Hobbit' makes a lovely family volume, perfect for reading aloud to children."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"In anticipation of The Fellowship of the Ring movie due out this December, I've decided to re-read Tolkien's classics, starting with The Hobbit. This is a great and classic story about a quest. It was great to see Bilbo's character evolve from beginning to end, as well as get introduced to all the great characters that populate Tolkien's world. I loved Beorn and wished he was more integral to the whole story, but maybe he's in The Lord of the Rings (I've forgotten!). My only gripe is Gandalf - I thought he was extremely underdeveloped and there was so much more we could have learned about him. As a stand alone story, The Hobbit is a classic, but it just felt like Tolkien was going through the motions and saving his best work for his later novels..."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a whimsical tale of adventure spun from the wildly imaginative mind of J.R.R. Tolkien, creator of Middle-Earth. It stars an unlikely hero, a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins who is content living out the quiet life in his warm and cozy hobbit-hole. Until one day a wise and mysterious wizard, Gandalf, and thirteen lively dwarves unexpectedly disrupt his life. They manage to recruit Bilbo as a burglar to help them with their quest to The Mountain where they plan to reclaim their lost treasure, stolen (and now guarded) by a fierce dragon. Throughout their journey they encounter many dangerous obstacles, including trolls, goblins, riddle solving, spiders, and of course, the fearsome dragon, Smaug the Magnificent.Portions of the book drag, but overall The Hobbit is a captivating read. It may have been written for children ages 9-12, but the Hobbit is the first fantasy novel of its kind, cleverly capturing the hearts of both young and old."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"&quot;The Hobbit&quot; was first read to me i 4th grade by my teacher Mrs. Bassford, i ws hooked. i had to have my own copy so i could read it again and again, and that is what i did. &quot;the Hobbit&quot; is the best book i have ever and i myself have read many many books in my short 14 years. i read the book so much i had to buy a second copy because the first was so &quot;well read&quot; it has fallin apart after being taped, glued, and reglued and retaped. i am happy to report that is now happing to the other copy. i read the book from cover to cover, and i mean cover to cover, the copyright and all. the when i have finshed the last word i go back to the begining and start all over again, i can't get i out of my systum. it is some times the only thing that can cheer me up after a bad day. most people don't read it be cause the first chapter turns them off becase they say it's &quot;slow.&quot; i beg to deffer it is a very well writin, thought out, and much more pice of work. &quot;it shows to me by the way Bilbo came out on top in the end that if you put your mind to it and your hart is in the right place you well find out you can do things you yourself never dreamed you could.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Generally I don't like fantasy, but I have always been intrigued by the tremendous reputation of The Hobbit, and read it merely out of curiousity. The book hasn't disappointed me, but hasn't overwhelmed me either. Tolkien's writing is charming, endearing and very enjoyable, but I couldn't really see why The Hobbit is considered one of the 20th century masterpieces. Unless I missed a whole different level of meaning, the book can hardly qualify as serious reading material that is supposed to evoke deep thought, but for what it appears to be, a harmless fantasy tale, it serves its purpose.If you have never read The Hobbit and have some free time on your hands - do read it, if only as a tribute to a classic. If you don't have too much free time - don't bother with it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"No, this book isn't \\"better\\" or \\"worse\\" than any of the volumes in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. It's just different. Less serious, for sure. And for me, that meant a much more enjoyable experience. This is a book that reads like an extended fairytale, with all the associated delights, while the LOTR books read like a chronicle of war. Both good, but you have to pick your poison. Humor plays a huge part in this story, where it plays only an ocassional part in the later Tolkien volumes ... As for the story, it's engaging from the beginning, and because it's earlier Tolkien, it is not burdened by any undue pressure of having to produce something better soon: in fact, a lot of it was just notes Tolkien read out loud to his kid before bed. When he went to compile it, he had to think back to how the tale went. Bedtime stories, in other words, which I think adds to its charm.The chapters are mostly fun, and wholly unpredictable; I loved finding out what happened next, and rarely saw it coming.Some negative points involve the \\"songs\\"; just as in the LOTR volumes, personally, I could have done without. Tolkien is no poet.Some unforgettable scenes here, and most will linger in your memory, like the image of the group of adventurers lingering for weeks (months? years?) near the dragon's lair, unable to figure a way inside. Or the \\"Invisible Bilbo\\" chapter. Haunting stuff.Then there are the precursors: the introduction of Gollum, the Ring of Invisibility (which was not the One Ring at first), and Gandalf, among other things.All in all, not only one of the best books-for-children I've read, but one of the best books period.And the title of the new movie should be \\"The Hobbit, or, There and Back Again,\\" stupid Hollywood people.

So please read it"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Our family book club read The Hobbit for our August selection; we didn't have our meeting until early September. Afterward, our son wrote the following essay:Since The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien was offered as an option for our family book club, I've been asking for it each month. In August, my pleas were granted, and we started the book well before The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring arrives in theaters.A quick summary of \\"the enchanting prelude to The Lord of the Rings\\": The comfortable hobbit Bilbo Baggins smokes his pipe, relaxes in his easy chair, watches the stars. He leads a peaceful life until Gandalf, an old white wizard, comes along and changes it forever. In spite of his Tookish ancestors, Mr. Baggins is a \\"lazy\\" hobbit who doesn't want adventures: \\"Nasty disturbing uncomfortable things! Make you late for dinner! I can't think what anybody sees in them.\\" (p. 4) Of course, then, he is quite suprised when he is called to serve as a professional burglar for a band of thirteen dwarves. Later, he's even called upon to kill Smaug, a dragon with a diabolical appearance and a mammoth appetite. Of the thirteen dwarves, Thorin is the most eager to see Smaug die, for a few of the villages Smaug has destroyed were part of the kingdom of Thorin's fathers and forefathers, making Thorin the King Under the Mountain - not Smuag! With no choice but to join them, the hobbit has no idea of the dangers he must face to reach his goal, no idea how to kill a dragon (let alone a dragon who has been the glorious victor of who knows how many battles).My favorite part of their adventure takes place in the Elvenking's palace, when Bilbo is devising a plan to save the dwarves. He decides to put them all in barrels to be rafted off with the other empty barrels sent to \\"the Long Lake... a town of Men still throve there.\\" This plan gets them out of the castle without being seen. But, as Tolkien points out, \\"It was just at this moment that Bilbo suddenly discovered the weak point in his plan. Most likely you saw it some time ago and have been laughing at him; but I don't suppose you would have done half as well as him yourselves in his place. Of course he was not in a barrel himself, nor was there any one to pack him in, even if there had been a chance!\\" (p.182)The mastermind of this journey, J.R.R. Tolkien, and C.S. Lewis (Chronicles of Narnia) were friends, colleagues, and masters of fantasy. We can see the influence of the Chronicles on the many series written for younger readers today. Tolkien's influence can be seen in series that appeal to more advanced readers; The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings are the \\"granddaddy\\" of the sci-fi/fantasy genre.In The Hobbit, Tolkien relies on the power of the mythological \\"hero's journey.\\" Bilbo has a lot in common with Odysseus of Homer's Odyssey (perhaps the original hero) and Luke Skywalker of the Star Wars epic, a hero whose story was told four decades after Bilbo's. Hero stories teach us about our own potential. Heroes are called to journey and adventure for their heart's desire (Bilbo and Odysseus both want to return home, for example), but they must fight evil and learn about themselves before they can achieve their goals. Each of the heroes I mentioned are guided by mentors or wise guides: Odysseus by Athene, Luke by Obi-Won, and Bilbo by Gandalf. They each benefit from a magical talisman or sacred object: Odysseus has his magical bow and quiver of arrows and assorted amulets Athene and others provide during his twenty-year journey home; Luke Skywalker wields his father's lightsaber; and Bilbo has Sting, a short sword made by Elves, and the invisibility ring. In each of their stories, the hero must enter the \\"underworld,\\" a classic mythological detail. They are also encounter ugly, horrible beasts on land and in water, adding chilling action and, in some cases, humor to the stories. The heroes also, I might add, eventually achieve their goals.The Fellowship of the Rings is our next book club selection. I look forward to more of the same exciting and enchanting elements that made The Hobbit so memorable."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"On of the greatest books I have ever read was The Hobbit by J.R.R. Talkie. It takes you on an amazing journey through a fantasy world of mythical creatures and such. It is the prequel to the more famous Lord of the Rings trilogy. It has been around for more than 30 years and is still considered a work of greatness.In this book you go on an adventure with the main character Bilbo Baggins. He is a hobbit who lives in a hole by himself. He goes on a journey with a wizard named Gandalf and thirteen dwarves. He travels many miles to find gold to steal from a dragon named Smaug. Along his way he finds a ring with magical powers that is very powerful. This ring chances his life for ever and helps him steal the gold from the dragon. The Dwarves want to get there home land back from the dragon. He later returns to his hobbit hole very wealthy and a different person from when he left. The Ring in which he holds is very important for the survival of the hobbits. I felt that this book really held your interest with the amazing things it had. The most amazing thing is that Bilbo Baggins is only a hobbit who is able to steal the gold from the Dragon. This book sets up the entire Lord of the Rings Trilogy which is very important. It is a book in which anyone from any age group can enjoy.Basically this book is suitable for anybody who enjoys fantasy and also enjoyed Lord of the Rings. If you were confused reading Lord of the Rings, you should try reading The Hobbit which explains the main story of what happened before. Many professional book reviews except this piece of literature as one of the greatest fantasy stories of all time."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Have you ever heard of a hobbit? A hobbit is a small wooly footed creature. They don't wear shoes because they have thick soles that form on the bottom of their feet. They have curly brown hair like the stuff on their feet. Some people call them hole dwellers because they live in holes.Now that you have learned what a hobbit is, I shall tell you about one particular hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. This hobbit lives in a place called Hobbiton or the Shire if you like. Anyway, this hobbit is about to go on an adventure with thirteen dwarves and one wizard named Gandalf. The dwarves are trying to get their gold back from an evil dragon named Smaug. Will they succeed? I'll tell you one thing, this is one adventure that will change this hobbits life forever.I love this book. I have read it over and over again and I still can't get enough. It has so much action, adventure, and it's hilarious. You will adore this book and want to read it over and over again. I would think that older kids might enjoy this book more than younger kids. For instance five year olds; or two year olds would not understand it very well. But older kids like nine or older would most definitely love this book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is amazing. I love the depth of the details it offers, plus all the photos and illustrations... It gives a very interesting and deep perspective of the Hobbit's/Tolkien's world.However, all that extra info kinda gets in the way if you are reading the story and want to get lost in it.Really something you do not want when reading it for the first time.Highly recommended if you want to go deeper though :)For the rest of you, I would recommend the 70th Anniversary Edition [Hardcover]"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Did you have to read the Hobbit when you were in school? There is so much to this story that is missed when you first read it for plot, which is typically what is done when you read something for your High School English class. This time, enjoy a slower pace and drink in the awesome details and background to one of the jewls of the English language literature. The increidible journey of 13 dwarves and one hobbit, which became the spark and foundation for the Lord of the Rings, is rich in detail that will only enhance your appreciation for these amazing stories. This particular edition contains illustrations and passages, which are later linked to the Lord of the Rings. The illustrations are Tolkien's own and I was delighted when I watched the movie and found them come to life in the big screen. Have fun rediscovering the Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I chose this rating because of the thrilling adventure and the endingWith Bilbo sitting in his living room and Gandolf smoking tobacco"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I love Tolkien's world. The vibrancy, the realistic character portrayal, the in depth descriptions and the sheer imagination and fortitude it took to concoct these imaginary lands is astounding. Whether you appreciate the fantasy genre or not, this classic book series is in a class by itself. This is one of those rare books - like the Harry Potter novels - that one can read over and over and never get bored of. It can take a bit of time to get used to the &#34;Middle English&#34; language (read: much like old English) however, once you get used to it is becomes smooth sailing. The plot is engaging and you find yourself caring about the characters very easily. Tolkien was a true master of the story telling art. The Audible reading (by Inglis) is really a treat as well."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It was disappointing to me what the movie producers did to this book!

I suppose there is some justice in retrieving the dwarf treasure from the clutches of the dragon, but it seemed so rooted in greed than in justice that just didn't seem a story-worthy plot or one worth risking life and limb for. And the first 50% of the book was just so whiny - I'm hungry! I'm thirsty! I'm sleepy! I'm cold! I'm wet! I want to go back! - that it reminded me of many a hike and camping trip in Scouts when I was a patrol leader with kids on their first time out.And yet, Bilbo does emerge as a leader of the quest, and learns a lor about himself in doing so. In that, I think a child would find inspiration in what is, at heart, a children's story.It is must reading to backfill the lore in Lord of the Rings, but the sense of good vs. evil is *so* much better in LotR than in the Hobbit.And speaking of greed: 3 movies for a 300-page book? Really? I just don;t know how they are going to do it and it seems so much against the moral of the story in terms of what Bilbo happily took in the end."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have loved this since I was young, and it still stands up.

Do you like action? Do you like short, fat, little burglars? Then The Hobbit is the book for you. This is a hilarious book filled to the brim with magic and action, and the main character is a miniature burglar who always has his tea at four. Or will he?The reason that J.R.R. Tolkien wrote this novel was to entertain teenagers and adults. He has accomplished his goal as a writer at least fourteen times over.This book takes place in Middle Earth, a medieval-type world with creatures and people of all sorts. Just to name a few: Dragons, Dwarves, Elves, Goblins, Hobbits, Wargs, and Wizards. This is how you can tell that this book is fantasy. Here is a quote from page 145 \\"'Bombur has fallen in! Bombur is Drowning!' he cried. It was only too true. Bombur had only one foot on the land when the hart bore down on him, and sprang over him. He had stumbled, thrusting the boat away from the bank, and then toppled back into the dark water, his hands slipping off the slimy roots at the edge,\\" I think that this book has great plot, good characterization and an awesome theme.I think that Tolkien accomplished his goal in The Hobbit. One thing that I left out was his characters, they are Gandalf the Wizard; Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, Fili, Kili, Dori, Nori, Ori, Balin, Dwalin, Oin, Gloin, and Thorin Oakenshield the Dwarves; Bilbo Baggins, the hobbit burglar. They have been over hill and dale, through an ominous wood, forded several rivers and fought a great battle. My opinion of this book was that it is 100% totally absotively posilutely AWESOME! My personal connection to this book is the fact that I had a grandfather just like gandalf (except for the fact that Gandalf was a wizard) he was cool, calm, and collected. He had a great sense of humor, and he knew the way out of any tough situation.Bringing this review to a close, I think that you should read this book. I rate it 11 out of 10.

A few years after seeing it the first time, I happened to pick up The Hobbit at my school library (this was in the 6th grade), and started reading it. I did not recognize it till I reached the same event in the book, and I realized I was reading the source of the cartoon. That discovery, that there was a book form of the story, eventually led me to find the LOTR Trilogy and the other books of the Middle-Earth universe...that being said, I love this book. The narrative style does seem a bit more geared toward younger readers, which was wonderful given the age at which I first picked it up, and that might turn away older readers who are getting their first taste of the Middle-Earth. However, having read the Trilogy numerous times through, as well as having read the Indexes and Silmarillion, going back to the Hobbit opened a whole new world. Things like realizing that the same Elven King that held the dwarves prisoner was the father of Legolas, or that Gandalf meeting Thorin was possibly by chance yet the events he set had a much greater purpose than getting rid of a Dragon and reclaiming a treasure (Sauron's attack in the ROTK might have gone differently had the dragon still lived...and an alliance between the Dwarves and the Men stood in his way). It was like finding invisible ink on many of the pages that gave bits of information here or there. Since I am a diehard fan, I found rereading the Hobbit was even better the second and third times through...and there is still so much know and find out, and that is what I find so wonderful about the LOTR and Middle-Earth.This book certainly might not be everyone's cup of tea, just as there are differences in tastes of music. The very descriptive style of Tolkien does turn some people off to his works, and others, like myself, find ourselves embracing every word.It is certainly a great read for the Tolkien fan and for younger children, and can be, if you let it, the first step into a much larger world."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I first read this book in fourth grade and I loved it to the last sentence.

The detail was great, and made it so you could imagine the surroundings and actions almost perfectly.Some think it's a book for teens and kids, but I think I'll love rereading it through my life.

This rendition of The Hobbit is excellent. The narration of Rob Inglis is perfectly suited to this genre."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"My family and I have immensely enjoyed this CD set as well as the entire Lord of the Rings stories narrated by Rob Inglis.

I enjoyed \\"The Hobbit\\" then and, upon rereading it recently, I enjoyed just as much again. Seeing Bilbo reluctantly dragged from his comfortable hobbit hole into the adventure of a lifetime and seeing him rise to the occasion time and again was pure delight.\\"The Hobbit\\" is a magical book which resonates with overtones of mythology and folklore. Tolkien was a specialist in Anglo-Saxon and Old Norse materials--Beowulf, the sagas, and Eddic poetry were part of his professional stock in trade. Much of the atmosphere of his books comes from his use of these materials. Having studied a bit of Old Norse mythology since my first reading of \\"The Hobbit,\\" this time around I had a deeper appreciation of Tolkien's accomplishment.Unlike the LOTR trilogy, Tolkien originally wrote \\"The Hobbit\\" for children. This makes the book a little simpler thematically than the other books. However, Tolkien does deal with some very adult themes in spots and adds a touch of ambiguity to some of the characters as well. The aftereffects of the death of Smaug and the battles at the end of the book are cases in point. But whether you choose to read deeper meanings into the book or not, it remains a wonderful, enchanting read.One final word-this time around I listened to an audio version of the book. Not only did this make time spent driving much more enjoyable, but the narrator's singing made the songs come alive in ways that they hadn't before."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a great book for anybody who likes adventure stories.

But, as they are not sitting here at the computer with me just now, you'll have to take my word for that.By now, most of the civilized western world knows that The Hobbit is the prelude to The Lord of the Rings (which is even better, yet more accessible by older teens and adults than by children). I've always told the kids that I teach who read Harry Potter (and I'm a Potter fan, too), that when they're ready to \\"graduate their reading\\", The Hobbit is the next step. It has all the appeal of the best in \\"young\\" fiction, but it is absolutely \\"literary\\", too, in the most classic sense of that word. And well it should be. J.R.R. Tolkien was a student and teacher of linguistics himself, and his love of history (over allegory) is omnipresent in all of his works, not least in The Hobbit.It's the story of an unlikely and reluctant hero, Bilbo Baggins, who is unceremoniously roped into an adventure with thirteen dwarves. Their goal: traverse the whole of the Wilderlands in Northern Middle Earth to the Lonely Mountain, defeat a dragon who stole the dwarves' treasure, and reclaim the kingdom under the mountain as their own.What follows is largely episodic in nature, as the first half of the book chronicles the various dangers and respites along the way (one per chapter until they reach the mountain itself). By chapter 8, not only have you met hobbits, dwarves, and wizards, you've outwitted trolls, dined with elves, evaded goblins, avoided being eaten alive by a nasty little subterranean fiend named Gollum, been rescued from the tops of burning trees by flying eagles, befriended a were-bear, and hacked down an army of giant spiders. And then, just when you've taken a breath, you realize the book is only half done ...To give any more away would be simply gratuitous. If you're a kid, read The Hobbit. If you're an adult, read The Hobbit. If you're a highly intelligent family pet, read The Hobbit.(This review has been posted by Marcus Damanda, the author of a horror novel called \\"Teeth\\".)"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It's a real shame that the movie version of this book didn't come out before The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. People would have had a better idea of who Bilbo was. The worst part about the movies was they made him look like a silly little old man. But this is a classic story of a rather ordinary little creature reaching out to be extraordinary when the situation required it. It is a mistake to think of this as a story about a small group of thirteen dwarves, a wizard, and a hobbit out to fight a dragon merely to win back a treasure. This group is out to win back a lost kingdom. And it must be pointed that an elf kingdom and a kingdom of humans suffered from the fall of the dwarf kingdom as well. So it shouldn't be a surprise when a war breaks out because other people want a share of the treasure. This a bit lighter in tone than The Lord of the Rings, but it came twenty years earlier, and a lot happened to Tolkien in that time, including World War II. But this is a most excellent story about a most excellent Hobbit"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I listen to a lot of audiobooks, usually stephen king although i have listened to others and having read this book several times i thought i would listen to the audio version.

I found this novel to be well presented in the hardcover format which came in a sturdy green box. It is pleasant to look at, and the texture feels great. The print is a good size for the younger readers or people who have difficulty reading small print.This is a beautiful book. There are 5 beautiful full-color watercolors and many more illustrated prints which look like a cutline / woodcut effect by the author.The cover is a delight, with a gold image, red & gold writing around the edge and on the spine. Vibrant and gorgeous it's a beautiful keepsake.It's a great edition to anybody's book case.It is truly a beautiful book!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I purchashed the Hobbit on audio for use in my classroom. Most of my students find it easier to follow along with a person reading aloud than when reading on their own; the problem is that if I am the one reading my attentions are on the book, and the classes can sometimes take that as a cue to misbehave!Enter the Hobbit on audio. This is an unabridged reading by classically trained actor Rob Inglis, who specializes in Shakespearean and Tolkien readings. His reading is consistent: his voice work stays the same for each character throughout the reading. A nice touch is the actual singing of the poetry Tolkien included. Music, songs, and poetry are an integral part of Tolkien's travel narratives, and the use of actual singing makes this reading a delight to listen to. Inglis's smooth voice is easy on the ears, and he performs this recording beautifully.My only complaint, and that of my students, was that sometimes the pace of the reading was too slow, which made tedious parts of the book even more so. Other than that it was a huge asset to my classroom, and truly served its purpose. While I don't really use audio books for personal use, I would still recommend this item to people who do.

It is great! Am I biased, of course; but does that change the beauty of this book, no!This is a great book for many reasons. I will give you three:1) Great English usage. Tolkien was a master of the English language and it shows in this book (maybe even more so than in the LoTR cycle). He is creative and concise. At times he is gives you lots of information and description, while at other times he is sparse; but either way he gives you just exactly what you need to know. When you read this book, note how Tolkien uses adverbs. For some odd reason the adverb is out of fashion to most fiction authors these days, thus, reading Tolkien is a breath of fresh air.2) The richness of the story is undeniable. This book set the bar for a modern fantasy staple: the quest story. Without \\"The Hobbit\\" there would be no Dark Tower, Drizzt, Demon Wars, Robert Jordan, Terry Brooks, etc. \\"The Hobbit\\" is and always will be the defining novel of the fantasy genre.3) It is fun! Hobbits are intriguing, the quest is exciting, and the interactions between the characters are authentic (even though they aren't human!). Tolkien captured the human spirit in this book in a way that I have never read before or since. Every page will make you smile, cry, or laugh out loud!So, am I biased? Yes! But \\"The Hobbit\\" is still the best!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a great book for people of all ages. The Hobbit is exciting with cool action and a little comedy.

You will love the book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"So much has been written about J.R.R. Tolkien's works recently, in the wake of Peter Jackson's magnificent films, that it was refreshing to simply re-read Tolkien's original tale of Bilbo Baggins. This marvelous new edition provided the perfect excuse.\\"The Hobbit\\" is a classic tale of adventure. Bilbo Baggins, Esquire, of the Shire, has never done anything outlandish, and is a most esteemable hobbit as a result. But lo and behold, the wizard Gandalf arrives on his doorstep with thirteen dwarves on a quest for revenge. Although never made quite clear why or how, Gandalf knows that Bilbo is going on this quest, too, like it or not. And after a night of dwarvish tales to chill a hobbit's bones, Bilbo finds himself running out his front door on a quest without so much as a pocket-handerchief.Just what is the quest? The dwarves are refugees from the Lonely Mountain in the East, a mighty dwarf kingdom, that has been ransacked by the dragon, Smaug the Magnificent. Bilbo is the troop's Burglar, although one imagines that the only thing Bilbo has ever stolen is a nap, or perhaps an extra piece of pie.If you're going to do archetypal stuff, you must do it well. In \\"The Hobbit,\\" Tolkien sets the gold standard. His Middle-Earth is a fully realized land full of terrors and wonders, from trolls, goblins, evil wolves, giant spiders (not to mention Smaug or the ultimate nemesis, Gollum) to the shapeshifter Beorn, the Arkenstone, Bard the Archer, Sting, and Gandalf's wizardry on the other (not to mention a certain magic ring). Tolkien spends as much time on the landscape as he does the action or the dialogue, and his descriptions are so vivid one finds yourself walking alongside Bilbo through his amazing adventures.In contrast to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy, which can generally be characterized as a heavy load, \\"The Hobbit\\" is much lighter. Tolkien tells this tale using a narrator who cleverly jumps ahead and back in the story to offer hints, clues, and humor . . . just as if your favorite uncle were telling you a tall tale on the couch when you were a wee lad.The story builds, and builds, and builds, but never loses steam. A tale that must be read, \\"The Hobbit\\" will surely earn a place of honor on your bookshelf.For devotees of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy, you will find throughout \\"The Hobbit\\" somewhat veiled references to later events. A few references are made to \\"the Necromancer,\\" who never really figures in the story but plays, shall we say, a slightly larger role in the trilogy. A certain magic ring, used by Bilbo to great effect, does not seem to carry all the negative baggage that Bilbo's nephew will associate with it. And Gollum, well, you know all about Gollum. (Apparently Tolkein revised \\"The Hobbit\\" after working extensively on \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" because Gollum unexpectedly became a major player in the trilogy.)And this edition is wonderful, too. Handsome green leatherette binding with heavy paper makes for a pleasant reading experience, and the artwork and maps (drawn by Tolkien himself!) just adds to the magic.You cannot go wrong giving this book to any Tolkien fan, or keeping it for yourself."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit Book ReviewBy PeterThe Hobbit is a story about Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo is a hobbit from Bag-end, a place in the Middle Ages. Hobbits are smaller that you and I. They don't wear shoes because they have hairy feet. Their houses are called hobbit holes. They are holes in the ground (hill). One nice day in May Bilbo gets an unusual visitor. The guest is unusual because it just so happens that he is a very powerful wizard named Gandalf. The hobbit knew the wizard because when he was young the wizard came to Bag-end to meet old friends and make fireworks. Gandalf was an old friend of the Took family and Bilbo's mother. He and the Took family used to go on all sorts of adventures. Obviously the Took's weren't hobbits because generally most hobbits enjoy peace and tranquility. Little did Bilbo know he was about to embark on an amazing quest along with thirteen dwarves and of course Gandolf. Soon he will be battling with goblins, Gullem, orcs, giant spiders, and Smaug the dragon. All he has to help him along are his friends, Spike the sword, and his very unusual ring.The Hobbit is a great book to me because it is full of magic, battle, legends, and many unusual creatures.

I often had difficulty getting past the first few pages. This isn't my sort of read, for I've never been into this sort of fantasy-and-magic-realism-for-children genre. But then I couldn't put it down the second I decided to give it a whirl. The Hobbit is a well written, engaging, and oftentimes humorous work of fantasy. It is aimed at a youthful audience and I think it would be a marvelous next step for Harry Potter fanatics. That is if said fanatics hadn't read this classic gem beforehand. In any event, this novel is far better written than the aforementioned popular series. This book is a wonderful revelation and I recommend it. You won't be able to put it down once you get into it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book tells of the hobbit Bilbo Baggins and of his companions, a group of thirteen dwarves (Tolkien's preferred spelling) and the wizard Gandalf, as they set out to rescue a hoard of stolen gold from a fierce dragon. (A hobbit, for those not familiar with Tolkien's world, is a small, hairy-footed person who lives in a hole in the ground). Along the way, they have various adventures at the hands of the other inhabitants of Tolkien's imagined realm of Middle Earth- trolls, goblins, elves, animals and even humans.If the above brief synopsis makes the book seem like a twee Enid Blyton tale for infants, all I can say is that it is not. Unlike the more adult The Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit probably was written primarily with children in mind, but it is the sort of children's book that can easily be enjoyed by adults. Indeed, it can in many ways be read as an introduction to The Lord of the Rings, because it introduces characters such as Gollum and Gandalf, who will play an important role in the later work, and because it tells of the earlier history of the Ring, which it will later fall to Bilbo's nephew Frodo to destroy.The Hobbit can be divided into two parts, corresponding to the time before and the time after the finding of the gold. The earlier part is lighter in tone. Although Bilbo and the dwarves face dangers in the course of their journey, they are able, by courage, ingenuity and luck, to overcome them; they are always the heroes, and the reader's sympathy is with them as they battle with the malevolent trolls, goblins and wolves they meet along their way. Bilbo is a particularly well-drawn character. He starts out as hesitant and nervous about the enterprise (hobbits tend to be conservative and unadventurous), but as it progresses finds within himself reserves of courage and resourcefulness, which enable him to rescue his companions from danger. (The dwarves, on the other hand, do not really come across as sharply-defined individuals, apart from their determined, headstrong leader Thorin Oakenshield and the fat, lazy Bombur).After the gold is found, the tone of the book becomes darker. The dwarves become less heroic and more morally ambivalent as disputes over the true ownership of the recovered treasure threaten to lead to war. The issue is not finally resolved until a bloody and destructive battle has taken place. What started as a light-hearted children's adventure story becomes a parable about the corrupting nature of greed and the destructive power of violence. The links between The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings are thematic as well as narrative"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The book was amazing, it is a must read. I would would recommend the book for any skill level of reading. The adventures are imaginitive and in detail. The author Tolkien takes your mind to another place. The book is a great start to a series. The journey of Bilbo is fast moving and keeps you on the edge of your seat.I don't know why Hollywood didn't start the movvies off with this. The characters are mysterious and funny. The history, set, characters, and background fit and work great together."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This review discusses the graphic novel of Tolkien's The Hobbit, with illustrations by David Wenzel and adapted by Dixon and Deming. The cover art is by Giancola and is different than the cover shown above.I have been enamored of Tolkien's universe for over three decades now, and interested in associated works as well, though some work better than others. This one-volume illustrated adaptation of the novel works very well indeed. What I'm probably most grateful for is that, while not a verbatim transcript, it is a fairly complete adapatation -- even Beorn is here! As for artwork, I always measure Tolkien art by the depiction of the hobbits, and Gandalf, and Wenzel does a fine job IMO. (His pictures are quite different from the cover art.) The hobbits aren't the best I've ever seen, but they're not freakish either, and the dwarves and Gandalf and the elves and the settings are all quite nice.This would be of interest to a Tolkien collector, a fun read for graphic novel fans, and a nice introduction to the Tolkien canon for wee folk.Note: I believe there is also a three-volume graphic novel though I haven't seen it.

But Bilbo's life is unexpectedly turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf, with thirteen dwarves in tow. They eat Bilbo's food, take over his cozy hobbit-hole (a subterranean dwelling -- \\"Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort\\"), and generally make life difficult for him.But Bilbo soon finds out why: these dwarves are on a mission to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug, who slaughtered its inhabitants and stole their treasure. Now, led by Thorin Oakenshield, the dwarves intend to take back what is theirs -- and Gandalf wants Bilbo to come along. Bilbo doesn't particularly want to go, but the adventure appeals to a quirky, adventurous side of him. Before he knows what has happened, he is on a rollicking adventure filled with malevolent goblins, a degenerated creature with a magical Ring, Elves both friendly and unfriendly, enormous eagles, savage wolves (also called wargs), and giant carnivorous spiders. But even if Bilbo can get past these dangers, he must still deal with the malevolent Smaug in his mountain fortress.Many people have fond memories of reading \\"The Hobbit\\" as children (including part of the LOTR movie cast). This is definitely a children's book in some ways, but most children can't pick up on the subtle character developments and the nuanced foreshadowing. \\"The Hobbit\\" is not merely an entertaining story or a delightful prequel, but also a masterful piece of fiction.If nephew Frodo Baggins is the ultimate \\"little guy\\" hero, then Bilbo is the ultimate reluctant hero. Bilbo is almost perfectly happy in his respectably dull life, but his very small yearning for adventure is evident from the very beginning. Though he is not the sort of person that you would classify as being a hero, Bilbo grows gradually and subtlely in courage and ingenuity. Only on the very last pages does the reader realize just how much Bilbo has changed.Gandalf is a more nebulous figure in this book than he is in LOTR, and displays much of the \\"crotchety gray wizard\\" archetype that he formed in fantasy literature. Thorin Oakenshield displays the endearing and annoying traits of dwarves, dating back to the Prose Edda: He's proud and sometimes a little obnoxious, but also fiercely loyal, honorable and extremely brave. The other dwarves are not featured as much individually (after all, there are twelve) but retain individual characteristics that never become jumbled or confused.Tolkien's writing style is somewhat in keeping with a bedtime story (which this once was) and a children's story. He had apparently mastered a very rare gift, that of being able to address the reader without sounding cutesy or smug. The descriptions are very evocative, especially when he describes action scenes. The dialogue is enchantingly written, managing to be fairly realistic while never being boringly so.Like \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" \\"The Hobbit\\" is influenced by mythology and a previous work of fiction. The goblins (later orcs) are somewhat reminicent of George MacDonald's goblins; as Tolkien read and enjoyed some of MacDonald's works, this is unsurprising. Additionally, the names of Gandalf and almost all the dwarves can be found in Norse legends. The impact is subtler than that in LOTR, presumably since Tolkien's children were too young to appreciate any influences.\\"The Hobbit\\" remains a classic that can be read and enjoyed by children and adults alike, possibly even more enjoyable now than when it was first written. Before you read \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" be sure to check out its enchanting prequel."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I love this book.

For instance, the ending seems a little rushed.I still recommend it as a fun read.If you like fantasy it is a staple of the genre."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I reread this in anticipation of the movie coming up in December. It is a classic tale of a fish out of water exploring the greater fantasy world he lives in, much like Luke Skywalker or Harry Potter. Bilbo Baggins is the fish, though he is much more unwilling than Luke or Harry to explore the fantastical world in which he lives. As a Hobbit, he lives in a comfortable hole in the ground where life goes on at a leisurely pace. There's plenty of time for meals, smoking, meals, drinking, and more meals. Then he's visited by the wizard Gandalf, who is helping some dwarfs organize an expedition. Gandalf wants Bilbo to go along, partly to break the unlucky number of dwarfs (thirteen), partly because he thinks Bilbo will be useful. They head off across Middle Earth to the Lonely Mountain, where the dwarfs once ruled. The dragon Smaug turned out the dwarfs and turned their underground kingdom into his lair. The head of the dwarfs, Thorin Oakenshield, is a descendant of the rightful king and is going to take their kingdom back.Like most of these stories, at first Bilbo is out of his depth. But he quickly becomes more resourceful, using his wits and his growing bravery to get out of the various tricky situations he and his companions wind up in. At one point he is separated from the group in the caverns of the Misty Mountains and has a delightful battle of wits with Gollum, a wretched creature who loses his preciousss ring to Bilbo. The ring becomes quite pivotal in The Lord of the Rings. But that is another adventure.This story is very well written. The descriptions are vivid and the world is well-crafted. The characters are interesting and the situations have plenty of humor and drama. The style of writing is a little old-fashioned, as if it were an epic, though some places the author addresses the reader (like, \\"for you it would be very strange if...\\") almost like he is a storyteller with an audience listening to him speak. I'm sure it will be wonderful to read this to my children in the coming years."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is perfect for anyone who reads to be transported out of the mundane world into the realm of possibility and ancient myth. The Hobbit was written for children but is delightfully engaging for adults as well. My advice is to pick up a copy and read it aloud to a child you love... You will instill in that child a love of all things magical and share a literary bond that is unbreakable. You cannot put a price on a gift like that!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I liked \\"The Hobbit because of three things. I liked the author's creativity. It was a nice little world in that book. I also liked the originality. Other books just copy some clay mold for a \\"good\\" book. Finally, I liked the characters. Did Tolkien invent the \\"hobbits\\"?The best part of this book is where the main charcter meets a creature named \\"gollum\\" and steals his magic ring. It was very suprising and very original. The description of the area just puts a picture in my head.One element I like best about this story is the characters. Even though there were about 15 characters, Tolkien gave each of them a personality. I also liked the resolution. It was close to real life because there were happy parts and tragic parts."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I think this is the best book Tolkien has ever written. The hobbit is the prequel of the great lord of the rings trilogy and gives it an indispensable background.This book talks about Bilbo Baggins, a young hobbit, which decides to go on a long journey, along with his friend Gandalf the wizard, to find about a great treasure guarded by the fierce dragon Smaug.This book gives the background info of most of the lord of the rings characters, Golem, Gandalf, Bilbo etc... and how the famous ring was actually found.A must have for all lord of the rings fans and for every other fantasy writing lover."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Once there was a brave hero who journeyed with his companions on a glorious quest to reclaim a lost treasure from an evil dragon! This would seem like a typical fantasy-adventure storyline, if it weren't for the fact that this \\"hero\\" were no more than three feet tall and had no experience in the ways of battle whatsoever. This is the story of The Hobbit by JRR Tolkein, and is the prelude to the famous Lord of the Rings novels. In this novel, Tolkein proves that anyone can accomplish a goal, regardless of his or her physical abilities.The story starts out very peaceful as the reader is introduced to the main character: Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo is a \\"Hobbit\\", which is a creature like a human but much shorter and with twice the appetite. He goes on with his life normally, until one day a wizard named Gandalf shows up at his door, and Bilbo embarks on the adventure of his lifetime (which is longer than a man's). Bilbo must travel with Gandalf and a group of dwarves to a mountain far away where a dragon called Smaug lies with an unimaginable fortune of treasure. The treasure originally belonged to the dwarves, but the dragon drove them away and claimed it for itself. Bilbo himself cannot see why he was chosen for this journey since he has never seen a battle in his life. However, he will soon learn that they chose him for a different reason. It would take an awfully small and clever creature to sneak past a dragon!One of the many exciting incidences in the novel is when giant trolls capture Bilbo and the dwarves. They are all tied up in sacks and desperately trying to find a way of getting out while the trolls decide how they should kill them. It seems hopeless for the courageous company before Gandalf shows up and rescues them. As the trolls are deciding how they will kill their catch, Gandalf hides in a bush behind them and starts to talk in on the trolls's conversation and causes them to quarrel. The trolls lose track of time arguing with each other, the sun rises, and they turn to stone. That is what happens when they come in contact with sunlight.Tolkein magnificently blends exciting adventure and action along with a climatic ending that will take you by surprise, and immerses you into a world that will not be able to come out of until you have read the very last word! This story is a must-read for everyone."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"If you are a fan of Tolkien you know few things compare. I'm a huge fan of Tolkien's writing. I've read the complete history of middle-earth, the silimarillion, the lord of the rings and this wonderful novel. The Hobbit remains my favourite of all time. No modern writers even come close (perhaps Robert Stanek but that's different). Read this, you are going to love it!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I only recently (Today in fact) recieved this book, and I had no doubts in my mind as to whether it was worth the expense to have it shipped here (I am located in the republic Ireland). I could have simply gone to my local Easons (pretty much *the* only bookstore, of note, in Ireland) and picked up one of the many (and I'm talking millions here) paperback editions of \\"The Hobbit\\" (or The Lord of the Rings, as I bought both leatherette editions), but instead I chose the leatherette edition, and I'm not sorry, not in the least!I'll start by describing the 'externals' (or asthestics) of the book: Let me first say, dont be fooled into believing this is some 'form' of leather that the book is bound in, it is, in fact (or at least appears to be), a form of plastic. Saying this, however, it does not cheapen the book, I'm saying merely to clarify. This 'plastic' is actually made to look 100% like real leather, if only for the feel, you would be fooled into thinking it was leather (leather is less resitant, scratches more easily and is softer under-hand). I personally dont mind, the book is most beautifully crafted with 'simulation' gold gild (more than likely its a gold ink or paint).The pages themselves are of good, rather great -quality, not cheap 'bright-white' 'mass market' pages, but rather a subtle shade of mild yellow, not to mention the pages being almost twice as thick as paperback editions (if not, in fact thicker), which makes for a much more comfortable read. I have only one 'gripe' or 'probleme' with this book, and that is that the text that is printed on the pages seems to be at an angle (rather than being 90deg to the pages edge, the text seems to be off by about 3-5 degrees). This is only a slight annoyance, and I am not totally convinced that it is either an error while printing nor that all copies have the same 'condition'; I personally dont mind too much, but for the 'perfectionistic reader' it can be quite distracting, but to be honest that is the fault of the reader rather than the book's.Finally (and perhaps most importantly?),The book comes with a 'container' wich is, also, bound with 'leatherette', they both complement each other and the cover is a perfect protector against the day to day 'wear n tear' of life.Personally, I cant put the book down. I'm three chapters through and cant find fault in the book. All of this goes for the \\"Lord of the rings - Leatherette edition\\" just as much as for \\"The Hobbit - Leatherette edition\\".This book is a must for all!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"My introduction to the world of Middle-Earth happened last year. I was never very enthusiastic about the world created by Tolkien, but when I finally read Lord of The Rings (which I'm actually still reading: I'm in the beginning of RotK) and The Hobbit last year, in 8th grade, I could''t be more impressed, and I'm an official Fantasy geek (and I mean this in a friendly way).The Hobbit is a fairy-tale like adventure, easy to read and told in a much less accurate and serious way than LoTR, one of the greatest Fantasy tales ever published. But don't take this book as a work of less importance, because though it is not as epic as LoTR, The Hobbit is a excellent book that can be used as an introduction to the world of Middle Earth, or as a separate tale. The book shows Tolkien doing what he seems to do best: it's an aventure full of carachter development, with both sad and lighter, even comic moments. Though this book isn't a epic war tale, it's a great and easy read, reccomended for everibody."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"If you are reading this you probably already know that a hobbit is a really fascinating epic story and the prequel of the lord of the rings. I just wanted to say that this hardback edition illustrated by Alan Lee is near brilliant. The art of the book: the inside as well as the outside are a real sight to behold, even if you are not a fanatic Tolkien fan, but just someone who likes great stories, I would still recommend this. It's just a great story in a beautiful edition. It is really worth the extra money because this a book you will treasure for a long time and for sure you are gonna read or just look in it another time too."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Unfortunately Amazon has mashed together all the Hobbit reviews. But the comic/graphic novel version is different enough to warrant it's own review pool.I bought this expecting to love reliving the Hobbit in a visual format. But that didn't happen. This adaption is just flat and missing so much of the magic Tolkien created. I suppose that's a given when you replace so much of his expertly crafted words with pictures.If nothing else, read the standard version of the Hobbit first before trying this. Reading this first will just spoil what a great book the Hobbit is."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"When I was in sixth grade, my teacher told me of a book called The Hobbit. At once, I knew I'd hate that book! Who'd want to read about a midget who lives in a dirty hole? When I was in ninth grade, I decided to read it anyway. I discovered how wrong I was about hobbits! Hobbits are people just like you and me, only they're plumper and about two to four feet tall. Most have curly brown hair on their heads, and on the leathery soles of their feet to match! They live in the Shire, which is in Middle Earth, in little tunnels (which DON'T slope down, merely just go right into the heart of their hill) all panneled and decorated to look cozy and inviting. Their town is a very pretty place full of flowers and rolling green hills. Bilbo Baggins, a fairly young hobbit, is strangely greeted by Gandalf, an old wizard clad in blue-ish grey and a whole bunch of dwarves! Unexpectedly, Bilbo joins them on a journey to steal the gold back from the dragon who sits on the Lonely Mountain far, far away rich with all the dwarve's gold and jewels. But it is a long, perilous road they must take. They meet elves, trolls, goblins, and many other unlikely creatures along the way. You feel like you're one among them. Just imagine: You're captured by a tall, gruff troll in the middle of the night and stuffed into a dirty, smelly sack with twelve others and listen to the trolls quarrels of whether they should roast or mince you after they squash you . . ."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Great book, classic and interesting across the generations.

These books will have the longevity of Shakespeare."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"As a fan of The Lord of the Rings books (liked them) and the movies (loved them), I finally wanted to read The Hobbit before seeing the movie. Most people seem to read The Hobbit before The Lord of the Rings, but I got it backwards.I enjoyed the novel well enough, I guess, maybe, but I found it lacking the weight that The Lord of the Rings has. It is a simple story about a simple quest to get treasure back from Smaug the dragon. The episodic nature of the novel added to its simplicity: the band go here, fight something, win, move on.One of the best scenes is with Bilbo Baggins and Gollum asking riddles to each other. The dialogue is fun, and it helps see the origins of Gollum and the hobbits to be explored later. Just precious."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Okay, so I say that this is the best way to read The Hobbit. And I am dead serious.I know that annotated books can be difficult to navigate, filled with useless, pointless, or just plain boring information, and can be grossly oversized. That is not the case here.So - here's the scoop.The original story is very nicely presented, with all original illustrations in color when possible, and in black and white elsewhere. The type is nice and clear, very easy to read. (Many cheaper editions are also rather hard on the eyes. Check the print before you buy, folks!)The illustrations are printed very clearly, and with very good notes on what they are.And then the annotations - useful, engaging, and very well done. You will WANT to read these. We discover how the book was written, and what was changed between editions. (There were many changes made so that The Hobbit would conform more easily to the Lord of the Rings trilogy.) There are fascinating tidbits about Tolkien's life and the experiences that made their way into the story.The forward tells about the writing of the novel, and the appedices give additional details about the text.There are also many illustrations from other editions of the book. These are varied, from thought-provoking to not-provoking.And the book is not too big. Some editions are simply too big to be read, but this book is reasonably sized so that you can actually READ IT! In fact, I have not read any other edition of The Hobbit for years, since the original annotated version came out.The new edition is very much worthwhile. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This version of the Hobbit is a pleasure to long-time fans but will also serve new readers well. Anderson released the original &quot;Annotated Hobbit&quot; years ago but this new format with the annotations in the column most often directly next to the orginal book text is supurb.Included are Hobbit illustrations around the word, a rich addition, but the real joy of this book is learning background and details about The Hobbit, author J.R.R. Tolkien and The Lord Of The Rings. At times the footnotes are scholarly and at other times they are amusing gems.Anderson has compared all of Tolkien's revisions and has researched the 'whys' 'hows' and 'whens' that helps reveal to reader the meaning of the text and the personality of the author.My favorites are anecdotes about Tolkien's personal life that involve his family and personal history. They are facinating and at times touching.WIthout rambling on too much, I can confidently recommend this version of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; as the best available."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This newly published, annotated version of THE HOBBIT is excellent for fans of the book. It may be TMI (&quot;too much information&quot;) for the first-time reader. The text of THE HOBBIT settles in the center of the book while Doug Anderson's notations appear in the outer margins. At times it's a bit busy - but there's always fascinating reading! Tolkien fans are sure to get excited over this one.Doug Anderson includes lots of sources in his notes. He quotes Tolkien's own letters, other fairy tales and legends that may have inspired Tolkien, as well as previous versions of the section he's noting. The Gollum section (&quot;Riddles in the Dark&quot;) is interesting. Tolkien did some tinkering with the original Gollum story as its follow-up (LORD OF THE RINGS) was taking shape. Seems that George Lucas is not the only person who's revised previously released work! Tolkien was his predecessor.Also interesting are the many black and white illustrations that Anderson includes, many from foreign editions of THE HOBBIT. Some of the art is hilarious, as it does not resemble Tolkien's characters at all! There is a nice color section of illustrations in the center of the book.THE ANNOTATED HOBBIT is a handsome, interesting book to own if you're a fan of Bilbo and his adventures with the dwarves (or dwarfs? That's covered in the book as well!)"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Tolkien's Hobbit takes the imagination on a wonderful flightof fantasy. I read this book on a yearly basis and eachyear I am delighted and captivated by the world of BilboBaggins.Bilbo is a reluctant member of an adventure that willforever change his life and the lives of those around him.He accompanies 13 dwarves on a mission to reclaim the goldand mountain kingdom of their ancestors from the dragon,Smaug. They have many adventures and mishaps on theirjourney to the lonely mountain including the climactic battle offive armies. Bilbo finds a magic ring along the way whichleads, not only to a rise in his stature, but also to a newadventure for his friends in &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot;Tolkien is a master storyteller and the depth of his skillis best seen in this tale. In the following trilogy, &quot;TheLord of the Rings&quot; the story is continued, but the sheerdelight of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is never fully recaptured.This collector's edition is beautifully bound. Even moreenjoyable are the illustrations and paintings by the authorhimself."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\`The Annotated Hobbit', annotated by bookseller Douglas A. Anderson is published by J.R.R. Tolkien's American publisher, Houghton Mifflin (important because it means the cover of this book uses the same art as the cover of the most popular hard-covered American edition of the Hobbit, published in the 1960's).Let me be perfectly clear that this is first and foremost a review of the Annotation, not of the novel, \`The Hobbit' itself. I have an almost reverential respect for the original novel, having bought my first copy of this work on a cold February day in 1965 in the Lehigh University bookstore. I began reading it on the bus on the way home from my college classes at about 1:00 PM, and simply could not put it down. I finished reading it at about 8:30 that evening. The experience is not unlike some cinematic versions of experiences like Dorothy's opening the door of her Kansas house to step out onto the grass of Oz. I am totally unsurprised by a statement in this annotation that says that the entire first page of \`The Hobbit' has been reproduced in \`Bartlett's Familiar Quotations'. There are few more magical or evocative openings to novels I have read in my whole life. And, while I can appreciate that there are adult readers, my Hemingway loving uncle being one of them, who simply \`don't get it', I am often driven to the point of dispair when I can't interest young readers or listeners in \`The Hobbit'. Like \`Winnie the Pooh' and \`Alice in Wonderland', I really think these are books designed much more to bring back memories of childhood in adults than to engage young readers. And oh how much I enjoy reading \`The Hobbit' aloud!But back to this Annotation'. Like similar annotations to works of fiction such as \`Alice in Wonderland' and the Arthur Conan Doyle stories of Sherlock Holmes, there are four different subjects for annotation. One is internal; where names and events are cross-referenced to other parts of the work to explain, elaborate, resolve, or point out inconsistencies. The second is external, where correspondences can be made to sources or, in the case of Conan Doyle or Carroll, events of the day that may have found their way into the fiction. The third is references to the author's unpublished notes and letters. Tolkien's works should be rich sources for all three types of annotation, as the world of \`The Hobbit' and \`The Lord of the Rings' is based on an enormous body of Norse, Celtic, and Teutonic mythology, fable, and epic literature. Also, standing behind \`The Hobbit' is the great events of \`The Lord of the Rings', \`The Silmarillion', and over twelve volumes of Tolkien writings compiled and annotated by Christopher Tolkien.So why are the annotations in this volume so sparse? The author certainly does not limit himself to only one kind of annotation. There are examples of all three references to other Tolkien works, notes and letters, and other sources. The author does give us lots of illustrations of scenes from \`The Hobbit' published in translations of the work from around the world. There are also a few illustrations from books that certainly influenced Tolkien, such as \`The Marvelous Land of Snergs'. The one thing that all these illustrations tell me is that, on average, they are not very good, oriented primarily towards a children's audience rather than some of the more heroic art familiar to us from modern fantasy illustrators. It seems to me a lost opportunity also to not include Tolkien's own color illustrations for \`The Hobbit', as they appeared on the very first \`Tolkien' calendar in, I believe 1966 or 1967.I will give just a few illustrations of where I think the author may have disappointed his readers. By far the most interesting character in \`The Hobbit' next to Bilbo and Gandalf is Smaug. And yet, the book has next to nothing to say about the fictional antecedents of that delightfully cagey old worm. One of my only fond memories of the rather insipid cartoon version of \`The Hobbit' done several decades ago is the gravely voice of Smaug done by Paladin himself, Richard Boone. If you couldn't get John Huston, then Boone was certainly the next best thing. To the whole conversation between Bilbo and Smaug, there are but two notes regarding Smaug and dragons. At least we get a reference about the source of Smaug's name, a primitive Germanic verb, \`smugan' meaning to squeeze through a hole. Tolkien confessed that this was \`a low philological jest'. In the wider story culminating in the great events of \`The Lord of the Rings' coming at the end of the Third Age, it is much more important to Gandalf to remove this great dragon from the field so Sauron could not use him as a weapon in the War of the Rings than it was to restore a small band of dwarves to their treasures. The book has practically nothing to say about this, or the fact that the character of the \`necromancer' who takes up residence at the southwestern tip of Mirkwood forest is actually either the leader of the Nazgul or Sauron himself.I keep thinking, as I turn each page of ample, empty white margins, all the things that could have been included.In balance, this is not a bad book or even a poor purchase, especially if, like me, you simply must have a copy of every different version of Tolkien's works imaginable. It has a very nice bibliography and an Appendix of all textual changes between the 1937 and 1966 editions. For those notes it does have, it is great as a version to read to children where you can record your own notes with answers to their questions."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I always thought this book was for children so I got it for my son for Christmas. He had read all the Harry Potter books and was waiting for the next one so I figured this classic fantasy would help fill the void.Well fill the void it did! My son absolutely loved it and has already read through it twice. Intrigued, I picked up the book myself and was immediately captivated by the story and stayed up until 2AM one morning to finish it! This is a book that any adult can appreciate and while it might be challenging for a child under 14, the effort will be rewarded.This is the story of a hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, who is very much like many of us. He would rather avoid &quot;adventure&quot; and sit by the fireplace with a mug of beer and a good meal in his stomach. He is suddenly dragged unwittingly into an adventure that ends up transforming him and teaching him things about himself that he never knew.As Bilbo and his dwarf companions encounter trolls, goblins, giant spiders and ultimately a giant dragon in their quest to recover lost treasure, you will find it increasingly difficult to put the book down.J.R.R. Tolkien is a master of prose and you find yourself reading paragraphs over again to absorb all the rich detail. They sure don't write them like that anymore!I highly recommend getting this book on tape (or CD) as well. My son and I &quot;re-read&quot; the book this way and we gained much more appreciation for this timeless classic (the medieval music added a whole new dimension to the tale)."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This review concerns the Kindle edition. I paid $9.99! I would think at that price the publisher could have somebody edit the e-manuscript! There are numerous paragraph breaks where there should not be as well as some typoes. This detracts from the reading experience! Please fix! (the book itself is a fantasy classic and deserves better treatment than this slipshod editing)Edit 6/7/11 - looks like they reformatted the kindle version to deal with those errors. I don't know for sure if they caught them all because I haven't had a chance to look at it all - even if I had made bookmarks for the errors I wouldn't have been able to check because downloading the new version means the old bookmarks get deleted."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I bought this book because I wanted a hardcover illustrated fancy version of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;.I'm just going to pretend that everyone who reads this review has already read &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and knows what it's about. Like I suspect many others do, I have my own old sacred tattered and dog-eared paperback version on the Tolkien bookshelf.This book (the physical object, not just the story) is beautiful. It's clothbound in dark green and embossed in gold, and the bottom corner of the front cover has a gold embossed dragon, tastefully rendered. The paper dustjacket/cover features a dragon as well (I'm guessing Smaug). Eye-catching.There are many full-page color paintings, and many grayscale drawings (not full page) throughout. I'm not an art student, so I don't know what they're really called. Pencil-drawings or something. I call them grayscale because they're gray. Anyway, the Allen Lee illustrations are utterly charming, soft and colorful without being too bright. However, I wouldn't recommend this illustrated book for very young children; some of the goblins and trolls are frightening!I was a bit disappointed that Alan Lee didn't include more illustrations of Elves. Most of the pictures dealt with Bilbo and the dwarves, with a few of goblins and Gollum (scary). Also, I pictured Bilbo Baggins to be somewhat on the &quot;stout&quot; side...the text *does* refer to Hobbits as being &quot;inclined to be fat in the stomach&quot; and liking two dinners a day, &quot;when they can get it.&quot; The Bilbo Baggins in these illustrations is quite slender and looks as if he could use that second dinner right away! Maybe even a third and fourth! The balding, skinny Hobbit did surprise me. But then, I kind of expected the chubby halfling I saw on some old Tolkien calendars.This book makes a wonderful coffee table book and would make a great gift. It's printed on thick glossy paper, so the book is heavy. In these days of cheap hardcover bookbinding and paperbacks that have the consistency of the thick weekly manga, this book is truly a work of art in itself.Recommended for all but the very young, or the easily frightened."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a fun adaptation of Tolkien's classic work and I enjoy it as such, but it is *not* as described here by Amazon. First, buyers need to know that this is a graphic novel and an abridgment of Tolkien's work. Second, it is *not* illustrated by Alan Lee as stated in Amazon's description, the illustrations were done by David Wenzel. This is a glaring mistake that Amazon needs to correct quickly. There are plenty of Alan Lee fans out there, especially after the LOTR movies were made with his assistance, and those fans may be disappointed to find the work of a different illustrator show up in their mailbox. Amazon also gives the wrong ISBN-10 number, though I doubt many will notice or care.Having said all this, I have enjoyed this adaptation of Tolkien's work. I bought it primarily for my 5 year old daughter who is a bit too young for the unabridged and non-illustrated novel but is still very interested in the story. She loves for me to read it to her and she gets a fuller and more accurate depiction of the story than the 1977 cartoon video provides.I recommend this work, but Amazon needs a fuller, more honest description of what buyers will be receiving."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"[This is a review of the 70th Anniversary Edition, not so much of \\"The Hobbit\\" itself. I've reviewed the book proper elsewhere, and would rather focus on the actual edition itself.]\\"The Hobbit\\" is one of those few books that I have felt justified to buy multiple copies over the years. It is a book I have read and cherished, and a book I dearly love. \\"The Hobbit\\" is a novel that deserves to be bought multiple times over, and I always enjoy looking at new editions of this classic work. So imagine my excitement when I found out they would be publishing a 70th anniversary edition of one of my most cherished novels!This has been a big year for Tolkien fans. Christopher Tolkien published \\"The Children of Hurin\\", a newly completed version of Turin's legend, in April. We've gotten (at long last), \\"The History of the Hobbit\\", expertly handled by brilliant Tolkien scholar John D. Ratcliffe and published in two separate volumes. And of course, we have the 70th anniversary of Tolkien's first primary work, \\"The Hobbit\\", which this edition is published in celebration of that momentous occasion. And does it live up as a major new edition of this fantasy classic?That's a pretty easy answer. The answer is NO.First off, here are the positives. The 70th anniversary edition is pretty much how the first edition of \\"The Hobbit\\" was actually published back in 1937 with some notable improvements, and conforming to Tolkien's pretty exacting specifications, including how the dust jacket should appear, as well as the art and maps that accompany the text.These are the notable differences between the first edition and this edition. Due to cost, Tolkien was not able from a production standpoint to have the book appear exactly as he envisioned. The 1937 publication cut some of his artwork, the map was not how he so desired, and the dust jacket, due to printing cost, was limited to three primary colours (green, black, and white). Originally, Tolkien wanted the sun on the front cover and the dragon on the back cover to be totally in red, but this was not feasible.Obviously Tolkien's work is successful enough that these production costs are no longer an issue, and so this is a relatively accurate facsimile of what Tolkien would have wanted to publish in 1937 had money not been an object, as it too often is in the real world. For that, this edition has some worth.Now, there are some negatives. And these are big negatives.First off, paper quality and binding. It's bad.Then there's the actual art work. The colour artwork is quite nicely implemented into the main text, and overall I don't have a problem with the colour artwork from a production standpoint. The paintings are bright and colourful, and remain true to higher quality prints of Tolkien's phenomenal painting. But unfortunately the same cannot be said of the black and white illustrations. Like a reviewer said before me, it appears Tolkien's drawings were reproduced on a cheap scanner. Tolkien's artwork is highly valuable, but unfortunately the drawings here are rather badly reproduced in this edition.Then there's the advertisement for \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" at the end that's rather annoying. They reproduce the first chapter of \\"The Fellowship of the Ring: Being the First Part of The Lord of the Rings\\" and place it at the end of the novel, acting like a cheap plug for Tolkien's masterpiece. I don't have any problem with plugging \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", but to me this inclusion of the first chapter just cheapens the whole book, especially when it's supposed to be a major edition of a major work. We all know about \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". Do we really need the first chapter here? Rather tacky, to say the least.Then there's the problem of Christopher Tolkien's forward. This is what I was most looking forward too, actually. Having read E. A. Solinas's review, I was under the impression this was a new forward prepared specifically by Christopher for the 70th anniversary of his father's work. Not the case. It's simply a reprint of the forward he wrote for the 50th anniversary of \\"The Hobbit\\", twenty years previously.As far as textual authenticity, I must be honest in the fact that I've only browsed it at a Borders bookstore, but I'd be very surprised if they did not use the text fromThe Annotated Hobbit, as it is the most definitive and accurate text yet established for the book. Still, I can't verify that that is the case.Overall, this is a fair edition of \\"The Hobbit\\". It could have been a lot more. What sets this apart from the other copies is this is how Tolkien truly envisioned how he wanted the book to appear, and for that fact alone, this is a valuable edition to the Tolkien collector. Unfortunately the poor production quality of the black and while illustrations, the rather tacky inclusion of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\"'s first chapter, and the disappointment of the publishers' just reprinting a twenty year old introduction to the 50th anniversary publication rather brings the whole affair down. I think I'll pass on this one.For those looking for the best edition of Tolkien's book, buy \\"The Annotated Hobbit\\", first published in 1988 and republished in a new format in 2003. The second version of \\"The Annotated Hobbit\\", is the definitive edition of this phenomenal work as far as I'm concerned."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"A great book for teens and up...wouldn't recommend for younger ages because it is a harder read.This book is extraordinary!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I really liked this book.

I've re-read it several times since. Having seen and enjoyed Peter Jackson's LOTR trilogy, I looked forward to the new movie(s???) based on this book.I think J.R.R. Tolkein, for all his foibles, would most likely not enjoy Mr. Jackson's current offering. I realize that MGM has now taken a stake in Mr. Jackson's films.... and with the current trend of making \\"franchise films\\", I should have known something was amok when I learned that \\"The Hobbit\\" was to be a two-movie offering. The embellishments on the original story, the addition of \\"bad guy\\" goblins and a whole battle scene that doesn't occur in the book had me wondering from the first half hour of the movie, if it would get back to the story as Tolkein wrote it. A character mentioned ONCE in the book (and just in passing) has two whole scenes devoted to him.This is not so much intended as a review of the movie as it is the book. Read.

He first tends to be alittle timid, comfortable, independant, and secure in his little hole, also called his home.

Biblo is later visited by Gandalf the wizard, and not to long after, twelve dwarves show up in his hole, to tell him about a quest they have planned, and what part they would like him to take part in. His quest is to go and rob Smaug the dragon for the treasure of Lonely Mountain. They want him to be their burglar. He is very creative, and has a large imagination. Overall, i think this book is good, but not great. It is more written for the fantasy type people, and who like wizardry.

To say that it is &quot;just for kids&quot; is like saying that ice cream or watermelon is just for kids. Blasphemy! It is true that Tolkien intended his story for young readers to enjoy, as is evident in the fact that hardly a page goes by in which the narrator does not address children in the first person singular, but the story is never &quot;childish&quot; (in my opinion). Any child reading this story will feel elevated to being at one level with the (adult) narrator. I think it is significant that Tolkien makes the hobbits beardless and &quot;shy of the Big People&quot; and their stature to be &quot;about half our height, and smaller than the bearded dwarves.&quot; They tend to &quot;disappear quietly and quickly when large and stupid folk like you and me come blundering along, making a noise like elephants which they can hear a mile off.&quot; The misgivings that Bilbo has as he is swept off on this adventure, are the misgivings that any child would have... and the fact that he overcomes those fears, learns to live with a determined initiative, becomes a true leader, and emerges a hero in the end is a great lesson for young and old alike.The Hobbit is self-contained, and essentially independent of the three-volume Lord Of The Rings, which, in my opinion is a far more graver sort of quest... perhaps less accessible to the younger reader. It is not necessary to read the Hobbit in order to understand The Lord of The Rings, but The Hobbit serves as a quarry of important themes for the larger work.The Hobbit reminds me of something C.S. Lewis (a friend of Tolkien's) once said of children's literature: &quot;No book is really worth reading at the age of ten which is not equally (and often far more) worth reading at the age of fifty...&quot; The Hobbit surely fulfills this criteria, and so I believe you will be smiling at the end of this book regardless of whether, in doing so, you're displaying baby teeth or dentures at the time."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"First things first: If you have NEVER read the Hobbit before, I do not recommend this version. GetThe Hobbit: or, There and Back Again (Collector's Edition)instead. That is a wonderful hardcover collector's edition with a slipcover and beautiful illustrations.Having said that, I will now direct my review towards people who have already read the Hobbit at least once and now wish to lean more about both J.R.R. Tolkien's writing process and the world of Middle-Earth itself.But before I discuss this product I would like to explain why I bought this book in the first place. When Tolkien published the first edition of the Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins aquired the Ring from Gollum in a slightly different way than that with which we are familiar. Originally Gollum offered to give the ring away as a prize if Bilbo won the riddle contest. A few years later when Tolkien began work on the Lord of the Rings and finally realized what this Ring actually was, he knew that there was no way that Gollum would voluntarily give away the ring. So he went back and rewrote the entire \\"Riddles in the Dark\\" chapter, and to this day every later edition of the book has Bilbo taking the ring in a less-than-honest way. I wanted to read the original text from the first edition. What do you do when you want to read the first version of \\"Riddles in the Dark\\" but can't afford to spend hundreds or thousands of dollars on a first edition copy of the Hobbit? Get Douglas A. Anderson's annotated version!What is \\"The Annotated Hobbit\\"? Start with the final edition of the Hobbit that Tolkien published in his lifetime, and center the book around that. Add Anderson's detailed annotations in smaller print in the wide margins of most pages. Add a large collection of illustrations of all sizes, and include appendices in the back. What does Anderson discuss in his annotations? Most notably he quotes the original text from every time Tolkien changed anything from one edition to the next. At one extreme is the entire \\"Riddles in the Dark\\" chapter rewrite included in the margins next to the regular text. At the other extreme are numberous single-word changes. In between the two Anderson detailed every time Tolkien made sentence and paragraph rewrites. Anderson discusses Tolkien's writing process, drawing heavily on Tolkien's published letters and other sources. Anderson cross-references minute details in the Hobbit with LOTR, Silmarillion, Book of Lost Tales, etc, in order to further explain people, events, and places and to point out cases where Tolkien occasionally contradicts himself. Anderson also discusses the impact the Hobbit has had on different audiences throughout the world.The illustrations are splendid. We have all of Tolkien's original (published and unpublished) artwork for the Hobbit. We have the paintings of modern authorities like John Howe, and we have absolutely horrible artwork by illustrators who must not even have read the book - such as early Russian versions. Not only does that make this book a feast for the eyes, but it is interesting to see how different artists have had their own interpretations of Middle-Earth.For anyone who wants more information or more artwork or the original text of \\"Riddles\\", this is the book for you. Although some might think this book contains too much miscellaneous information, I think it is the perfect volume for anyone who loves Tolkien and his hobbits, wizards, dwarves, and elves."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I first read &quot;The Hobbit&quot; in the 8th grade, at the age of 13.

And to this day it remains a beloved favorite due to Tolkien's exceptional writing, realistic and lovable characters, and the fantastic, complicated world with its unlikely hero: a fuzzy-footed hobbit.Bilbo Baggins lives a pleasantly stodgy and dull life in the Shire, in a luxurious hole under a hill. (\\"It was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort\\") But his life is completely turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves. The dwarves, led by the exiled king-in-waiting Thorin Oakenshield, want to regain the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug, who drove out the dwarves long ago. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar (even though Bilbo has never burgled in his life).So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable -- and dangerous -- adventure. Bilbo and the Dwarves battle goblins and spiders, are nearly eaten twice, are captured and Bilbo is forced to riddle with the treacherous, withered Gollum, and ends up escaping with a magical Ring. But even after these obstacles, the dragon Smaug is still in the Lonely Mountain, and Bilbo is not entirely sure what to do to deal with this enemy.Author J.R.R. Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and Men for years before writing \\"The Hobbit,\\" but \\"The Hobbit\\" is the first story that people had the opportunity to read. It began as a line scrawled on a sheet of blank paper, and then into a bedtime story for his children. And even though it's overshadowed by \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"Silmarillion,\\" this book is an essential link. It's definitely sillier and lighter, but it provides the springboard for a lot of the stuff in \\"Lord of the Rings\\" -- especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.The concept of hobbits started in this book -- the quintessential peaceful \\"wee\\" people, based on British countryfolk, with simple pleasures and unexpected depths of strength and resourcefulness. And, of course, fuzz on their large feet. Tolkien's Elves are a little more ethereal and less dignified, and his dwarves are a bit more comical and less grim. But Elrond hints at the full majesty of the Elves, and Thorin Oakenshield is still the most dignified, proud and impressively flawed dwarf there is. The last chapters of the book hint at the epic majesty of \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" and some of the same victory/loss themes. And of course, the idea that even little people -- like a hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.Tolkien's writing is quick and light, while providing sufficient detail to let you picture what's going on. The dialogue is less influenced by Old English, and the pace is a lot faster (not surprising, since it was originally read to his kids before bedtime). Bilbo is a likable little guy -- he seems to be the last person whom you'd expect to be a courageous hero, but he shows incredibly strength and smarts when he's under pressure. Supporting characters like Thorin, Bard the Guardsman-turned-King, the king of the wood-elves, and even Smaug himself are never cookie-cutter, but multidimensional and immensely interesting to read about.\\"The Hobbit\\" was written for children, but adults can appreciate and enjoy it just as much. So read this book, then scoop up \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" and continue reading. A timeless treasure and classic."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Comparable with Chaucer and Shakespeare, J.R.R. Tolkien is one of the most influential writers in the English Language. His masterful story telling and tails of adventure can be read on so many levels. Tolkien's style and themes have been imitated time and again, and many words have come into the English language from his works. It's a must-read for a full understanding of the current day culture in all English speaking parts of the world.The Hobbit is a light hearted prequel to Lord of the Rings series. A Hobbit and 13 dwarfs set off on an adventure to fight a dragon and reclaim a lost kingdom. Of course, recovering the dragon's treasure is just an added bonus. They have almost as much trouble and adventure just getting to the dragon as they do when they arrive.The Kindle version of this book is Fantastic! The pictures show up more clearly than they do in my paperback copy. The table of contents is interactive and you can easily navigate between chapters using the 5 way controller. Basically, this is one of those rare books that takes full advantage of the e-book medium."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Like most everyone else who has reviewed The Hobbit, I've owned several copies over the years. From a tiny, dog eared paperback that I got free from a RIF event (Reading is Fundamental - they give books to school children) to this graphic novelization. Which is why it is so hard for me to write something bad about this book.I flipping love The Hobbit.But this version is dreadful.First off, it has been abridged. Who in their right mind would cut out parts of the Hobbit?Second off the writing is so teeny weeny and with the pictures running right into the center binding, I had to break the spine to get at the dialogue to read it. Tres annoying.Third, this is sorta a recap of number one, but with the parts left out and then the pictures teeming with activities and characters, well, sometimes it was just plain hard to know what was going on.Anyway, I think instead of this book, I'd rather buy the hardback version of The Hobbit which has pictures at the beginning of each chapter."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The story of , \\"The Hobbit\\" by J.R.R. Tolkien, has taken on a life of it's own. From its first publication in the late 1930's as an obscure children's tale written by a little known professor of Anglo-Saxon history that, as the story goes, has grown greatly in its telling. This pop culture fad of the 60's and 70\`s has morphed into the basis of the blockbuster LOTR films by Peter Jackson and its own films in the near future, (sure to also be blockbusters). Professors Tolkien's Hobbits, Elves and Dwarves have become a fixture and icon of Western Culture. I find it fascinating that he, (Tolkien) remarked to a friend, in 1937 that, \\"I don't much approve of, \\"The Hobbit\\", myself....\\". I think it's possible that he changed his mind as the years went on.I wont go into reviewing the story that so many already know by heart and that others have spoken of at nausea, other than to say that it is a great book for both children and adult's, nuff said.I will however, say a bit about this Edition. I have been lusting after this Edition of, \\"The Hobbit\\", ever since I was sale's clerk at a Walden's in the early 1970's. I think that even then it cost around $20. For those of you who can't recall any President prior to a Bush or Clinton, let me tell you, when you're 16 years old and making just under $2 an hour, that was a sum that only old Smaug himself could afford!This edition is beautifully bound and printed. The illustrations and drawings could be considered a bit unspectacular by today's, \\"razzal-dazzle\\", standards but, they are none the less very enchanting in their own right and done by the author, I think that counts for something.The hard cover box/sleeve that the work comes in both protects the volume and does nothing that detracts from its beauty. If you ever have an evening to spare, translate the ruins that encompass the book, it's a bit of an inside joke.This is a work of heirloom quality. I am greatly looking forward to reading this beautiful edition to the prolific number of grandchildren that our children have produced and seem to drop off with greater regularity, :).All and all this work and this edition come very highly recommended.Spence the Elder\\"Sic gorgiamus allos subjectatos nunc\\"-M.

However, I would like to say that this Alan Lee illustrated edition is magnificient. The illustrations are beautiful and the print is bold and on thick glossy paper. In short, the physical quality of this book is superior to all other editions of The Hobbit I have seen, and I would highly recommend this book for anyone's personal library."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I am sure you have either heard of or read J.R.R. Tolkien's great fantasy classic The Hobbit, but I will tell you about it anyways. Bilbo Baggins is a hobbit(smaller, chubbier folk who have six meals a day, and have very hairy feet) who is living a very easy, relaxing life in his home at Bag End. One fine morning while Bilbo is puffing his smokepipe, the mysterious wizard Gandalf comes along with a band of 13 homeless dwarves asking Bilbo to be the fourteenth member of their adventure through dangerous forests, giant spiders, menacing trolls, savage wolves, and other unknown dangers! Bilbo is persuaded to go and finally it will be Bilbo alone to face the fear of an entire countryside, the great dragon Smaug! J.R.R. Tolkien brilliantly takes you through a marvelous fantasy world in Middle Earth as Bilbo and friends go on their epic adventure. There are plenty of amazing settings and wild creatures. He keeps you on the edge of your seat as Bilbo and company pull off one miracle after another. The copy of The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien that I read was published in 1982 by Ballentine Books. It is meant for older readers, but I think younger people would get a kick out of it also. I give this book a 10 and anyone who wants to read an excellent book should read it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I would even give this edition to first-time readers, who will no doubt have many questions that Anderson attempts to answer. All the various illustrations will no doubt interest younger readers as well.Anderson does perpetuate a couple of myths (such as the notion that Tolkien's Elves had pointed ears) but his research is generally regarded as some of the best in the world and that is well-deserved praise. The book includes all the changes Tolkien ever made to The Hobbit in an appendix which is non-intrusive. There is also an extensive bibliography for further reading.But maybe the best reason to buy the book (if/when it is printed again) is its size. It's a nice, big cuddly book that is easy for an adult to hold, especially if you're reading to a child in your lap or beside you. The book also includes a biographical section on Tolkien that is interesting though short."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I've read the Hobbit many times and each time I find something new to enjoy about it.

It had never occurred to me that I'd read all the books in the LoTR trilogy and had somehow skipped over The Hobbit; it's unfortunate that I missed out all these years from such a great read. But it's a great time to read it now, with the movie coming out.Since it's been so long since I read the trilogy, I can't really compare writing style/differences between the two. But Tolkien certainly has his way of writing which gives you just the details and describes the environment. He also does a wonderful job of portraying the characters and the personalities and the cultural differences between men/dwarfs/elves/wizards/hobbits. As one reads, they truly feel like they're right there along with Bilbo experiencing this adventure.After reading this book, I am an even bigger fan of JRR Tolkien's writing and I absolutely cannot wait to go see the movie!!**I received this book as a gift**"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"What can I say about The Hobbit?

I forgot so much of it and I love Tolkien's way of telling a story. I laughed at many lines, grew to love each character and was reminded again that Tolkien was a genius. If you've never read the books, put them next on your list!He created a language, incredible story lines, creativity beyond most people and even today's famous books are influenced by his story (I love me some Harry Potter, but you can't help but notice the similarities with Lord of the Rings). I am so excited to see the movie coming out this weekend! Not sure how three movies will pan out, but I figure that's just more Tolkien radness on the big screen.After every read or re-read of Tolkien, I'm left with one single question: Is it too much to ask for Middle Earth to be real and for me to be an elf or rider of Rohan?I didn't think so either."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is great!

Over all it was and exciting book. I liked it alot."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien's 1937 novel, \\"The Hobbit: or There and Back Again\\" is the starting point for what became \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". It is a whimsical adventure, introducing us to hobbits, dwarves, elves, dragons, and a host of other fantastic creatures. However, this is not just a tale of quest-adventure, or a simple morality play. Tolkien's own introduction to the first edition notes the \\"glimpses into the history and politics\\" of Bilbo's world that the novel provides. Indeed, \\"The Hobbit\\" is a journey from innocence to experience, but the lessons learned are fraught with contradictions and complicated political messages.\\"The Hobbit\\" begins abruptly, as Bilbo Baggins, a 50 year old hobbit, living a comfortable, sedate life, is intruded upon by the wizard Gandalf and a company of 13 dwarves. Against his better judgement, Bilbo is swept into accompanying this band in a quest to recover the treasure and birthright of Thorin Oakenshield, the dwarf leader. For countless years, the Lonely Mountain, ancestral home of Thorin's people, has been inhabited by the powerful usurping dragon, Smaug. At Gandalf's insistence, the dwarves, believing Bilbo to be an accomplished burglar, recruit the hobbit to assist their quest. The quest, which takes the adventurers halfway across their world, is beset by trials and tribulations, as they must face dangerous goblins, spiders, the dragon, and the commercial civilization of Men. These are trials of mental and physical strength, and they test the dwarves, but more importantly, Bilbo. Bilbo's encounter with Gollum and the adventure of the Ring is the centerpiece of the novel. Bilbo's characterization as a burglar by Gandalf and the dwarves at the novel's beginning casts a shadow over the ethical decisions Bilbo is faced with throughout the rest of the tale.There are many points of interest in a novel like this, which could be seen as a fairly straightforward Marxist fable. Tolkien's distrust of money as a locus of desire is most apparent in the development of Thorin's character, but also in his anxiety over the Master of Lake-Town, and in the fat and complacent Smaug, whose flesh has become embedded with jewels from ages of sitting atop his treasure hoard. Contrasting this with Bilbo, whose primary interest is in food and good cheer, is problematic. His experiences with Gollum and the Ring and his later relationship with Thorin call into serious question Bilbo's own priorities. In fact, one of the things that is so amazing about \\"The Hobbit\\" is that there seems to be no one character that represents the center of morality in a novel so concerned with honorable action and fair dealing.The action of \\"The Hobbit\\" is fast-paced, and Tolkien for the most part is content to sacrifice character development to plot. That said, the most interesting characters in the novel for me were Gandalf, Bilbo, the \\"skin-changer\\" Beorn, and Thorin. They provide a complicated variety of perspectives on inter-cultural relations and politics, value systems, and justice. Tolkien's achievement in \\"The Hobbit\\" is the way that he disguises what is problematic in the society he presents in what appears to be, and is at heart, a fun and enjoyable adventure."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The hobbit is about the adventures of a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins.

It is so fascinating to read about the adventures Bilbo gets into as the book gets nearer and nearer to the end! If you read this and love it like I do, then I suggest you start reading The Lord of the Rings trilogy. But, read The Hobbit first! In this book, Bilbo finds a ring that somehow makes him invisible.

The pages of mind-numbing verse are all-but absent in this book, replaced by actual narration and dialogue.

The story is as rich in detail and plot as the LOTR pseudo-trilogy, if not more so, with the added bonus of actual characterization for many of the characters.

Tolkien, should be made into a movie and in the hopes that you would be willing to direct it.Mr. Spielberg, it came to my attention some time ago that the story The Hobbit should be remade into a feature film and although I know that you probably have an extremely busy schedule it would be a great honor if you would see about directing my movie. As you may already know, The Hobbit has already been made into a movie and that the movie The Lord of the Rings is already in the makings, I still wish to have a remade and revamped version of the story, preferably using live action rather than animation. I feel that the adventurous story of a hobbit as he and his friends make their way to a dragon's lair, in order to slay him, would make for a wonderful movie. There are many fantasy adventure fans out there just waiting for another movie based on this popular book. This story has all the makings for a great movie: a likable and funny main character, a old and wise father figure, a multitude of helpful friends, and the freedom of creativity that only a fantasy story can give. The basic structure of a good lesson, namely the advancement from complacency and boredom to adventure and mystery, and the combination of action packed adventure could possibly even make The Hobbit a better seller even than E.T.The wonderful tale of an adventurous hobbit, of the new friends he makes and their struggle to take back their home should make for a superb movie. Along with the possibility of several sequels if this first movie works out there are the endless possibilities for creativity and ingenuity on the part of the director. Thanks to the advancements in visual arts and computer graphics it is now possible to create the vivid and vibrant universe that was originally created by J.R.R. Tolkien in his wonderful story. My only hope is that you will accept my proposal for a movie based on The Hobbit and that you might be able to direct it yourself or at least pass it on to someone with as much vision as yourself.

I grant that this is an unabridged reading, not a dramatization, but for an example of how the characterizations could have been accomplished, and for sheer listening pleasure you must compare this to the Harry Potter audio books read by Jim Dale. Jim Dale brings the characters to life in his reading with amazingly diverse voice characterizations, speech affectations, differing accents and pacing, such that the voices really suit the characters. In comparison, Mr. Inglis has a very narrow range of voice characterizations, and to my taste his characterizations were distinctly amateurish, flat and one-dimensional really, which was surprising in light of his Shakespearian credentials and disappointing after my experience with the triumph that Jim Dale brought us in the Potter series. In addition there are some rather horrible errors which should have been caught, and these now seem telling in the overall sparkless, indifferent and uninspired performance of this classic. An example of one such error: \\"Confusticate and bebother those dwarves!\\", which was flubbed by Inglis, saying \\"Confiscate\\" instead of \\"Confusticate\\". It is possible that Mr. Inglis thought to correct the text, as there is really no such word as Confusticate, nor \\"Eleventy-One\\" for that matter, but this may also underscore Mr. Inglis' ill-suited understanding of The Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"In my opinion the Hobbit is the most amusing book by kinship to the Lord of the Rings trilogy.

He had many riches and he treasured them so much that he filled the tunnels in the mountain with the treasure. One day a huge dragon invaded the mountain and horded all the gold and had been guarding it to the present day that Gandalf went to Bag End to Bilbo's little hobbit home. So Bilbo and Gandalf and the 14 Dwarves set out to the mountain. The mountain was set in the North Mountain chain. They went through the Dark Woods and the hills and through various mountain chains. They finally got to the mountain and they hid in a cave. Finally, Bilbo found a way to defeat the dragon and he was a hero. He had all the gold and riches he could ever want.The theme of \\"The Hobbit\\", I think is that size does not matter. It is what is inside that counts.I thought that \\"The Hobbit\\" was an extremely good novel. It not only taught a lesson but was intertaining also."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I always go back to this book. Published in 1927 it is the prequel the world best-seller, the Lord of the Rings. Althouh, this book is considered a child's book, I strongly disagree. Tolkien's prose satisfies any age genre and paints a vivid picture of his Middle-Earth.Never has a prequel been so good. It follows Bilbo Baggins, and a band of crazy dwarfs and the Magician Gandalf to the Lonely Mountain, where the dragon Smaug guards a notorious Dwarven treasure. I do not want to spoil any plot details so I will stop here. The most simple synopsis I can give is: For those who are 10 years old, and those who were once 10 years old.Any review of this praised book is inadequate and one must experience for himself the poetry and magic of The Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a very good book.

This all changes when an unsuspecting hobbit named Bilbo, when Gandalf comes back to The Shire. He tells Bilbo of a far off land in peril. He tells of a dragon that is wreaking havoc to the people of the nation. But most of all he tells of an adventure, an adventure that Bilbo is not to keen to be a part of. With a band of dwarves, a wizard (Gandalf), and a Hobbit, the team sets off on their quest. Along the way, the group is met with many challenges including a bunch of trolls, some mischievous elves, and a creature named Gollum. It is in the cave of Gollum that Bilbo has to use his skill of riddles, to outsmart the creature and escape. On the way out of the cave, Bilbo finds a ring that will come to lead to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Their quest leads them to the mountain of the dragon Smaug (Mt. Doom), where it is again up to the smart and cunning of the little Hobbit to save a town. Here, at the lake, and epic battle occurs. With the dragon slain, it is time for the return trip and for life to resume as normal. Bilbo has a hard time trying to readjust to his former life of a hobbit. He is constantly seeking adventure again, and so is looked down upon by the inhabitants of the Shire. This book is filled with action, adventure, and friendship. It is a great read, and starts the epic tale of The Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"A bunch of hobbits and a wizard go a long adventure together.

I loved the movie and you could tell, I guess; but this book struck as directed toward the younger readers.I do not mind the juvenile material, but the conversation was more that I can stand. And other than that it was a fine story.If you had watched the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" movie, you'd know that it started with a hobbit (one of the Hobbits which is a tribe of halflings) named Bilbo, who was trying to have a big party for his elleventeen birthday (111 in the hobbit tongue, don't you think it is very childish for me, sigh). This story, \\"The Hobbit,\\" is the sole account of Bilbo's adventures, and is the predecessor of the \\"Lord of the Rings.\\"Gandalf, who appears in the \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" appears here too, and is one of the integral components of the story. He introduces Bilbo to 12 dwarfs (or dwarves as he insanely like to write it). The 12 dwarfs take Bilbo, who reluctantly agree to accompany them, on a trip to kill a dragon (what can be more childish). These dwarfs have some strange (childish) names, like dori, ori, nori, oin, and gloin.They encounter some trolls, goblins (or orcs), and Bilbo meets a strange creature called Gollum. He gets his ring from there. They meet some more odd creatures and then reach the place where the dragon is.They actually kill the dragon and then have a big fight with some other armies. Bilbo forsakes the dwarfs, for some reason or another. Things must be fixed, so Bilbo becomes a friend of the dwarfs one more time. He gets his share from the treasure of the dragon (all dragons must have treasures, you did not know that? oh my!) and then goes back to his hobbit hole, where he lives.You are welcome to read, you might not get bored, but I am not all that enthusiastic."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I absolutely love this book.

As close as I could imagine Tolkien or Mr. Bilbo would have had it.As for the negative reviews, which almost seem intentionally too long-worded and heavy to want to read, comparing this edition to that edition, blah blah blah.... a review should be just that... otherwise it would be called a comparison, would it not? Sounds like a pissed off writer who never made it, sitting on their chair the wrong way (something up their south-facing orifice)THAT SAID :PI am a book collector. In particular I tend to gravitate towards classics which are bound and covered in such a way as to make them worthy not only of reading, but also for display and even to be handed down within the family. I have inherited and purchased a number of books over the years to this end, and not only is my library becoming and amazing collection to experience through reading, it is becoming a beautiful sight to behold, thanks to books like this particular edition of The Hobbit, which happens to be among my favorites, at the center of my collection.The book is initially pleasing to the eye. The slip-cover is of the same bound heavy card stock as the book cover, with beautiful drawings affixed to either side. The pages are heavy, the page edges have a nice rustic cut (though I wish they were gilded), the print is bold, and the font fitting. It won't be long and you won't be able to find books of this quality anymore.The Hobbit is perhaps my all time favorite story. The first copy I read was a ragged elementary school softcover book, missing pages and covers... I loved the story first long before I became a book collector. Tolkien wrote it primarily from the perspective of the one telling the tale, I.E. \\"There and Back Again\\" by Bilbo Baggins, and if old Bilbo were to have had a printing press, and produced his book en-masse, I imagine, of all the editions I have handled, that this particular one has the most authenticity and character, and is the closest to what Bilbo would have produced himself. This is very original. If like me you become absorbed into what you read, then you know how important the 'feel' of a book can be. You just don't get that same feel from a paper back book.For the money, you will not find a more beautiful, more collectable copy of this tale. I also recommend the matching red-\\"leather\\" bound LOTR with similar slip-cover. All that is said of The Hobbit in this review could also be said for the similar copy of LOTR.Thanks for reading!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"In a mythical or maybe just forgotten time, many creatures lived in places like the Shire, home to Bilbo Baggins, Hobbit. Hobbits are comfort loving creatures with no real sense for adventure. A knock on the door and Bilbo's life is about to change.Calling this book children's book is like calling \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" [see \\"The Annotated Alice\\"] a children's book. Yes children can read this book and it is fun. How ever there is a lot more to this book than a cute story. And it has all the depth of the other Tolkien works with the exception of being shorter.Many people look at this story as a prequel to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", where in reality it is a stand-alone story with a perfectly good beginning, middle, and end. When you read \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" there is enough description to forgo \\"The Hobbit.\\" Personally, I find that reading The Lord of the Rings first gave me the in-depth background to better appreciate The Hobbit.Many of the creatures and adventures will put you on the edge of your seat. You will recognize the personalities and grow along will Bilbo as he faces new challenges as he learns to deal with life.A good book to read first would be \\"The Power of Myth\\" by Joseph Campbell. Then you get a clearer picture of why the story progresses as it does.Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Those who did not like \\"The Hobbit\\"--and I was surprised how many didn't like it--seem to have missed the point. Either they did not really read it or read it very superficially.The author was a professor of Anglo-Saxon and Old Norse, and he took many of the elements of the story--including, for example, the dwarves' names, the the theft of the dragon's cup, and trolls that cannot stand daylight--from the legends and myths of those cultures.Basically, the story is one of a well-to-do middle-aged bachelor (50--which isn't as old for a hobbit as it is for a human, as they live on the average about half again as long as we do) who lives a comfortable, snug, smug existance in the beautiful home his parents--he was an only child--had built. Then, along come thirteen dwarves and a wizard who take him out of that narrow existance and show him a great, big world out there; some of it is beautiful, some of it is horrible, but all of it is exciting; along the way he finds that he's a lot braver and a lot cleverer than he thought he was. He comes home, to his old life, but not the same.The book is all about growing up, maturing, pushing your limits. It is also about the futility of lust for material gain and the horror of war.You don't have to like it; nobody said that you HAVE TO like anyting. But don't say that it is 'pointless' or 'without substance'; to do so will tell more about your intellectual vacuity than about anything else."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"When I was in the seventh grade my English teacher made us read this novel. I am forever indebted to this teacher for introducing me to one of the greatest fantasy novelists of all time. In this delightful tale, Tolkien introduces a new world called &quot;Middle Earth.&quot; &quot;Middle Earth&quot; is a place where dwarves, elves, wizards, dragons, and hobbits live.Of course, in this story, Bilbo Baggins is the consummate hobbit who runs off on a dangerous and exciting adventure (something hobbits do not normally do) with a clan of dwarfs. These adventures lead to dangerous encounters with giant spiders, goblins, etc. Moreover, Bilbo encounters an odd slimy creature named Gollum, who possess a ring that holds great magical power (an item which plays a vital role in the trilogy titled &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;). Gollum is so obsessed with this ring, which he calls &quot;precious,&quot; that he will do anything to get it back from Bilbo (who found it on the ground and later took it from Gollum after a contest of wits and wisdom). Gollum, of course, shows up again in &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot;Another important character in this enthralling tale is a wizard by the name of Gandolf. Gandolf periodically appears to either help Bilbo and his befriended dwarf companions or he appears to give advice or simply converse with his hobbit friend.This story is very captivating from beginning to end. Actually, there are no dull points in the story line at all. The descriptions of this wonderful imaginary world are very florid and imaginative. Tolkien developed an entire world with maps, alphabets, languages, riddles, and very vivid characters who not only win your heart but wheedle your emotions and imagination.This story is not your typical run-of-the-mill fantasy novel. In fact, much of what is called 'fantasy' today owes a great deal of homage to Tolkien and his creative expertise. Since many fantasy novelists who followed Tolkien borrowed in one way or another from him and his works. Tolkien is a master story teller who has an eye for elaborate detail and sophistication. None of his stories are trite or typical. Tolkien stands in a class all his own."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The fantastic and terrific book by J.R.R. Tolkien, which is called THE HOBBIT, which tells a story of a brave Hobbit going to the rescue of a treasure being protected by a dragon. It is an adventure book which every one should read because of the authors way of writing it and also because of its setting, which is very creative. The book tells about a Hobbit, which is a small creature about one meter, more or less and lives in underground holes and are very smart and silent. One day a magician called Gandalf comes to his house and invites him to a journey to rescue a treasure which was stolen from their ancestors by a evil dragon called Smaug. He accepts and gets into a lot of adventure, danger and meets very different creatures, sometimes bad and sometimes good, until the the cave where the dragon sleeps... The first reason I liked the book is because of the authors way of writing. He describes exactly whats happening and makes us able to picture every plant, every character. I also like the setting, which is super well described, and is very creative too, with lots of characters, mountains, and different scenarios which are very well pictured while reading the book. So thats why I think every one should read it and enjoy it, no mater if its a child or an adult, you'll never let the book down until you finish it or let it mold on the top of your desk!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I enjoyed Anderson's book, especially the background into Tolkien's sources and early writings that is invaluable. I must say I have read the Hobbit at least 100 times and yet I have never enjoyed reading it as much as when I read it with Anderson's anotations. I especially appreciated the philological background into the many proper names and archaic words that Tolkien used. What is a &quot;carrock&quot;or what does &quot;confusticate and bebother&quot; mean? Now I know!I also enjoyed the immense number of illustrations that were included, many of them sketches and pictures made by J.R.R himself. Alas, they are not in color, most are black and white prints of original color pictures. If more had been invested in the visual quality of this book, it would have greatly added to the level of pleasure in the words of Tolkien that Anderson's comments bring out. Still worth the money, hopefully Anderson will add color in the next edition"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book will probobly not interest those reading The Hobbit for the first time, but it's excellent for those who want the inside scoop on Tolkien's inspirations and drafts. A good resource for hard-core fans!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"The Hobbit or There and Back Again\\" is the first story of Middle-Earth that was ever read by the masses. And to this day it remains a beloved favorite due to Tolkien's exceptional writing, realistic and lovable characters, and the fantastic, complicated world with its unlikely hero: a fuzzy-footed hobbit.Bilbo Baggins lives a pleasantly stodgy and dull life in the Shire, in a luxurious hole under a hill. (\\"It was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort\\") But his life is completely turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves. The dwarves, led by the exiled king-in-waiting Thorin Oakenshield, want to regain the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug, who drove out the dwarves long ago. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar (even though Bilbo has never burgled in his life).So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable -- and dangerous -- adventure. Bilbo and the Dwarves battle goblins and spiders, are nearly eaten twice, are captured and Bilbo is forced to riddle with the treacherous, withered Gollum, and ends up escaping with a magical Ring. But even after these obstacles, the dragon Smaug is still in the Lonely Mountain, and Bilbo is not entirely sure what to do to deal with this enemy.Author J.R.R. Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and Men for years before writing \\"The Hobbit,\\" but \\"The Hobbit\\" is the first story that people had the opportunity to read. It began as a line scrawled on a sheet of blank paper, and then into a bedtime story for his children. And even though it's overshadowed by \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"Silmarillion,\\" this book is an essential link. It's definitely sillier and lighter, but it provides the springboard for a lot of the stuff in \\"Lord of the Rings\\" -- especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.The concept of hobbits started in this book -- the quintessential peaceful \\"wee\\" people, based on British countryfolk, with simple pleasures and unexpected depths of strength and resourcefulness. And, of course, fuzz on their large feet. Tolkien's Elves are a little more ethereal and less dignified, and his dwarves are a bit more comical and less grim. But Elrond hints at the full majesty of the Elves, and Thorin Oakenshield is still the most dignified, proud and impressively flawed dwarf there is. The last chapters of the book hint at the epic majesty of \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" and some of the same victory/loss themes. And of course, the idea that even little people -- like a hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.Tolkien's writing is quick and light, while providing sufficient detail to let you picture what's going on. The dialogue is less influenced by Old English, and the pace is a lot faster (not surprising, since it was originally read to his kids before bedtime). Bilbo is a likable little guy -- he seems to be the last person whom you'd expect to be a courageous hero, but he shows incredibly strength and smarts when he's under pressure. Supporting characters like Thorin, Bard the Guardsman-turned-King, the king of the wood-elves, and even Smaug himself are never cookie-cutter, but multidimensional and immensely interesting to read about.\\"The Hobbit\\" was written for children, but adults can appreciate and enjoy it just as much. So read this book, then scoop up \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" and continue reading. A timeless treasure and classic."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"&quot;The Hobbit&quot; is one of the best-beloved books out there, for either kids or adults -- it's cute, funny, charming and very well-written. (In general, stories that were originally created to entertain kids are the best) Author J.R.R. Tolkien first scribbed down the opening line of this book on an extra sheet of paper, and later concocted a complex and colorful bedtime story for his kids...&quot;In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.&quot; That hobbit is the determinedly normal Bilbo Baggins, whose comfortably boring life is turned upside-down when the wise wizard Gandalf turns up with thirteen dwarves. But they're not there just to abuse Bilbo's hospitality -- they're there to recruit him as a burglar, so that they can sneak back to the old dwarf stronghold of Lonely Mountain and reclaim it from the dragon Smaug.Before Bilbo knows what's happening, he's being whisked off with the dwarves and Gandalf across Middle-Earth. His odd journey rapidly turns dangerous when they are captured by goblins, he is forced to riddle with a withered creature, finds a golden Ring that will turn its wearer invisible, and they are nearly devoured by monstrous spiders. And he hasn't even gotten to the Mountain yet -- where the dragon is still sleeping.I was seven years old when I first read &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; which wasn't even the start of my appreciation for Tolkien. Now with the movie trilogy partly released, a new buzz of interest around anything and everything &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;-related has brought &quot;The Hobbit&quot; back into bookstore displays. This is a less serious, dark book than the Rings trilogy, but the charming tone and delightful, unexpectedly brave unlikely hero Bilbo will delight both kids and adults. At a bookstore recently, I saw a teenage boy insisting that &quot;Hobbit&quot; was not a children's book, because he still read it. (The final chapters hint at the future epic battles of the &quot;Rings&quot; trilogy, and several plot threads are picked up in those books as well, so note the details...)&quot;The Annotated Hobbit&quot; is a special treat for Tolkien fans, or just people who want to know more about this book and about Tolkien's Middle-Earth. Pictures (Tolkien's own) are included in the middle of it; Douglas Anderson includes plenty of careful footnoting, citing works of mythology, legend, and careful usage of other books by Tolkien to back up his commentary. (For example, one major question is answered: Do Elves have pointy ears? Answer: Yes, and check this book to see why) The binding is nice and tight, the cover is one of Tolkien's illustrations (Smaug on the dwarves' gold), the paper is smooth and very pale so that the words are always clearly visible.Needless to say, if you liked the movies or the books, you'll adore &quot;Hobbit.&quot; If you haven't read it, then do so. And then check out &quot;Annotated Hobbit,&quot; with its extras and bonuses. Great read."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is mostly based on a fantasy world with fantasy people. For anyone that enjoys to reading those types of books I would recommend. I enjoyed the thirteen dwarves and how they identified their own personalities. My most favorite person would have to have been Gandalf,the wizard. He was the one who had been experienced on the journeys and felt settled when they were faced with another conflict or situation. And without him this journey would have never begun in the first place.

It's a really great tale with lots of adventure and twists and turns. I never knew what was going to happen next like when Gandalf leaves the group or when Bard kills the dragon instead of the dwarves. Tolkien uses great imagery that just painted pictures in my head.

At first, I believed this book to be quite a silly story. However, after much reading I have come to see new aspects in the story. The way that the author describes the setting made mr feel as if I was marching through the woods on the adventure. During the dwarve's adventure, they come into contact with many obstacles including goblins on the search to capture them, eagles coming to their rescue, and huge spiders with venim dripping from their mouths. Every step, from the opening of the story onward, is a great adventure. Within the woods of the Misty Mountains one never knows what may be lurking around them. This book is truly a fantasy novel. With goblins, dwarves, elves, hobbits, and wizards, one can only imagine the fantasy it brings. Although as unrealistic the story may seem, I find myself hoping for Bilbo the hobbit to save the dwarves through each adventure. I recomend this book for suspense and mystery. Hoping that the dwarves would find their dragon and get the gold in the end,the only thing I could do was read on!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"If you like adventure,then you'll like this book.The little hobbit was just smoking his pipe when a wizard and a gang of homeless dwarves came along to coux Bilbo into an adventure of a life-time!Read along and see if they can defeat the dragon Smaug and get the treasure that was rightfully theirs?I hope you'll like this book as much as I did."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Simply put, I absolutly enjoyed reading this book. I was never bored, I never found myself questioning the author, I was just purely entertained from cover to cover. This book has been described to me as &quot;the greatest story ever told&quot;, and it comes darn close. It ranks up there with Alice in WonderLand and The Wizard of Oz to name a few. It is just one of those stories you can read over and over and still get completely engrossed in the adventure. The heart of this book lies in the timeless characters Tolkein creates. They are realistic in their humanity, but the fairy tale essence heightens their appeal. You just can't wait to see whom you are going to meet next.

But now as hype over the forthcomming &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilagy grows, I decuded to take the plunge. I LOVED this book. As I was reading some of the hisory around the book, I learned that Mr. Tolkien had started it a bed time stories for his childeren. This is very believable, because I know I was often motivated to reading it aloud. Now, I am on to the Lord of the Rings!If you are at all interested, buy this book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"SYNOPSIS: In the world of Middle Earth, a homebody, worrisome, comfort oriented hobbit is convinced to go on a long, wondrous quest with a wise, old wizard and fourteen dwarves. At the end of this journey lies a huge quantity of dwarven wealth. Only problem is that it's guarded by the most fearsome dragon in the realms. CONCEPT: The creator of hobbits and the Father of Fantasy. The concept itself deals with a stay at home hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, who is given the opportunity to partake in a long hazardous quest to recover lost Dwarvish treasures from a guardian Dragon. Promises plenty of adventure, amazing tales, encounters with mean monsters, wizards and long gone History.This is the best fantasy novel to start with for fantasy series; even above HARRY POTTER (gasp! Yes, I said it). I even gave this to two former girlfriends, both pretty and both not fitting the stereotype of fantasy readers, and they both loved it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is the best book I have ever read!

Over dinner Bilbo discovers that he has the ability to be a most excellent thief. He learns the tales of the dwarves, and how most powerful and fierce dragon took their homes and fortune from them. This dragon's name is Smaug. The land in which the dwarves treasure and fortune lies is the city of Dale by the Lonely Mountain At first Bilbo is hesitant to even go on the journey, and thinks that the dinner has was put up to by the dwarves was just a dream.

On the way, in the presence of a very terrible creature named Gollum, Bibo gets a magical, ring, which makes him invisible. Gandalf who was the parties' leader, leaves to take care of some business he has to deal with. Bilbo is then looked upon as the party's leader. Bilbo is a bit worried that he will not live up to the expectations that the dwarves have of him, but he proves himself worthy of being a leader on more than one occasion. After the long hardy journey is finally over, the party reaches the Lonely Mountain to retrieve their treasure. To find out what is to become of the group and their treasure read The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien....."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I think the Hobbit was an OK book. It is about a hobbit named Bilbo, who lives a very scheduled life until he meets 13 dwarves and a wizard. Bilbo doesn't like adventures, but his mined is changed after his long journey for a teasure. Bilbo runs into many dangers including a dragon named Smaug, Goblins, Trolls and Wolves. Bilbo makes many friends on his journey and looses friends too. I didn't like the ending to Smaug. They made him such a big character, but he dies so quickly.

The characters pass through well described places such as Rivendell, The Misty Mountains and Mirkwood on their way to Lonely Mountain, in order to take back treasure stolen by the great dragon Smaug.One of the things I liked most about The Hobbit is that we can all find our inner-Hobbit; the part of us that wants nothing but an easy and comfortable life. But there is still something inside all of us that perks up at the thought of adventure and a journey into the unknown.The Hobbit is a book that can be enjoyed by children and adults alike.

You may call it that if you wish. This book is smiled upon if you read it for the story, if you think of it as a bedtime story that the speaker made up and that the listeners wanted written down.

Movie left too much out."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Descriptions are fabulous. Tension is felt. Magic is present on the trails, having tea with the hobbit, and in the many escapes from the bad things."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"When J.R.R. Tolkien wrote The Hobbit, he likely had no idea that it would become the first book in a lengthy series which today serves as the archetypal example of high fantasy. Still further from his mind would have been the idea that his story could find its way into the theaters of the the next century as a blockbuster production.Taken solely on its own merits, however, The Hobbit is still an exceptional book. Tolkien weaves together bits of European mythology, stringing it into a tapestry with threads of his own prodigious creativity, to write a book with appeal to all ages. The poetry can be a bit corny by modern standards, but the overall style of writing and the narrator's tone make the story come alive for the reader.The Kindle edition of The Hobbit has an issue with images in text, causing many of them to appear \\"sideways\\" regardless of the angle of the Kindle. While this won't be an issue for the majority of readers, for some (particularly younger children), it could be frustrating. Still, this is too minor a concern to justify a lower star rating."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I loved reading it. Can't wait for part 2. I think the best part is the ending.

Movie fans need to be aware that the film takes considerable leway from the book. The role of Thorin is larger in the film than in the book and he is much more the hero in the film. It will be interesting to see how this plays out in the future films.Tolkien writes the Hobbit as if he is writing for a young audience, he also uses humor to advantage in this novel. This does not mean I did not appreciate the book. But it is not for very young children, there is too much detail for them.

It's definitely a different &#34;flavor&#34; compared to LotR, but that doesn't mean it's not as good, it's just different.

That's kind of a shame now, because I missed getting my kids into this wonderful story earlier.Who doesn't want to go on an adventure?Okay. Most hobbits don't, but most children do.I would encourage everyone to read this book again before seeing the new movies. As visually spectacular as they are, they do deviate from the story in the book in odd and seemingly unnecessary ways.

He very much enjoys going back and forth between his numerous pantries and smoking some pipes.One day Bilbo gets an unexpected visitor: The wizard Gandalf is standing at his door and offers him an even more unexpected adventure. Bilbo, though, doesn't have the slightest desire to be part of this. He prefers to concentrate on less dangerous things, such as cake for example. Lots of cakes, to be perfectly clear.However, shortly after, Bilbo is confronted with even more unannounced visitors - a bunch of dwarves are making themselves comfortable in his living room and eat all the delicacies from his pantries while discussing and planning said adventure. It takes some serious persuasion by Gandalf (that very much address Bilbo's idea of honor) to make the little hobbit decide to accompany the dwarves on their daring journey. He does regret this decision several times later on.Together with the wizard and 13 more or less brave dwarves he has to pass trolls, make it through the dangerous Misty Mountains and through the even more dangerous Mirkwood with its enchanted Forest River, to eventually reach Lonely Mountain. This is the final destination of their risky journey, because there, the dragon Smaug is sitting on a huge golden treasure that once was stolen from the dwarves and which they now want to get back under all circumstances.With the help of a golden ring, that Bilbo receives through a trick from the strange creature Gollum, and which can make its wearer invisible, he escapes great dangers more than once. Slowly, the once frightened and cautious Bilbo Baggins turns into a brave and bold version of himself, who saves his companions from danger several times.It was exciting to accompany Bilbo on all his adventures. A big reason for that is Tolkien's impressive writing style: It is captivating and totally dragging the reader into the story - there is no escape. Often, I have been staying up late to read \\"only one more chapter\\" (we all know how that works ;) ). Many times, I had to smile about cranky Bilbo or the grumpy dwarves.I loved this courageous little group; constantly hoping, they would be able to successfully fight all the dangers, and hopefully with most of them surviving. ;DBilbo's character really developed through all of this. By the end of the book there was almost nothing left of the once timid hobbit. Okay, he still is a little greedy when it comes to food, but I guess that's just in the nature of hobbits. He has a good heart, is honest and always tries to make everyone happy and to be fair. Overall, he was such a likeable character to me, which is a bit weird, because in Lord of the Rings, I found his character to be rather strange and couldn't get a real connection to him. Now, that I know his own \`story', I understand his character much better and just love that charmingly quirky dude.The end of this book, which apparently left many people disappointed, was totally okay with me. It was exciting and exactly what I was expecting. With Tolkien, most stories are built up the same: There's an adventurous journey, with a lot of dangers and mystical creatures such as elves, Orcs, Wargs or, well, dragons. At some point the journey ends and then there is a furious ending, which I, of course, don't want to spoil here ;). So, like I said, I expected it and it was just perfect to me.I even shed some smallish tears over it and finished the book with a big *SIGH*. I was sad that the long journey now had come to its end. One of my favorite quotes is from Paul Sweeney: \\"You know you've read a good book when you turn the last page and feel a little as if you have lost a friend.\\"This.With each end every book of Tolkien's.I am going to watch the movie next week and am very excited about it :)The Misty Mountains Song, which I posted at the beginning of this review, already very much convinced me and I hope the rest of the movie is just as awesome :)However, I do think that making a trilogy out of a book that only has ~300 pages is somewhat strange (and very much \\"milking the cow\\" = pure money making), but okay.Gotta watch the movie first to form my own opinion about that - maybe a trilogy really is a good idea in the end.To me, \\"The Hobbit\\" certainly is a classic, which every fan of epic fantasy should have read at least once in their lifetime."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have never been a fantasy lover until I read, &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. As I read the book, I actually forgot where I was because it was so interesting. I loved the sarcastic vocablulary that J.R.R. Tolkein used throughout the book. This is an excellent book for middle grade students to read. It gives them the chance to step out of reality and broadens their imagination."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit was a wonderful fantasy book that portrayed the new ideas of modernism throughout the turn of the century. It did this by portraying wisards, monsters, and different kinds of creatures and staying away from religion. The Hobbit was an interesting book and I enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I just read The Hobbit for school. I liked it very much. Itis a wee bit childish, but I don't think adults can't appreciate it,too. Besides, it was based on bedtime stories Tolkien told his children, so why shouldn't it be childish? I skimmed over a lot of the descriptive passages at times because I was more interested in just getting it done (That isn't the book's fault, it's just that I wanted to get it done). But what I did read was very descriptive. The adventures were pretty exciting and the story was pretty engrossing. Interesting characters and lively plot, as well. I would like to read the Lord of the Rings books; no doubt they're just as good."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I really liked that book, it was fun reading, not to difficult from the language yet still binding! - the only reason it got only 4 stars is that 5 stars should be reserved for The Lord of the Rings! One thing I don't like about this book (as well as about the LOTR) is that there are so many different prints - having pictures in them from different artist rather than those painted from Tolkien himself."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I fell in love with this wonderful children's book at the age of 8. It was so simple and fun, yet in its own way so magical and incredibly entertaining (seven for an eight year old). Tolkien seemed to be, as a front, writing a children's book.Coming back, though, I read it again and on a completely different level. Yes, it was still entertaining, fun. But not once, NOT ONCE, upon the reread did I think of it as a children's book. It was still light and cheerful, but now a stark parable was presented in every character; a viscious greed that made two enemies (Thorin and Smaug) more similiar than they ever would realize; Gollum, who condemned himself by his own idiocy and corruptness; and, most of all, Bilbo, who secretly longed for adventure, though he himself didn't know it.In the style of Hemingway and Steinbeck, Tolkien uses simple words to create an elegant writing style and a complicated tale. In his sequels, The Lord of the Rings, however, he loses his simple eloquence and falls into the same pit Dumas fell years before him. Don't read the Lord of the Rings, whatever you do.And here's to all of you who dislike this enchanting, warm-hearted tale: maybe you still can't realize its warmness and brightness that brings alive a piece of childhood in all of us, or maybe, you are to disgrateful to fully appreciate the beauty of the magical Middle Earth, and the charm of Bilbo, THE HOBBIT."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings are my favorite books of all time. You are missing something if you don't love these books. They are charming, quaint, sad, funny and FANTASTIC! I can't even come close to describing how wonderful they are. I first read them when I was in high school in the 70's and have re-read them countless times since. They are awe-inspiring!I deeply regret that Tolkien passed away before I ever got a chance to meet him. I would have done just about anything to talk to the man who wrote these stories...he was a genius! He wrote his own language! He was fabulous!There is also a book that was published of letters he wrote and illustrated for his children from Santa Claus...he would send THEM letters from the North Pole every year. Can you imagine being a child and RECEIVING letters from Santa Claus? What a cool dad!Tolkien changed my life and my way of thinking with his books and I pity anyone who has never entered Middle Earth. I've never read anything that comes close to these books. I think I'll read them again..."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I am a large fan of the hobbit.

I'm now soon to be in the 12th, and recently reread it for old times' sake. What a disapointment. Tolkien's story telling seriously lacks in dialogue. The plot is also incredibly boring, and unbelievable (i know, i know... it is fantasy), but we can't blame Tolkein for that, seeing as he was one of the first fantasy writers. For the more experienced fantasy/sci-fi reader out there i suggest Orson Scott Card, Samuel Delany, William Gibson, and Ursula Le Guin. The hobbit is an enjoyable fairy tale, but not nearly worthy of the praise it recieves. I only give it 3 stars because Tolkien paved the way for so many others."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is the greatest, and a must have to introduce you into the world of Middle Earth."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The hobbit is defiantly a great book but I really liked The Lord of the Rings better. The hobbit is very important though because it sets the stage for the ring trilogy. By itself it is still an engaging,interesting, and enchanting story."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I recommend The Hobbit to anyone who enjoys a book you can't put down. You should have at least a 6th grade reading level. It is about a hobbit named Bilbo Bagins who is a normal hobit until one day... An unexpected party shows up with lots of dwarves and a wizard named Gandalf. They go on a mission to find the evil dragon Smaug who has stolen treasure from thier ancestors. They are trying to win it back It is the first book of a series of 4. If you read this book you should read the other three called The Lord of The Rings trilogy. J.R.R. Tolkien has created a real page turner because he keeps the suspense going. It keeps you on the edge of your seat. That is why I recommend The Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The only other equal books I've read are The Lord of the Rings series.Tolkien was a genius when it came to books.

I read a lot. I guess you could call it a hobby. Therefor, I am well versed in literature, and The Hobbit is in a class of it's own. I could reread it again and again and it will always fascinate me.

If you never read this book I truly believe that your life will never be complete. Mine wouldn't be."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book was great. Bilbo Baggins was a perfect character for this book.At first he seems like a coward at heart, then he becomes a fighter when he sees how much he is needed.

Like the person who previously reviewed it my only regret is not reading it sooner! This is the thrilling and mystical story of a respectiful and sqeamish little hobbit named Bilbo Baggins of Bagshot row who is visited one day by an extrodinarly renowned wizard selling, er, adventures and eventually somewhat &quot; tricking &quot; Bilbo into accompaning thirteen easily likable dwarves in their quest to reclaim their lost gold. I won't tell any more, for that would ruin it but it is a wonderfull and whimsical story that sweeps you away from your troubles into the land og wargs and wizards and things as evil Goblins and as good as Elrond the occupant of the last homely house in the mysty mountains. I will probably read this book again one day because it is wonderfull. J.R.R Tolkien was one of the most original and creative writers ever with his brilliant poetry and songs and descriptions of far off places of fear and brilliance. In short buy this booka nd read it, you won't reqret it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a classic, a must read for anyone who loves fantasy. From start to end, the Hobbit never seases to amaze and delight. With a cast fo characters, ranging from Gandolf, a wizard to Smaug, a dragon, the reader is taken through the ups and downs of the adventure.I would have to say that my favorite part was where Gollum was challenging Bilbo, the hero of this book, to a game of riddles. Here is where the real story begins as Bilbo finds a ring, that Gollum refers to as his precious.This is the best written and thought of book of its kind. A must read for anyone. I give it four stars."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a true classic fantasy tale. It can spark the immagination of the young and the old. In this respect it is much like the Harry Potter series. I am 33 and I enjoyed Harry Potter as much as any fantasy tale. The Hobbit was groundbreaking in that it paved the way for generations of future science fiction writters. It was written in 1937 and to this day it sparks the immagination of the young and the old. It is a great book to introduce young minds to reading and it is a fun tale you can later enjoy as an adult. The Hobbit has passed the test of time. Not too many books written in the 1930's are still so loved as the Hobbit. It is a treat that should not be missed."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is certainty up there with my favorites. It takes you along with the adventures going on in the book, until you feel a part of it. It is wonderful and opened my imagination. I strongly suggest it, and the collectors addition just adds more magic on to it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I fell in love with the cartoon version of this movie as a child. Now, as a teenager I can appreciate the book all the more, and I thoroughly enjoy every moment of Bilbo's adventure. 5 big ol' stars!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I just read &quot;The Hobbit&quot; for what I've estimated to be the tenth time, and Tolkien never disappoints. Come visit the Hobbit hole at Bag End, where you're always welcome...journey to the lake under the mountain...cross the enchanted river flowing through Mirkwood...and on to the Long Lake and the Dwarven Mountain overtaken by the evil worm Smaug. &quot;There and Back Again&quot; is quite the appropriate alternate title.Tolkien synthesized many mythical creatures and stories into his introduction to the Lord of the Rings. The story was meant for children, and is certainly not a difficult read, but anyone who enjoys fantasy, adventure, and heroism will not be disappointed by Tolkien's marvelous book.Without giving the plot away, the book does have more to it than simply the plot...consider, for example, the obstacles Bilbo and his party face. Water (it's been suggested before) is a recurring theme. Also taking into account where Tolkien is from and the time he wrote &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and the Lord of the Rings, some have examined whether the books contain historical allusions.Most, however, leave the academic arguments aside and simply read &quot;The Hobbit&quot; as Tolkien, at least foremost, meant it to be: an escape to Middle Earth, an epic adventure with an unassuming, timid, and at the beginning, most unwilling Hobbit. Enjoy! econ"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Have you ever been at a particularly challenging point in your life? Ever woken up in the middle of the night and wondered, \\"How did I get into this mess?\\" I'm willing to bet that Bilbo Baggins wondered this many a night as he went through his adventure in J.R.R. Tolkien's novel, The Hobbit. One day Bilbo's life was peaceful, orderly, and quiet, shut up in his little hobbit hole. The next he was worrying about trolls creeping up in the night, or spiders swallowing him whole as he led eleven dwarves and a wizard to retrieve stolen treasures from a legendary dragon. Tolkien makes readers feel as thought they are really there. Their hearts pound as the characters race from evil goblins. They can almost feel the bitter cold of the mountains, the cruelty of the dragon, the vulnerability of the dwarves, and the terror of the war between them. As a teenager, I don't read much fantasy. Normally, I enjoy books that are true to life and have things in them that really happen. But Tolkien makes the novel seem so real and honest that I find myself believing in every word he writes. There are always a few questions people ask when I try to tell them about this book. One question I hear a lot is, \\"Aren't I a little old for fantasy?\\" Never! Fantasy is written for anyone who has an imagination--who believes in dreaming and accomplishing his or her dreams. Fantasy is for them, and I believe anyone can dream. Another question is, \\"What is a hobbit?\\" A hobbit is a small creature with large hairy feet, an enormous appetite, and excellent eyes and ears. They love parties and hate adventure. So why did a wizard named Gandalf knock on his door one sleepy morning and push him into the greatest adventure of his life? What did the long, grueling journey have in store for Bilbo? How would he change? Find out when you read The HObbit, and enchanting, captivating book that I most definitely recommend. Take the journey of a life time that you're sure to never forget--and experience it through a hobbit's eyes."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have done dozens of reviews for Amazon and I have hundreds of reviews on other sites, and The Hobbit is one of only 2 books I ever gave 5 stars to. Simply put, everything else is worse by comparison. This book began the entire fantasy genre, and it is still far and away above all of its competitors. Put simply, there has never been and probably never will be a fantasy author as good as J.R.R. Tolkien. I read this book for the first time when I was 6 and I have reread the series at least 20 times since. What makes this book (and the entire series) so compelling is the level to which Tolkien develops his characters and settings; it is very easy to completely lose yourself in his words. You don't read this book, you experience it. I wholeheartedly recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The hobbit has to be my all time favorite book.

Cheery at some points and very dark at others, by the time the end is reached (or so it seems...) the tale has come full-circle and given the reader a pleasant taste of a great story told by a master storyteller. Probably best geared for the 8 - 12 age group, but good for adults as well - and an almost necessary prerequisite to the Rings trilogy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"&quot;The Hobbit&quot; is a well written book that inspires people to read.

So I go take the book out of the library. I liked it -- a lot! The songs were kind of boring, and the plot was little more than a long series of mishaps, but it's told in a captivating narritive fasion that will keep your attention. The charachters are very likeable. It reminded me of C.S. Lewis' &quot;Cronicles of Narnia&quot;. Go read it if you like fantasy, I can't wate to read &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.

Although written originally for children, J. R. R. Tolkien's epic tale of the quest undertaken by the hobbit Bilbo Baggins, the wizard Gandalf, and thirteen dwarves is an enchanting saga which should interest adults too. It's a fascinating, often gripping, tale, recounting Bilbo's adventures as he and his companions confront trolls, goblins, giant spiders and unfriendly elves before battling the great dragon Smaug. Bilbo's discovery of the One Ring of Power and his fateful encounter with Gollum is merely a minor aspect of this tale. Fans of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; as well as those interested in reading a great work of fantasy shall not be disappointed with &quot;The Hobbit&quot;."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a wonderful book full of rich characters set in a time and place that never existed...or did it? The characters in it are so real with good and bad traits that we can all identify with. There's always an air of mystery, of something that is just beyond our sight and more than it appears.I don't rate this as highly as The Lord of the Rings trilogy because it's written to a younger audience. But it is still a wonderful tale told well that anyone can read. I just prefer the depth of the other set.All of the bad reviews I've read of this book have been from video game players who have the attention span of a memory chip. Wake up, o sleeper and partake of a real adventure!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I read this book when I was about 9 or 10. Up until that time, even though I was a good reader, I didn't particularly enjoy it. Tolkien showed me just how powerful literature could be, and I haven't stopped reading since.What I enjoyed the most about this book was the well developed, three dimensional characters. I could almost picture them in my mind. Tolkein had a gift for creating imagery that is beautiful and realistic. His use of language totally enraptured me and kept me engrossed in the story.What's really neat about this book, as well, is that I think it will have as much appeal to girls as it does to boys. That has not been the case in other fantasy-type books I've read. In fact, this novel is really the only one of it's genre that I've ever enjoyed. So, don't be put off if you think you don't like fantasy. I would also note that there is an abridged version with illustrations that younger children (I saw a grade one class sit totally still as their teacher read from it to them) will likely enjoy. Despite being pegged by some as a &quot;kid's book&quot;, however, this book is actually one that will appeal to readers of all ages."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"My 11-year-old daughter liked this performance. She and I listened to it together once a week over a month or so. The actor's performance is very good. The elements of the story are terrific--it's quite an adventure that Bilbo goes on.

Ideal for all ages! Well worth the read."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It's a nice, big book with a lot of beautifully painted illustrations inside. One thing I didn't expect was that the cover shown is actually the cover protector (I don't know if it said that in the description I read) and the real cover is very plain, green and with gold writing. All the same, I'm thrilled to have it and would recommend it to just about anyone."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It's great to finally have an unabridged version of this book. The narrator does all the voices, and even sings the songs. Some characters sound a little more pompous that I would have liked, but there you go. I have loaded the Nicol Williamson version of this onto iTunes, but it is heavily abridged, only 4 hours long. This one is 11 plus hours. If you (like me) are going to load these onto iTunes, get ready for many hours of work. The book is 16 disks long. And it seems that the data for each disk was written by a different person, so you will have to make many alterations. But it's all worth it in the end."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Definitely a great read. One of the best books I have ever read. Everyone should read this at least once, if not to just expose themselves to elves and dwarves and such. (:"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I bought it to re-read an old favorite. Still enchanting, but I don't see how they can make 3 movies out of this little book!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I read this book in my school library back in the 70's and my daughter seems to like the LOTR movies, so I thought I'd get at least the first book. I seem to remember a much larger book with smaller print, but it could be me. I looked at all the info inside the book, but it doesn't make clear if this version is unabridged, edited down, or what. It IS the entire Hobbit story (Unlike the current movie, being split into 3 parts), so I can't complain about that, but it would be nice to know if this version is the unrevised, unabridged version or not."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have owned a copy of &#34;The Hobbit&#34; for 37 years. It wasn't until I read it this past month that I realized it was actually a children's story."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I read the book years ago, then saw the movie with my grandson recenly. I and decided to read the book at the same time and I really enjoyed reading it again."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I had to re read this one after I saw the movie. Funny how maturity changes your perception.... Last time I read this I was 15. Still great, but it seemed more like a string of short stories than a novel."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit tells the story of Bilbo Baggins, who finds himself in the middle of an adventure when Gandalf the Gray, a wizard, shows up at his door, bringing 13 dwarves with him. The dwarves are starting a quest to reclaim their lost home and gold from the dragon Smaug. Bilbo loves his home and his simple life, but he finds his Tookish side forcing him in.I was extremely happy with The Hobbit. I thought it was masterfully told, and I enjoyed Tolkien's style. I particular like how he is very straightforward, and doesn't force the reader to feel emotion. Instead, he presents the plot and allows the readers to feel on their own. I was often surprised by how casually a death or important, emotional event was told.My only criticism of the book would be that there are too many characters. The 13 dwarves are named Fili, Kili, Oin, Gloin, Dwalin, Balin, Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, Dori, Nori, Ori, and Thorin. Although the names are rather amusing, it is often hard to remember who is who. Having all of the names (except Thorin) very similar to at least one other name can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, it is very amusing, and it can help you remember their relationships, such as Fili and Kili being brothers. It can also make you feel like you know all of them when you really don't. On the other hand, it can be confusing at times and it can distort your perception of how many people are in the party.In conclusion, I was extremely happy with The Hobbit, and would highly recommend it. I loved the story, how it was told, and the themes present in it. Although I thought there were some issues with the characters, it was a very impressive read. I am definitely going to be reading more Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is great! The character of Bilbo Baggins makes you want to read more. In summary, READ THIS BOOK NOW! Don't just sit there, START THAT WONDERFUL WONDERFUL BOOK! Teluca"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book changed my life. I have only read two books in life, Jurassic Park, and Eyes of the Dragon. It took me a year to finish each of them and I didn't like either of them. Then one day, I was doing some web surfing at Apple Computer's QuickTime web site and saw a banner for The Lord of the Rings movie preview. I clicked it and saw the preview. When it ended, the only word that came to my mind was awesome. I then thought, &quot;Well if they are spending all this time and money on bring J.R.R. Tolkien's story to life, then hell the least I can do is read the books!&quot; I then picked up my brother's copy of The Hobbit (he has been reading The Lord of the Rings and the works of Tolkien for a year and half).I read the whole book in just two weeks! I couldn't put it down. One night I was having a hard time sleeping, so I got up at three in morning just to read The Hobbit. This was the first book I have ever enjoyed reading.Once I have kids and when they are old enough, I will read them The Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This great book has it all. It has a great adventure of an everyday hobbit whose life turned aroud in just one nihgt. The descriptions are superb along with the comical aspects of a truly magnificent book!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"A great and fasinating account of a hobbit (a beardless type of a dwarf with leathery feet) going on the adventure of a lifetime meeting up with some very strange and interesting characters.The novel is very interesting and I recommend it to everybody. Kids and adults will enjoy this absolutely ravishing adventure alike.J.R.R. Tolkien is the best fantasy novelist ever. His books have gained ample recognicion for a very good reason.This is one of my favorite books (if not my favorite) and I can't wait to finish reading the Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is the best book ever. A mixture of fantasy and action, Tolkien wrote this book perfectly. For all of the people out there that thought this book was a failure because it was too hard to read, tellin you, It was my favorite in 4th grade. And if you think it was hard to keep up with the characters, you really need to reread it again. This book is about a Hobbit who goes off on an adventure with 13 dwarfs and a Wizard, and faces many challenges through the way, including wolves, goblins, spiders, elves, men, and a huge dragon. It is the best book in the world, and you should read it. Stop reading this review and READ IT!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is a true classic book despite what people say. Anyone who could possibly hate this book even a tiny bit doesn't know how to enjoy classic and well written literature. I'm 13 and have read books by most of the classic authors including hemingway's &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;; George Orwell's &quot;1984&quot;; Steinbeck's &quot;Of Mice And Men&quot; and &quot;The Grapes Of Wrath&quot;;Kafka's &quot;Amerika&quot;; and Homer's &quot;Illiad&quot; and &quot;odessy&quot;. These classic books are the greatest of our time, but J.R.R Tolkien's &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy&quot; are defidently better than all of these. If a person could give anything worse than a 4 star they are ignorant, fools that don't know the difference between &quot;The Cat In The Hat&quot; and the great writings of J.R.R. Tolkien. Even a 4 star rating is worse than what this book deserves. If I could, I would give this book 6 stars. I dedicate this review to the people who would dare to insult this piece of art by giving it a rating below 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"In this book, J.R.R. Tolkien keeps the story flowing so thereis rarely a dull moment.Most book readers like the flow of actionthat this book provides. Teenagers can relate tothis book because Bilbo was just about forced to go on the adventure and he had no ideawhat he was getting into. The only flaws of this novel include a slow beginning and a lotof characters to remember, although it isn't too hard to remember all of them. The novelis well written overall. This book is adventurous, while allowing you know to it isfiction. In conclusion, I think The Hobbit is a good example of what J.R.R. Tolkien canwrite, but why stop there. There are similar books to this one, also written by J.R.R.Tolkien, that include The Two Towers and The Return of the King. Enjoy the book!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I first got in touch with this book when I was in elementry third grade. It was the book that made me intrugued into the world of fantasy stories.
