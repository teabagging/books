He would end up on the attack aircraft carrier USS Yorktown, and keep a diary for much of the remaining portion of World War II. During his stay, the Yorktown would refit and rearm in the great atoll harbor of Ulithi with its islands of Asor, Mog Mog, Falalp 400 miles southwest of Guam. Today, as seen from Google Earth it remains impressive, but what it would have looked like during the latter stages of the war with 100 ships anchored within its confidence must surely have been something to see from the air. From Ulithi, the Yorktown began to operate off Japan in support of the Okinawa landings.The Yorktown was the epitome of the new paradigm for force projection, nestled in its protective shield of battleships, submarines, cruisers, destroyers and tankers, a huge armada bringing retribution far and wide. In fact, while Bryant was aboard, it would register its 21,000th air craft landing in March of 1945.Bryant's account of life aboard a Pacific aircraft carrier is at once personal and yet explanatory in its detail - the harsh heat, the sudden call to battle stations, the Japanese bomb penetrating below decks, bouts with malaria. There is a large measure of the daily scuttlebutt so prevalent aboard ship, with many concomitant CIC's (\\"Christ I'm confused\\") moments. There are skunk (surface contacts) alerts and bogey (air contacts) alarms and wry humor: the chaplain explains that \\"Today is Palm Sunday. Last Sunday was bomb Sunday.\\"This is really not a work of grand strategy. Instead, it is a charming tale of young men in a serious war, or as Admiral William F. Halsey called it, \\"This yarn in diary form.\\" Nevertheless, it resonates with power and insight, and casts in sharp relief life aboard the attack carrier battle group, which even today remains the enduring paradigm for force projection at see, then seen in its initial, muscle flexing stage."},{"Title":"Paul and the Macedonians: The Life and Letters of Paul","review":"Designed to be a six-week Bible class study guide, author David DeSilva brings an interesting and informative examination with his 108-page book \\"Paul and the Macedonians\\" (paperback 2001). This quick study presents Professor DeSilva's analysis of St. Paul's three 1st century letters to the Philippians and Thessalonians.The book is divided into six easy to read chapters that contain multiple sections designed for participation, leading, and teaching. These sections host several questions in caption boxes that will evoke group discussion.DeSilva tells St. Paul's missionary story with an eye to chronological events by means of specific faith-filled vignettes. Although no footnotes or maps are provided in the text DeSilva's biblical scholarship is apparent. He cites many Bible verses throughout the book. The book is replete with information about St. Paul, 1st Greek and Roman Philippi and Thessalonica, and 1st century Mediterranean culture.Perhaps the only downside to this book is the author's protracted use of St. Luke's secondary source \\"Acts of the Apostles\\" for Paul. (Certainly, when Luke is good he is really good, but when Luke does not know information about Paul of Tarsus, he is really bad!) It is much better to use Paul's own words to navigate his story and sprinkle in Lucan certainty occasionally.DeSilva is a very good study book. It is recommended to all who want to study St. Paul, his Macedonian letters, or the 1st century Greco-Roman world."},{"Title":"The Novel Writer?s Toolkit","review":"Good book.

Now, years later, the pages are all marked up, paragraphs are highlighted, pages dog eared, and I love it.If you are just starting out and want a book to help you learn about the intricacies of writing a novel, this book will be there for you from the beginning to the end of your journey.Thank you Bob Mayer!"},{"Title":"The Novel Writer?s Toolkit","review":"This is the book one needs to move them in the \\"write\\" direction.

I would recommend complimenting this book with one that deals with the inner creative nature (like The Creative Fire by Clarissa Pinkola Estes). While the Toolkit focuses on creating a product to be sold (it's only negative point), The Creative Fire espouses creating because that is what the creative spirit within you longs for.It might also be helpful to see what novels the author of the Toolkit has written.

Other books I've read have tried to focus too heavily on the technical aspects of writing and not so much on the steps and concepts. What makes this book so easy to read is that everything is broken down into individual &quot;tools&quot; that, when read in order, will walk you through the entire novel writing process from beginning to end.This book also fufills an excellent role as a reference guide. Since everything is broken down into &quot;tool&quot; sections, it's easy to flip through the book to find what you want to know. Multiple appendices in the rear section of the book will help you outline your story, break down chapters, and assist you in writing cover letters. The index is also fairly useful and extensive.I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn the process behind writing a novel or wanting to improve their current skills. Mr. Mayer does a superb job."},{"Title":"The Novel Writer?s Toolkit","review":"As I was reaching about the halfway point in this book I began looking ahead to the review I would write for it and at that time was contemplating just three stars. The reason was that the information up to that point was often so elementary that it was almost not worth reading, i.e. advice about getting a word processor (duh) and some of the tips about writing basics. However, things really picked up from there and I found the second half of the book, which dealt with the subject of getting a book published, to be very helpful and enlightening, if rather discouraging. But as a previous commenter noted, the author doesn't hold any punches and makes no attempt to sugar coat the harsh world of publishing. Personally I'm thankful for his candid observations even if they do paint a bleak picture. If the entire book were as enlightening as the second half I would easily give it five stars, but because of the shortcomings of the first half I'm only willing to give it four. It's definitely worth your time to read this book though, so don't let this criticism deter you from taking a look for yourself."},{"Title":"The Novel Writer?s Toolkit","review":"The Novel Writer's Toolkit: A Guide to Writing Novels and Getting PublishedBob Mayer's \\"The Novel Writer's Toolkit: A Guide to Writing Novels andGetting Published\\" is a really great book. This book should be on everyaspiring writer's book shelf. I have been an aspiring writer for the pastsixteen years and I'm really learning from this. Bob Mayer doesn't sugar-coat the business aspects of writing. The other great thing isthat this is an easy-to-read, step-by-step book. Mayer also has awonderful theraputic approach to writing and says that anyone can learnhow to write. It's not some sort of mystical talent people have the day they are born. Mayer also gives charts and grids on how to make your story better.Mayer doesn't babble on about pointless aspects of writing, like a lot of self-help writing novels do. Mayer really knows his trade and gives great advice. He talks about why and how aspiring writers fail. He also makes you really think about yourself and your needs as an author, wheather or not you're really cut out for the business side of writing. Mayer gives great details about every aspect that should be in a book, from characters to plot points and other things you wouldn't even think about.The other good point that Mayer makes is how many authors give up because of a lack of patience and frustration. He makes it clear that writing a novel more than likely won't take a day, or just a few months. Most people won't write a novel and complete it except after several years or so. Just think of J.K Rowling. Even she doesn't complete a novel in a year, much less three or five. One of the main points that Mayer makes is to never give up. Try to write every day even if you don't keep what you are writing.

I review it before I write a novel to remind myself of the traits I need to follow and refer back to it when I'm stuck on a scene that just doesn't sound right. It is a powerful reminder of what works if/when you lose your way. Mayers includes topics on characteristics of a writer, tools for day-to-day writing (fairly trite, though i enjoy the entire atmosphere of writing so it was fun to read), what to write, preparation for writing, elements of the story (narrative structure, plot, pacing, etc.), technique (characters, POV, dialogue, setting, subplots). His final chapters on the business end of writing include the submission (process, rejections, agents), your business and the future (ebooks).He has helpful sample outlines, sample cover letter and synopsis. He also includes a nice sample story grid and plot line.Overall, he covers the mechanics of writing in less than 135 pages and the business parts in less than seventy pages. That makes it a quick read, and an enjoyable one as it doesn't linger anywhere too long to be boring. Therein lies its shortfall. Nothing is very detailed. For example, there aren't specifics on creating good dialogue or narrative. As a result, it is one of about fifteen books I keep to provide a solid reference on how to perform my art to its best.I gave this book only three stars because of its title: The Novel Writer's Toolkit: A guide to writing great fiction and getting it published.

If you enjoy detailed descriptions, incredibly well written, you will enjoy this book. But for me, I will just continue to revere John Muir for the inspirational human he was!"},{"Title":"The mountains of California","review":"The question is not whether Muir is a terrific writer-but how he got that way, and secondarily, why it is important. The Mountains of California was his first book, published in 1894, and was an instant success. This book contains not just some of the best nature writing, but for its vividness, immediacy and vision some of the best writing in English in any genre. Modern Library's edition is quite special with its introduction to Muir by Bill McKibbon and about 50 illustrations, though I wished there were better maps for following the footsteps of Muir's many great narratives among the fabulous natural wonders of the Sierra.Muir succeeds in his writing in ways that Emerson and Thoreau fall short. Emerson's nature is an internal construct, almost a habit of mind. Thoreau conveys something of the immediacy of Muir in selected writing (and he, like Muir, actually immerses himself in nature itself), but his writings and especially his journals seem chaotic at times and lack a unifying vision.Muir, on the other hand, always draws the reader forward from one vision to another, each one more fantastic than the previous.My favorite passages are his descent into the Merced Glacier (in \\"the Glaciers\\"), and his description of being on the high slopes during a major windstorm when he climbs a swaying pine to get an even better look. His description of the Giant Sequoia is a work of great subtlety and richness--I seriously doubt you will find a more enchanting description of the two California Species of Sequoia anywhere.This work abounds with rich and sensuous passages that are descriptions of actual experiences in over a decade of exploring, mostly alone, in the high Sierras. The strength of Muir's writing is based on the depth of his emotional experience of nature-his very personal relationship to the whole and many specific animals, trees and features of the landscape. You would say that it's mystical except for the fact that it's very sensual and very concrete. Muir employs religious language though he never becomes ethereal or abstract as Emerson sometimes does. The reader is always right in the immediate moment of the present listening to Muir's voice. And that suggests another reason why this writing is great. Muir's Scottish heritage (he was born in Dunbar Scotland in 1838) has provided him with a rich, luxurious and slightly exotic vocabulary for describing all the natural wonders that he sees, feels, and hears. It's a voice like no other in American writing.Of course, the reason it is important is because of what Muir spawned through his vision and experience-he was the true creator of the conservation movement leading to modern environmentalism. I should say that this work is all luxurious description and scientific discussion and rarely becomes didactic or preachy-as modern environmental writers sometimes do. It is not fashionable to think that one person of vision can create so much;but it's hard to conclude otherwise about Muir, founder of the Sierra Club, after reading this work."},{"Title":"The mountains of California","review":"Some say this is Muir's finest work. As the only other Muir book I've read (at this writing) is Travels in Alaska, I cannot comment on this, other than to say that I enjoyed this book a great deal.From almost any vantage point in California, whether near or on a distant horizon, there are mountains. A fact not lost on Muir, whose sense of wonder and love of life endear him to his readers.&quot;God's glacial-mills grind slowly, but they have been kept in motion long enough in California to grind sufficient soil for a glorious abundance of life ... In so wild and so beautiful a region [was spent my day], every sight and sound inspiring, leading one far out of himself, yet feeding and building up his individuality.&quot;Muir was the consummate man in nature. Anyone who is indifferent to Muir's writing may simply be indifferent to wonderment itself. I have no doubt that if Muir were placed in a room with the great kings and generals and tycoons and empire builders of history, he would appear singularly as a man among men. Unimpressed with their pomp and bluster over rotting empire, he might soon command more attention than they, and many would be happily listening to Muir in spite of their self importance. Why? He would have the most interesting insights, offered poetically and in a most humble and charming way. ... (in fact Muir was sought out by the great politicians and philosophers of his day).If you like mountains, if you like California, if you like trees and glacier-fed streams, you will like this book."},{"Title":"The mountains of California","review":"As a Birder, I spend a lot of time travelling outdoors.I also have a large collection of Bird and Nature books and spend a great amount of time in them.For pure enjoyment;I found this one of the finest.Muir was as one of America,s greatest partakers in and writers of Nature and Enviroment and was in every way as much a giant as the Sequois and Mountains he wrore about.I read this Classic a short time before I visited Yosemite National Park and having done so,encreased my enjoyment and appreciation immeasurably.After many years of reading,I have come to the conclusion ,that I tend to like books about people I would liked to have known,or to spend some time with.What an experience it would have been to have known and travelled with Muir. While that is impossible;at least we have his writings and can dream."},{"Title":"The mountains of California","review":"muir describes the sierras with detail and love. he is one of the few authors who is content just to be in and describe a landscape. and what a description!. he describes the evolution of glaciaral lakes to the hights of mount ritter and the migrations of deer and native peoples. a great book i recoment it to anyone who loves the outdoors."},{"Title":"The mountains of California","review":"After years of seeing wonderful quotes from books by John Muir, I finally bought The Mountains of California, and it simply bowled me over. Here is a man whose writing is informed and beautifully poetic. He wrote with a broad knowledge of geology, botany, meteorology, and a giant love of the natural world around him. If you are AT ALL interested in nature, and would like to read someone who is not dry or boring, his writing will sweep you up."},{"Title":"The mountains of California","review":"John Muir is a superlative writer and this book is about a place (the California Sierra Nevada) near and dear to my heart, so I enjoyed this book. However, I would have really liked to have had a forward or preface that gave more context to the writings, e.g. some short biographical data or background about John Muir's life and the relative time frame during which he wrote these essays. There is nothing of this nature; page 1 starts with Muir's words. In addition, he goes into sometimes excruciating detail about his experiences in the sierras, down to minutia about rock formations and such. If this isn't of particular interest to certain readers, I imagine some sections could drag for them."},{"Title":"The mountains of California","review":"Despite that over a century has passed since John Muir wrote this work, his words still inspire me and honestly bring tears to my eyes. I have seen much of the US and my favorite places by far lie in the undeveloped lands in the mountains and state and national parks. I am in fact jealous that he was able to spend years wandering on foot through the wilderness without worrying about society or expenses.His words are beautiful and bring life-like images to my mind, along with my own memories of exploring, limited though they are compared to his. I was indeed also impressed with his description of how the Californian mountains were formed by glaciers, and before that the volcanic origins of the stone beneath. I know no review can do his words justice, but if you love the wilds, do yourself a favor and read this book, and any others you can acquire. John Muir was a man who truly loved the outdoors, and the writings he left behind invite us to share it with him. Indeed, without him, we most likely would not have nearly as many national treasure lands set aside for future generations to enjoy."},{"Title":"The mountains of California","review":"Not to be missed: an American classic of great poetic beauty and documentary power. The first book of many by a Scottish son of Wisconsin, who, together with Aldo Leopold, also from Wisconsin, and Henry David Thoreau, holds one of three premiere positions of honor for nature and ecological literature. The last chapter is especially beautiful as it describes the entire Imperial Valley as it once was: carpeted by the uncountable blossoms of annual plants, an ancient and stable community, that, had it been recognized and preserved, could have easily supported a honey bee industry more vast and productive than any on the planet, and obviously benefiting the whole state and beyond."},{"Title":"The mountains of California","review":"An obvious lover of all nature, a keen observer and a dynamic writer, descriptive, detailed and as near to nature as you can get without being there in person.WOW! Muir blew me away! As a nature watcher and hiker, hiking for the love of seeing and being in nature, loving the details of nature,this author finally fulfilled my idea of description and detail and love of all the beauty,in a written form. I felt transported to this time and place, he painted pictures with his wonderful descriptions that brought me to hear the wind in the pines, feel the rain dripping off me in the wild rainstorms. Feel the exhiliration rounding a canon corner or popping over a peak and there beholding a view before me that takes away the breath and floods you with such an overwhelming amount of beauty that you scarce can take it in.When he describes the sequioa I felt compelled to sit down right there and observe the giants,drink that forest in, contemplate, go over the bark, the heigth, the forest floor, the moss, the ferns, the sky, the sounds, and smells, until you feel full and have taken it fully in.Which is exactly what I have done when I was among them myself. But Muir's writing took me right to that feeling with his beautiful writing alone.His description and obvious love of the water-ouzel (birds) felt like my own experience that I have never had in near the depth that he experienced it.This writing is a treasure and should be preserved for all times for all to read, all who cannot go to nature can almost literally bring nature to themselves;the writing and detail is that supurb.Granted he does talk at length about some things in nature that are not of a great as interest to me , for me it was the mountain sheep, I hold very little interest in these fellows of the mountains, Muir's writing is so concise and organized, all I had to do was skip over this part to the next part that was of interst to me.If you adore nature and being in it, or if you adore nature and cannot be in it for some reason, this book is for you! If you are encouraging an interest in nature in your children or studying how the glaciers went through an area and carved out the land, then what happens over time because of the changes the glaciers started, this book is an excellent source of how and what. Amazing, an Icon of Nature Writing for all Times."},{"Title":"The mountains of California","review":"You can really grasp the love and peace John Muir found in the mountains of California through his words. I've spent some time almost every summer of my life up in the sierras, and his descriptions are right on. The drawings are lovely too, I wish they were higher quality reproductions, but for the price this was an excellent edition."},{"Title":"Sex Without Love","review":"This is a great read for all teenagers who will identify with the real world of this book. It is not preachy. It is a warm and compassionate story that teaches young women that they must be prepared to take personal responsibility for their judgment when confronted with pressures from the boys in their lives. A must for young women as they embark on life and have to rely on their own smart judgments or live with overwhelming lifelong problems alone."},{"Title":"Sex Without Love","review":"I laughed, I cried, but mostly I thoroughly enjoyed reading \\"Sex Without Love.\\" The memories it stirred were both poignant and bittersweet. How easy it is to delude ourselves into believing that our situation is different. This is one book every high school senior should read before leaving for college, and it probably would be even better if it was read by every teen before their first date. I sent this book to my daughter to read before giving it to my granddaughters. My 14 year old granddaughter read it in one day. Could not put it down. We are just hoping that she got the message.

If you're interested in learning some new information about the crew of the Enterprise-D, this is the place to start.

There are extra scenes and more information that in the TV episode.Overall, this is a great book. A recommendation to anyone who wants a good read."},{"Title":"Star Trek the Next Generation.","review":"After watching the series on TV including Encounter at Farpoint, I found that the book concentrated much more on the character development and maybe a bit less on technical details in some parts but ALOT more in other areas. The only major difference I saw in the book is that they didn't really give details on how most of the crew and famalies we're sent to the sauser section during seperation as in the TV show. Other than that it was an EXCELLENT read."},{"Title":"Star Trek the Next Generation.","review":"I found the first episode of the series \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation, Encounter at Farpoint\\" to be weak the first time I saw it. There were many characters to introduce and at that point, it was not possible to predict what direction the series would go. In retrospect, the introductions were more than adequate, with so many of the characters ultimately being so heavily developed in such interesting ways.The actual content of the encounter of the Enterprise with the Bandi remains weak in my mind, appearing no stronger in this novelization than it does in video. However, the introduction of the \\"Q\\" character was an act of genius and the hints of the vulture capitalistic Ferengi set the stage for many subsequent stories.It is rare when a story is strong based on what followed it in the plot line, but this is one such instance. Looking at it in retrospect, it was about as good as it could have been, considering how much new ground had been broken."},{"Title":"Star Trek the Next Generation.","review":"Although this story seemed, to the best of my memory, to conform very faithfully to the television episode that it was based on, still it seemed to do a better job of establishing characters than that episode did. Perhaps this is simply a function of the fact that I already know the characters now, as I read the book, whereas I didn't yet know them when I first saw the episode on television. But I don't think so; I believe that once again, this book demonstrates that a book can do a better job of character development than the screen can; the screen can give us visual impact that even the best written description can't, but a book will win when it comes to character development every time.Although I WILL admit that, had I not seen John Delancy's portrayal of Q, I might not have truly appreciated just how obnoxious he was merely from the book; his superciliousness seemed a bit understated."},{"Title":"Star Trek the Next Generation.","review":"I remember watching &quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot; when it first aired with several high school friends, and the great groans of derision we all uttered when Deanna cried out, &quot;I sense joy, Captain!

It wasn't *terrible*, but it did not inspire great hopes, either.David Gerrold took a generally weak episode and fleshed it out as best as anyone could do, but not even Shakespeare could have turned &quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot; into a gripping read. There are, of course, a few problems with changed premises (for example, William &quot;call me Bill&quot; Riker and Picard's obsession with some woman named &quot;Celeste&quot;), but one can hardly blame Gerrold for that."},{"Title":"Star Trek the Next Generation.","review":"Without Q Encounter at Farpoint would have been just a trip to another starbase.

Some of it is almost inadvertantly funny: \\"Some people live wonderful short lives while others live long, miserable lives.\\" Yikes, what category does a 12-year guess she's in? Aside from its way-too-broad contents, there's the off-putting moral purpose of the book as described at the end: \\"Learning what you can about death might motivate you to live a happier, more productive life.\\" Well, maybe. Or at least be more selective in my reading."},{"Title":"The handsome road","review":"Two likeable protagonists, with a great-grandmother in common, brought up in two very different ways enables the reader to see life under two very different sets of circumstances. Ann Sheramy, a very decent, well-meaning Southern belle, and Corrie May Upjohn, an intelligent young woman from the wrong side of the tracks, are thrown into war in Louisiana. Ann does not mean harm to anyone, however her entire way of life forces Corrie May to never be able to rise from her position in life. The author explains how the war changes this. Slavery forces those who think they are &quot;free&quot; to never be able to rise above the poverty level due to the fact that no one wants to pay for labor when the job can be done for free by a slave. Just like in Roman times, this means there is a large class of people with no work and no hope of anything better. They are expendable people. This means that instead of fighting for their own rights, these &quot;expendables&quot; fought for the rights of the plantation owners, and fought to keep themselves in a type of &quot;bondage&quot;. They had no &quot;rights&quot; to fight for. Read how the author explains this viewpoint. You will not be disappointed! Also read how Corrie May's bitterness over these circumstances leads her to make the choices she makes."},{"Title":"The handsome road","review":"This is one of the best historical fiction novels I have ever read. The story of Corrie Mae UpJohn a poor white girl in the South fighting for a better life for herself. Unaware, she is a cousin to the richest family in the region, Corrie Mae fights to stay alive with everything she has. This book made me see the true hardships of the poor during the time of the civil war. This is a book I will never forget."},{"Title":"The handsome road","review":"This book takes the story of the Larne, Sheramy and UpJohn families through the civil war and it's aftermath. The author provides a very realistic portrayal of the upper class Larnes and Sheramys and the poor UpJohns, the latter having to struggle for work as the upper class had the slave labor to do most of the work for \\"free\\". Also, the turnaround of the cultures in the aftermath of the civil war, the Larnes and Sheramys having to struggle to survive and keep their plantations while Corrie May was able to catch a coattail of a carpet bagger and his money.I have to say that \\"A Reader\\" in September 2002 summed this book up better than I could. Well worth the time to find this out of print book, I was able to get a copy from my local library. Please note, that the comment by \\"A Reader\\" in 1999 who called it smutty must be thinking about another book. This was as chaste as a book could be, and would be a good choice for a younger reader."},{"Title":"The handsome road","review":"Gwen Bristow is an amazing author.

The exchange of energy during sexual intercourse is not only so powerful that it can create another human being it can also be consciously used to create other things we want in life.Anand teaches couples to focus on their personal vision during sex, and create changes in their daily relationships and circumstances through the energy they produce.Anand believes that everyone can experience transformative power if the exercises in her book are diligently followed.I enjoyed this book but I must admit that years of reading and intuitive training has made me receptive to her ideas."},{"Title":"The Art of Sexual Magic","review":"I just finished reading this book all the way the way through, and all I can say is WOWZA!!

Very, very funny book. Ms. Halpin really nails the geek type while, at the same, time, expressing deep respect and affection for geek culture and tendencies.

(just for kicks check your favorite book and compare)Not only are there very few words, but the content is so bad, it hardly says anything, it reminds me of some people who are trying to explain something they dont understand, so the say 1,000 words which make no sense... and then spit on your face how knowledgable they are.For example seccion &quot;1.4.5 Your Geek Child&quot; is 20 lines long (which include 3 sections... features, known bugs and tips... in 20 lines) i'm sure you need more than that to raise your geek child, the worst thing is that later on the book she say's &quot;on how to educate your child go to secction 1.4.5&quot;... like if it actually said something!"},{"Title":"The Geek Handbook: User Guide and Documentation for the Geek in Your Life","review":"I bought this book because of the excellent references I saw, it took me one day to read it from the beggining to the end, but the book lacks of perspective.

If you want an aproach of a geek search for the &quot;Geek Code&quot; (not a book) and you can obtain a lot of information.My last word goes for the little information in a lot of sections (like &quot;Geeks Diet&quot;, &quot;The inner geek&quot; and &quot;Your geek's cycles and routines&quot;).I have seen more effort at independent (and free) writtings"},{"Title":"Tales of Passion, Tales of Woe","review":"This book starts after Josephine and Napolean are married. It gives a deep insight into their marriage, their quarrels, and how they shaped and liberated France. While it is a love story, it isn't terribly gushy. It has its footholds in reality, making it a pleasant read for a man. It touches briefly upon war, but primarily explains the preparations and after effects. It doesn't really go into what happened on the fields. The author filled this book with so many facts that it would make a great reference. It would also give a highschool student who was anti-learning about history a different view, perhaps even peak their interest. The entire book is footnoted."},{"Title":"Tales of Passion, Tales of Woe","review":"I was a nervous wreck waiting for &quot;Tales of Passion...&quot; to be released. And when it arrived in NY stores, I had a salesclerk pull it right from the shipping boxes! It took me 3 days to complete this fabulous continuation of Josephine's life. I had feared it wouldn't even compare to the first, but now I can't decide which one I LOVE more. I haven't been this excited about a book since Memoirs of a Geisha (which I read 3 years ago.) I'll be in withdrawl from now until Part III. Hurry up Ms. Gulland! What will I do when its over!"},{"Title":"Tales of Passion, Tales of Woe","review":"A wonderful book, far more interesting than the first volume. Once you begin to read the first words of this book, you will be slowly hypnotised into her world. You will be transformed into Josephine herself and relive the wars, the romance, the terror, her emotions and thoughts. A three dimensional feeling will overcome you, and suddenly you'll find that you are imprisoned in the world of the past; deep in a dark winter night in a jasmine-scented room, writing a letter with the light of a single candle where you can only hear the sound of the fire crackling and the cold wind rustling. And you WON'T want to return. You will bring Josephine to your dreams, in a mysterious night in the alluring melancholic music of a harp. Oh, it's completely mesmerizing!"},{"Title":"Tales of Passion, Tales of Woe","review":"Absolutely mesmerizing. This is a book that invades your mind and soul completely. Historically rich, refreshing, provocative yet deep. Unique perspective on a subject often ignored in history- the role of the significant other. Definitely one of the best historical fiction books I've read."},{"Title":"Tales of Passion, Tales of Woe","review":"This is the second novel in the Josephine Trilogy; here the story takes us to the beginning of Josephine's marriage to Napoleon. We are witness to the horrid and formidable Bonaparte clan, In-laws that would make anyone think twice about marriage, and the rise of Napoleon's power. Through Sandra Gulland, Josephine brings us into her world as she deals with her new and ever evolving role in society. It is an interesting and refreshing point of view, which Gulland brings to the pages. We see history through human eyes and actually experience this period time. If the Napoleonic Wars are of interest to you, or you enjoy getting a sense of history and a different society I highly recommend this book. Gulland makes Josephine real to us, sometimes we want to shake her, and sometimes we want to congratulate her. Always we want to sympathize with her."},{"Title":"Tales of Passion, Tales of Woe","review":"I read The Many Lives and Secret Sorrows of Josephine B a few years ago and hadn't thought of reading the second volume until now. Well, in all fairness, I hadn't known there was a second installment until now. This historical figure has always intrigued me for being the wife of one of the most powerful military commanders in history. Tales of Passion, Tales of Woe is another intriguing and insightful historical/biographical novel centered on the woman who shared her life with the man responsible for the European wars of late eighteenth century to early nineteenth century. This novel covers the couple's stay in Italy during 1786 to 1800. In diary form, Josephine tells us about Bonaparte's self-declaration as First Counsel and becomes all the more powerful while she deals with her in-laws who had taken an instant dislike to her and try to ruin her reputation with lies and careful plotting. And through her many trials, she never loses her desire to help others in spite of having a compulsive need to shop and then hide her debts and expenses. And then she moves the reader when she realizes that she's developed feelings for her husband. There are various twists throughout the novel.Sandra Gulland paints a true and compelling picture of the historical Empress. She makes her likeable and yet conflicting and complex at the same time. Her trials with her in-laws are the most difficult ones for her and you feel her struggles while applauding her strength for enduring them with the patience of a saint. I also like how the author describes the ever-changing roles in Josephine's life as her husband gains political power and becomes a formidable figure in Europe. The historical accuracy is quite impressive and the footnotes were very insightful. I often don't like footnotes in fiction because they distract me from the story, but in this case I found them to be integral to the overall book because I learned things about Bonaparte that I hadn't known about before. I read The Many Lives and Secret Sorrows of Josephine B a few years ago and cannot remember every detail, but I do know that I wasn't able to appreciate Josephine B back then as I do now with this one. Tales of Passion, Tales of Woe is a great second offering in what is so far a great trilogy. Sandra Gulland has impressed me with this wonderful book and I look forward to reading The Last Great Dance on Earth, which will pick up when Bonaparte moves to the Tuileries Palace. I hope that this third and last installment will also cover all of the Napoleonic wars, Bonaparte's exile to Elba and his reinstallment on the throne of France, which leads to the battle of Waterloo. I can't wait to read Gulland's version of Josephine B and her insights during those events! (Though I think Josephine died the year before Waterloo.) Anyway, I recommend this wonderful book, right after you read The Many Lives and Secret Sorrows of Josephine B."},{"Title":"Tales of Passion, Tales of Woe","review":"Two days after Josephine's marriage to the funny little Corsican (on March 9, 1796), Napoleon leaves Paris to take command of the Army of Italy. Three and a half months later Josephine is summoned to Milan by Bonaparte. She leaves her beautiful home, her friends, and most importantly, her children for almost two years. During this period she must spend time with her husband's horrible mother and siblings and endure the most unbelievable and torturous therapies in order to get pregnant.TALES OF PASSION, TALES OF WOE is book two in Sandra Gulland's trilogy about the life of Josephine Bonaparte. This novel only covers four years--the period between Josephine's marriage in 1796 through February, 1800 when the Bonapartes move to the Tuileries Palace. This takes place after the big Coup d'Etat when Napoleon overthrows the Directors and declares himself as First Counsel. In between the pages, written as a diary and peppered with a multitude of historical footnotes, we find Josephine, as usual, trying to help others. She continues to show exceptional patience when dealing with her offensive in-laws (who are constantly plotting against her, taking money from her and who spread lies about her). She also shops and shops and spends way too much money and then tries to find ways to cover her debts. She also is slowly falling deeply in love with her younger husband.I really enjoyed reading this historical novel about characters I have always been intrigued with. TALES OF PASSION is not only beautifully written but is quite the page-turner. Included in this book are actual letters written by Bonaparte to the love of his life. Even though I know the tragic ending of this love story, I am still looking forward to book number three to see how it all transpires."},{"Title":"Tales of Passion, Tales of Woe","review":"Sandra Gulland's trilogy on Josephine Bonaparte is brilliant.

At times it almost seemed like this book was written by a different author than the first Josephine B. book. This book placed much more emphasis on the racy, sexy side of Rose/Josephine and at times it felt a little forced. It's as though the author felt the need to sex it up a bit.

While reading the first book in the series, I didn't notice any mistakes, but this book is riddled with them. The most glaring was in one of the dates at the beginning of a journal entry - 1978? I was born that year and I'm pretty sure Josephine wasn't still writing in her journal at that time.I'm not sure if this is a problem with the Kindle edition only or if it is something carried over from the hard copy.The writer is obviously very talented and prolific and deserves a better editor."},{"Title":"Tales of Passion, Tales of Woe","review":"I have read this trilogy through twice, it is fabulous! 2012 this was my &#34;go to&#34; gift choice and I gave the complete trilogy set to numerous friends.

The brother, a composer and pianist, was much older and died in an accident while staying at a grand hotel. In his search, the young man discovers love and has some minor adventures. It's nothing grand, but more of a gently told old-fashioned story of youth. The sleepy village and stolid villagers are beautifully rendered in razor thin black and white lines, as is the vast landscape."},{"Title":"Lost in the Alps","review":"Got a early discount but they failed to let me know that a page was missing."},{"Title":"Office Slave: Books I and II","review":"I have an open mind & a very fertile, active imagination.

Pretty good reads, although the sequel might be a tad too romantic for some tastes."},{"Title":"Office Slave: Books I and II","review":"This sterile narrative is about what people do, not what they feel. There is no depth, no emotion, no human response. It is fantasy, but fantasy fit for the lower half of the bell curve.The writer never bothers to enter the minds of the characters. He merely narrates action safely from afar, much as the director of a claymation film supervises his blobs of clay. One move follows another as his mannequins engage in sexual calisthenics, but never for a moment do we believe his characters are human.One reviewer suggests this is male erotica. Not so. It is non-erotica.Should one seek truly erotic writing, one might do worse than to try Anais Nin'sDelta of Venus."},{"Title":"Office Slave: Books I and II","review":"This is probably one of the best book I read by McKenna, what an interesting way to pay off an enormous debt and then just when you did't think it would be there the happy ending I love so much happened"},{"Title":"Office Slave: Books I and II","review":"I have to agree with another reviewer, this one was definitely different.

The back cover of the book calls it \\"A masterpiece of vampiric passion\\". The novel isn't about vampires, but shares characteristics. It kinda reminded me of a certain Stephen King screenplay. The story predominantly was told through conversation between the main character and a detective. The story was told a lot in past tense. This is the third Andrew Neiderman novel I've read (Child's Play, Surrogate Child). This was the most edgy out of the three which caught me by surprise. There were homosexual and heterosexual situations. I didn't expect this from Andrew Neiderman just by what I've read in the previous two novels. I thought the story started off a little slow, but once the story started to develop, I found it very interesting. I breezed through it fairly quickly. Overall I enjoyed it!"},{"Title":"The Need","review":"The Need is one of the best works of fiction that I have read in years. Neiderman draws you in from the prologue and never lets you go.

You never know what will happen next, or if Richard is waiting there to stop you. The Need is a real page turner. Neiderman, keep up the excelent work. Bravo!"},{"Title":"The Need","review":"This was my 14th Andrew N. Book because I think they are so fascinating, but this is my least favorite. Sorry, Andy.

Essentially every word you might want to look up from the Bible is laid out in dictionary style - from Abronah to Nicolaitans to Zaphon, each with at least a few sentences, and usually more, to explain what is known about them. There are also more extensive sections on occupations of Biblical times, charts of political parties, parables, weights and measures, maps, time lines and much more.This Holman dictionary has over 600 illustrations and plenty of photos of landscapes from the Holy Land, etc. There are other good Bible dictionaries available, but this one is the best illustrated and attractively arranged that I know of. The other dictionaries I've seen may have more text per entry, but I find Holman to be completely adequate in this regard. The text is also typeset cleanly so it is easy to read; this is not always the case with other dictionaries. Holman's dictionary is a terrific tool for helping your study come to life in a vivid way.I would recommend a Bible dictionary even if you have a good study Bible. There is a lot more information in the dictionary than any Bible can really present. Holman's dictionary is keyed to match several popular Bible translations so whichever English translation you prefer, you'll likely find the entries in Holman's to match. Halley's Bible Handbook is also a useful tool for getting a high level overview of information as you study. A Bible handbook does not overlap with the dictionary, they each serve a distinct purpose, but the dictionary is the more valuable of the two if you must choose between them.May God bless your time in His Word"},{"Title":"Holman Bible Dictionary","review":"Very useful and it has at not least very nice fashion.

The book itself reminds you from the moment you open it that it was cheap: the paper is not the best quality around; the book creaks and groans as you page through it (just how long will it be before the spine cracks and breaks?); the quality of the photos is, in general, nothing short of abominable (in the 1960's and 1970's they would have been acceptable).The dictionary entries are good, if you like conservative biblical scholarship. Reference to various (modern) translations of the bible makes it quite a useful book. But one essential ingredient of a good scholarly work is missing: a bibliography. Of the three dictionaries I know (Eerdmans, HarperCollins and this one from Holman), the Holman is the only one totally lacking any kind of bibliography. For the lay-user maybe not a problem. For an academic user a great problem. I would advise academic users to consider either the Eerdmans or the HarperCollins publications.For the lay-user this is a useful publication at a good price. For academic users this might be handy to have as a second dictionary but it is, thanks to its lack of a bibliography, unsuitable as a sole work of reference."},{"Title":"Holman Bible Dictionary","review":"It is ridiculous for this book to be offered at $95.00, when the cover photo shows it being for sale at $29.97.

I enjoyed and empathized with him very much. If you know anything about Native Canadian life you will be touched by his poetry."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"awesome, awesome, awesomeFall of Hyperion beautifully ties together the seven mini-stories presented in its predecessor novel, Hyperion. Having been left hanging in the first book, all is revealed here in climactic fashion.It is amazing that so many wildly different story lines could come together... the mysterious Shrike and its Tree of Pain, the Time Tombs, the AI Core, the enormous galactic war between the Humans and the Ousters, the regenerative cruciform parasites, the farcaster network, the John Keats link. To top it off, there are some great twists along the way that will leave you gasping. This book is also much more action-packed than the more story-telling Hyperion.My only complaint is that some of the dialog was a little bland; especially the exchanges with the poet Martin Silenus and basically anyone. Also, some of the explanations of some of the more bizarre things are, well, bizarre; you'll have to put the book down at certain points and wonder if the author was doing some seat-of-the-pants writing. Not to give anything away, but I felt that the Shrike's purpose in the story was not too profound or important once revealed. He just seems to be more of a freak show throughout. But, all of the other events taking place more than make up for it.If you like Hyperion even just a little bit, you should read this sequel."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"This answered all the questions that Hyperion asked. It may not be the style of Hyperion, but it was terrific."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"There's nothing I can say that hasn't been said already, so I can only say this: breathtaking! Both in scope, prose, imagination, and sheer audacity, this book leaves every other Sci -Fi book I've ever read in the DUST. Confusing? Yes. Hard to understand at times? Yes. Totally worth reading? Again--YES. &quot;The Fall of Hyperion&quot; is in every way a match for its forerunner, &quot;Hyperion&quot;, and twice as satisfying. Definately a must-read."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"The Fall of Hyperion follows straight on from Hyperion, and does not disappoint those who were left gasping for more at the end of the first book.Probably more action-y than its predecessor, Fall is filled with shocks, scares, surprises, horrific destruction and terror, and disturbing revelations. The opening pages help to further establish the nihilistic society of the Hegemony, where artists organise coordinated suicides on several planets at once and citizens try to travel to war zones to see what war looks like.The Hyperion pilgrims' stories continue as they travel through space and even time, often with the assistance of the mysterious Shrike, which has become more of an ambiguous character - sometimes it is still a bloodthirsty killer, at others it seems to act as a sort of guide. Most of the questions posed in Hyperion are answered, together with some new ones.My favourite part of the book (and possibly the entire series) is the jaw-droppingly shocking climax, in which those in the know make a desperate attempt to save humankind from the dangerous artificial intelligences who are the true villains of the story. How do you fight an enemy who controls every communication band and interplanetary gateway and whose location is a complete mystery? I won't give anything away, but the conclusion is brought about through a terrible yet necessary decision.I personally would have been happy to see the series ended here, with most of the loose ends tied neatly up and only a few tantalizing mysteries left behind to puzzle over. This could have something to do with the fact that it's in Endymion, the third book, that continuity really does start to go straight out the window. Oh well, never mind."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"This second book of the Hyperion series is darker and full of much more action than the first. The first novel is almost entirely devoted to intense character development, and it is the first book that makes the second so incredible. Once the character foundations are laid, the second book, \\"The Fall of Hyperion\\", delivers page after page of building conflict. For those of you who enjoy lots of action in a sci-fi novel, this second book in the series delivers. It isn't merely some shoot-'em-up novel, it is the next dark phase in the evolution of a future universe that is as fascinating as it is frightening.Complex relationships between character sets are laid out in the second book. The TechnoCore, the collective of hyper-evolved and diversified AIs, is beginning to reveal its role in the destiny of mankind. As The Hegemony of Man finds itself in the middle of a conflict with its space-born brethern (the Ousters), the TechnoCore has been an uneasy ally during the initial battles. Soon, however, the clever tactics of the Ousters begin to overwhelm the Hegemony, and the TechnoCore suspiciously offers no explanation or support.The planet of Hyperion, its mysterious Time Tombs and its most terrifying resident, the Shrike, is the only undefined variable in this entire galactic war. All parties involved fear the planet and its unknown influence, and all parties fight for it. A galactic-wide battle ensues.The creative innovations set forth by Simmons will awe you. The first pages of this second book act in the same fashion that fishing bait entices unsuspecting aquatic creatures. You will sit down to read a few pages, and then you will consume the entire book within days.Finally, if you have read my review on the first book, Hyperion, I can only reinforce my declaration that I am the Shrike's biggest fan."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"The follow-up to the Hyperion book is a complex, fascinating story that attempts to unify the tales presented in the Hyperion book. It is an absorbing, imaginative book with a very satisfying ending. The only drawbacks are somewhat long length and repeating subplots. Most readers will find it difficult to tie the loose ends of the story. The most memorable part of the story is the discussions with Ummon, an artificial intelligence. The are elements that will satisfy both the philosophical, thoughtful and the suspense-oriented readers."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"I was loathe to spoil my memory of Hyperion by reading this book. But, unlike almost every sequel I've read, this one did not disappoint. Brilliantly different from Hyperion it obtains a high standard of character development (especially of Meina Gladstone, Keats and Silenus) and a brilliant plot. One of only three books I've read more than once; this book is a top read, if not as challenging and stimulating as the peerless Hyperion. This book will be accessible to most audiences, but those that have read Hyperion first will love it. For those who have read &quot;The Fall of Hyperion&quot;, this book probably equates to &quot;Dying Earth&quot;."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"Great book, terrific series (so far), but I have two questions:1. How was God's Grove able to preserve its ecology when Maui-Covenenant had *its* ecology wrecked so quickly by the Hegemony?and2. What happened to the whole business of the Shrike being slated to kill all the pilgrims but one and then to grant a wish to the survivor? The plot apparently went off in another direction, but all the characters seem to have forgotten about this earlier premise which once seemed so crucial"},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"I was a girl who didn't like the sci-fi books. I was. The Hyperion series opened a brand new world for me. Since then I've red numerous sci-fi books, but this one remains one of the most important in my whole life."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"Beware the ghost in the machine, lest it be mankind's downfall. In this case, beware the TechnoCore of Dan Simmons' World Web, the human spawned web of artificial intelligences that dominates humankind. In the far future of 800 years from now, humans live in a web of planets interconnected by farcasters and instantaneous communication, created or allowed by the Core for mankind's convenience, or so it is thought. What a tangled web has been woven though. One would think by the year 2800 people would have learned the lesson that there is no such thing as a free lunch, but that is not so. The Core has its own agenda, hidden from everyone.This book picks up where Hyperion left off, so the story of the pilgrims is continued, but there is far more to be revealed as Simmons delves deep into why the pilgrims are on Hyperion, what The Shrike is and its purpose, and what is the TechnoCore's deadly agenda. The figure of John Keats looms more ominously in this volume, since his persona has now been \\"reincarnated\\" into another cybrid, Joseph Severn, the namesake of the real Keats' artist friend. The \\"Joseph Severn\\" cybrid becomes more and more like the real John Keats of 19th century England, to the point he becomes ill with tuberculosis and a friend is by his side to comfort him in his last moments, though this time the friend is Leigh Hunt, an aide to CEO Meina Gladstone, in another of Simmons' witty literary references. (The real Leigh Hunt was a poet friend of John Keats.) The way the Severn character is interwoven into the pilgrims' story is that he is connected to them via Brawne Lamia's data implant and is able to access her dreams and thoughts. The only weakness in this device is that Severn claims his images are fuzzy, but we get full details aplenty when the pilgrims' tales are told. The Keats character becomes increasingly more important to the story and to the survival of humankind, so it is no surprise that even as his physical body dies, his AI persona lives. \\"On he flared\\" is the last line of this book as well as Keats' poem \\"The Fall of Hyperion,\\" a fitting ending.The pilgrims' adventures become otherworldly, defying time and space, but Simmons has created such a place where everything that happens is believable. For example, Father Paul Dure, a peripheral character in the first novel, comes back to life in this one, and he travels the labyrinths of Hyperion to see horrors unimaginable only to exit on the Vatican's planet, Pacem, where he runs into Joseph Severn, of all people. None of it seems contrived or unbelievable. Brawne Lamia has some wild adventures of her own that transcend her physical body, Fedmahn Kassad finally finds his mystery lover, Sol Weintraub does not have to make the dread decision to sacrifice his daughter Rachel because that decision ends up not being his to make, Martin Silenus, the old Satyr himself, finds his muse again and literally cannot be torn away from it, and Het Masteen, as in the first book, plays an unfinished role. The story of the Ousters is elucidated and expanded on, so we get some wonderfully descriptive glimpses into their bizarre, alien world, but it becomes clear they are not the dreaded enemy once thought. The real war is against the TechnoCore, and when revelations are made as to what the Core has done, humans will not let it dominate them again.As with Hyperion, Simmons writes masterfully with beautiful prose that sounds like poetry, full of color and light, metaphor, and literary allusions. This is a learned person's book, not a light read, yet one that is easily accessible without being haughty or abstruse. If you have read John Keats' poetry or know about his life, the book becomes richer. If you know about Teilhardian theology, Dure's philosophy and distress over his faith/lack of faith becomes more real. But if you have not had these intellectual experiences, you can still enjoy the book and learn much from it. Maybe this book will inspire you to pick up a book by Teilhard de Chardin or to read Keats' poems. Or maybe not, but that is your choice. Either way, this is one of the best science fiction books ever written, and must be viewed as the continuation of Hyperion, not as merely a sequel."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"I gave the first book from this series HYPERION 5 stars, it was a truly great book. Unfortunately, besides the main characters, THE FALL OF HYPERION is nothing like the first book... and even some of the main characters changed and/or became less interesting - for example, Martin Selinus changes from a witty drunk poet, to an obnoxious drunk poet, and towards the end of the book, a resurrected Father Paul Dure is inexplicably unbothered by the pain from the cruciform which held him in check in the first book. And then there is the Shrike - so mysteriously scary in HYPERION, and so useless and confusing in THE FALL OF HYPERION.The 2nd half of the book drags on, as the ordeals of the main characters become an ordeal to read through to the end. It got to the point where I could care less what happened to the characters which I had been so interested in by the end of the Hugo-winning HYPERION... it is no wonder that this stinker didn't win the Hugo.The frequent descriptions of some of the characters \\"travels\\" thru the dataspheres is truly boring and unintelligible.One of the only things I found of interest in the 2nd book was the mystery surrounding the duplicate Old Earth.I mean, really, how many times (a dozen?) can one read yet another unispiring description about \\"the lapis lazuli skis\\" and not wretch."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"I first read the books of the Hyperion cantos a few years back - read the mass-market paperback editions. I don't know what happened in creating this kindle e-edition, but it is full of typos - misspelled words, missing puncuation - absolutely the worst of any kindle book I've purchased so far (and I've purchased several scores worth). The errors seem to be in the actual distributed kindle edition - the same errors show up on every device I have a kindle app installed on, deleting and redownloading the book does not fix the errors, and these errors were not in the mass-market paperback edition. I personally like the series, which is why I decided to reread the books, but it pisses me off that publishing industry standards have fallen so low that they don't even bother to pay an actual proof-reader to make sure the conversion to e-book was done correctly.I'm not anal about the occasional error popping up here and there, although it is a shame that spelling and grammatical standards have fallen so far in the publishing industry, but this particular kindle edition is exponentially more fubared than any other e-book I have read. My advice for reading The Fall of Hyperion is DO NOT GET THE KINDLE EDITION - just buy the mass-market edition instead."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"It's hard to follow a book as good as Hyperion, but The Fall of Hyperion, which concludes the stories of the seven pilgrims we met in its predecessor, makes an ambitious attempt. Events pick up where they left off, with the pilgrims arriving at the Time Tombs to face the mysterious creature known as the Shrike. Simmons also introduces another POV character, who functions as a sort of omniscient narrator and relates events occurring elsewhere in the Hegemony. We see the government dealing with new developments in the Ouster invasion of the planet Hyperion, and learn more about the TechnoCore and its motives.Unfortunately, my feelings on this book are a mixed bag. At times, Fall is as much a page-turner as its predecessor, especially when the war with the Ousters really gets going. Other times, the story becomes a vehicle for Simmons to expound on a complex framework of ideas that links artificial intelligence, theology/philosophy, 20th century physics, time travel, and, of course, the poetry of Keats. While I thought he explored some thought-provoking questions, all the exposition gets a little clunky. For instance, there's one scene where an AI makes a long, cryptic speech about what the AIs have been up to, and how it plays into the larger story. This might have worked fine on it's own and challenged us to make some connections for ourselves, but the author then goes on to have another character explain what it all *means*. At that moment, Simmons has ceased telling a story and is just using characters as mouthpieces to lecture us what his book is about. There's too much like that. Some of the science and the Keats references are a little forced, as well.More to the point, most of the characters have stopped being interesting. In Hyperion, we got to know each pilgrim intimately, through his or her personal story. In this book, they turn into simplistic versions of their previous selves, and mostly just act as game pieces moving around to advance some part of the plot, or allow Simmons to explain more of his high level story. I just didn't feel that invested.Which is not to say that Fall of Hyperion is a bad book -- Simmons is a good writer and his ambitious philosophical ideas are well-thought out. I can't fault the overall plot. But I get the sense that while Hyperion was a labor of love, this novel was a bit of a rush job. It just isn't as rich, varied, and emotionally compelling as its predecessor.You should read Hyperion, though -- it's excellent. You can always consult wikipedia for what happens in this one."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"Volume one was magnificent yet unfinished, and I was hoping volume two, the companion volume, would continue the story of the pilgrims and reveal mysteries only hinted earlier. By page 100, Simmons has spent virtually no words regarding the main characters from the first book, and instead introduced CEO Meina Gladstone, and another cybrid of Keats as 'new' main perspective characters. They proceed to recount bits and pieces of what happened in volume one... and this doesn't stop. For example, mid-book, chapter 18, has Meina Gladstone visiting the backstory worlds of the party from Hyperion, but nothing happens. All she does is think about their stories and describe scenery. Too much of the book is about these new characters and their response to the Ouster threat.Simmons feels the need to write in constant cliffhangers at chapter endings, a great technique when things are actually happening. When the story is bloated, it's annoying. I want plot; I do not want the first volume in flashback all over again. Now the story is decent when it ceases the bloat and repetition, but Simmons took 400+ pages to tell a 200 page story.My final problem was the over-abundance of perspective characters -- about ten of them. All of the pilgrims from Hyperion, two new 'main' characters, and occasional scenes and chapters from the 3rd person 'observer' perspective. Additionally John Keats is central to the Hyperion Saga, and I haven't read his work or biography. I can't help but feel I missed many nuances. Simmons makes no effort to integrate the historical Keats context, but often uses his poetry and writes him as a 'reborn' perspective character, and a couple scenes made less sense to me than I think they should have.I wanted to love this book because Hyperion was amazingly good -- the time-backwards death manifestation of the Shrike, the Ultimate Intelligence Project, the AI factions, fat-lines, the web of teleporter doors, fates worse than death/tainted immortality.... it's got a unique Sci-fi style -- but I was turned off by the extraneous, repeated 'recaps' of what had already happened. I do advise potential readers to go for it, but concentrate on the characters from book one and liberally skim when Simmons refuses to move his own story. I think I could give an abridged version of \\"Fall of Hyperion\\" four or more stars, but the filler-scenes lessened my enjoyment of the work."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"Why this is the only title of the Hyperion Saga that i can't buy in kindle format? The best in the row, but i can't have it on amazon for my newest ebook reader! A shame...Anyways, like i say, the Fall of Hyperion is one of the finest scifi book of the last century. I remember the awe i got when i was reading this magnificent story, with all the profoundness and the best scifi can offer. Do yourself a favor, read Hyperion and The Fall of Hyperion and enjoy the ride! The fun is in the pages. I have nothing else to say....except that last thing: Please, bring back the kindle format as soon as possible, amazon."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"Whereas Hyperion was a study in character development, this was a study in... unraveling a story?I can't really recommend reading this, but if you read Hyperion and are looking for answers, then go ahead. I can tell you that reading this will leave you with an unfilled feeling, sort of like drinking warm brackish water when you're thirsty."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"The story continues and gets better.If you take a look at the size of \\"Hyperion\\" and \\"Fall\\" together since they really are two halves of one book, you see just how huge the story is. Simmons certainly takes his time telling a story and the reader is all that much better for it.\\"Fall\\" is more conventionally structured. We've read about all the previous encounters with the Shrike, now we find out what happens to our pilgrims after they finally reach the Time Tombs--the Land of Oz.Loose ends are drawn up, some wishes, terrible as they may seem, are granted.Best scene before conclusion: Sol is in a sand storm on Hyperion. He has given his only daughter to the Shrike, technological god of pain, in hopes of her restoration. Through the dust he sees a figure. It could be his daughter, Rachel. They run to each other. You hope to God it's her! You've read the book up to this point and you know what COULD happen. You know who it COULD be. You know what an expert writer would do in this scene. Then they meet. They embrace. They know. Simmons gives you the answer and they both cry. I had to put the book down at that point and shed a tear with the characters.Because the characters are so well constructed in \\"Hyperion\\" the reader is immediately drawn into \\"Fall.\\" The consul, once quiet diplomat, is in an entirely new light. Questions behind his motivation still bubble and now it is his boss, Senate CEO Meina Gladstone, that has a surprise of her own for him. Lies folded in lies wrapped in a web of deception. It all becomes untangled and revealed. Almost.So where DID the Shrike come from? What will become of the hegemony now that interstellar travel has changed so drastically? Does the cruciform have a place in the universe anymore? I'll tell you right now without giving away anything: The ending is . . . enlightening. So much destruction and yet there is a phoenix of hope rising from it all. What will this phoenix mean for the future of the broken and separated members of the human race?Sorry. You have to continue reading. The answers are in the last two books. Keep going! It's the best series I've ever read. I can honestly say I am a better person for having read the whole series. Utterly magnificent!"},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"\\"The Fall of Hyperion\\", the second novel in the \\"Hyperion Saga\\", follows the characters introduced in the prior novel along with some welcome new additions. The author describes the events and sciences of the future in fascinating detail.Political and warfare action fills the plot around the engaging individuals trying to prevent the end of humanity. While the storyline initially appears disjointed and discontinuous, a careful explanation will soothe any concerns. Expect huge surprises regarding the final outcome of the pilgrims and the war.The primary motivations behind political and religious organizations, which developed in a highly advanced computer space age, can be difficult to understand. A detailed map of the significant terrains would have been useful.I highly recommend this series to any fan of the science fiction genre.Thank you."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":".Whereas typical writers introduce, fill in, and conclude their stories, Simmons' Hyperion books just start and then slowly end. This, to me, is the most natural and welcoming way any story can be written. Nevermind all that self-conscious structuring; you'll see none of that here. That's not to say that there isn't structure in Simmons' books. He structures, alright, but he does it for a reason..In the Hyperion series (for the record, the order of the series is: Hyperion, The Fall of Hyperion, Endymion, and The Rise of Endymion) you'll find many of the elements that make any literary work spectacular - parallels, symbolism, empathy, historical references, foreshadowing (as much as there is unpredictability), openmindedness, etc...You'll come across countless instances where Simmons' biases as a writer shine through in bold statements - and then you'll watch him approach and unravel these statements from opposing perspectives. Few of the underlying statements Simmons makes are not thoroughly analyzed and criticized. If any. The only possible exception I can think of is Simmons' recurring usage of the concept of love. And I must say, he does some marvelous things with it....You won't see just one lengthy, drawn-out climax in this book - rather, the entire book is a series of delightful encounters, some profound and some delicate. You'll be shocked at a tragic or wondrous turn of event, or you'll be in awe at the clarity of a particular description, or you'll find yourself nodding, smiling, and murmering crude names to the conniving Simmons as loose ends tie themselves up before your unsuspecting eyes..Don't expect to fly through this book (why is that deemed a good thing anyway?). Expect to savor every last detail, re-reading entire chapters if you must. Are you a wine-drinker with an imagination? The Hyperion series is the perfect read for you. Simmons' mastery of language, understanding of human nature, and confidence as a writer place him far, far ahead of nearly all (if not all) of today's other authors..Dan Simmons is now my favorite writer. Orson Scott Card takes second."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"I was trying to think of a good sci-fi related way to compare my disappointment with \\"Fall of Hyperion\\" compared to the original \\"Hyperion.\\" To use a popular culture example, it reminded me of when I watched \\"The Matrix Reloaded.\\" I really enjoyed the first movie and as I watched the sequel it seemed we were getting farther and farther away from what made me like the original in the first place. But at least it's not a shameful debacle like the regrettable \\"Star Wars\\" prequels.Most of \\"Hyperion\\" was devoted to seven pilgrims gathered from around the Hegemony of Man to travel to the mysterious world of Hyperion and confront the dangerous spirit/monster known as the Shrike. Along the way the pilgrims told their stories \\"Canterbury Tales\\" style of how they ended up on the trip. The story was focused on these seven (six really) characters and the mystery of their journey. I was more than a little frustrated to realize I'd have to wait for another book to find out the solution to this.Imagine my surprise then when the first third of \\"Fall of Hyperion\\" has almost NOTHING to do with the pilgrims or their mission. Instead, we're treated to the narration of \\"Joseph Severn\\" or John Keats mark 3. Severn/Keats is a clone of a clone of the 19th Century English poet who somehow has the ability to see what's going on with the pilgrims in his dreams. But mostly he's sitting around at meetings and parties as the Hegemony compares to confront the dreaded Ousters, a race of sort of humans who rejected the decadence of the Hegemony and its reliance on machines of the artificial intelligences known as the TechnoCore. At first this war relates only to the space above Hyperion, but soon it spreads all over. (I have to say that a space empire of 200-plus worlds that has a military of only half a million troops and 600 ships, one that KNOWS there are barbarians outside the gates, deserves to be destroyed. In Earth terms, it would be like tasking Portugal's military to protect the entire North American continent; you'll be spread just a bit thin.)My reaction was: WHO CARES? I want to know what's going on with the pilgrims, Time Tombs, and the Shrike; I don't care about the silly Hegemony, barbarian hordes, and AIs that communicate in poetry. It seems almost spiteful for an author to lure you in with that first 484 page book and then make you wait hundreds of pages more to get back to that main point. And in the process, the story also lost much of its focus as it tried to spread around to Severn, the pilgrims, the Hegemony, and so on. For the most part then it lacked the humanity of the first book.When Simmons finally gets around to solving the riddles of the Time Tombs and the Shrike, I found it disappointing. I had already figured out \\"Moneta's\\" identity in the first book, so when it's revealed at the end it was no surprise to me. (Though if I hadn't been right I'd probably be complaining about the solution being ridiculous.) Then there's private detective Brawne turning into some superpowered Virgin Mary--only without the \\"virgin\\" part--that seemed completely absurd. And really, what did Martin Silenius, the annoying 400-year-old poet, actually contribute to the story? The Tree Templar contributed more to the final result and he was believed dead/actually dead for most of both books!(Possible spoiler: for a hint at what the final solution involves it'd be like the inhabitants of \\"The Island of Dr. Moreau\\" battling SkyNet and its army of Terminators.)In the end, I came away disappointed with this book, but it's not a completely terrible book. Most of the writing was sound, though I found a little of it to be amateurish, like when a senator says something and then the author says, \\"She was a short woman with dark hair.\\" which really had no relevance at the moment. While it was written in 1991, a lot of what it says about humanity's dependence on computers and scientific stagnation is still relevant in the 21st Century. The \\"datasphere\\" people plug themselves into to communicate with far-off people isn't so different from the Internet we use right now. It might have helped if I were familiar with the Keats poem that shares its title with the novel, but I don't really care about Keats no matter how many clones of him there are.That is all."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"I am not normally one who likes Science Ficition books, but this and Hyperion are obviously truly what this genre should always be. The final closing of a story who's foundation was layed precisely in the first, this story quickly moves into a complex interworking of the human Hegemony as they struggle against a future that lies hidden. The pilgrims fight to solve the mysteries of their own lives started in the first book, and their actions tie in beautifully with the epic story happening around them. And through it all the shrike waits, watching. This is a book that is exciting, uses a complex plot that plays out in such a way that will leave you shaking, uses many many themes that add massively including theology and many others, is realistic, is inlayed with a certain amount of terror, wonder, love, compassion, sacrifice, human understanding and struggle. A realistic epic, masterfully written with a skill rarely seen. You may have to read it in part several times to fully understand it (I did!) but even the first time through it is incredible. A novel of incredible scope, power and realisim. The new standard"},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"Let me begin by saying that Hyperion is the best book I've ever read. But the worst part about hyperion was it's ending. Thankfully, there's a sequel that explains everything that happens with the pilgrims and the Shrike.

It's worth it."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"I loved Hyperion, but must admit that the second part of the story is not as good. It is a very different book and has to stand on it's own story more than Hyperion and it gets sort of long in the middle.

Other reviews have rightly put it with the best of Sci-Fi literature, and I put it with the best of epic sagas ever written. I never wanted the stories to end. Awesome!The downside and a word of warning to those considering buying the e-versions. Reconsider it, and stick with the paper versions if you can. This is the worst conversion to an ebook I've seen yet. There are glaring errors of punctuation, grammar and, spelling throughout. They are almost constant, and kept pulling me out of the story. Kindle's version is very badly executed. In my frustration, I also tried another e-version through Apple, and it ended up being the same. Horrible mixups and errors throughout.Again, great book, great series of books, but avoid the Kindle version if possible!"},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"The Fall of Hyperion by Dan Simmons is the second book in the Hyperion series. I won't say this one is as good as the first one, as it isn't, but it comes close, real close. Simmons again captivated me with the story revolving around the planet Hyperion. Like the first book this one was full of surprises and unexpected plots. I have to say though that I am easy surprised. For one I didn't see the end of Sixth Sense coming until Bruce discovered himself. This time our heroes meet the Shrike one by one. For each the outcome is different, but satisfying. At least for the reader it is. The Hegemony finds out who the real enemy is. No big surprise there. Surprising for me was the way they attacked it though and the big consequences it has for mankind. Anyways, great book, will read the next one for sure."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"This book, along with Hyperion, is a masterpiece of writing.

There was more love making in the first book."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"Dan Simmons' \\"The Fall of Hyperion\\" picks up right where the first book Hyperion leaves off. Though, the storytelling is a little different.In the first book the Consul is the first person narrator, except for when the other characters tell their stories.In this second book, we meet a new character: Joseph Severn, an artist living in TC^2, who has the ability to view our Hyperion friends in his dreams. During the first part of the book, we see things unfolding from Joseph's POV through a clouded lens. At first this was annoying, but it turns out that Joseph is a very important person. (If it's any hint, the \\"real\\" Joseph Severn was a good friend of the poet John Keats.)But then starting with Part 2, everything becomes a little clearer with the author switching to normal third person limited. Events unfold. We get to see what happens to each of the pilgrims on Hyperion.I can't say too much without giving away the plot of the first book, but I can say the following.This second book is almost as good as the first book. Where I would give the first book 10 stars, the second gets 9. There are some parts in the second where the writing seems a little sloppy, while the first is a masterpiece from page 1 till the end.The second book ties up nearly all loose ends from the first book. While book #1 ends in a cliffhanger, book #2 gives a satisfying end such that you don't feel like you need to read the last two books (though I probably will eventually).Book #2 has a lot of \\"No way!\\" moments, and is a very exciting read once you get past Part 1.Book #2 doesn't waste any time reminding you what you should remember on your own from Book #1. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Well--Simmons might do it a little, but it flows so naturally.After reading Book #1, it's so easy to say, \\"I don't see how everything fits together.\\" But book #2 will hit you over the head with the explanation and when you're done reading you'll say, \\"Wow! It makes sense. Why didn't I see that earlier?\\"There are still a few small things left unrevealed--gotta keep things open for books 3 and 4.Dan Simmons really, really seems to like John Keats. I don't share this great love, and I usually skimmed past all the verse in italics. Though I gather that the whole Hyperion story seems to be heavily inspired by some specific Keats poems--as if Simmons read them and said, \\"Wow. I could make a great story out of that.\\"And the Consul still never gets a name. Aaaaagh! I know ... major spoiler.But notwithstanding, Simmons is an excellent storyteller and I thoroughly enjoyed reading these two books, and I highly recommend them both."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"A colleague of mine lent me the first book and since then I can't put these books down. Hyperion was haunting...to this day, the story of Sol Weintraub and Rachel, being a father with two daughters, brings a lump to my throat.

I won't spoil reads for anyone but I see too much time travel without much of any attempt to explain how it might be done. I guess I just prefer more slightly realistic. And what exactly are 'time tides' anyway?I get that the skies on Hyperion are 'lapis'. Does anyone really know that word without looking it up and how many times was it used? What's a matter with blue?And what is with sex in the middle of battle? Is there a point to that?OK, my annoyances aside, the basic storytelling part was OK. I like the technique of the separate traveler perspectives. I like discussion of what might happen with intelligences we create that become superior to us. It's just that these points were degraded for me by the other items mentioned. I may eventually read the follow up book, but it's not high on my priority list at the moment."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"I really do enjoy the story but the imagery is abstract and lengthy. He throws in a lot of archaic descriptors that really do not add to the painting. At times the pace is frenetic and then at other times it's glacial. The first book was a much better read. The worst part is when he throws in the AI's koans (painful literary technique). It's very painful to dredge through pages and pages of that crud. Those are a lot of parts that are easy to skip over without really losing anything in the story except for one early round of koan's that had some pertinent info. The best parts are excellently depicted hand-to-hand and space combat scenes, travels thru bizarre worlds and the concepts of time/travel (I wish there was a glossary of terms)."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"One of the most bizzare, esoteric pieces of science fiction I've ever read (and I've read a lot).

The ending(?) is fantastic, to say the least. Throwing the human race into the bowels of Chaos (In which our very survival is unknown) to avoid our own fate of certain extinction by slowly fading out into mindless, unevolving slugs was very powerful. The entire story is a treasury of Philosophy and Theology, and if a reader cannot decipher it's complex language, perhaps Mr. Simmons' view of the status quo of the human spirit is not entirely wrong."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"A good ending to the stories started in the first book.

This tore down the curtain, showing the flames and voice of the wizard to be a small, petty thing."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"Overall I found The Fall of Hyperion to be enjoyable, but by the end I felt I was given weak explanations or no explanations for many things. I very much enjoyed the overall arc of the book - the results of and surprises from the battle with the Ousters set up in \\"Hyperion\\". I felt I was left empty-handed as to why many things happened. For example, in the first book we learn that the Time Tombs are traveling back in time. It's a primary question; why are they doing so and who did it? The explanation comes but but not with a \\"oooooh\\" but a \\"huh?\\" It's a convoluted and contrived-seeming story that resorts to god-like influences and it's not satisfying at all. It reminded me of some of the later Dune book in that it tried to be deep but missed and ended up seeming just arbitrary.If you wondered at quantity of John Keats references in \\"Hyperion\\", this book gives you a ton more, including an inexplicable quantity of pages reliving a part of his life to arrive at a purpose that could have been accomplished without any of it.And the wonderful pilgrims from the first book that you're bouncing off the walls wondering about? Their stories play out, and the ride is fun but it all feels random and mostly purposeless at the end. The Tree of Thorns, the Shrike, the Time Tombs, all are players in this more personal drama with an unsatisfying conclusion which includes a couple deus ex machinas.That said, it was largely the framing of the story - the explanations that were unsatisfying. I was engaged and excited the entire way through, up until I realized the explanations were failing, and the last quarter of the book I spent hoping that Simmons would pull it together somehow.I enjoyed Hyperion a LOT more. I'm glad I read this but wish it had been better than it was. I'm not going to read any more in the series, though."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"For those wondering about the quality of the Kindle edition, it appears that it comes from a similar source as the first book's Kindle edition. There are typos here and there, but not nearly as common as in the first book. Whereas the first book had a few issues per page, this book has something maybe every five pages or so. Also, fewer words are misspelled (\\"tne\\" instead of \\"the,\\" for example) and the errors that tend to crop up are a missing period or comma here and there. Still slightly distracting, but nowhere near as bad as the job done to the first book."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"I was taken a bit aback with this the second installment in the Hyperion Cantos. The first was so character driven with such well rounded and unique characters created in order to build a story. The Fall of Hyperion was the opposite and is almost entirely story driven, leaving someone who loved the first book wondering if this was going to fall a little flat. It certainly did not after you readjust your mentality, leaving you with a story and a universe that is very compelling and believable.The Fall of Hyperion takes off right where Hyperion ended. The characters were fleshed out in the first in order to set up the second, so you have very little character development in this one, except perhaps for some like Severn and Gladstone. The story begins to unravel as you progress towards when the Time Tombs are going to open, always with the menacing Shrike lurking around. I found the Shrike to be very believable as a villain one that both frightened and fascinated me. Simmons' description of the various actions of the Shrike are very detailed and alive, putting the reader right in the middle of the action.Going in to The Fall of Hyperion you feel for Sol and Rachel, you understand the bitterness of Martin, you believe in the reasons for why the Consul betrayed two groups. You understand what they went through to get to where they were. The Fall of Hyperion is their story, the story that unfolds the reasons why each of them, as individuals, were chosen to be the last of the Shrike Pilgrims. If you enjoyed Hyperion, than ready yourself for a different feel to Simmons' writing altogether, one that takes the fully fleshed out characters and inserts them into a story on an epic scale.5 stars."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"Fall of Hyperion is the second half of the Hyperion saga. I'll admit, I was a bit skeptical when I first picked this book up. After reading the first book I figured there wouldn't be much more story left and that Fall of Hyperion would be fluff-filled (could there really be another 500+ pages worth of quality material here?). Boy, am I glad I was wrong!Fall more or less picks up where the original left off. We begin with a first-person narrative from a new character named Joseph Severn. Severn is another Keats cybrid who dreams of the events happening to the pilgrims on Hyperion. The war between the Ousters and the hegemony is brewing at full-force. The hegemony is aiming to connect Hyperion to the web (via farcaster) but it is feared that the Shrike will then be able to traverse through the web, causing havoc throughout. The Ousters don't agree with farcasting. An epic battle begins on Hyperion and in the center we have the pilgrims, whom we learned all about in the original work.Fall is significantly more complex than its predecessor as far as plotting. The original was more or less just six short stories that surround each of the pilgrims. In Fall the plotting is more conventional (sort of) but Dan ups the ante a bit. Here we have up to five or six parallel story lines, which are often on different parts of the galaxy, sometimes during different timelines. We also have a new cast of characters on top of the already existing characters. A heavy dose of religion comes into play along with quantum physics, multiple dimensions, lucid dreaming and much more. Dan will often switch threads at a break-neck pace, typically leaving cliffhangers along the way, so you better keep up!Hyperion was amazing and for me Fall of Hyperion was even better. I really enjoyed all of the twists, turns and layers. The whole book is great but the last 150 pages or so are just jaw-dropping. If you are a fan of fantasy or sci-fi and you haven't read the first couple books in the Hyperion saga then you are really doing yourself a disservice. Fall of Hyperion is one of those books I could read again and again and is easily a solid five stars."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"The Fall of Hyperion, is quite different in style(s) from Hyperion. While Hyperion was almost a showcase for Dan Simmons' literary talent, The Fall of Hyperion is a more straight-forward space opera. In a way, that makes this sequel a bit disappointing, and in another way, it offers the best conclusion to the original story possible. It's a fair trade-off that benefits loyal readers.Without spoiling anything, The Fall of Hyperion concerns our favorite pilgrims, and the effects of their journey on not only themselves, but the hegemony of man, interweb, ousters, and time and space as well. Virtually the entire book is a rollercoaster ride, there's so many answers, new questions, and satisfying conclusions.It should be noted that while a number of new characters are introduced, one stands out - Joseph Severn/John Keats. This character serves as the main narrator, able to view the majority of events through his dreams. While a far cry from the variety of styles present in Hyperion, this offers it's own intriguing elements. The actual John Keats for instance, wrote an epic poem entitled The Fall of Hyperion: A Dream in which this novel takes inspiration from.The addition of John Keats as a character adds a meta-element that really reminds me of The Dark Tower Book 6: Song of Susannah when Stephen Kings writes himself in, as well as my most recent read - Breakfast of Champions when Kurt Vonnegut adds in himself as \\"the creator\\". Simmons achieves interesting results in adding this character, as it forced me to search out some Keats for myself. And I suspect this will be a continuing theme in Simmons' other major series - Ilium/Olympos.The novel, in paperback, is about 500 pages long, and 300 of those pages are action-packed. Colonel Kassad, in particular, resumes his heroics and you'll be unable to put the book down during his scenes. Likewise, the way that Simmons weaves the lives of each pilgrim together at the final conclusion is masterful. The twists and turns make sense, and characters motivations are always believable. You'll finally understand why each character was chosen, and you'll be rewarded greatly for sticking with the story.I hesitate to state that The Fall of Hyperion was any better or worse than Hyperion, simply because I beleive the two should be read together as \\"The Hyperion Cantos\\". Where Hyperion failed, The Fall of Hyperion succeeded, and where the Fall of Hyperion missed, Hyperion connected. These two novels make up one hell of a story, one in which I haven't seen matched in the science fiction genre. And yes, I'm including Dune and the Ender series. science fiction fan or not, everyone should give both books a read. At the very least, I think it will open minds as to the literary potential of science fiction."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"Wow! I enjoyed the first novel in Dan Simmons's Hyperion quartet, but the second was nothing short of astonishing. The first novel almost entirely focused on the back stories of the group known as the Shrike Pilgrims, people sent to the Shrike Temple to make contact with the three-meters tall bio-metalic entity with the power to manipulate time. The first novel actually was a set up for what came in the second novel, which is the pay off. The first novel ends with the pilgrims approaching the Shrike Temple; the second novel tells what happened after that. It tells the stories of the multiple plans to destroy the existing political and social order, with a couple of major twists and turns. I found the entire thing absolutely brilliant, with a depth of character development unusual for SF. I have not yet read the final two novels in the series, but I look forward to them with tremendous avidity (unfortunately, projects that I'm involved with will delay my continuing with the story for a while).One of the more fascinating aspects of the Hyperion books is the way that the poet John Keats is woven into the story. It extends even to one of the major characters in the story, the detective Brawne Lamia, the lover of the Cybred recreation of John Keats and the mother of his child. One of Keats's major poems is entitled Lamia while Brawne was the last name of the great love of his life (and the one to whom most of his poems were addressed), Fanny Brawne.Only rarely have I read a SF series with the depth and intelligence of this one. I can't wait to get to the next book."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"This book consists of 45 chapters that conclude the story begun in 'Hyperion' book. This time, John Keats (or someone who has his memories) is much more apparent than in the first book. Through his words, visions, dreams and deeds we can see the fates of other main protagonists -- and you know what? Now we meet Paul Dur&eacute; himself.The narration is very descriptive many times, requires a careful attention and many people will want to reread the book to fully captivate the messages this book tells. Still the book does not make you bored and I was always thinking about it and what will possibly come next while not reading it.Yes, this book -- like Hyperion -- is not for everyone. But those, who liked Hyperion, will like The Fall of Hyperion, too, although it is different in both style and composition."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"The Fall of Hyperion picks up the Hyperion Cantos where it left off, but with a unique twist: the story switches to a first-person narrative told from the perspective of Joseph Severn, the cybrid reincarnation of the poet John Keats. This point of view allows Simmons a great deal of freedom, as Severn can directly narrate the compelling story of tragic Meina Gladstone, he can keep the reader informed of the Shrike pilgrims through his unusual dreaming capabilities, he provides a link to the cryptic but critically important Ummon in the Core, and finally his own experiences make up a large part of the slow, sad denouement to the tale.While all of the Hyperion stories are excellent, in retrospect this might have been the one that engaged me the least. After the incredibly engaging, intense, and well-crafted \\"Hyperion\\", \\"The Fall of Hyperion\\" feels a little bit rough around the edges. There is a lot of action and dialogue that are confusing to follow. The comings and goings around the Time Tombs tended to unfurl in a relatively slow fashion--like martial artists fighting in quicksand. The Shrike resumes its role as the mechanical bogeyman, but its actions shift from indiscriminate killer to more nuanced plot facilitator ... making its motives as friend or foe unclear. Much of the dialogue involving Keats' poetry or especially the Zen koans seemed indulgent in a \\"look ma, allegory!\\" kind of way, without adding much to the story itself. Fortunately, Simmons seemed to sense a need to \\"translate\\" the intended meaning of the poetry into verse so nothing was really lost, but it made deciphering the text a bit tedious at times (I grew to have a strong dislike for Ummon for this reason!).Ultimately though, this is a successful tale of the descent into chaos for the decadent but decaying Hegemony of Man. We see the downfall of the Hegemony through the eyes of the elegantly portrayed Meina Gladstone, triggered in large part by a critical insight about the subtly sinister TechnoCore provided by Ummon. We see the fall of Hyperion itself at the hands of the enigmatic Ousters. Finally, we see several deaths, \\"rebirths\\", and a pregnancy that will play a critical role in the subsequent stories.In many ways, \\"The Fall of Hyperion\\" was probably the most challenging story of the Cantos for Simmons to write because it needed to fill two roles: as both the \\"conclusion\\" of \\"Hyperion\\" and the segue to the \\"Endymion\\" stories, Simmons needed to wrap up certain story lines, continue others, and start yet several more as the foundation for the Endymion books. He returned to a more conventional (less innovative?) narrative style than Hyperion, and the writing seemed to suffer a bit from this novel's broader scope (this is where a talented editor should've stepped in). For me at least, Severn is the weakest of this series' many narrators, as his status as a somewhat enigmatic copy of a copy of a 19th century poet makes him feel more like a plot device than a flesh-and-blood character that the reader can make a connection with. Still, \\"The Fall of Hyperion\\" serves as the necessary and still largely-successful bridge between the outstanding \\"Hyperion\\" and the concluding Endymion tales so if you have made it this far, dear Reader, continue on!"},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"This book is an addictive, read-deep-into-the-night page-turner. Whereas in Hyperion, I could stop after each tale for a bit, I couldn't put this book down. I needed to know what happened next. And next. And next. A phenominal epic that will remain with me forever. Warning: read Hyperion first."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"I loved \\"Hyperion\\" so much that I was almost afraid to pick the sequel up, fearing that it wouldn't measure up to the incredibly high standard that Dan Simmons had set (see my review of \\"Hyperion\\" for more details). I needn't have worried. \\"The Fall of Hyperion\\" further demonstrates Simmons' amazing ability to meld science fiction with poetry, two genres that I would have never thought could be combined. There were several points when I had to put the book down in order to digest what I had just read before i was able to continue, it moved me that muchThe characters you have grown to empathize with in the first novel are forced through more unnerving experiences on the world of Hyperion, with the mysterious Shrike. However, the focus of this book shifts somewhat from the first, elaborating on the big picture as well as the events that are happening on Hyperion. I found much of the book to be confusing, but I kept going anyways and it all eventually made sense in the end.\\"The Fall of Hyperion\\" explores issues that normally do not surface in the science fiction genre: free will and slavery, religion and faith, and whether the ultimate loyalty should be to the institutions that humanity has created or to the human race itself. It is a work of literature that, in my opinion, should be ranked along with many of the other enduring classics that are taught in our schools. This is not an easy book to read - the Shrike is, after all, known as \\"The Lord of Pain\\" - but it is well worth it."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"This sequel to \\"Hyperion\\" does a good job of tying up the loose ends from \\"Hyperion\\" however without the Chaucerian conceit, it reads just like an adventure tale. That's not bad if that's what you're after, but I like my sci-fi to have a bit more meat on its bones.The world is still superb and even more worked out. The Shrike is even more in evidence and still cool.The resolution, however, is a bit too mamby pamby for me. Simmons tries to switch so many genres in the first book that in the second one he ends on too triumphant a note. Too long to go for such little emotional/intellectual payoff."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"After reading this book I understood that the stories of the pilgrims of the first part, &quot;Hyperion&quot;, work as a clever device to reveal to the reader the magnificent and intriguing universe that Simmons has created for this series. If you finishedthe first book with a feeling of disconnection between the stories, like I did, this is the part where all is blended together. The different patches are stitched together and the whole plot is laid before your eyes in all its complexity.The scope of the story suddenly expands and it deals now with nothing less than the surviving of the human race. Difficult decisions affecting the destinies of entire worlds have to be made by leaders on the basis of insufficient and unreliable information. War rages. What is the role of the planet Hyperion and the shrike on this grand scale drama? Who can you trust?The story offers some very interesting and not so obvious twists at the end. It has a sense of closure, but not all the issues are resolved. Actually, I think that the main issue is merely postponed to a time deep in the future of which we are offered only glimpses.At times the story is difficult to follow because the pilgrims are split. Then we follow one of them for a while, and whensomething extremely important seems to be about to happen... we shift to another pilgrim or subplot and start accumulating tension again. This format has the advantage, though, that it adds some suspense, and I liked it.I assume that if you are considering reading this book is because you have read the first one. Go ahead! It will answer some of the many questions you must have. In case you have not read the first part, I do not think this second part is a stand-alone book; you need the background of &quot;Hyperion&quot;."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"Uhhhh.... Ok. The overall concepts in this book are pretty interesting. However the details make no sense. None.After reading both Hyperion, and The Fall of Hyperion, you would think some basic questions could be answered. If you can't answer these questions, how on Earth could anyone possible give this a 4 or 5 star rating? The most basic questions that come to mind are (spoilers):1. Brawn destroys the Shrike how? She does what? Where was she hiding her magic x-men powers all this time? Is she like Tinker Bell the magic fairy - one touch and *poof*? What the heck? What - does she have some sort of super fetus channeling power though her?2. Kassad's purpose was what? He accomplished what?3. Exactly when did Gladstone come up with her solution to the Core? Early on, we are told that she intends to carry out some grand plan (known only to her). But wait, apparently she doesn't actually know where the Core is located until the Keats/Severn spirit/dream thing tells her. Right? So her plan is what...? Only after she finds out where the Core is does she know what she needs to do. So what the heck was she planning on doing before that? Prior to discovering the location of the Core, she says that she has enough time to accomplish her goal. Ok, so what was that? This makes no sense at all. Oh... and the best part is how fast she makes the decision and how fast she implements it.It goes something like this:Gladstone: Hey military general dudes! Guess what? I just had this dream that told me where the Core is located!Dudes: Sweet!Gladstone: But...ahh.. here is the problem. See, we have to blow up our entire farcaster system to destroy the Core. You know, the one that allows human travel between worlds. This would mean the largest mass murder of in human history, the destruction of civilization as we know it, a new dark ages, etc. You guys cool with that?Dude 1: NoDude 2: (shoots Dude 1 dead) Yeah, I'm cool with that.Gladstone: Great! However, we only have like a couple hours to implement this plan on a galactic scale. We can do that right?Dude 2: Yep - I'll just go back and git r' done.Gladstone: Sweet. I mean wow... our entire civilization is based on these farcasters. Isn't it amazing that I can have a dream and then we can destroy the entire system with pretty much no problem at all?Dude 2: Yep.Gladstone: Ok then.4. Uhhh... so is the tree of thorns real or just a stimsim? Oh - and why the heck would the Templars want to fly it around?5. Ok... so Keats/Severn is the one who comes before... but wait, he could have been \\"the one\\", but he chooses not to... but wait, he really didn't have a choice because he found out he was really just the one who comes before. Before what? Before the one who teaches of course. But how does the one who comes before actually prepare the way for the one who teaches? What does he do? Oh I see - he takes over the AI of a spaceship and begins to recite poetry.6. Silenus - the poem matters why? Why does the Shrike care about the poem? Oh wait... the Shrike really doesn't care, just before its finished he decides to impale to poet. Ahhhhh... so why waste the time writing it in the first place?7. Perhaps the penultimate question. If the Core really wants to eradicate most of humanity (except for some rubes that it keeps in tunnels with cruciforms on them), then why the elaborate ruse? The Core can control the farcaster portals, correct? The Core can apparently build a massive cybrid military, correct?So - why not just use the farcasters to teleport a bunch of people to a hidden world and then stick cruciforms on them to create the Core's human computer, or whatever you want to call it? Basically, a Matrix sort of setup for the Core. In other words, why the heck can't the Core set up an independent network of its own? A backup system.I imagine a conversation between two super AI's:AI 1: Hey. I've got an idea. Rather than being stuck in a symbiotic relationship with the humans, why don't we kidnap some of them and create a backup system on another world. Even if is isn't as good as our current system, at least we would have that in reserve. Good idea, huh?AI2: I don't know about that. I've got a batter idea! Let's work for a few hundred years on created our own God - an ultimate intelligence for machines. Oh... and once we do that, our new God can create a crazy creature called the Shrike, which it will send back in time from the future to do something, probably just impale people on a giant tree of thorns or something, in order to scare any other Gods out there into showing up for a fight. Well... let me think about that... maybe not a real tree of thorns, maybe just a simulation. We could hook people up in the head and make them think they are impaled on a tree of thorns. Or, we could sort of make it confusing so that you can't really tell if the tree is real or not, that way we could trick someone into trying to make it into a flying tree of thorns spaceship. Ha! That would be awesome!Oh... and check this out. We'll trick those humans into thinking that the Ousters are attacking them everywhere. But that will be our cybrid army of course.AI1: Ahhhh... ok. But what if the Hegemony humans actually talk to the Ouster humans at some point? What if the Ousters tell the Hegemony - hey, you know those people attacking your other worlds? Yeah...Sorry, not us. Maybe we should have a backup just in case. I mean look... the farcaster system is the single most important technological system in the galaxy. It is the basis for Hegemony civilization and permits our Core to exist. What if the humans take a stick to it? It's not lie either one of us actually thought about making it hard to destroy or something?A2: Bah! I'm building a new God, a cybrid army, a big boom deathwand weapon, bioenginnering a cruciform resurrection device, and plotting the destruction the human race."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"As war rages above the planet Hyperion seven pilgrims embark on a journey that six of them may never return from. They are on a pilgrimage to the Time Tombs an area of the planet where time runs in reverse and that is guarded by the three meter tall four armed metallic Shrike a creature covered with spikes with red glowing eyes and no sense of mercy. The creature can appear at any time, any place with no warning taking its victims in a seemingly random fashion. The Church of the Shrike believes that the Lord of Pain has come to announce the end of the universe and a time for atonement. Oh, and the seven pilgrims have all been warned that there is a traitor among them.Each of the pilgrims have their own reason for going on this journey of no return. One wants to save the life of his daughter who is aging backwards after encountering the Shrike; one wants to kill the creature after being duped into starting the war; another believes that somehow he brought the Shrike back when he wrote his Hyperion Cantos. They are all seeking answers which might result in death. The Shrike's reappearence means the end of everything to many and an answer to mysteries for others.Dan Simmons' first two books in his quartet set in and around the planet Hyperion is a well written space opera that lives up to the genres potential--it is epic storytelling that really hasn't been seen since Frank Herbert's DUNE series or John Varley's Gaean trilogy. While the prose can often become overly florid at times, Simmons does a terrific job of creating his universe and the characters that inhabit it. Many have pointed out the parallels to The Canterbury Tales and with good reason--Simmons is an educated writer that isn't afraid to throw in literary references to enrich his story.This book along with Endymion, The Rise of Endymion (again, both were written as a single novel) and the short story \\"Orphans of the Helix\\" (published in the collection Worlds Enough & Time)are all worth reading. Don't let those who argue that Simmons' intelligent references to other novels is a bad thing--he makes assumptions about the intelligence of his readers--it just enhances the experience."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"The Fall of Hyperion is Dan Simmons' conclusion to the epic novel Hyperion. This book is a small departure from the \\"frame story\\" format used in Hyperion in which each character is treated as a separate story within the framework of a single narrative. The Fall of Hyperion settles into the more standard linear narrative, although it does retain some semblance to the original Canturbury Tales style of the first book.The group of seven pilgrams has reached the Time Tombs, and they seek a confrontation with the mysterious Shrike, a machine like predator who can seemingly transcend time to kill. Each traveler has their own reasons for coming on this quest, but it is not understood how they all relate to one another.At the same time the galactic government of the Hegemony is at the brink of all out war with the ousters, a group of humans who struck out into space on their own hundreds of years before and has seemingly evolved. The CEO of the Hegemony government Meina Gladstone finds herself in a very difficult position, facing decisions that could affect the future of the hegemony. CEO gladstone must make these choices in the face of conflict with the military, the senate, and especially the Artificial Intelligence known as the Core.However the main perspective of the story is told through that of Joseph Severen, a cybrid who was modeled after the poet/author John Keats. Severen seems to hold the key details to a future that could take place resulting in either the destruction or salvation of mankind.John Keats is of course, the inspiration for both the titles of this series as well as its storyline, and his writings figure even more into The Fall of Hyperion. This novel travels much deeper into philosophical and theological territory than does hyperion. I found the concepts to be extremely interesting and enlightening, however some may find that less interesting than the more character driven Hyperion. Simmons is able to deliver a complex and compelling narrative, while at the same time creating a drawing on high concept physics and scienctific principles. This is what sets him apart from the rest of the crowd of \\"science fiction\\" authors.The pilgrims' stories that filled \\"Hyperion\\" were a major reason for its brilliance, and it makes that a tough act to follow. however, it is necessary to this concluding act. The switch in style however, does allow the further development and exploration of the philosophical themes which form the basis of the series. That alone makes this novel a superb conclusion.The Fall of Hyperion is not quite as engrossing and fulfilling as it's predecessor, but it is a worthy and masterly epilogue."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"This was the first book I ever read by Dan Simmons. Unfortunately, I was completely lost, so much so that I barely even remembered it. But read the way it was meant to be- as a sequel and continuation of the story started in \\"Hyperion\\"- it became one of the best science fiction books I have read in years.This new book continues the story of the Shrike Pilgrims, who have reached the Time Tombs where they believe they will die. It also adds a new character, the reconstituted personality of John Keats, an English poet and now experiment by the powerful AI factions that control human destiny. The Pilgrims explore while they wait for the Shrike to claim them, and the Keats personality witnesses the ramp-up to war of human civilization. And then unexpected things begin to happen.Although the universe that Simmons has created is extraordinary, what sets him apart from most science fiction writers is the depth and believability of his characters. Some of the Pilgrims seem to have had their stories told in full in the first book, but others, especially Martin, are allowed to evolve full circle. Added to that is the multilayered and extremely unreliable narration of Keats, and of his various acquaintances among the world of humanity. Each person rings true - there are no character actors here, no templates filled out and thrust into the book to perform a specific action and then fade from the scene. I read an interview once where an author claimed that he knew how each of his characters would answer questions on a personality test. At the time that seemed ridiculous, but now I feel that maybe writers such as Simmons really do have the ability to hold whole personalities in their heads.None of this is to say that fans of traditional science fiction will be disappointed. There are space battles here; wormholes, exoskeletons, time warping, network wars, and much else that should be familiar but which seems fresh and exciting in context.If you have read the first book you probably already want to read this one. If you're looking for a Simmons book, start with Hyperion. You'll end up reading this one in due time!"},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"Dan Simmons' The Fall of Hyperion is the sequel to his Hugo-winning novel Hyperion, a grand masterpiece in its own right. However, The Fall of Hyperion is where the story is truly realized, explored, and concluded. The destinies of the Shrike pilgrims are told with stunning skill and moving ability, and the epic story of the Hegemony wars finally plays out.Of course, you should not pick up this novel without first reading Hyperion. But you should buy this with Hyperion--the original novel ends with an absolutely terrible cliffhanger.The Fall of Hyperion is told with all the deep human emotion and brilliant prose of the original novel, and I am surprised that it too did not receive the Hugo award. Granted, there are still the slow philosophical parts, and much space is devoted to the discussion of the nature of God and gods and the relationship of humankind to their deities. Personally, I found it fascinating, and it doesn't detract from the story in the least.For cutting-edge, gripping science fiction, finish off the Hyperion set with The Fall of Hyperion. Dan Simmons is once again at his best in this novel, and you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"Dear reader beware of any review that attempts to give you a plot synopsis of this novel. Your enjoyment can only be lessoned, as one of the strongest aspects of The Fall of Hyperion is its methodical revelations, peeling the layers of the onion back to reveal &quot;the big picture.&quot; A fair synopsis must be reduced to this.This book answers two questions.What happens when the pilgrims reach the Time Tombs?What happens to the Hegemony of Man as the pilgrims reach the Time Tombs?And a grand plot it is indeed. As epic as The Lord of the Rings and as filled with political machinations as Dune. Simmons does an outstanding job of addressing an eclectic cornucopia of ideas to include - art, science, slavery, philosophy, theology, artificial intelligence, and metaphysics. All within the context of mankind's struggle to save itself while not really being sure who the enemy is. Up until the last five pages before the epilogue I was asking myself, &quot;Just exactly how does he intend to wrap all this up.&quot; But he does. He wraps it up in a neat little package with ties drawn all the way back from the first novel. Every question that I had was answered, except for just exactly what the purpose of the ... oops, can't tell you that.The other real strength here is that once more Simmons draws on his talent to breath life into his characters. He made me cry again (I hate him for that.) The original pilgrims retain their depth, but the new characters never really achieve the same level of solidity.But he does include two things in this novel that just plain annoy me. The first and third parts of the book are riddled with sections written in present tense. I have always found this to be a pretentious attempt to be &quot;artistic&quot; (like e.e. cummings always writing his poetry in lower case.)The other problem is far too much use of poetry. I've never been a fan of poetry. I love the written word, and for me the attempt to encapsulate ideas within the constraints called for by poetry are like trying to build the Sistine Chapel using designs for an outhouse. I know there are throngs of intellectuals that disagree with me. So be it.Well worth the read. After two days I'm still mulling over some of the ideas and emotions brought forward by this work. That's a sign of a good book.The sequel test? Well in this case, I'm thinking that I will not proceed to Endymion without reading a few reviews myself. Hope no one puts in a spoiler."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"Hyperion transported me into another world; The Fall of Hyperion left me looking at my watch. Boring.

Another but not necessarily conflicting answermight be, when the genie is out of the bottle you can never put it back!"},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"I agree with other writers, you would not be able to follow this book if you hadn't read the first. There is just too much info about the characters detailed in the first book that you would loose only getting it from the second. That said, I'm not even too excited about this book. There are about a million plot lines happening at the same time and they come together so late in the game that it is difficult to keep track of them and you start to loose interest/patience. I gave it a 3 because about 75% of the plot lines were interesting enough to keep me going on their own and last handful of pages sealed the book nicely."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"Dan Simmons weaves a story, blending competing and disparate threads togeather into a fine tapestry.

I am now on to my third one.The books are all written exceptionally well, with just the right amount of detail and backstory to make you forget you are not actually living the book.

You can definitely use this as a book to enjoy for the read, or to ponder the deeper meanings of this book and its commentary about the society we live in today."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"I would rate all four books in the hyperion series as five stars. Any fan of sci-fi or fantasy who has not read this series must pick up these books. This second book of the series is the second half of the 1st major story in the series. It finishes the story started in Hyperion. While this book doesn't quite have the story telling of the 1st book, or the character development of the last two books, Fall of Hyperion has the best suspense and twist turns of all the books in the series. Simmons masterfully builds up mystery after mystery. Every answer to each riddle is another question that draws you deeper into the story. This book is a definate page turner. I guarantee you will find it hard to put it down. I think this book is the key the whole series because it takes the terrific foundation of Hyperion and raises it to a whole new level."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"I am writing a joint review for both \\"Hyperion\\" and its sequel \\"The Fall of Hyperion\\" as, together, they are one complete story arc - \\"Hyperion\\" figuratively (and almost literally) ends mid-sentence to be picked up in \\"The Fall of Hyperion\\".Man's civilization and empire spans light years through a wormhole transportation network that hummans use to travel between the stars instantaneously. Through a treaty with humanity after they broke away from man's control, the AIs make this technology possible and run the network of portals - no non-AI computer has the power to create the network.This empire is now threatened by swarms of augmented humans that live and travel between the stars and the focus of their attack is the planet Hyperion and its star system. Hyperion is not a normal planet as it holds the Time Tombs - empty and enigmatic vaults/monuments that are literally traveling backwards in time. Guarding the Time Tombs is the Shrike - a seemingly living entity made of razor-sharp metal blades. A religion has grown around the Shrike and believers in the Shrike Prophesies make pilgrimages to to see the Shrike where they are wither granted a request or sacrificed.As war approaches Hyperion, a group of humans gather for one last pilgrimage - each with their own history and reason for wanting to confront the Shrike. Each pilgrim's story and history is a sub-story in its own right and together they intertwine to build the story as it arcs across the two books.Questions about man and machine, human and AI, are answered in these two books - questions \\"The Matrix\\" could begin to ask.>>>>>>>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;A Guide to my Book Rating System:1 star = The wood pulp would have been better utilized as toilet paper.2 stars = Don't bother, clean your bathroom instead.3 stars = Wasn't a waste of time, but it was time wasted.4 stars = Good book, but not life altering.5 stars = This book changed my world in at least some small way."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"The entire series is well worth the effort but this may be the best. This is one of those rare sci-fi authors who expects you to know a little about science and a little about literature and the ability to recognize when each is being tweaked a bit. Top of my list."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"The best Sci-Fi ever, the whole series (Hyperion, The Fall of Hyperion, Endymion, The Rise of Endymion). The characters, the plot and the intensity make it a must read not just for Sci-Fi buffs but for any Fiction reader. Dan Simmons has as big of a surprise in the end as did Isaac Asimov's Foundation series. This series touches on all aspects of humanity in seven characters lifetimes through a plethora of worlds."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"Dan Simmons continues the story of the 7 pilgrims sent to confront a monster. The story broadens from the perspective of the pilgrims to humanity as a whole, and does it well. Although \\"Fall of\\" does not shine like the \\"Hyperion\\" precursor in sheer writing genius, the storyline carries the novel with more points of view, surprising nuances and technological deception. It also brings faith and religion into the story, giving a hope for the salvation of humanity against incredible forces and a surprising enemy.Again, the reader is left yearning for the conclusion, and running to purchase the next book in the series."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"Simmon's Hyperion stands as the Canterbury Tales of science fiction. The space opera begun there continues in Fall of Hyperion. I enjoyed the book immensely, but was left somewhat unfulfilled at the end. Simmons returns to these characters in Endymion/Rise of Endymion which requires slugging through Endymion to reach Rise. The two middle books of this series are good books, but they are overshadowed by the series opener Hyperion and its conclusion, Rise of Endymion."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"After reading Hyperion, I had no doubt whatsoever, that I would continue to read this series. Although not quite as engrossing as the original, this sequel is well worth your reading time. The problem may be getting past the first 160 pages or so. I was rather bored with it all and Mr. Simmons gave repetitive information that he'd already shared in the original. But then (after page 160) the book shifted into high gear and kept you there till the very end. It definitely ended better than the first novel."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"I finished reading Hyperion and was overwhelmed at what I thought was the best SF book I have ever read, but last night in the early hours I finished The fall of Hyperion and never before have I found a second instalment equal or better than the first (Unlike 'The Nights Dawn Trilogy'), the characters continue their individual quest to find and face the Shrike, whilst the fate of mankind is being fought and decided by the politicians and the Ousters. However both collide in one of the most amazing and somewhat disturbing endings I have ever read. These 2 books are esential reading to both non SF fans and SF fans, and I cannot wait to start Endyminion as well as read up on Keats's work. Brilliant."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"In The Fall of Hyperion, Simmons manages to not only create one of the best sci-fi universes, but he adds to that an incredible, thought-provoking story that makes us look at our own world and think about our own future.

I'm hooked!"},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"I just finished reading Dan Simmon's &quot;The Fall of Hyperion&quot; and I am truly mesmerized by the quality of the ideas behind the novel. This book makes a really excellent read. Un-put-down-able!"},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"Although it is true that these two volumescan be thought of as two parts of a longbook, the style of the two parts is verydifferent. The storytelling in this second partis not completely linear, however it follows asingle style. While the recounting of the pilgrims'stories in the first book showcased Dan Simmons'mastery of a number of different fiction genres,the complexity of the story lay in the interplaybetween the tales, rather than the individual tales.The writing in the \\"Fall of Hyperion\\" is a bit morecomplex, and the story a bit more difficult to follow.The book ends with many questions unanswered,but is still a very satisfying read."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"This is a must read for anyone who appreciates both fine literature and Science Fiction. No cowboys in space here... Well maybe a little...God, Monster, killer time traveling robot or all of the above... Every one should familiarize them selves with the Shrike!Read the first two books and you'll be locked in."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"This book is not for those with short attention spans. It has multiple, complex plots which fold in upon one another. The book takes effort to understand but the effort is worth it. The author, Dan Simmons, has a clean writing style that lends itself to helping the reader along."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"I wrote a review for Hyperion. I didn't think a book could be as spellbinding as Hyperion, but Dan Simmons did it again! This book was unbelievable! He continued to show us the rich future he gave us a taste of in the first book, and continues to lay an even more intriguing story on top of it. I simply could not quit reading it.As with Hyperion, I have purchased the next book in the series and I believe I am going to continue my voyage through the world of Hyperion. As with the first, this series has only been rivaled by Frank Herbert's Dune. I can't think of any other series in this genre that has held my attention so intensely."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"In the field of science fiction, sequels usually don't live up to the original, especially not when the original is as good as Hyperion. The Fall of Hyperion is a bit of a let-down because author Dan Simmons turns away from the main strengths of the first novel and tries to move to a new setting, new characters, and a new style. Although this sequel does show the fate of the pilgrims from Hyperion and explain the nature of the Time Tombs, the majority of the action is set on TC2 and other planets and deals with politics and warfare in the Hegemony. The pilgrims are only mentioned during brief dream sequences. Perhaps the biggest dissapointment is that Simmons doesn't create any more wonderfully imaginative planets or any other new setting for this novel. He just employs the same settings as the previous one. However, The Fall of Hyperion does have a very well-orchestrated plot that explains all the loose ends that were left open from the original."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"This book is book 2 in an incredible series of four. The story draws you in and doesn't let got even after the book is done. If you like sci-fi or even if you just like a good book you should pick this up. But in order for it to make sense besure and pick up Hyperion first. Hyperion lays the ground work for the next three books.Although I think that The Rise of Endymion is the best in the series, all of the books are incredible storyies well worth the time to read. GO READ THE BOOK!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"The most exciting and wide ranging science fiction saga continues.Some things get better as they get bigger: witness the Hoover Dam. Some, of course, don't - Pamela Anderson's front-piece is a prime example.&quot;The Fall of Hyperion&quot; belongs to the former category. &quot;Hyperion&quot; is gob-smackingly good. If you ain't read it, do so now, or go to bed without any supper. Then, for a greater thrill, a greater ride through the staggering reaches of a brilliant man;s imagination... read &quot;The Fall Of Hyperion&quot;.Dan Simmons is amazing. You don't win that many awards unless you are. How many actors have won five, ten Oscars?Because Dan Simmons has won that many - or at least their literary equivalents.

At the end, something starts to happen to him, but it's not resolved in all four books, or DID I MISS IT? Anyone know?

I was right. However, since I had the book in my room, I could only resist it for two whole days.At times, the plot seemed a bit farfetched and coerced (like the Keats persona dreaming the others' lives even after the initial explanation was no longer valid), and other times I thought &quot;OK, Dan Simmons likes Keats - let's get on with it!&quot;. Overhall, though, it's a great book, with great ideas, and besides - if you've read Hyperion there's no way in hell anybody's going to stop you from reading it."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"Each of the characters introduced in Hyperion goes through their own harrowing adventure in the Time Tombs. Their stories are wonderfully interwoven. From this very complicated and convoluted story, comes some very simple and basic messages at the end of the book.A wonderful example of what a modern science-fiction novel can be. (Just what the book jacket says!)"},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"I couldn't finish it. I made it a third of the way through, and then couldn't bear it anymore, so I skipped and read the last few chapters, hoping to find some resolution. I was disappointed: the last few chapters were murky, bordering on incomprehensible.Look, just because it's sci-fi doesn't mean you can dispense with internal story logic, Dan Simmons.I think he [Simmons] was inspired when he wrote Hyperion. Fall of Hyperion, on the other hand, was a hack, slapped together and padded-out to a couple hundred pages to satisfy his editors.The irony is that the two books are a sort of homage to John Keats, who never padded out anything and never wrote sequels. But if Dan Simmons had written \\"Ode on a Grecian Urn\\", he would have definitely followed it up with \\"Ode on a Grecian Urn Part II: the Grecian Urn kicks the Persian Jug's Ass!\\" (now available in paperback at fine bookstores everywhere)."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"This series has been invaded by strange creatures from another genre. This book (and it's predecessor) have many elements which are creepy and grotesque but don't have much in the way of explanation. For example, it's not clear why the shrike kills person X and not person Y. Or why the shrike is invincible in some scenes and vulnerable in others. Or why the \\"cruciform\\" is shaped like a cross. Or how the human sacrafice fits in to the big picture. In a science fiction book, everything should pretty much happen for a reason and fit together.I bought \\"Fall of Hyperion\\" hoping that these questions would get answered and tied together. I was disappointed."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"Sorry Hyperion Cantos, we are through. I had high hopes that Simmons' second Hyperion novel (of 4) would tie of up all the dangling, half-explained threads of the first. This did not happen. I don't understand why an author with such strong prose, scope, and characters can fail so utterly at delivering a cohesive, connected story. Too many things happened for no particular reason other than to advance the plot. Too many other things regularly hinted at a purpose but fell flat. There were great moments, yes, but not enough to clear the bad taste in my mouth. Since I won't be continuing the series, I've read reviews and plot summaries for the remaining novels. From what I can surmise the problems the plague the first two books never quite work themselves out. A shame."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"After reading \\"Hyperion\\" I anticipated a great continuation of the story lines introduced but was ultimately disappointed in this book. While the characters are the same their stories become mired in an awkward style of writing that too often tries to fill in details for readers who did not read the first book. These glaring sidebars seriously disrupt the rhythm of the book and were an irritating accomodation. I will give credit to some striking images and some truly epic scenes but there were too many times when I had to \\"push on\\" while reading. The pilgrims take a back seat in many ways to the \\"Keats Persona\\" which unfortunately fails to reach any true emotional power. Don't expect to find answers to many of the questions you may have from \\"Hyperion\\", they're obviously in the next book, which I won't be reading."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"I can't say much about this series of books, because they were for my husband. Who HAD to have them! He loves these types of books and this author. So if you like the fantasy, futuristic stuff I guess these are for you."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"I did not understand all of it, but I enjoyed its beauty. Hence, it must be art!"},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"With a Bang and (several) Booms ,Dan Simmons has managed to exercise the subtle art of misdirection, I think... If all these important things move back in time ( the shrike, most noteably) shouldn't they be weakened by the lack of in-time support...even destroyed by travelling to a time where they don't even exist?...I think we readers should look deep into each action and turn of phrase here. The future seems to be where the Shrike has his stronghold.... Kassad confronts the Monster(s) in a jaunt thru time... his fate to wind up in one of the time tombs as an honored , though fallen hero. How about his time jumping amour... what is the deal? Rachel... The Templars... This is a book to remember folks!!! It cannot be read on it's own. HYPERION is a required lead in... Watch the exploits of Father Hoyt , the cruiform is going to figure in here somewhere. The Catholic Church in a future incarnation will be, as usual involved in some kind of political intrigue... Even if this series continues to follow the people we have come to know, I feel Dan Simmon's will swap ends on us so many times it will be a dizzying, unforgettable ride......Let's all read on!"},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"Let's get things straight: I enjoyed Hyperion. It's an odd mixture of terrible &amp; brilliant writing and I absolutely understand those that found the brilliance overwhelming &amp; so gave it such rave reviews. On the other hand, this book is plain old terrible. Pure junk. The only connection with art is that it alludes to Keats. The SF ideas are not original, and the treatment of them is remarkably shallow. Naturally, an SF book from a good writer like Simmons, contains 10 times more originality and imagination than an average mainstream book. I guess that's why newcomers to SF, or people that like Star Trek, Power Rangers and the likes, might find no fault with this book. But for most SF readers, especially if you haven't gone totally gaga over Hyperion, don't make the effort. Really, you can compose a better sequel in your sleep."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"This book should never have been written as the ending to Hyperion was perfect in my opinion. This story feels rushed and Simmons completely changed the writing style of Hyperion to force this book out. One piece of advice, read this really fast so you won't notice all the plot loopholes. The only reason that it is not a one star book is that the setting of Hyperion is impressive."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"Like my title states, so bad. I got maybe 50 pages in and had to walk away. It took me a week to make it another 20-25 pages, and that's with skipping sections.Dan Simmons either didn't like this book, or is just a bad writer."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"Hyperion and The Fall of Hyperion are the old school version of an epic Sci Fi. That means it's deep, convoluted, long, and it will make you stay up late at night to see what happens next. Total page turner.There is a lot of Keats poetry in these two books. Might be a turn off to some!Dan Simmons creates a descriptively rich fantasy world with wonderful character development, political intrigue, and a BIG mystery. Truly a joy to read for any Sci-Fi Epic lover. Don't miss it."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"Not a bad read. I'll assume everyone will get something different from it. Thought provoking... It's been awhile since I've sat around thinking about a book I've just read."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"I enjoyed parts of Hyperion, but overall it fell a little short for me. It was a great setup for The Fall of Hyperion, though. Most of the plot-lines from Hyperion are discussed in further detail and some come to fruition. I really enjoyed the writing style that Dan Simmons employed in the telling of this story as well. Each chapter switched from perspective to perspective and almost every one ended with some sort of a cliffhanger. This made for an exciting read as well as giving you an impetus for reading just one more chapter. The ideas that develop in this novel are rather frightening, and it really makes you wonder about the future of humanity if things keep going the way they seem to be. I would recommend this novel to any science-fiction fan. I'm not a huge sci-fi reader, mostly fantasy, but this book has piqued my interested in reading more sci-fi and other works by mr. Simmomns."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"I didn't like the concept of the omnicient cybrid watching over the event although he was a good vehicle for the story itself. Many of the concepts have been lifted from a short story by Asiomv called \\"The Last Question.\\" The catholic church plays a major and triumphant role in the story. The religious developments are some of the most interesting aspects of the story. The fate of the CEO didn't fit with my experience of politicians or the events themselves really. All that said the writing is excellent and the book is immersive and a good read. You'll want to read Hyperion first."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"The Hyperion Cantos continues with this book, \\"The Fall OF Hyperion\\", which might leave some readers scratching their heads as they plod through the introductory chapters being introduced to this new central character, Joseph Severn. Don't worry, your pilgrims appear. Don't worry their stories resolve. More important than just about anything else, M. Severn ends up tying this series together in the most beautiful and human of ways.The narrative cuts between the POV's of the original pilgrims, M. Severn, and Meina Gladstone establishing a tumultuous escalation of events after the time tombs open. Mr. Simmons weaves a complex Dickensian tale through future dynamics of catastrophe and age old places of the heart. The story becomes more and more emotionally steeped in what it is to be human and what of humanity needs to survive. Along with this is the undercurrent of AI and technology and it's place with our existence and an underlying texture for a coming war with possible futures. Everything beautifully layered into a climax that is nothing short of completely mind-blowing.If you're reading this it means you've read the first book, or are thinking about reading the first book and wondering if it's worth getting into. Don't worry, it's unforgettable and complex and entertaining and emotional all in ways you will just need to experience to believe.Think Space Opera with unforgettable characters, epic stakes, inspired ideas, that seem to increase with every reading."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"All I can say is I can't wait to read this series again. These are by far the best books Dan Simmons has authored."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"As I said for the other books, I'm still not sure if I like this series. I'll mark it as having liked it however."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"Dan Simmons is one of the best writers of science fiction I have ever read. If you want to feel like part of the story read this book and its beginning Hyperion."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"This is the second part of the \\"Hyperion\\" book. Don't try to read this book if you did not read the first one.This book contain a more conventional story-line in terms of its structure, and try to solve all the mysteries that were introduced by the six pilgrims stories in the first book. While the story is indeed interesting, I must say that I was extremely disappointed that not all the parts of the story were explained. While reading the first book. I was under the impression that the author knows exactly where he is leading us. However, it appears that he could not tie all the loose ends of the plot: for example, there are still lots of missing answers about the Shrike. In addition, as I'm currently reading books three and four of the series, and it seems that the inconsistencies are larger that I thought, but I'll be able to evaluate them better only when finishing my read.However, regardless of the above, this is an excellent book and the main reason that I'm giving it four instead of five stars is the split of the story to two books."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"Granted, the 'Hyperion' books aren't for everyone (staunch opponents of descriptive writing, opponents of 'soft' science fiction, or people who dislike fiction might not enjoy these books), but I enjoyed them immensely, as have the many friends I've shared them with.This second book in the 'series' is substantially different in both narration and plot, but it's still somehow the familiar work of an author whose ideas & writing we can depend upon and enjoy."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"I really liked the first book. I thought it was extremely original, literate, and well-written, with good atmosphere and a great aura of mystery. The second book, \\"The Fall of Hyperion\\", just seems so *ordinary* in contrast. I've read a hundred other books just like it, all equally forgettable. By the time I reached the last third of the book, I was already completely disinterested. Threw it in the trash when I was done. I won't be reading the next one, cause I just don't care. I'm not saying it's a terrible book... just terribly average."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"After reading Hyperion, I was so excited and eager that I picked up the sequel as soon as I could find it and prepared for an all-night session. Well, needless to say, I was sorely let down.The characters that were so well developed in Hyperion became exagerated and unrealistic. The style of writing also seemed to lack the same quality as it had previously. I found myself skimming through many of the pages because the descriptions were redundant. I also think that Simmons wasted a lot of time recapping what happened in Hyperion.Also (and this has been a pet peeve of mine) I just want to know why, oh WHY do they keep drawing the Shrike that way?? Every description of him says that he has FOUR arms. Not two. I know that has nothing to do with the story itself, but I had to vent my annoyance somewhere. :-)Though I have much criticism for the book, I do also have praise. Simmons reveals a plot so orginal and intricate that he has to get three stars for orginality alone. I do wish he explained it more however. I had to re-read some passages just to understand what was going on. In fact, I'm not quite sure I figured it out yet."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"My review is for the combined 'Hyperion' and 'Fall of Hyperion' novels. One cannot be read without the other and in correct order.While I have ranked these 5 stars, I do not think they are perfect. However, I have read very few similar genre books that I would rate higher. My favorite is still Asimov's Foundation series.Admittedly, Dan Simmons' story probably approaches the limit of my understanding and enjoyment. I have never enjoyed classical poetry and struggle in its interpretation. Fortunately for me, the interjection here and there amount to a relatively tiny portion of the written text.Portions of 'the Fall' can feel rushed and disjointed when directly compared against 'Hyperion'. The change in writing style evidently has turned a small group of readers off. It had no such effect on me. While I preferred the 'flow' of the first book, the second book was nearly as enjoyable and it conveyed the climax of the story in a well-written manner. The payoff is plenty deep and there are also plenty of questions/threads yet to be addressed...presumably by the Endymion series.There are a few points that can be nitpicked and (minor) explanations that may be dissatisfying, but these are miniscule in the grand scheme. Every book I have read has had imperfections and I reiterate that the Hyperion Cantos are superior to the majority.To me, these are a must-read for any science fiction fan"},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"I don't have the motivation to write a lengthy review. Suffice it to say that Hyperion and Fall of Hyperion are two of the best SF novels I've ever read. I've read most of the absolute all time classics (Ringworld, Foundation, Starship Troopers [NOT the movie], Stranger in a Strange Land, etc.), and these two are just as good. They're quite long, but easy reading and it pained me many times when I had to put them down. The pilgrim's individual stories are amazing on their own. The World Web, the technology, the cultures, etc. are truly fascinating."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"In \\"The Fall of Hyperion\\" we finally learn what happens to each of the pilgrims; not everyone lives happily ever after, but that wouldn't be terribly realistic based on the set up in the first book. The plotting is intricate and primarily takes place through the dreams of the main character in this book, another Keats cybrid. I'm certain others have outlined and dissected the plot for you, so I won't take your time; just be sure to grab this book if you're a fan of Dan Simmons, science fiction/fantasy and/or just all-around terrific books."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"Galaxy-spanning human civilisation the Hegemony is in crisis, facing immanent war with the nomadic Ousters over remote planet Hyperion. Behind the scenes, meanwhile, the very fabric of the Hegemony, the communications grid that allows instantaneous travel between the stars, is under threat. The Fall of Hyperion is science fiction on a heroic scale, yet is also intricate and tapestry-like, a complex narrative with many interwoven strands. This fine, imaginatively written novel is not so much a sequel as it is an immediate continuation of Hyperion, so I highly recommend acquiring both books and reading them straightaway one after the other!"},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"As you know by now, The Fall of Hyperion is not a sequel but rather the continuation of Hyperion. It's really one book that was split down the middle and published separately. This may seem daunting to a first time reader to have to tackle 1000 pages, but this is now a classic, epic, dual-book novel/series, and it's hard to believe that any fan of science fiction would not enjoy reading these.A re-reading brings its strengths and weaknesses to light. The name dropping of terms such Praetorian bodyguards, etc, etc, become tiresome at times, but its strengths certainly outweighs them. And with the events involving Colonel Kassad certainly brings new meaning to the term \`bloodlust' (or maybe reinforces the term). It can certainly be seen why it was bestowed the Nebula award given by the SFWA (Science [sic] Fiction Writers of America) which has often now given awards on works so distant from science fiction they have to redefine the term \`SF' to mean speculative-fiction rather than science fiction. But science fiction readers over the years have voiced what they enjoy reading foremost, science fiction, and what we have here is science fiction on a sweeping, epic scale written at a detailed, engrossing level.There are many Hollywood movies that have a battle situation where the enemy has an advantage and thus the movie makes a big, big deal about the protagonists using what weapons are available. Like a character will say \`why use that rock, it won't do anything against that giant', and you in the audience thinks, well maybe if it's hit in the eye it'll be injured, or another character will say \`don't use that machine gun, that aircraft in covered in sheet metal' and you think, well maybe then the pilot will be distracted giving us a chance against it, or very, very often a movie character will say \`what use will one nuclear bomb be against the aliens, they have 100 ships' and you think, well then they'll only have 99 ships left, krips. But in this case, we have an enemy, the Shrike that's almost so omnipotent, that here are the seven pilgrims bringing small weapons to use against it, when the Shrike could kill 1000 or 1,000,000 people, disembowel them, and still get home in time to sip from its still steaming hot coffee sitting on its breakfast table, so go figure.There are occasional small items that are annoying. Like Simmons makes the military use of decoys like it's some super-duper unknown military strategy unknownst to an galactic Hegemony made of hundreds or more planets. It's what, been used for maybe a few thousand years. Or he'll write about the large distances and travel time between web planets even at light speed and then something can all of a sudden be a few hours away. What, this almost ruthless Hegemony empire has no idea of the usage of listening posts/satellites. So there are occasional gaps in the suspension of disbelief upon a second reading. Another thing, that I think Simmons has to be very careful with, is that he has an almost romantic admiration for the Ousters. Well he's made them up to be a pseudo-fascist, or an actual fascist, group. Then the intelligent computer-entities become the enemy. So is it then supposed to be a choice between slavery for a totalitarian organization with respect for art and planet ecologies between slavery to silicon AI's? With all that's going on in the novel, it's hard to know what the point is supposed to be, but with a second reading, it becomes obvious that Simmons is very, very upset of what tourism has done to such unique, ecological locations such as Maui with \`tourists smelling of suntan lotion and cannabis'. And so if he's trying to make a parallel between the United States and the Hegemony, he has a point. The United States history of its past treatment of native American Indians is horrible. Unfortunately the history of humanity, and this justifies nothing that the US or others have done, is laced with such horrible events. So is the best course of action then to have the constitution of the US dissolved and have a totalitarian regime like the Soviet Union (which was in existence when Simmons wrote the novel) come and take over. What, does Simmons not know the absolute horrible atrocities that the Soviet Union committed?? What, does Russia's history of great artists such as Tchaikovsky and their ability to produce world class Olympic figure skaters supposed to justify these atrocities?? There is certainly a lot that the United States is accountable for, and it's incredibly sad to contemplate that large mammals such as rhinoceroses and tigers may become extinct in the wild within our lifetimes, and I'd like to think that there are people working hard to resolve these situations before they come to pass, but I think history has shown that fascist and totalitarian regimes are NOT the answer, even if they are able to produce waterfalls that flow upward against gravity into outer space. So Simmons has to be very careful of any romantic notions, even if based on ignorance, of totalitarian regimes.As a counterpoint to what Simmons has written about instantaneous travel destroying unique cultures, John Barnes has written a novel, A Million Open Doors, where instantaneous travel helps as a check from keeping distant cultures from becoming too extreme and if used judiciously can hopefully help humanity form a united front in case of first contact with an alien sentient species.517 pages, published 1990, 4 stars"},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"Read Hyperion first, there is no other way to begin this roller coaster ride through time and space.

This, and Hyperion, is Dan Simmons best work. The book is so good that unfortunately none of his other work can come close to its greatness (although much of his other work till about 6 years ago) is pretty darn good.

If you love SciFi at its ultimate best (better than Dune) then don't live without it."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"With this book, Simmons has given the reader a book that is a more traditional sci-fi than the first in the series, HYPERION. His vivid character development and world building are still there, but his storytelling style isn't as experimental as in the first book.This book continues almost directly from HYPERION. The time frame picks up almost exactly from the end of the last book. However, the beginning jumps from the planet HYPERION and actually starts in the heart of the Hegemony. This allows the reader to get a closer look into how this world actually works. We are introduced to important players in this world that were only mentioned in the first book. Don't worry, the pilgrims are not forgotten...their stories are fully revealed by the end of the book.This book also explores more traditional themes of sci-fi. One of the big things is the interaction of humans and non-humans (the Ousters and the Core personalities). The conflict is at times subtle, but vivid nonetheless. Simmons gives us a deeper look at the relationship between the Hegemony and the Core itself. We even get to explore the landscape of the megasphere through the journey of one of the characters.Simmons does an amazing job of weaving his differing plotlines and bringing them together at the end for a very satisfying climax. His characters are vivid and interesting. I found myself rooting for some and hating others, but, most of all, it was their realistic interactions that made for interesting reading. All in all, this book left me anticipating the third installment in the epic, ENDYMION."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"Although the pilgrims' stories are wrapped up, in some cases a little too neatly, the book remains largely unsatisfying. Simmons had a lot to live up to based on _Hyperion_, and some measure of disappointment is to be expected. Besides that, though, this book was way too wordy for my tastes. The book simply ran on too long and went into too much detail. Simmons could have saved about 100 pages and managed his readers' interest level better with some judicious editing. Also, infuriatingly, Simmons again misused the word &quot;penultimate&quot; (see page 419) -- this *has* to be an inside joke or something he's doing for a reason!All in all, though, _The Fall of Hyperion_ is still head and shoulders above most science fiction and I'd recommend this installation as well."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"If for some reason you are considering reading this book without first reading Hyperion, STOP and go buy Hyperion to read it first. This book will make no sense to you if you have not already read Hyperion. The Fall of Hyperion is essentially the second half of the story of Hyperion. Neither book would stand on its own, but when you put both books together they make an interesting and well-written story.The first book in this story, Hyperion, provides all the background of why these individuals are on a pilgrimage to see they mysterious and dangerous Shrike - a creature known for its ability to travel through time and tendency to kill people for rather mysterious reasons. The second book, Fall of Hyperion, is written in a completely different style than Hyperion. While Hyperion tells the story of each of the pilgrims on the trip and their motivations, Fall of Hyperion is about the action that is going on in the confrontation between two groups of humans and between AIs. The conflicts that are going on are at points difficult to follow because the timing is not always concurrent. In addition, the activity on Hyperion is being told from the viewpoint of an AI construct who is somehow eavesdropping on the pilgrims on Hyperion. This leads to the story being a little bit on the jerky side, kind of truncated in strange places.Because Hyperion and Fall of Hyperion are in essence one book, I was irritated by the difference between the style of the first book and the style of this book. I can understand the necessity of the changing the style because the style of Hyperion would not have worked for this book. However, since the books are so intrinsically tied together, the style differences seemed disjointed.I clearly have mixed feelings on whether I enjoyed this book or not. I am irritated by the trend in sci fi publishing towards these &quot;two part&quot; books. If neither book has the ability to stand on its own, why should they be published seperately? It doesn't make sense to me. Because the books were published seperately, Simmons apparently felt the need to drop reminders back to things that happened in Hyperion, which was a compete waste of text. To make it clear, I have no problems to books that have sequels. That's fine. This book is in no way a sequel to Hyperion -- it is a part of Hyperion.Assessing this book on its own, I would only give it three stars. However, as part of the Hyperion-Fall of Hyperion story, I would give the books together four stars."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"Hyperion was an inventive, deep and delightful read. I was blown away by the scope, depth and detail of this universe, and by the subtle but powerful literary allusions strewn throughout the book (Hyperion's structure is lifted from the Chaucer's Canterbury Tales and the poetry of Keats infuses the book with soul).The Fall of Hyperion lacks all of these qualities, going instead for a pay-by-the-word space opera. Simmons did maintain the integrity of some of his characters, but it's apparent that he decided against doing the heavy lifting of evolving, transforming and revealing the hidden depths of those characters, something we know he can do by reading the original novel. Instead, he provides a perfectly readable, interestingly plotted but ultimately unfulfilling sequel to one of the best novels of the decade.Read Hyperion. Skip the Fall."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"It's obvious there are a lot of great ideas in this book, but WHEW! what a muddle this is. I still don't get 1) What John Keats has to do with anything. I was expecting a specific REASON why the persona of Keats was chosen by the Stables (or maybe I'm wrong on that??)to be the \\"one who prepares the way.\\" 2) I still don't know who exactly chose the pilgrims and why. To partake in the war against the technocore? 3) Don't get the Rachel story. Why is she aging backwards? Is she in the end going to grow up in the future as Moneta and fight in the war? But in a world of time travel, who needs to become young again to grow old? A total mess. 4) THE BIG REVEAL: The idea of an Utlimate Intelligence AI fighting with GOD is totally laughable. You mean God, or a part of him, actually retreated back in time because he was tired of fighting a machine? Can't God sneeze and the AI UI will crash? The author has some fascinating ideas about God, suffering, and freedom on his mind, but it is so overwrought and nebulous that it frustrates."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"I'm not reviewing the book here, just the Kindle conversion. The book is excellent.Whatever process that was done to recently convert the book to Kindle has some glaring flaws. Typos are everywhere and the same typos occur time and time again.\\"...corn-log's navigational...\\"\\"...their drives off, their corns silenced...\\"\\"The corn-unit element of the...\\"\\"Corn\\" should be \\"com\\", by the way.Every other page has a glaring and disruptive typo that distracts the reader. One or two typos a chapter is fine (even normal), but whoever did this conversion needed to double check the software's work. This book, in this form, should never have been released.Just want to say that I'm not some grammar fanatic either, but it just feels like shoddy work. This excellent book seems amateurish because of these problems.The sequel is the same."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"This book concentrates more on action that in the psycological and philosofical explorations that are essential to Hyperion. Kind of a let-down."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"The Fall of Hyperion is everything that Hyperion is not. Great. Exciting. Thoughtful. Much much better. Hyperion should have been 100 pages at the beginning of this book. We finally have our AI war, the end of the world and God. Everything I look for in a sci-fi novel. The characters that were so boring in Hyperion, really come alive in Fall. I couldn't put it down for my concern for them. Perhaps oddest of all, this is a sequel that surpasses the original. We'll see what the next installment is like. One word of warning, this book is 517 pages and a tiny font. This book is probably really about a 700 or 800 page book with a normal font."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"Hyperion and its sequel tell a story that is rich in detail and astounding in scope. Many complain that they are so very different and Simmons changes his style so drastically. While I cannot argue with the observation, I think the two books are very different and their goal is to tell very different stories. The first is an exploration of a small group of diverse characters learning about each other and the stange common threat that connects them, in a chaucer like group of short stories. The second, however, is a powerful adventure story about social evolution, science, and political intrigue.Different? Yes, but they compliment each other beautifully. If, like me, you were facinated by the universe Simmons created and the issues of how societies form that he explores, than I think you will enjoy reading this. Speaking only for myself, I cannot understand how any one who loved the first could dismiss the second, but you will have to find that out for yourself."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"As interesting as HYPERION was, it certainly was only the setup for a larger story to come. THE FALL OF HYPERION deals with that larger plot, and is just as involving as the first book.THE FALL OF HYPERION is the story of the fall of galactic civlization in a three-way power struggle between humanity, its AI creations the TechnoCore, and a group of human outcasts, the Ousters, who have continued to evolve while the bulk of mankind stagnates under the Core's influence. Dan Simmons again breathe life into his world, and THE FALL OF HYPERION is certainly a book I would recommend to science-fiction fans."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"This book and its predecessor, &quot;Hyperion,&quot; are easily my all-time favorite SF novels, ones I return to every few years, and that never cease to leave me stunned. There is so much here: religious commentary, believable characterizations, a plot that will have your head spinning, literary allusions, humor and slam-bang storytelling. It all serves the story, none of it is affectation or overblown space-opera. It's epic storytelling at its best. Don't miss these books. Buy them, read them, savor them, then read them again."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"My brother gave me this very good book. Thank you brother! I have read less science fiction in recent years, principally because of the difficulty of finding good science fiction. This follow up book to the Hugo Award winning book \\"Hyperion\\" is the best science fiction I have read in some time. I strongly recommend you read \\"Hyperion\\" before reading this book, since this book is the second half of the tale.In the 29th century, mankind is under threat of invasion by the Ousters. An invincible robot-like creature called the Shrike may hold the key to defeating the ousters. However, the Shrike may also be the doom of mankind. Seven pilgrims and one child have journeyed to Hyperion to see the Shrike. We learn that each was selected for various reasons that relate to Hyperion and often to the Shrike itself.In \\"Hyperion\\" we learned the story of each of the Pilgrims. In this book each of the pilgrims encounters the Shrike, and others, in their own way. We finally learn the true nature of Rachel's decreasing age, and learn that Rachel's life is very complex. We also learn the nature of the Shrike and the Technocore. What of the Ousters, on their way to invading Human worlds? Are they prepared to conquer all mankind for reasons we have yet to fathom?\\"The Fall of Hyperion\\" fully reveals the epic started in \\"Hyperion.\\" This incredibly complex story is one of the best science fiction novels I have read in two decades. I compare this novel to Asimov's Foundation Trilogy and to Herbert's \\"Dune.\\" There may be a few slow moments in this book, but those moments are necessary to set up the ending of this incredible novel. Be warned, this story is heavy going and will demand a lot of concentration to get to the end."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"After I finished reading &quot;Hyperion&quot;, it took me a while before I picked up this sequel. I'll admit that I didn't quite know what to think about the story. However, as time passed, I came to appreciate the rich imagery, plot intricacy, and beautiful writing that Simmons employed in the book, and I decided to give this second book a try. I think I ended up reading it in a single weekend.The world that Simmons began to create in the first novel is expanded and enriched, drawing the reader further into its intricacies, and we see the characters introduced previously in increasing depth as they continue their pilgrimage to the Shrike and the Time Tombs. You could easily to go so far as to say that this is really the second half of the story that began in &quot;Hyperion&quot;. If you were intrigued by the first book, or even if you were only mildly interested, go ahead and take the time to read the second half of the story. You'll probably be hooked, and if not, you'll at least have the satisfaction of having read the whole story, rather than just an abruptly terminated beginning."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"This second installment (not an actual sequel) of Simmons' incredible Hyperion saga is every bit as engaging at Hyperion, completes the tale of the Hyperion Pilgrims in a powerful, complex and shattering conclusion.Simmons writing style is excellent for this type of story, he peppers you with the right amount of details that fully immerse you in his world and continues to amaze, delight, evoke sorrow and joy in the best of ways. His literary references are spellbinding for a sci-fi story and he's inventive beyond belief. If only George Lucas was this good.I felt sad when the story ended, because I got so attached to the people, places and events and at the time the next set of book wasn't yet published. However, now Simmons did revisit the world of the Shrike with Endymion and the story can continue. Who says you can't return home again?"},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"The Fall of Hyperion is the sequel to Hyperion. Hyperion, which you should read before diving into Fall, is a wonderful novel containing six independent and fantastic novelettes. After finishing it I knew that it would be difficult for the sequel to even match it and in my opinion Simmons doesn't quite make it. It's close though. Fall answers many of the questions you surely had at the end of Hyperion. You know, all the confusion you felt about the Shrike, the Ousters, the Time Tombs, Rachel and her Merlin's sickness, the Keats cybrid persona, the Templar's erg, etc. Most of it is explained, though you may find some of the explanations unsatisfactory because they're wacky!The quality of Fall's narrative isn't quite as exquisite as that of some of the stories in Hyperion, but it largely makes up for that by providing the big picture that Hyperion lacked. Although Hyperion hinted at important political forces such as the three factions within the Technocore or the impact of the Consul's treachery on the Ousters, the novel focused mostly on the planet Hyperion and its enigmas. In contrast, Fall takes a much wider view of events and about half the novel takes place in other parts of the Web (and even beyond). Fall's main asset is the riveting story told in the context of this wider setting. Events on the planet Hyperion itself are often disjointed and unclear; it's the offworld action that saves this book and nearly elevates it to the prequel's level.At the end I still had a few major plot questions (and I'm currently reading the sequel Endymion to hopefully resolve those), but nothing compared to the number of unanswered riddles the first book ends with. This series would provide great material for lively debate with your sci-fi and fantasy friends, similar to Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series. Simmons really impressed me with Fall and I hope that Endymion continues the trend of providing a great alternate reality to explore. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"These two books, Hyperion and The Fall of Hyperion, have to be read together. In a sense, this confers a sense of commitment to the reading experience. But it is a commitment that is well rewarded. Other reviewers have noted the contrast between the two books. The first one is an exposition in narrative possibilities, while the second is an extension of story telling in one exhaustive direction; for example. I would view the architecture of the books as being continuous. The contrast in the structure of the two books accentuates the more subtle aspects of the series that are unifying: the mood (a bright but very windy day in the dead of an extremely cold winter), the visual detail (at the comprable level of Tolkin), and the residual feeling which lingers days, or perhaps years after one has finished reading the book. In short, this is not a book that one reads for escapism. It takes time to savor. It requires a certain stoicism to go through some very difficult scenes. But it is worth every bit of what a reader puts into it."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"As I begin, I must say I understand some of the negative comments left by a few reviewers complaining about the lack of resemblance between \\"Hyperion\\" and \\"The Fall of Hyperion\\". I guess that if you read them back to back, you might be lost. The Hyperion Cantos is not like \\"Lord of the Ring\\" or \\"Harry Potter\\" in its narrative scheme yet I must say I'm in awe at the way Simmons uses different narrative voices in his books. In \\"The Fall of Hyperion\\", he manages to put a first person narrator who also happens to be omniscient and write at the third person without it being tedious.Apart from this writing technicality, the content itself is of epic proportion. Simmons handles litterature, theology, greek history and science with disconcerting ease. I must say I wasn't prepared for this book. It is much deeper, yes a sci-fi book can carry a deeper message, then I would've anticipated.I only have two bad things to say about this book: one is the container, the other is the content. I read the book in Kindle format and once in a while, there was a missing determiner (such as \\"the\\") which broke the magic between me and the story. I was so engrossed by the book that these mistakes pissed me off. My second point is towards the end of the story. There is a character stranded somewhere and we are left off with him seeing something mysterious. The narrative then goes off someplace else and never comes back there yet we are left some clues about what could have happened yet we are left hanging. Now I got to go read the Endymion series."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"I've read hundreds of sci fi books. Hyperion (5 stars see my review) and The Fall of Hyperion ( 4 1/2 stars) together are a Sci Fi epic and INMO belong in the top 40 sci fi of all time. That's saying a lot!Dan Simmons is a master of character development and has created characters that the reader develops deep empathy with. I was so sad when Colonel Kassad dies hand to hand battling the mysterious, huge Shrike creature. We see Rachel and later baby Rachel given to the Shrike. Poets, Consul and a heavy planet detective. Also intergalactic war with the Ousters only to find out they are not the really bad guys. The AI Core is. They actually destroyed Old Earth with a black hole and more. I wont ruin the book by telling you too much. Just say you are in for a sci fi treat if you read this book.The Fall of Hyperion is over 500 pages and reads fast and well. There were about 15 or so boring pages where the AI head of the core is talking to Keats the poet/cyborg. INMO it slowed the book unnecessarily. The passage was not needed as the rest was explained excellent. Also there area few pages of poetry that INMO was not needed. When I read poetry I slow way down and sometimes read the passage 2 or 3 times to make sure I understand and appreciate what the author is saying. I don't like great sci fi slowed down unnecessarily.The Fall of Hyperion has a great moving ending you will enjoy. The Fall of Hyperion 4 1/2 stars because of the small amount of slow down by the talking back and forth with the AI core leader and Keats and the little bits of slow down poetry.Now reading Endymion by Dan Simmons....a city on Hyperion taking place 247 years after The Fall of Hyperion. I'll review it."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"\\"The Fall of Hyperion\\" is the second part of the Hyperion Cantos, following \\"Hyperion\\". It would be difficult and illogical to try to review these two books separately, because they are clearly two halves of a single story and should be read as such.With \\"The Hyperion Cantos\\" Dan Simmons creates a layered and detailed civilization eight centuries in the future, one of the most stunning and multifaceted histories ever produced by an sf writer. The world of the Hegemony of Man -- a Web that spans the galaxy, connecting planets through 'farcasters' -- is at once incredibly advanced and reassuringly human. You can step through a farcaster portal and find yourself on a different planet, or access the datasphere via your own implanted comlog; at the same time, one of the story's protagonists plays Rachmaninoff on his piano, and drinks Scotch whisky. It is a futuristic world, but not one wholly out of touch with its own history.To this world Simmons brings a story that is just as complex. There is an approaching war between the Hegemony and the Ousters, humans who have adapted to space travel and left the rest of us behind; there are artificial intelligences from the present and future plotting mankind's downfall; there are religious discussions and political machinations; there are copious references to the life and works of John Keats. There is a lot going on in this book.Simmons' greatest feat is in never overwhelming the reader with all this information and plot. The story focuses largely on half a dozen pilgrims on the planet Hyperion, whose mission will decide the fate of the galaxy. The characters are believable and compelling, and it is their own backstories which form the bulk of the first volume. By structuring his story in this way Simmons is able to summarize nearly every trend in science fiction at once: among our heroes is Fedmahn Kassad, a war hero whose story will appeal to fans of military sf; Brawne Lamia, a private detective whose backstory reaches into cyberpunk territory; Sol Weintraub, a scholar trying to find a cure for his reverse-aging daughter. The protagonist of the second volume is a \\"persona\\" of John Keats that has been recreated in a human body.It is a giant of a book, daunting and all-encompassing. It took me some time to work up the courage to read it, actually. It is a masterpiece of science fiction, perhaps one of the greatest novels to address humanity's future and our place in the universe; yet it is also a deeply personal book."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"Almost everyone else who's reviewed this omnibus has given it 5 stars and to be honest, Simmons' scope, breadth and depth of imagination fully deserve a top rating. His universe is mind-boggling, his grasp of modern quantum physics and relativity is very believable (the hawking mats and farcasters are especially novel) and his ability to marry the old (19th century poetry) with the new is unbelievably good. So why 3 stars? Because at times, I found the story overly complex and confusing and as a result, it became turgid, plodding and failed to hold my interest. The book is too long and as I neared the end, I found myself wanting to finish it not because I was desperate to know how it turns out but because I was desperate to get it over with. And after ploughing through 800-odd pages, there's a sense of incompleteness at the end because the really important questions are left unanswered: what is the Shrike? Who built the Time Tombs? Why was Hyperion chosen as the site for the complex and final battle? What happened to Weintraub? What happens to the poor tourists who step through the shining light that hangs in the middle of one of the Time Tombs? Yes I know leaving so many issues unresolved was probably intentional so that readers would go out and buy the Endymion series. However by itself this omnibus, though entertaining enough, just falls short in my view."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"In the next installment of the Hyperion saga, the pace is much faster. A lot of things are happening simultaneously and much more facts and mysteries are revealed. This time the story unfolds being dreamed by a John Keats second retrieval persona. The vastness that this book depicts is amazing. It also made me think and research about artificial and Ultimate intelligence concepts, a really fascinating idea, the latter."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"This is the second in a four part series: Hyperion, Fall of Hyperion, Endymion, and Rise of Endymion. This series has a lot to offer: science fiction, poetry, love, sex, war, intrigue and politics. I was left with questions about what truly does \\"human\\" mean. And what fantastic history lies ahead for us earthlings and our creations."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"Maybe since it goes back to a more usual structure, I was able to follow the story about the fall of humanity, the search for God and the fate of the Pilgrims. Again, Simmons shines as he shows he can blend cyberpunk, space battles, politics, literary apocrypha, poetry, philosophy and more into one exciting stew. The Fall of Hyperion actually made me care about the Fall of the Hegemony and its repercussions.My advice to those who have given up on Hyperion's rather contrived structure, read Fall of Hyperion and I promise you, you'll appreciate Simmons' universe even more."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"'The Fall of Hyperion' by Dan Simmons is the sequel to 'Hyperion'. It is in essence part two of one continuous story. The fate of the Shrike pilgrims is revealed, as are the nature and origin of the Shrike and time tombs.This is a enjoyable sequel that ties up most of the plot lines satisfactorily. Simmons tells a good story, and has created a very interesting future, but the scale is too large, not content with outlining a future several centuries from now, the plot involves not just the ultimate fate of humanity, but the very nature of God himself. It's all a bit much. Definitely a must read if you have read 'Hyperion' but definitely do not read unless you have read 'Hyperion'"},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Dan Simmons' first HYPERION novel, and agree with the assessment that its one of the best SF novels of recent years. FALL OF HYPERION concludes the story begun in the first novel, and it's a very effective, if not brilliant read.As with many SF novels, the main achievment of HYPERION is how Simmons' builds his future world. The Hyperion universe is intricately constructed, and Simmons spends a great deal of time detailing how his world thinks and operates. Simmons is, without question, a highly intelligent author, perhaps even a brilliant one. His universe comes alive in a way that I have rarely seen in a book like this.The only downside of FALL OF HYPERION is the rather plodding nature of the plot, and Simmons tendency to become long-winded in his descriptions. Still, the rather slow-paced middle leads to a rather remarkable ending that I found worthwhile.Overall, a strong read and I look forward to reading the next two installments."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"I enjoyed this book as much as I enjoyed Hyperion. Solid characters. Engaging story line."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"I'm somewhat hesitant to give this book 4 stars, I found it excruciatingly painful with the addition of a new character symbiotically related to whom this book is dedicated. Well, I know more about John Keats than I'd ever planned on knowing now. Although I found this book well-written, there were a few flaws that would make me reconsider my editor if I found them in this book. I saw a few other reviews mention that this book is long in the middle, and I agree. I also detected a slice or two of American cheese in the ending. Other than that, you won't be too disappointed if you read the first novel with its ultimate cliffhanger -- each of the questions in Hyperion are answered here."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"im afraid that this review comes as a bit of a confession! yes, i do read science fiction from time to time... but my god, this book is a stunner.addresses problems like good and evil, powerfully emotive. but i regret that i have given it spur of the moment five stars, since i think actually it merits three, and i dont know how to edit the star rating. it is nonetheless a great read.having time on my hands now... i hope to more appropriately address this book! it addresses a fundamentally important issue: does god use evil and pain as an instigator of these two things, to whatever ends. as a christian, i believe that god has to deal with these things but does not insigate them. it may however be in accordance with Gods purpose that we go through a form of crucifixion or whatever. Jesus for example was 'obedient' in that \\"he humbled himself and became 'obedient' unto death, even the death of the cross\\". of course God does not gain anything but pain himself in allowing us to be afflicted, however it is part of his scheme in moving us towards perfection -\\"that we may be one, even as he is one\\",\\"i in them and thou in me, that they may be perfect in one\\". i quote st Augustine's prayer at the end of \\"de trinitate\\": \\"that augustine may be one even as God is one\\". the goal is a movement towards our perfect oneness in God, and it may just be that suffering is necessary.if we say that suffering is not necessary then all suffering is just a 'waste', a dreadful waste, therefore i have to conclude that it is necessary and taken in grace, of some form of benefit. of course, if we say that suffering may be necessary, we also have to believe that it is unnecessary and unwanted, ie we cannot be blase and apathetic in the face of suffering. the stoics argued that \\"what is meant to be is meant to be\\". in a sense yes, but also clearly these dreadful things are not meant to be... hence the term 'evil'. evil is unwanted and is that which seeks to negate and destroy all that is good... including being itself.God is true love (loving kindness), and does not want suffering... ergo 'the enemy and accuser of the brethren and of all that is good.' we must for our own preservation accept the presence of an anti-god and the prescence of its attribute 'evil'. nonetheless... nature and the cosmos, all creation are somehow still perfect, even in their imperfection. perfectly imperfect. this is because god is the great mender. he can join the pieces back together and can maintain a high degree of order inspite of that which seeks annihilation and destruction.where it gets more difficult is when we assume that God is all powerful. if he is all powerful, then why has he allowed evil and suffering. and yet he is true love! we shall have to wait and see.thank you dan simmons for a hell of a good stomping read! very intelligent. choose again?... yes i would choose this book again.love and respect, snow-flake.xxx"},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"I've not read Dan Simmons before, but after picking up this Omnibus, I'm hooked. I bought it on a whim, and now I'm glad I did. Simmons has a very distinct style and has created a rich fantasy world that is easy to buy into...which I find to be quite rare. I've always been a fan of LeGuin and Atwood, so I demand a compelling 'human' voice in what I read (which is hard to find in sci-fi). And it is even harder to satiate that need when an author bluntly pays homage to some of the most recognized writings in western literature; but Simmons does it quite artfully - which is quite a feat. I promise that if you pick up this book, even if you are only a casual sci-fi fan, you'll quickly find yourself comparing it to some of the greatest books you've ever read."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"\\"The Fall of Hyperion\\" by Dan SimmonsThe pilgrims from Hyperion have finally reached the time tombs, but the Shrike has yet to reveal itself. All that can be done is wait for the Shrike to appear. The War that begun is still Raging in the Skies above Hyperion but the Hegemony is in for a surprise when it finds out there are other targets that the ousters have in mind. This leaves Meina Gladstone the Hegemony leader attempting to find a solution that will lead the hegemony to a safe outcome.This book reads slightly different that the first one as all of the happenings are taking place in the present. With all of the pilgrims tales told in the first book all that is left is for the story to move forward. This is not to indicate that this book is any less enjoyable than the first only that is reads in a more traditional fashion.There are a few more characters introduced that play major roles and evolve the story into something a little larger in scale than the first but Simmons still manages to devote plenty of pages to the remaining, original cast.The Good: Similar good as \\"Hyperion\\" with a similar writing style with a more traditional structure. There is good story development and evolution and the story was enjoyable overall. It is hard to expand without giving away any of the story but if you liked Hyperion you will likely enjoy this book as well.The Bad: Nothing memorable.Overall: Read Hyperion first and if you like it definitely give this one a try."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"I have searched all my life, for the science fiction novel that would rise above the others and truly deserve the description of perfection. Everything I could have hoped for in this book, it had. With it, I truly felt like Hyperion made sense. This book does such an amazing job of building off of its prequel that I felt that I was just reading one book. Never skipping a beat, it jumps right back where you left off, building off the stories relayed in the last book and bringing the significance of each one to the forefront.Where other writers would've just taken the same route to writing a book as with their previous one but Dan Simmons showed his mastery of the genre and pulled another masterpiece off. This book, instead of being just a compilation of short stories, it uses them as stepping stones to produce a great plot. With all the different twists and turns and double crosses this book keeps you guessing. The only thing I can possibly complain about is that there isnt another book in the series!"},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"Hi, I was only 15 when i read this book last year, and it was the best book i ever read! It was great, and even though it was a bit difficult at first (since i haven't read the first book) after a few pages, i began to understand what was happening in the book. I totally enjoyed it, and it's about my favourite book ever. I totally recommend it to anyone. The book just keeps going and going.........like when you feel a book is about to end, and then it takes another turn, throwing you in further(kind of like this review)............ It did that about a zillion times to me, and i began to wonder if the book was ever going to end........ in short i could have said this in 10 words:I am God, i command you to buy the book."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"I thought the review by troy d masters was fair. I was struggling whether to give a 3 or 4 stars, because honestly, I'm not sorry I read the book, it was entertaining and interesting. I suppose my reason for giving a 3 stars is that it was an award winner and I would expect more for that; also some of the themes and issues raised are not handled well enough for me: Abraham's dilemma, the nature of time/space, who's the christ in this story-who's the Shrike? we have to buy the next book to find out(and I may). Being a person who studies the Old Testament, I can assure you, Dan's handling of the Abraham event is shallow in comparison to the way it is handled in the Bible.Another reason is that I have never read Keats, and it seems that this whole story is based on the fact that John Keats was somebody special. I may read Keats after this to see if there is more to it, but I think Simmons' obvious love for Keats could have been \\"in there\\" without being \\"in your face.\\" I like the AI predicting the future idea, it is best handled in Asimov's foundation trilogy, but good here too.Lastly, it is a fun read, I like the Shrike, the space time stuff is cool, some of the connections are good, I just don't find it as deep as it hopes to be. I don't think it matches up with Dune, Foundation Trilogy, 2001 space oddysey, and some of the classics. Which would be hard to do, but I think Simmons stepped out into some deep water when he could have kept it simpler.Having said all that, I may go read Endymion."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"For those readers who reveled in the emotional and intellectual heights of Hyperion, the Fall of Hyperion is quite a let down. In Hyperion, I found the short-story format set within the evolving mystery of the Hyperion war to be among the most engaging styles I have ever read in a novel of this kind. The emotional impact of Sol and Sarai watching their daughter grow young before their eyes, the painful sorrow of Siri's tale and the destruction of Maui-Covenant - just brilliant. In Fall of Hyperion, we see a return to a more conventional style with multiple complex plot lines the reader is forced to alternate between. The use of Severn/Keats as a narrator is puzzling and in my mind detracts from the story. I am still not sure why I should care about Keats, why he was chosen to play such a significant role by the AIs, why we have to read through a detailed descripiton of Keats' return to Rome to die of TB. Then, Keats is used to intervene in critical ways in the lives of the pilgrims - it cheats the storyline of precious credibility. We see the disembodied Keats persona somehow taking physical form by finding symbiosis with the Templar's erg in order to prevent the Shrike from taking Rachel off to some unkown fate? Come on! Pretty ridiculous. I also am not very impressed with the religious philosophizing about the nature of God, but maybe that's just me.On balance, however, the book works, and I will be moving on the Endymion."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"awesome book from an awesome writer too bad th actual story ends with a new one with different characters. Answered some questions but not all..........."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"&quot;hyperion&quot; was one of the few SCI-FI books, i read recently, that realy excite me. it wa different from any story i read before, but it ended without answering any question about all the misterious plots, and the &quot;shrike&quot; - a SCI-FI fredy kruger creature.the sequel answer all of this questions, and produce it's own heros - human heros, who fight againts the shrike.this book is mabee more philosophic then the first one. i must admit i didn't understand most of the mystic stuff about religions and gods, but most other issues were much more understandable.i think the ending was realy good, and this is a realy good ending for the &quot;hyperion&quot; book."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"Hyperion was ok. Mainly because of, as many reviews say, the individual tales of the pilgrims. But, IMHO, it would have been better as a collection of novellas. The bigger story that tied the shorter tales together, which is the sequel's reason for being, should have been scrapped. The Fall has a handful aphorisms (about religion and God) that were so poignant that I just had to highlight them, but they don't make a book of more than 500 pages. Unnecessary sentences, paragraphs and scenes abound. There are too many descriptions of the desert and the sky, which only come off as pretentious, a poor attempt at being literary. The lapis lazuli skies, the vermillion sands, the way the light falls over a rock and whatnot are distracting and stall the story. Even in the middle of the action a character would contemplate about the sky! Ridiculous. Also, a lot of the war room scenes should have been edited out. Has Simmons heard about Hemingway's principle that leaving out a scene will only emphasize it? That a story should be like an iceberg, where there's more than meets the eye? In The Fall's case, it's the exact opposite. Lastly, the pacing and the cliffhanger transition between scenes and chapters (a cheap, trite device) are very much like that of formulaic bestseller thrillers which i stay away from as much as possible."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"Read it if you read that other one but not if you haven't.

Dan Simmons built a science fiction story around the format of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. Men and women are on a pilgrimage to some sort of a shrine and they are telling their stories and in turn it tells the story of the pilgrimage. The novel is perfectly executed and gives a vision of a future where humanity has expanded to the stars and is reliant on AI for much of its transportation and they are unaware of just how reliant they are. There is also a potential invading force of the \\"Ousters\\", humans who do not live the way the \\"Web\\" does. There is a cult of the Shrike on the planet of Hyperion which worships this super-powerful being which does little more than kill and brutalize. But this only hints at the straws of the story of Hyperion. The Fall of Hyperion is the sequel and it picks up with each of the pilgrim stories told. Now we do not have the literary format of Chaucer to fall back on but Simmons instead advances the storylines of his assorted and vast cast of characters at a rapid pace.Things change fast in this book and the reader has to keep up. The Shrike begins picking off the pilgrims one by one, leaving them wondering who is next and how they can reach the Shrike considering they are on a pilgrimage to the Shrike. There is an Artificial Intelligence creation which puts in the body of a man the complete personality of the poet John Keats, only he knows both the life of Keats as well as his own responsibilities and this AI can dream of the events of the pilgrimage as well as interact with the leaders of humanity dealing with the invasion of the Ousters at Hyperion. There is also something deeper and more ominous going on with the AI Core.The Fall of Hyperion is such a vast novel of epic scope that giving a decent description of the plot is difficult without laying out entire plotlines which would then ruin some of the enjoyment of actually reading the novel. Suffice it to say that The Fall of Hyperion is like nothing I have read before and it is outstanding. It is not quite the science fiction genius of Hyperion which gets some of its kudos because of how Simmons ties The Canterbury Tales in with his novel, but Fall is outstanding in its own right. Simmons has a masterful command of the English language and his imagination is second to none. This sequence of novels (which will be continued with Endymion) proves that science fiction can be a genre story as well as be Literature with a capital L. There is an excellence of language and craft here that rises above the genre and would be Literary (meaning that Simmons both tells a story as well as reaches into deeper command of craft and character development, it is a particular style).Well done, Mr. Simmons. Well done.-Joe Sherry"},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"\\"The Fall of Hyperion\\" is another very well-written and highly-detailed exploration into the varied motivations of mankind cast onto a galactic-sized canvass. \\"Hyperion\\" left many questions unanswered, and \\"The Fall of Hyperion\\" addresses most of them. But the sharp, tugging emotion that Simmons wrote into \\"Hyperion\\" is absent this time, replaced instead with linear storytelling that becomes almost (but not quite) tedious. I enjoyed the book, but much of the imagery was hard to comprehend, and the actions of some of the characters were inconsistent with my expectations after the extraordinary story in \\"Hyperion\\".I would not call \\"The Fall of Hyperion\\" a knock-off by any stretch, but I wasn't fully satisfied at the conclusion, and a central character, who becomes the thread that ties everything together, was not developed and deployed as I would have hoped.Still, the world of \\"Hyperion\\" is described in exacting (and breathless) detail, and is worth reading if for this reason alone. And of course, there are more sequels: there is still time to bring it all together."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"While \\"The Fall of Hyperion\\" (FoH) doesn't completely live up to the very high standard set by \\"Hyperion\\" it's still a very good book that I highly recommend to anybody who likes well thought-out and intellingent science fiction.\\"FoH\\" picks up where Hyperion ends, with the Pilgrims exploring the Time Tombs in seach for the enigmatic Shrike, while an interstellar war between the Hegemony and the Ouster erupts. What follows is a highly complex tale of warfare, space and time travel, philosophy, and a lot more.In fact, the story here might be a bit too complex for its own good. Don't get me wrong, for the most part it's a very gripping tale, with some very good twists and surprises, but there's also an awful lot of randomness and things that make little sense or aren't properly explained. I could make sense of the whole interstellar war part, but the dealings between the Shrike and the pilgrims didn't come across as awfully logical most of the time. On the whole though, the sheer originality and scope of the story more than outweighed a couple of holes.This is also one of those rare books where you really care about the characters. Dan Simmons succeeds excellently in bringing to life multi-dimensional, living, breathing characters and a living, breathing world. At several points, the book nearly had me in tears (which is something that rarely happens).For the most part, FoH is also an extraordinarily well written book. It's witty, intelligent, filled with absolutely beatiful prose, and it actually has something to say (there's a very strong message about how humankind carelessly destroys nature around it).There are a couple of times where the author goes a bit overboard though, with endless descriptions of locations and how wonderfully they look. Also, all of the poetry got a bit on my nerves after a while.In the end, this is not as good as Hyperion, but it's still a very worthwhile read. Occasional silliness and the fact that it sometimes drags a bit are easily outweighed by a lot of excellent writing, great characters, and a touching story.**** out of *****"},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"Simmons' conclusion to Hyperion opens a deluge of plotlines and character situations so finely detailed and expertly executed the reading is effortless.The Shrike is a more dominant character in this book and as a result, we see it rip the plotline apart from the inside out--with not a word being said. The explosiveness and pain only hinted at in Hyperion are manifested clearly and demonstrate the ability for words to truly hurt--I cringed more reading this book than I can remember in a long time.The introductoin of active politics and technology virtually unseen in the prior book support the plot as opposed to hindering it; we really get a glimpse behind the pilgramage and the true meaning to the Hegemony of Man.A exciting and adept work for Simmons and a keeper for all SF and non-SF readers!"},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"In The Fall of Hyperion, the sequel to Hyperion, we finally learn what happens to the Shrike pilgrims. The back drop is a stage of galactic turmoil. The Ousters are invading the web of known space, and it looks as if the human hegemony will soon come to an end, and possibly the human race as well. The Shrike pilgrims must risk the wrath of the Shrike as they explore the opening time tombs, or risk the fall of mankind forever.Okay, kinda dramatic, I know. This is a worthy sequel to be sure. Learning the fate of the pilgrims (and especially the fate of little Rachel from the first book) is very worthwhile. Many threads are left open, which I assume will be covered in Endymion and The Rise of Endymion. My only real complaint is that the novel drags on for a while. Dan Simmons seems to have an obsession with John Keats (as he does with Shakespear in Ilium) and tends to ramble a bit. However, Dan Simmons is a fantastic writer who pulls it off well. This is definitely worthwhile if you have read the first book."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"There are comparisons to be made between the epic \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and the first two books of the Hyperion series. The first book of both series is about travelers brought together under dark circumstances, all with a common goal. In \\"Hyperion\\" our pilgrims are on a quest to confront the Shrike, a god like being able to grant great joy and great pain. Each has a different objective and relationship with the Shrike and each knows that they may never return. In the first Hyperion book we hear each of their stories. In the second book \\"Fall of Hyperion\\" we not only see each of their confrontations with the Shrike, we are also exposed (much like in Return of the King) to a great and complex war.The Hegemony (what I assume is a futuristic extension of a democratic earth) confronts the Ousters. The Ousters appear to be evolved humans, rejects at one point in time forced to evolve in dangerous and beautiful ways in the deep of space. The line in the sand for this war is drawn at the edge of the Hegemony, near a planet called Hyperion. As the book progress, however; we soon learn that the Ousters may be the least of humanities problems.This is a complex series of stories. The author, Dan Simmons, goes back and forth between our pilgrims on Hyperion (and their ordeals with the Shrike) to the Ouster threat and then to a nagging feeling that there's something worst. There are also connections to be made to the first book as well. As a result, it's not always an easy read, but it is a very satisfying read. If you enjoy smart science fiction, you should give this Hyperion series a chance."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"The Fall of Hyperion takes the pilgrims, last seen in Dan Simmon's Hyperion telling their Canterbury type tales on their way to a demented Oz, and opens up their stories and lives, in much the way the Time Tombs opens up in the novel. This novel is structered in a more traditional narrative manner but soars on its layers of complexity and riveting characters, particularly the CEO Gladstone fleshed out fully and wonderfully in this novel, among the many fascinating characters. Occasionally the story veers slightly into a new age viewpoint but an edge is added with humour to keep any of these moments from becoming mushy. These two books together form a wonderfully rich science fiction classic that moves from religion to politics to science to fantasy to noir fiction to poetry and back again. A worthwhile journey."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"First, don't even think about reading this book if you haven't read the first part in the series, the Hugo winning Hyperion, since it will make little sense. This incredible sequel answers many of the questions left unanswered in the first novel, though a few riddles still remain. The novel is quite complex and can be hard to follow at times, the poetic references in particular went way over my head, and when the story shifts to the conflict between the various factions of Artificial Intelligences it all becomes quite complex. But this is still a great epic story about the fate of humanity and it's relation with the machines it creates, as well as God's relation with humans. There's time travel, space battles and plenty of adventure, but it never degenerates into the &quot;space opera&quot; type of sci fi. Dan Simmons tells a hell of a tale."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"The strength of Hyperion was its structure, loosely modeled on The Canterbury Tales. The pilgrims' stories were focused, fast-paced, and compelling. The Fall of Hyperion tells several stories at once, stretching across 500 pages. Each time we visit a particular protagonist or subplot, we're given another piece of the puzzle. The problem is that oftentimes the characters enter the stage, make their contribution, and then leave with little or no drama. The novel would have been better served by a more focused, more coherent narrative. Many of the questions raised in Hyperion are answered, but the journey isn't anywhere near as interesting."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"When I reached the end of Hyperion I sat in awe and then began to wonder. What happened to the Pilgrims? What happened the Hegemony? My god, where is the next chapter! I must know.The Fall of Hyperion could easily have been combined with Hyperion into one book. Without having read Hyperion this book will either infuriate you or make you stop in the first chapter and go out and buy Hyperion.For those who have read Hyperion then buying this book is not even something to decide on. It concludes the pilgrimage, explains the fall and enlightens you as to the Core's purpose, the Shrikes reasons and so much more.I don't want to say anymore except get Hyperion, read it and then make sure you have this book right next to you as you read the final page's.One final word is that Dan Simmons has proven to me that a sci-fi work can contain huge ideas and deep characters. I used to read sci-fi for the ideas, I cared little for the characters as they were but pawns presenting ideas. Now Hyperion and Fall of Hyperion have shown me that the characters can be and are even more important."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"And this book knocks 'em over. I love reading stories in which &quot;everything you know is wrong&quot;. Simmons takes the characters and events recounted in &quot;Hyperion&quot; and swallows them whole in a tale that had me scraping my brains off the back wall. The introduction of M. Severn and Meina Gladstone makes for two of the more fascinating and deep characters I think I've ever read. The former is a cipher, reflecting the events taking place hundreds of light-years away (those of &quot;Hyperion&quot;) and interpreting them through a dead poet's thoughts. The other is a master politician, leader of a Hegemony that encompasses more billions of souls than almost is comprehensible. The sacrifices they both make to save themselves save humanity itself, but at a terrible price.Some sections of the book are slow (I found the myriad battles with the Shrike tedious) the majority of the tale is fast moving, incredibly rich and believable, and astounding in its plot and details. This book and its predecessor are simply two of the finest works of literature in any genre, and are utterly entertaining.I've handed copies of the &quot;Hyperion&quot; books over to probably 20 friends over the last 8-9 years, and had never had any of them returned to me. I don't care ... these books are *that* good."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"Dan Simmon's \`The Fall of Hyperion' is not a sequel, but rather the second half of the unfinished story, \`Hyperion'. While \`Hyperion' was unique in its six wonderful tales as told by six people on a pilgrimage, \`The Fall of Hyperion' is more conventional, but is a real page-turner.\`The Fall of Hyperion' explains what happens to our travelers and delves into the purpose of the Shrike. It also expands greatly on the fairly thin plot exposed in \`Hyperion'. Most readers should enjoy this well-conceived and engrossing end to the story. Together, \`Hyperion' and \`The Fall of Hyperion' rank up there with the best science fiction has to offer and I give it 9 out of 10, or a five star ranking. However, because the reader is required (unknowingly) to purchase both books, I give each book 8 out of 10 and a four star rating.Those who have forsaken \`The Fall of Hyperion' because it requires another purchase, are missing a rewarding experience. Those who have not yet read the Hyperion series are in for a treat. It is worth every penny of the two-book purchase price."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"I'll spare you the synopsis. I was first skeptical of the odd looking cover and the interest in learning about the Seven Pilgrims, but Dan Simmons writes with breath-taking ferocity. The Hyperion series is the horrifying, wonderous, enchanting obsessive-stay-up-all-night to read thriller that I had been looking for, for years. The storyline unfolds in so many satisfying ways, the truth is always a chapter away. Hyperion's world is as rich as any other I've ever encountered. It is Asimov's Foundation with the kiddie gloves off. It's like the first 2 books of Dune before it gets weird with Leto II. ( You know what I mean) But I shall dare say this.Hyperion is better.Way better.It is beautiful, brutal, incredible, satisfying and deserving of every sci-fi fan's adoration. It was amazing enough for me that I'm actually here writing a review imploring you to not only buy this book, but buy it NEW so that Dan Simmons can get rewarded with your hard earned money. Or you can be a miser and say to hell with Dan Simmons. Whatever the case, just buy this book. (It has the first two \\"Hyperion\\" and \\"Fall of Hyperion\\".) And pick up Endymion and The Rise of Endymion while you're at it. Now!!!! (Click)"},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"I enjoyed &quot;Hyperion&quot; (see my 4-star review) and, upon finishing, I eagerly started &quot;The Fall of Hyperion&quot;. I was anxious to find out the fate of our brave pilgrims. 500 pages later, I didn't even care about them anymore.Rather than focusing on the characters in the first book that I had grown to care so much about, in &quot;Fall&quot;, the author follows two new main characters that are not well developed, and tend to be only passive observers of the universe around them. Also, the style of this sequel is very different from the first book. Every chapter ends in a cliffhanger, and the next one picks up with a different character's story. Used sparingly, this technique can build suspense, but here it is irritating. There were many times when I was tempted to just skip ahead so I could follow a particular storyline. In general the writing feels sloppy and rushed.Another annoying aspect of &quot;The Fall of Hyperion&quot; is the overabundance of exposition and explanation. Not only does Simmons waste dozens of pages, recapping the events of the first book, he even recaps things that happened 100 pages earlier in this&lt; book. The whole thing could have been edited down to 100 pages, and tacked on as a final section of &quot;Hyperion&quot;.All this being said, there are some exciting moments every once in a while, and it's nice to learn how the story of &quot;Hyperion&quot; ends. Still, I can't say it was worth suffering through all the filler. I don't think I'll be progressing any further in this series."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"'Fall of Hyperion' follows the style of an epic which can be read on many levels. It is an analysis of John Keats's poetry, the relationship of God and Man, whether there is a God at all, and the purpose of human suffering all at once--and this to name just a few. I do not think it should be judged in comparison with the first book, as they are both extremely different in structure. 'Hyperion' is a tight novel centering on the past lives of the pilgrims, while 'Fall of Hyperion' is an intricately woven tapestry much akin to epics such as 'Dune'. Both are ingenious in their respective approaches to theme and character.The new character viewpoints, Severn and Paul Dure, are well-developed, and Meina Gladstone is a tragic gem of characterization. The other characters undergo trials that stretch them to the limits, and lend a glimpse into the fragility of humankind. My only complaint is Kassad, who never feels real, though the author obviously admires him very much. His relationship with Moneta was a disappointment to me, as it never developed beyond sex, yet is referred to as 'love'. I didn't see it, and therefore didn't buy it.'Fall' contains the same trauma and horror from 'Hyperion', on a deeper and larger scale, making some scenes intensely painful to read. But with the pain comes a massive wellspring of emotion which, though still painful, is ultimately a pain which shapes and refines. Simmons is unafraid to go where other authors dare not, and for that he is deserving of praise. The action is such that there is never a slow moment, and the surprises are endless. Without question, Simmons knows how to weave a story.The multiple themes running through this book are difficult to follow. Somehow Simmons meant to tie the poetry of John Keats with questions relating to the nature of God and humanity, but this is done with such complicated strokes that the book probably needs to be re-read many times to be fully appreciated. I for one developed an interest in Keats as a result of reading this book--not to mention an affection for 'Mister John Keats, five feet high'."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"I'm somewhat surprised by some of the reviews for the Hyperion series, especially the latter two, Endymion and Rise of Endymion. I agree that Hyperion and Fall of Hyperion are the /slightly/ stronger of the four, but again they are the foundational works which support the rest of the series, which branches off into a more ornate, but steadfast, structure. Looking at the structure of the Hyperion saga as a whole, both as science fiction and as literary fiction, few stories come close to matching the width and depth of Simmon's conceptualization of the future.Sci-fi ornamentation aside, much of the saga's strength lies in it's most literary qualities. The plot is epic and the characters are depthful and realistic, but Simmons raises the bar a notch above the average space opera's best, weaving a rich tapestry of allusion and parallelism that would challenge literary fiction's finest offerings.Stylistically, Simmons writes with detailed clarity and a dry sense of humor that underpins every book in this series. While the story may bog at times during the particular verbose descriptions of the latter stories, the pacing is never derailed. Necessarily with any work of fiction, there are miniscule lapses of continuity and logicality. (What /did/ happen to Leigh Hunt?) But I would argue that these nits are so glaring only because the whole of the series is so well-implemented. To remain quotable, the saga is a spectacular tour-de-force, breathtaking in scope with heart-touching characters. Please read these books."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"My brother gave me this very good book, which collects the Hugo Award winning book \\"Hyperion\\" and \\"The Fall of Hyperion.\\" The two books are two parts of a single story and need to be read together, which makes this omnibus invaluable. Thank you brother! I have read less science fiction in recent years, principally because of the difficulty of finding good science fiction. These two books are great if you like science fiction that requires concentration and analysis.In the 29th century, mankind is under threat of invasion by the Ousters. An invincible robot-like creature called the Shrike may hold the key to defeating the ousters. However, the Shrike may also be the doom of mankind. Seven pilgrims and one child journey to see the Shrike. In \\"Hyperion,\\" we learn that each pilgrim was selected for various reasons that relate to Hyperion and often to the Shrike itself.After the pilgrims have gathered on a treeship, a spaceship as bizarre as any I have seen described in science fiction, the pilgrims each tell their stories in turn. Since some of the stories are quite lengthy, the stories continue after the pilgrims land on Hyperion and journey to the Time Tombs. Each story explains the background of the pilgrims, the political situation and history of mankind up to the 29th century, and gives intriguing backgrounds to the pilgrims. I generally found the stories interesting, though the story of the poet was the most boring, at first. The poet's story becomes more interesting as it nears the end, and we learn in \\"The Fall of Hyperion\\" that the poet's story is critical.I found many aspects of this novel interesting and unique. There are the people who follow the crucifix; people who may potentially live forever. There are the catacombs below Hyperion. Who built the catacombs and what is their purpose? What is the nature of the Shrike, including its incredible power to manipulate time? How did Rachel come grow younger each day after an encounter with the Time Tombs? What does the artificial intelligence Technocore have to do with the Ousters and the Shrike? This book asks many more questions, and the journey through \\"The Fall of Hyperion\\" will provide the answers.As the pilgrims journey to Hyperion and then to the Time Tombs on Hyperion, the Ousters approach Hyperion, and the pilgrimage becomes a race against time. Rachel continues to grow younger each day, approaching the date of her birth. What will happen to Rachel then?In \\"Hyperion\\" we learned the story of each of the Pilgrims. In this book each of the pilgrims encounters the Shrike, and others, in their own way. We finally learn the true nature of Rachel's decreasing age, and learn that Rachel's life is very complex. We also learn the nature of the Shrike and the Technocore. What of the Ousters, on their way to invading Human worlds? Are they prepared to conquer all mankind for reasons we have yet to fathom?\\"The Fall of Hyperion\\" fully reveals the epic started in \\"Hyperion.\\" This incredibly complex story is one of the best science fiction novels I have read in two decades. I compare this novel to Asimov's Foundation Trilogy and to Herbert's \\"Dune.\\" There may be a few slow moments in this book, but those moments are necessary to set up the ending of this incredible novel. Be warned, this story is heavy going and will demand a lot of concentration to get to the end.I enjoy a challenging science fiction book, and these two books are challenging. The novels are Dickensian in complexity. Read this omnibus only when you have the time and desire to read a story that requires intense concentration and analysis."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"I have already praised Dan Simmons in my review of Hyperion. It is clear that he is intelligent and has a knack for blending things together. I wanted to say this to remind the reader that though the majority of my comments are negative, it is only because I had such high expectations after Hyperion.Hyperion was incredibly original and well-constructed. There is a hint of innovation in the Fall of Hyperion, but this seems primarily a shallow mask for the necessary linearity of the novel. This is basically the conclusion to Hyperion, where Simmons has to explain everything that was introduced in the other book. And if you read Hyperion, you have to read this book, no matter what. I should not be able to convince you otherwise and will not attempt to do so.I guess what annoyed me most about this book was the amazing complexity. It must have taken a lot of effort to put this together, but you wonder if maybe Simmons added too many layers. Things brushed over in one chapter could be the subject of entire books. Explanations were hasty and fairly uncreative. Typically, an author reveals elements about the universe through the story without flat out telling it to the reader, making the reader become aware of things without him/her knowing that it was the author's intent. However, in Simmons' rush to cram so much information into this one novel, I felt like he was talking to me and not telling a story. Furthermore, it was very strange at some points. You expect a science fiction novel to be weird, but some of the stuff in here was really weird. My advice is to accept it and move on, even if it seems absurd to the point of stupidity.Overall, I would say that the pace at the beginning is normal, but towards the end is just a blur. Revelations and curveballs come from leftfield to reach the conclusion. Still, the story is solid, and any reader of Hyperion will not be more than mildly disappointed, if disappointed at all."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"Hyperion, artistically, is one of the craftiest novels I've ever read. Fall Of Hyperion was different in style, but I think I found it more entertaining.In Hyperion, Simmons' format was the short story, where we were given each of the pilgrim's different tales, one at a time. By the end of each story you are intensely caught up in that pilgrim, and can't wait to see what happens to him (or her) next. But then Simmons is pretty much done with that character for the rest of the book, and moves on to the next with similar result. The waiting was agony- a true credit to his masterful ability.In Fall of Hyperion (which is more like a normal novel), we finally find out what is in store for our pilgrims, and it was well worth the wait! Now he switches back and forth between each of the main characters on a regular basis, revealing a little more each time. Normally, when you have this many main characters, you find yourself bored by some, and can't wait to get back to others- In Fall Of Hyperion, I enjoyed each of them, almost equally, for one very smooth-paced, entertaining read.The two books, together, make an amazing duology, with everything solved rather nicely by the end... Which leaves me quite curious as to what we will see in the next two!"},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"I would like to start this review by highly recommending the first book in this series (Hyperion). That remains one of the best Sci Fi novels I have ever read and I have read a lot of Sci Fi in my life.Having said that, it is difficult for any book to compare. In this case even the author himself has failed to write a book that can withstand comparison. But since it is a sequel to the first book I do think it is fair to stand one against the other.The Fall of Hyperion has a fantastic plot that could have beautifully filled about 150 pages. Unfortunately the book is 517 pages and a big chunk of that was painfully retelling the story of the first book. That is a good thing if you were reading this as a standalone but it is tedious if you have already read the first book. I went into \\"skim mode\\" in order to get to the important parts (a clear indication that a book is bloated).I think that there were too many stories being told at once with no one story being fully developed. We read about the unfolding of events from the perspective of at least 1/2 dozen characters (sometimes as 3rd person observer of events and sometimes reading the thoughts of the characters). I can see what Dan was shooting for here and it was ambitious but in the end it became a distraction. Since the unfolding plot is told from multiple POVs the story winds up being told more than once.Overall this is not a bad book but it is very long and repetitive. The plot is complex and fascinating but you may find yourself skimming entire chapters to get back to the plot development."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"I'll just come out and say it. I don't get the appeal of the Hyperion books. I didn't even bother finishing this one. It lost my interest. I kept pushing through, it did nothing to regain my interest, and I put it down for good without finishing it.I wasn't a big fan of the first book, but at least it got me to read it through. Maybe thats the problem here. I tried reading the second book when I was already spent from having made myself read the first.If you're looking for good science fiction, go elsewhere. The Hyperion books are just pulp fiction. Nothing really new. Nothing original. The writing itself wouldn't stand up outside the genre, so don't read it for that either.I've read more than my fair share of science fiction. Some books stand apart as not only great science fiction, but great fiction, and can be compared outside the genre. Other books lack the writing skill that would make it great fiction, but still are well done and put forward new ideas or concepts. Those are the books I'm typically looking for in sci fi. A new take on things, a new idea, a new perspective. You won't find that here.Instead go pick up: any of the Foundation books, the Forever War, The Eternity Brigade, or any of a number of others you'll find in the same lists as Hyperion, but that actually provide something worth thinking about. The Hyperion books don't even stand up to classic pulp sci fi. I've read and re read so many old sci fi publications that its kind of embarrassing. Even those were more than this book. Those stories, while often lacking writing skill, were filled with new takes and scenarios and ideas.Oh, and if you're just looking for something to read regardless of genre, I'd suggest: The Shadow of the Wind, Shogun, or the Once and Future King. Just to name a few."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"Basically, it didn't flow very well. Elements worked and others felt contrived to fill space. In fact I felt like skipping over paragraphs in places which is something I rarely do."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"Reading these two novels (published in one volume) was something of an emotional rollercoaster. At times I hoped for it to end, and I wanted to put the book down rather than continue experiencing the anxiety and hardships these characters endure. Other times I was fascinated by the universe Dan Simmons created, or inspired by the bond the characters built through shared adversity.To produce such an empathetic response from the reader was probably one of the better results Simmons could have hoped for. One of the overall themes of the story is after all Human Empathy. In any case, this work contains much to reflect on. It is not quickly or easily digested, which is something one could say about too few Science Fiction novels.There are some weak points, such as the dependence of one plot on the early 90's obsession with virtual universes and cyberspace. Otherwise, this is an impressive achievement. The descriptions of the many human colonized planets, the strange Time Tombs, and the Shrike itself create very striking visuals in the imagination. (I am grateful to have read an edition with suitably abstract cover art, rather than the hopelessly literal artwork found on the covers of the mass market editions.) For some like me, Hyperion is also an interesting opportunity to learn more about the poetry of John Keats!One could easily imagine this story as an allegory for our current cultural and social conditions on Earth. The citizens of this fictional Hegemony of the far future have adapted to the convenience of nearly instantaneous travel and communication between extremely distant locations. Thanks to their dependence on this \\"Farcaster\\" technology, they consider themselves one population, rather than hundreds of different groups separated by vast light years in distance. Likewise, some part of our human population on Earth has adapted to the instant communication made possible by our Telecom and Internet infrastructure, and the quick travel made possible by the burning of fossil fuels for air travel. The resulting implications of this dependence may be very similar."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"Don't expect Fall of Hyperion to be anything like the 1st book, Hyperion. The format is different, the writing style is different, and the overall effect is different. I finished it to see if it would somehow get better, but it didn't. I was a bit disappointed."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"People will often compare this follow up to Hyperion in a somewhat negative light. I found this to be just as enjoyable as the previous novel in fact I certainly wanted to know what was going to happen to our pilgrims ending the first book heading down into the valley of the glowing tombs singing &#34;off to see the wizard&#34;. There were some parts of the book which dragged a bit but overall there was enough of a compelling plot to keep you very interested. I am quite the slow reader and became so engrossed in this story that I finished it in about a week and a half.

BUT, I think it is immature and inappropriate for Simmons to start blasting cultures as he does in these series. I am, ofcourse, talking about his portrayal of Muslims in his series. I find it deeply offensive that a writer especially one who targets the sci-fi group of readers would allow such low prejudiced ideas into a series, which, in the end, have no real connection to real life. for that I have given this book a 3, as far as the general story though, it is a stunning example of sci-fi."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"Hi, Dan here.As the astute among you must have noticed that I ran out of material towards the end of the first book. However, financial considerations (greed) kept me going. I even told my publisher that I can put the end in the first book but he called me an @#$%^%$ and told me to get with the program.Therefore while reading this book, you will notice that I list almost every character's name (regardless of how minute a role he or she plays). I actually thought about listing the names of all the planets and the entire 200 billion residents of the web worlds, but I need material for my third book.However, I was able to introduce 200 billion Cliff-hangers in this book. The linear narrative that was the strength of the first book needed me to come up with an actual story. So instead I decided to describe everything from controls of a ship, to the clothes that people are wearing at all times, to the weather of all the planets. And as soon as something interesting started happening in the book, I had to end the chapter and take you through at least 50 pages of mind #$%^. You see, this gave me the material I needed to fill the pages.Also, since the first book was a hit, my publisher assured me, that regardless of what garbage I put in this book, this will be sold and read by mindless self congratulatory drones everywhere, people who wouldn't know good science fiction if it were standing right in front of their huge noses.In the end, my kids thank you for buying this book.Sucka...."},{"Title":"THE FALL OF HYPERION","review":"I have 20/20 vision and I found it exceedingly difficult to read the miniscule print in the paperback edition....The font is so small my eyes hurt after a handful of pages."},{"Title":"Animalia: Thirteen Small Tales","review":"Where do I begin?

We very much enjoyed Berger's other book, \\"Thunder Bunny\\" and this did not have the kind of Margaret Wise type prose that made \\"Bunny\\" such a hit.

By far, the book that I referred to the most was &quot;The Complete Idiots Guide . . .&quot; Not only did it hit all of the major cities that I wanted to go to (London, Paris, Venice) but it told me important information: tourist traps to avoid, scams that take place, and money and time-saver advice, and the things not to miss. It is easy to read, and it is the only book that gives you several recommendations for both hotel and restuarants with price guides, phone numbers, and directions. The other tour books were just to general for me, I needed information on where to stay, where to eat, the currency rates, what to see, and what to avoid. I saved so much money staying in the big cities off the beaten path and not paying tourist prices. The time-savers where wonderful and I never waited in a single line in Paris for any attraction. For someone who is on a limited budget and limited time and wants to see the things that they have always heard about, this is the book.

I think it was very courageous of Ms.Thomas to tackle an issue that society thinks is \\"taboo\\" to discuss, but she did it in an excellent and thoughtful manner. Had I not endured the same thing, I would not have been able to relate as well, but I understand her pain oh so well.And I also applaud the way that it only took her a year to open herself up to love again, it took me 11 years to even admit that it happened to me. And that was ONLY AFTER I accepted Christ into my life and forgave myself and the guy. The love that Jackson exhibited towards Bran had me holding my breath until the end of each chapter. His patience and his willingness to wait, even on their wedding night, almost had me in tears. I did not agree with how she kept the secrets from him though and until he did the same with Monique, I totally agreed with his anger towards her for keeping Martin's re-emergence a secret.It was also refreshing for an author to show us how things progressed after the marriage. Oftentimes, stories end at the happy ending and we are left wanting more and wondering what happened, but this one answered all of that by giving us the opportunity to follow them all the way to their 1-year anniversary and beyond. I just purchased Carrie's story (Forever Always) and will follow them accordingly after that.Ms. Jackson has been making me happy long before I knew that she had fiction stories that were in a series (I have read all her Christian inspired books).

So the legend was printed, to paraphrase John Ford. Forty-niners gone astray, John Brier & William Lewis Manly, provide their own powerful narrations from when they found themselves trapped there, the first white men to witness its terrifying and dispiriting sights. Prospectors like Shorty Harris and promoters like George Graham Rice share their polished, yet engaging, accounts, as do editors of newspapers from the camps. They're joined by a host of flimflamming publicists eager to cash in on the crazes in the later 19th and earlier 20th century surrounding hoaxes, self-dramatizing forays after lost mines, Death Valley Scotty's mendacity, and the Bullfrog discovery. Yarnspinners and poetasters-- the best being Paul DeLaney surviving the summer's heat and Sydney Norman's debunking of Scotty-- round out the breathless array of selections.It's a handsome volume, but it would have benefited from a more detailed map than the dated, single inset one prefacing the book. I also wish more period illustrations had been interspersed throughout, instead of only at the start of each chapter. Also, the editorial material's very slim, a short introduction to the collection and brief notes prefacing the selections offering not much explanation or context for the entries. While these do often speak for themselves, the editors could have assisted the reader who does not know fact from fiction here.For the truth, Lingenfelter's standard 1986 history, \\"Death Valley & the Amargosa,\\" gives you in exhaustive but not exhausting detail a well-told in-depth survey; John Soennichsen's \\"Live! From Death Valley\\" entertains with a personal travelogue that captures the sense of the terrain from a modern perspective. (Both works reviewed by me on Amazon and this blog recently.) This subsequent anthology, on the other hand, revels in the rather dated, inflated and hyperbolic styles of the past. These types of stories made the impressions on those who never came within a thousand miles of the desert what it \\"must\\" have been like, in all its romance, horror, and hyperbole. Some of these impress-- the harrowingly detailed yet efficiently sketched forty-niner Manly or Brier's eloquence humbles you, when one realizes the limited formal education such men likely had, and how well they used their ability to tell a gripping first-person survival account better than any \\"reality\\" t.v concoction.John Brier sums it up: \\"One tires of writing about yielding sand and impeding scrub, so effectual in stretching distance and consuming strength and time.\\" (33) Either the teller begins to risk tedium by being honest, or conceit by being imaginative. Endless pages of despair don't hold one's attention; ghosts, skeletons, glitter, and wild Indians do. These rhetorical flourishes, set to separate elsewhere fools from money, or at least audiences from spare change for a paper, may wear down the contemporary reader, but they do provide an insight into how the popular press plays upon fads and puffs up trends.

Although it was hot (114 deg.) when I was there, it was tolerable. With plenty of water, a hat and suncreen, a person will do OK. The best time to go though, is in Jan/Feb. when the temperature is around 80 deg. This book is wonderful for the armchair traveler, too.M. S.

In the first place, it isn't so much a book about 'Melancholy' (or abnormal psychology, or depression, or whatever) as a book about Burton himself and, ultimately, about humankind. Secondly, it isn't so much a book for students of the history of English prose, as one for lovers of language who joy in the strong taste of English when it was at its most masculine and vigorous. Finally, it isn't so much a book for those interested in the renaissance, as for those interested in life.Burton is not a writer for fops and milquetoasts. He was a crusty old devil who used to go down to the river to listen to the bargemen cursing so that he could keep in touch with the true tongue of his race. Sometimes I think he might have been better off as the swashbuckling Captain of a pirate ship. But somehow he ended up as a scholar, and instead of watching the ocean satisfyingly swallowing up his victims, he himself became an ocean of learning swallowing up whole libraries. His book, in consequence, although it may have begun as a mere 'medical treatise,' soon exploded beyond its bounds to become, in the words of one of his editors, &quot;a grand literary entertainment, as well as a rich mine of miscellaneous learning.&quot;Of his own book he has this to say : &quot;... a rhapsody of rags gathered together from several dung-hills, excrements of authors, toys and fopperies confusedly tumbled out, without art, invention, judgement, wit, learning, harsh, raw, rude, phantastical, absurd, insolent, indiscreet, ill-composed, indigested, vain, scurrile, idle, dull, and dry; I confess all...&quot; But don't believe him, he's in one of his irascible moods and exaggerating. In fact it's a marvelous book.Here's a bit more of the crusty Burton I love; it's on his fellow scholars : &quot;Heretofore learning was graced by judicious scholars, but now noble sciences are vilified by base and illiterate scribblers.&quot;And here is Burton warming to the subject of contemporary theologians : &quot;Theologasters, if they can but pay ... proceed to the very highest degrees. Hence it comes that such a pack of vile buffoons, ignoramuses wandering in the twilight of learning, ghosts of clergymen, itinerant quacks, dolts, clods, asses, mere cattle, intrude with unwashed feet upon the sacred precincts of Theology, bringing with them nothing save brazen impudence, and some hackneyed quillets and scholastic trifles not good enough for a crowd at a street corner.&quot;Finally a passage I can't resist quoting which shows something of Burton's prose at its best, though I leave you to guess the subject: &quot;... with this tempest of contention the serenity of charity is overclouded, and there be too many spirits conjured up already in this kind in all sciences, and more than we can tell how to lay, which do so furiously rage, and keep such a racket, that as Fabius said, &quot;It had been much better for some of them to have been born dumb, and altogether illiterate, than so far to dote to their own destruction.&quot;To fully appreciate these quotations you would have to see them in context, and I'm conscious of having touched on only one of his many moods and aspects. But a taste for Burton isn't difficult to acquire. He's a mine of curious learning. When in full stride he can be very funny, and it's easy to share his feelings as he often seems to be describing, not so much his own world as today's.But he does demand stamina. His prose overwhelms and washes over us like a huge tsunami, and for that reason he's probably best taken in small doses. If you are unfamiliar with his work and were to approach him with that in mind, you might find that (as is the case with Montaigne, a very different writer) you had discovered not so much a book as a companion for life."},{"Title":"Accessible Access 2000","review":"You want to use MS Access 2000 to build a database, that much you know, but where to start and what to learn, you don't know !The two authors will answer that question by their selection of features to learn to give the reader a solid working knowledge of Access, and by acting as a filter they enable the reader to focus 100 % on learning. They don't base their selection on what is easy to learn, but which of Access' intimidating abundance of features and possibilities you need to know.The book is divided into 3 parts, the first part covers how to make use of Wizards and automation in developing the 4 basic objects of every database: Tables, Queries, Forms and Reports. Part 2 expands on these topics and will teach you how to design the objects without the wizards, and part 3 covers the more complex parts in a database design and how to make all the objects work together.To accompany this book I strongly recommend \\"Inside Relational Databases\\" (ISBN 354076092X) to learn about database design and theory, and \\"Running Microsoft Access 2000\\" (ISBN 1572319348) to learn more about the software, its features and how and when to make use of them.With this book, compared to other computer books, you do not end up with a book that tries to be everything for everyone but is nothing for no one, but a book that's perfect for the Beginning/Intermediate user that wants to build a solid framework before moving on to the more advanced parts of Access databases and the 1000+ page reference books."},{"Title":"Accessible Access 2000","review":"I bought three books to try to learn Access and it was just like The Three Bears. Using Access 2000 (Que) was too big--a complete reference that will allow me to master Access in about 3 years. Quick Course in Access 2000 (Microsoft) was too little--really just an overview. But this book was just right. It has a CD with one or more files for each chapter to work on. Part I is the introduction and then Part II is the overview section with chapters on the database window, tables, queries, forms and reports, primarily using wizards. Part III goes into each of those topics in more depth. Part IV covers more complex databases. I found it easy to go from the overview chapters in Part II to the detail chapters in Part III and then skip to the more advanced topics in Part IV when I needed to. This is the book to teach yourself from. Then you can go to the Papa Bear books."},{"Title":"Accessible Access 2000","review":"I just happened to see this book on the shelf and it was quite smaller than the other access 2000 &quot;telephone books&quot; beside it. This book is written by one of the original program archectects of Microsoft Access was it was first invented.A WONDERFUL read, IDG should have bought out the contract and had this book as their Access for Dummies. Eventhough IDGs version is good, this is shoulders above the rest.The authors share with you how to master and UNDERSTAND the basic features so you can get going with the program. They even state in the book that they only cover the 20% of all the features and want to make sure you understand the 20% first BEFORE grabbing the &quot;phonebooks&quot;. Like they said, if you don't know the basics inside and out, the rest will be a waste of your time. Wonderful, personable read. bravo"},{"Title":"Accessible Access 2000","review":"Highly recommend: simple enough for novice database users to understand without insulting our intelligence.

If you time is limited and you only want to buy one book to go through entry level with Access, this is the one. How about going from nothing to putting together multi-table databases with average queries within a week. It took two days to digest the book and three days of practice. (I'm not a programmer either. I had Fortran and Basic 20 years ago, and have seldom used them.) The style is easy to read. The author's present only those pieces of information you need at entry level; shielding you from the mind numbing detail in the Access &quot;bibles&quot;. The only derogatory comment would be that their example problems seem lacking, but that seemed a minor point compared to the clarity of the explanations."},{"Title":"Accessible Access 2000","review":"After I started reading the humongous &quot;Special Edition: Using Access 2000&quot; Book by Que, I had to look for another book. That book was hard to follow and understand. After reading the good reviews for this book, &quot;Accessible Access 2000&quot;, I decided to check it out. I am on Chapter 8 now, and so far, the book is very easy to follow and understand. If you have to buy one Access book, I highly recommend this one! You won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Accessible Access 2000","review":"This book will give you a superb start in Access, including versions later than 2000 (with the exception of web pages, covered in their new edition which is to be published shortly). It is thoughtfully written, with a pleasant and relaxed tone which eases the way greatly, plus a gentle wit which surfaces every now and again.The organization of this book, while unusual, turned out to be an approach which really grew on me: it's organized into three parts, EACH part covering tables, forms, queries, and reports, but each successive part covering them all at more depth. It would be the equivalent, let's say, of taking a three-semester course in Beginning Access, each semester giving you a well-rounded overview of Access as a whole, but building your skills progessively. (Another advantage of this approach, I suppose, although it didn't apply in my case, would be that if you are other than a rank beginner to Access, you could hop in at either the second or third part if they better suited.)I also found the balance of theory and practical application just about right. Personally, I don't like going through step-by-step tutorials (and infact, didn't bother here) but I found the accompanying screen shots useful never the less (and, again, I used this book to learn the 2003 version).In short, recommended without reservation. I now have two virtually completed databases which are functioning as I had hoped. My only wish is that Messrs. Whitehorn and Marklyn had published a follow-up book to take me from here into the far more advanced features such as automation with VBA, as I felt in good hands indeed with this book."},{"Title":"Accessible Access 2000","review":"this book is useless...I bought it along with two other Access books and immediately sent it back and of course A-.com ripped me off by refunding only 50% of the price...pathetic!"},{"Title":"Cosmos Earth and Man: A Short History of the Universe","review":"Preston Cloud (1912-1991) was an American paleontologist, geographer, and professor, best-known for his work on the geologic time scale and the origin of life on Earth.He states in the Preface, \\"This book is a distillation, in simple terms, of some aspects of what I think I have learned from a lifetime of research, reading, and reflection about our planet, its history and cosmic connections, the development of life on it, and its capability to sustain our descendants.\\" He adds, \\"What I try to do here is to relate the story of the co-development of Earth's air, water, crustal rocks, climate, and life in cosmic perspective as a vantage point from which to view the present state and future prospects of mankind.\\"Evolution is, of course, a major concern of Cloud's. He states, \\"It is a mistake to equate the fact of biological evolution with the problem of the mechanism or mechanisms that may have brought it about. The question is not whether evolution happened but how it happened. How did the descendants of common ancestors become different?\\" (Pg. 159)Concerning the comparative lack of \\"intermediate\\" forms in the fossil record, he says, \\"Considering the odds against their preservation and discovery, the fact that we know as many intermediates as we do and that new ones continue to turn up from time to time seems more remarkable than their common absence.\\" (pg. 177)The last chapter \\"Perchance to Dream\\" ends on a philosophical note: \\"Yet great and grave though the problems that confront us are, mankind has a powerful armamentarium with which to engage them--its collective genius and its seemingly unquenchable spirit....

A fair number of pages at the end are devoted to reference material -- dimension tables and tables of typical values for real-world motors -- which I found valuable. Criticisms include proofreading - several equations substitute the number &quot;12&quot; for &quot;I squared&quot; which made for a real headscratcher until I figured it out. The line drawings that illustrate the text were apparently supplied by Siemens as this company's name appears prominently on them. This seems parochial to me and should have been edited out, or other illustrations used. I thought that the treatment of phase relationships and rotating magnetic fields was less than rigorous, taking a phenomenological approach rather than an analytical one. It would appear that any material requiring a knowledge of trig and calculus had been stripped out, which is unfortunate. Still, not a bad text overall."},{"Title":"Quiet Magic: A Parable About Finding Happiness","review":"Written by family therapist and educator Pauline McKinnon, who has practiced meditation for over thirty years, Quiet Magic is a novel about a boy immersed in fast-paced life and modern technology.

An insightful parable about learning to manage and balance the stress of modern life, enjoyable for all ages."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Quantitative Review","review":"This book is a quick way to jam through some GMAT practice math questions, nothing more and nothing less. I sat down and did it in a weekend without too much effort. I agree with other reviews that this book is not a good place to begin your studying in that there aren't many pages devoted to concepts - it really is just a tool for practice. As mentioned in other reviews, the questions are in order of difficulty. I found this useful because it gives you a very clear sense of what the GMAT considers difficult versus the types of questions that are considered easy. If you're like me, you'll zip through the bulk of the questions and then hit a wall where you notice you're getting more and more wrong - a good thing, while you're still studying! Kaplan questions are generally harder than these, Princeton Review a bit easier, and Barron's are just plain bizarre. Given the huge inconsistency across books - it's nice to ground yourself in \\"official\\" questions once in awhile."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Quantitative Review","review":"This book is slimmer than the orange Official Guide, weighing in at about 300 problems, but if you need more math practice, it's a great resource. One caveat: the average difficulty level of questions in this book is somewhat lower than that of the questions in the Official Guide. If you're already getting a 650 or better on practice tests, or if you are comfortable with the vast majority of math problems in the Official Guide, go ahead and skip this one. If you're not yet at that level, this is an excellent supplement to the orange book.It can't be emphasized enough the importance of doing \\"authentic\\" practice questions: while some test-prep companies are better than others, none have completely mastered the exact tone and nature of GMAT questions. As these questions are written by the same folks who write the test, you can't really improve on the authenticity.The Quant Review book does have some actual math \\"review\\" material, but it's very official in nature. Not a shortcut in sight. Buy it for the questions; read the review if you're stuck in the subway without a pencil and scratch paper."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Quantitative Review","review":"I bought this after going through the 2005 Kaplan GMAT book. The pro's are that it has a lot of actual past math questions (176 problem solving & 118 Data Sufficiency) and they are very similar to the type of question you will encounter on the real test because the book is by GMAC (the makers of the actual GMAT test). Therefore, it's great as a source for additional practice. The con's are that it has a very brief instructional section that isn't very useful at all and the problems are organized in order of increasing difficulty. This means that approximately the last 20 questions of both P/S and D/S type problems will be like the real thing, assuming you are doing fairly well on the real thing and only receiving difficult level questions. All in all, I highly recommend using this in conjunction with another more thorough GMAT review (such as Kaplan), but not on its own. And if you want an accurate full-length practice test then definitely use the 2 FREE practice tests downloadable from MBA.com when you register to take the GMAT - they are much better indicators of actual performance than Kaplan."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Quantitative Review","review":"I bought this book in addition to the Official Guide and the Verbal Guide. While it does have additional math problems, they are lacking in complexity and not representative of what you will see if you're scoring much above 600.

So, if you're scoring at a high level, skip this book and concentrate on the last 50 problems of each math section in the Official Guide."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Quantitative Review","review":"While I did not compare this with other guide books, like some reviewers have, I did use it to prepare for the GMAT.

So if you have the 10th, you won't get as much as you might hope from spending for the new main volume, or $17 a pop for the supplements. You will get what GMAT calls \\"improved\\" explanations.

On test day I was the only one at the center and I got to know the receptionist pretty well. She told me that she sees hundreds of these scores a year and the ones who get 700+ all have one thing in common - they have all done every problem in all three books.My advice: spend the money on all three. Work every problem, noting which ones are hard and which you get wrong. When you are done, go back and work the hard/incorrect problems again. Then, when you are done, start over from page one. You effort will be rewarded on test day."},{"Title":"The Official Guide for GMAT Quantitative Review","review":"I have been studying for GMAT for a few weeks now and I think the OG is a great source for a good practice on real GMAT questions. But having said that, use the OG only once you grasp all the basics and when you are almost ready to take the GMAT. The OG does not contain any math conceptual content, so use it only for practice towards the end.In order to get a real GMAT prep - I would recommend you buy the set of 9 books of \\"EZ Solutions,\\" or whichever book(s) you think you need most help with. These books are very detailed oriented and cover everything on the GMAT math. First use the review modules to get the concepts and then use the workbooks for practice. Some of the most challenging topics in GMAT math, such as permutation/combination, probability, geometry problems, complex word problems, etc., are brilliantly explained in these books. Also, the EZ Advanced Workbook is a \\"must have\\" if you are aiming for a high score. It may be a good idea to buy Barron's without the CD (don't waste money on the CD version for any book). After doing all this, use the OG and you will see a dramatic difference in your scores. If you still need more practice, you may consider buying the Kaplan book (but really not needed). Save your money by not buying anything else. You don't even have to take any of those pricy courses. I followed this process and my scores have jumped from the 500-range to the 700-range.

If you are already scoring above 600 in your practice exams, then I suggest you focus your studies on Manhattan GMAT books (3rd edition) and GMAT Prep (download free from MBA.COM), which has at least 250 GMAT questions which are similar to the real GMAT.Just as anything, how you spend your time is critical in studying for your GMAT.

I teach sacramental theology and I have often wished for a book that would inspire ordinary people to understand and appreciate what takes place in each of the sacraments and what is the meaning of each sacrament in their daily lives. Anselm Gr&uuml;n brings to this enterprise all of his experience as a monk, a theologian, a parish priest, and someone conversant with modern psychology. On every page I have encountered a priest who prays as he administers the sacraments.

Initially, his letters reflect a man seeking to know what the rule is, and expecting others to live by the rules. On a deeper level, the letters reflect Boniface's deep honesty, frustration, and dedication to his work in churches plagued by pagan and heretical influences. Weeks after I finished this book, individual incidents Boniface confronted came to mind. The letters inform about eighth century culture. They share the thoughts of a dedicated man trying to do the right thing in a difficult era."},{"Title":"Robert Lax","review":"A pricey but handsome volume from Verlag of Robert Lax's final notebooks before his leaving Patmos for the last time before his death in September of 2000. This is a beautiful book--nice, heavy, slick pages, wonderful photographs, and the poems are laid out in a way that invites the eye to linger. Lax's poems are stil spare, and these are interesting in that they are long exercises in peeling apart the poet's own life and consciousness. They're more like his \\"21 pages\\" and journal entries than the short \\"Fables\\" or even the long, abstract island poems--yet still retain his trademark short broken syllable style. And for this reason, they're very involving. You feel closer to the center of Lax's world than ever before, as if you're invading his private world, sitting in his bedroom late at night watching as he whittles away at himself with words. Also included are several essays, one detailing Lax's final trip home, an interview (as I recall), and some other miscellaneous essays. Whether you love the poetry or loved the man himself, or both, this is necessary reading."},{"Title":"Robert Lax","review":"What a rich journey into the contemplative world of a poet! Although the book is costly, it is so worth it. This museum quality publication pleasures the senses, as well as the mind. Brought into the quiet, serene world of Robert Lax, living on a remote Greek island, one feels the hectic turmoil of life slip away.Black and white photography present an old man, lover of cats, who lived in a small room, bed in one corner, \\"study\\" in another, table, sofa and chairs in another. Living a simple, hermit life, this writer gave up the modern dream of accumulating fame and fortune. Lax attempted to bring attention and love to the world every moment of every day.This poet's slowed down, minimalist style intrigued Europeans long before his fellow Americans. The extremely focused, train of thought poetry will not attract those looking for a \\"quick read\\" or lovely nature poetry. But for those of a more contemplative bent, \\"Robert Lax\\" is a delicious meal to be savored."},{"Title":"An introduction to Viking mythology","review":"The author spent much time making certain each portion was 1) accurate and 2) understandable to all readers.

I'm ordering a few more books to try to fill in the gaps."},{"Title":"The Storm (The Lighthouse Family)","review":"We love all of Cynthia Rylant's books and series of books, and The Lighthouse Family series is our new favorite! We are anxious to read the next book as soon as it comes out so we can know what happens to Pandora the cat, Seabold the dog and their three little mice children. Rylant uses wonderful words in her books, painting a beautiful story of words. (the illustrations in this book are beautiful too!) This is for a little older readers than her Mr. Putter and Tabby, Henry and Mudge, Poppleton, or Little Whistle series, ALL of which I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!"},{"Title":"The Storm (The Lighthouse Family)","review":"\\"The Storm\\" by Cynthia Rylant is one of the most joyful stories a writer could ever put pen to paper (or fingers to keyboard) to write. Finding Preston McDaniels to illustrate is probably a sign from heaven that this book was meant to be. It is perfect. That simple: \\"The Storm\\" is perfect. Because this is a ready-for-chapters book, a beginning reader has the story to practice reading skills. As a bonus, the story is didactic in teaching that solitude comes with a price and that friendship heals loneliness. Even if the young reader does not understand these concepts on a conscious level, surely the subconscious makes that registration.The adult cannot miss the themes of solitude and friendship and what each bring. This is one of those books that I would like to stand in the foyer of Wal-Mart and hand out to everyone who leaves. Rylant has a soft touch, a magical way with words that go straight to the heart.In children's books animals are often the characters. Why, you may ask? Studies explain the psychological use and also why they dress as humans. The first main character is Pandora, a cat who has accepted the loneliness that goes with living in a lighthouse, but her sole purpose in life is saving ships from crashing on the rocks. Enter Seabold, a loner dog who loves to sail the seas, who finds safe harbor one stormy night in the seas near Pandora's lighthouse. A dog and a cat living in the same house is difficult at first. He is a salty, crusty old dog, she is neat and tidy, a follower of rules. Their family is made complete with the rescue of three little mice.Think of it: how incongruous it is that three such disparate sets of persons could make a happy home, but they do. This statement may be a spoiler, but it is not. It is not the make up of the family that this story is about; rather, it is about love and acceptance and kindness and generosity of spirit. Mostly, it is about the magic of love in transforming people, in making them human.See what I mean. This book needs to be handed out at Wal-Mart. Pay it forward, make the world better. Another of Rylant's magically worded books is \\"Missing May,\\" a Newbury Award winner. \\"The Storm\\" is the first in her Lighthouse Family series. Very highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Storm (The Lighthouse Family)","review":"The is the first book I have read my Rylant. Being a fan of lighthouses and children's books, I had to check this one out once I saw the cover. I was very impressed. The story is about 2 lonely animals,an adorable sheepdog and kitty cat, who love the sea and develop a deep friendship. They decide to tend a lighthouse together. The illustrations are some of the best I have seen in kids' books. This is definitely a cozy read for bedtime."},{"Title":"The Storm (The Lighthouse Family)","review":"The Storm introduces us to a new book series by Cynthis Rylant, one of my favorite children's authors. We are introduced to Seabold, a seafaring loner (and a dog), the cat Pandora, a lonely keeper of the lighthouse, and three mouse orphans. The text is melodic and never overwrought. The story is sweet, and though filled with virtue it is not moralistic. By the end of the book my son and I wanted to live with the lighthouse family, and share in their new life together. A sweet book, that I read to him, but equally appropriate for a mid-level independent reader. I would think the age group anywhere from 5-10 depending on who is doing the reading, an adult or the child herself."},{"Title":"The Storm (The Lighthouse Family)","review":"We read a lot and have struggled to find the right chapter books to read out loud to our 6 (almost 7) year old. He can read the Magic Tree House series on his own now, so we were looking for something slightly more advanced in terms of vocabulary and number of words on a page to read TO him. Many of the books we've tried have had subject matter too dark for a 6 year old (Lemony Snicket, Winn-Dixie, Edward Tulane, Swiss Family Robinson early classic version, etc. - they all seem to include kids or parents dying).This book was perfect. It included just enough new words for his vocabulary - not so many to make the story difficult to understand but enough to stretch his mind a bit. :-) The story itself had the perfect balance of drama/adventure and simple peace and goodness. I don't know just how to explain this, but the book itself just has a cozy feeling...it makes me want to snuggle up close to my son for an old-fashioned wholesome read.I was surprised at how different this was in writing style from Rylant's books for younger readers (Henry and Mudge, Mr. Putter and Tabby). We liked those too, but the style here is much different. It's not just a longer story. The words chosen give the sense that she carefully crafted each page. I can't say enough about how much we loved this book and are looking forward to reading the others in the series.I think the vocabulary would make this a little tougher for our almost-5 year old, so I'd recommend this for 6-9 year olds, depending on whether you're reading TO them or whether they're reading these on their own."},{"Title":"The Storm (The Lighthouse Family)","review":"This is, amazingly, the first good series I've found to read to my four-year-old son.

Thank you Ms. Rylant!"},{"Title":"The Storm (The Lighthouse Family)","review":"The drawings are a little strange, my kids couldn't make out what the pictures were supposed to be.

The author claims his book is the true record of a fantastic soul journey into the heavenly worlds. Unlike a number of books which take the reader into first heaven, Twitchell pushes onward and upward, ascending heaven upon heaven, describing what he sees and hears with lucid and poetic language. I've never read another book since which comes close to giving such a vivid and graphic account of the higher worlds of God, and of the spiritual laws and principles which operate in those realms. Even if read as fiction, the book is a moving and inspiring journey of the divine imagination. Twitchell made a name for himself as one of those rare souls who have the ability to travel at will far beyond the confines of the body, to soar on high and touch the face of God. Another one of his books, titled ECKANKAR, The Key to Secret Worlds, gives the history of the art of soul travel, and many techniques on how to do it. I don't hesitate to highly recommend this book to anyone who is curious or interested in life after death, and in the higher heavenly worlds."},{"Title":"The Tiger's Fang","review":"The Tiger's Fang is the greatest book I ever read! I am a seeker and have read many, many books on spiritual subjects. Many years ago I discoverd a book by Brad Steiger who mentioned in the book a remarkable man called Paul Twitchell.This intrigued me and so I bought several books by Paul Twitchell. One was Eckankar: the key to Secret Worlds which I really enjoyed! But the one book I liked the most was called THE TIGER'S FANG by Paul Twitchell. This book is really incredible!Paul describes his soul travel experiences with the great ECK Master Rebazar Tarzs. Paul journeys on the Inner Planes to the Astral World, Causal Plane, Mental World and Etheric Planes. On each inner plane Paul gets to meet the ruler of that plane and converse with him. Finally Paul reaches the Soul plane and beyond where there is no more thought or negativity.Paul is able to travel beyond the Soul Plane into the God Worlds. And finally Paul meets God and experiences God Realization!This book is beautifully written but its also incredibly inspiring. This is one of my favorite books of all time! I recommend that everyone rush to buy this book! (and I don't get a commision)Regards...Bill Marcus"},{"Title":"The Tiger's Fang","review":"Spiritual adventure at its best. This book explores the universes of God, those heavenly planes beyond earth. If you're interested in aspects of soul travel, natural expansion of consciousness, and existence beyond death, you may find this book beneficial. The author seems to indicate that having the god-realization experience is possible for anyone. Read &quot;The Tiger's Fang&quot;, and see how to begin that process. Well written, exciting, exhilarating, spiritual adventure at its best. A classic counterpart to Mr. Twitchell's &quot;Stranger By The River&quot;, and also his &quot;Flute of God&quot;. All three books offer readers life-changing options. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Tiger's Fang","review":"What a great book. I could not put it down. I stayed up all night reading it, it moved me that much. It's well written and he describes in detail his travels with his 15th Century Tibetan Spiritual Mentor Rebazar Tarzs. He's either got the greatest imagination ever or as I truely believe it's an accurate account. If you read it with an open mind it will rock you from long held beliefs about life in the worlds beyond the physical. It's fascinating, enthralling and in the class of the best spiritual books ever written. It's right there with Gibran's works, Yogananda's, the Dali Lama, etc. Best read of 2003 for me. It will not disappoint any reader with an open heart. Highly recommeded, a can't put it down read!"},{"Title":"The Tiger's Fang","review":"It is a known fact in arcane circles, that with this book, Paul Twitchell has revealed some of the most hidden secrets of God. This body of knowledge was hitherto only passed in sacred and revered sanctums from Master to worthy students. Knowledge concealed in elaborate ceremonies, trappings, symbols and a life-times maze of deliberate false leads. This book is presented as a sublime dialogue between student and Master, an inner journey that is distinctly Twitchells'. It also betrays a detailed and graphic description of what is loosely called heaven.It is also a road map for those of us so inclined to follow his journey Twitchell opines that this inner journey may differ from person to person depending on the prerogative of the Guide and Spiritual Master. These guides are souls that have traversed the road to the deepest Heavens, and whose only concern is to assist us in realizing our God-like nature throughout eternity. Gods in their own right, they belong to no religion, race, nor social persuasion. Forget the stifling ignorance of orthodox religion, this is the most sought-after arcane knowledge presented to you literarily on a platter of gold. The idea is to doubt this knowledge, then prove it to yourself, your experiences will then become a basis of your authority as you gradually join the species of people who have experienced a glimpse of the eternal. Dare to explore your self!!"},{"Title":"The Tiger's Fang","review":"I read this book 27 years ago... and since then, my spiritual life has totally changed. This was (and still is) what I call a &quot;Page Turner&quot;, I couldn't leave this book alone until I was able to devour it all! I was &quot;brought&quot; with The Third Eye's Lobsang Rampa books, and the Astral Travel methods. A quarter of century ago, I thought that was THE only method of accessing the inner worlds... until I discovered that book. Since then, I learned that Soul Travel is THE way to the inner worlds. Astral travel limits oneself (limits, yes!) only to the astral, causal or mental heavens while Soul Travel (as explained by Paul Twitchell in Tiger's Fang) imposes NO limits. You are limited by your own limits! That book indeed transformed me inside and out... I have since then been able to &quot;really&quot; prove to myself the validity of my own inner realities through Soul Travel. Today, Harold Klemp is the Spiritual leader who is teaching this method, but one doesn't have to follow him to try the methods explained in his books. Also, look for &quot;Autobiography of a Modern Prophet&quot; by Harold Klemp. He explains how he was able to reach the highest heavens... another page turner..."},{"Title":"The Tiger's Fang","review":"After reading &quot;Confessions of a God Seeker&quot; by Ford Johnson I am giving all of Twitchell's and Klemp's books a second, hard look. I am now able to give a different perspective on a book review than a current Eckist could or would dare to.Tiger's Fang is an interesting book with obvious ties to Shabd Yoga which was Twitchell's previous spiritual path. This book also has some Twitchell fiction similar to his &quot;Talons of Time&quot; novel. Rebazar Tarz, unfortunately, is a made up character who becomes the keystone in Twitchell's deception of Eck Master linage which validates the current administration. Still, the book does have some redeeming value if one is able to discern truth from fiction. Lots of luck!"},{"Title":"The Tiger's Fang","review":"If you don't mind, I would like to begin this review by giving you a little backgound on myself. I have four (4) different university degrees from various universities in the United States, and I have been a student of spiritual matters for over 40 years. I wrote my own book on the subject of law, and sold it to a major legal publisher a few years ago. Over my 66 years, I have met and discussed religious issues with people of all backgrounds including those who are homeless and those who have successful businesses or professional practices. I value the teachings of all great spiritual leaders who have love at the core of their belief, and at least once a year I watch and am moved by the movie \\"The Gospel According to Saint Matthew\\" by Pier Paolo Pasolini.I sincerely believe that the \\"Tiger's Fang\\" by Paul Twitchell is the greatest book written in the past 2000 years. I ask you this one question, who has claimed that they have actually traveled to and heard the voice and message of GOD, and then backed it up with a writing with appears to support that claim? The \\"Tiger's Fang\\" backs up that claim with a facinating book that will amaze those who are ready to absorb the experience. In a world filled with war, the desire for power, self-destruction, and hate, what could be more important than the recorded experience of someone who has heard the message of GOD, and then presented it in a writing that can be appreciated by today's educated population.The spiritual seeker must have an experienced teacher. Most of us start off in the human consciousness, and moving out of it into the spiritual consciousness is simply not achieveable in the typical lifetime without an experienced guide. The \\"Tiger's Fang\\" may provide you with a meaninigful step on your spiritual journey, and if you don't find that meaningful step here, I encourage you to continue your search as there is much more to reality than this world acknowledges."},{"Title":"The Tiger's Fang","review":"An excellent ECK book.

Having read about that in some of the negative feedback, I have deducted a star from what otherwise would have been a 5-star rating, and yes, I would still definitely recommend The Tiger's Fang.I did not read the book thinking that Rebazzar Tarz was Twitchell's PHYSICAL master in THIS realm, as someone else suggested. Perhaps I misread. The way I understood it, Tarz appeared to be an ascended, or spiritual, Master that was the boatman who took Twitchell through the different levels of God Head on what was obviously an astral journey. A Master, of course, being someone who has already gone through these levels of God, himself, and has denied being absolved back in to the One in order to help others achieve enlightenment. A few weeks after finishing the book, I realized, or decided, that the levels of God Head Twitchell and Tarz traveled are, quite possibly, the Kabbalistic Sephiroth's of the Tree of Life in esoteric Jewish tradition. Is that really what they were? Was Twitchell really full of crap, as some of the negative feedback suggests? I don't know.

So, looking for answers I was surprised - and grateful! - to find them in Paul Twitchell's 'The Tiger's Fang.' Now, in re-reading this edition, his description of an apparently life-changing spiritual odyssey appears just as fresh - and relevant. Clearly there is a timelessness about the subject matter, and its depiction, which rings true to those who want to listen. The book's real challenge is less the subject matter and more its subsequent execution: &quot;Now you know&quot; says Mr Twitchell's spiritual guide, Rebazar Tarzs. So what's next? Fortunately for the reader, the author makes it very clear."},{"Title":"The Tiger's Fang","review":"Paul Twitchell wrote the Tiger's Fang in the 1950's for his master, Kirpal Singh. Singh refused to publish it as he believed it was made up and Twitchell didn't have any of these experiences at all. Twitchell then published it in Orion Magazine in 1960. Later, under Lancer Publications he reprinted it, calling it a first edititon but changed the name from Kirpal Singh to Sudar Singh then finally to Rebazar Tarzs.After Paul Created Eckankar early Eck literature has his master as Sudar Singh. Later he changed the name to Rebazar.Now and then the old Orion magazines pop up on Ebay.

ECK gets lots of praise from its authors, but when I put it to the test I can't truthfully differentiate it spiritually from simply eating food. Paul Twitchell introduces us to all of the different gods that control reality, and has extremely boring and pointless monologues from each.

Once-in-a-while I come across people who are bound in occult and philosophical ideas that have a detrimental effect on their life and destiny. My knowledge is to set captives free from destrucive lies and demons; I do not encourage any Christian into such \\"research\\"ventures unless they have the grace to \\"stay clear\\"- for many have in fact been \\"converted\\" unwittingly.2. I came across this book in one of those \\"unusual\\" ways after reading Twitchel's \\"In my Soul I am free.\\" I found a connection between the ECK ideas from a further previous reading of a confessed occult grand master who became a follower of Jesus Christ. The most interesting development however, came when after having read a couple of the pages of \\"The Tiger's Fang\\", I noticed a word-for-word, and very often paragraph-for- paragraph duplication of the material from W. Russell's \\"The Secret of Light\\".3.Russell, if you are aware of him, was a genius of some sort- his intellectual powers, being original, were obviously far superior than much of the New Thoughters and New agers combined. I am however not endorsing any of these people here. I can tell you that the majority did not have the reality of the Living God in their \\"mystical\\" knowledge.4. All false religion's and occult doctrine are from the lesser \\"occult heavens\\". They must naturally bear similitudes of Truth and statements of fact to be convincing, but their core is connected to hostile intelligences that are out to destroy human beings. Intelligent human liars are the more dangerous; they are more effective instruments of propagating satanic ideas on earth. I would like to encourage the followers of this liar (TwitchHell) to examine these evidences for themselves.5.There is no doubt he was an occultist, and a very gifted mind in literature, but where can such a person lead you to if not to hell. From my research, I discovered there are two kind of occultists: the wicked ones (mind controllers and sorcerers) and the foolish ones (dabblers and blind initiates). Neither side is an option for a person desiring salvation, yet both sides portray the villain-victim motif in all tragedies of earth-life.If the philosophical powers of these occult characters initially excite you, it can be understood (just as love at first sight), but if they become your consummate way of thought-life-action, I greatly sympathize with you. It means you cannot think for yourself. You are already under manipulation because you are irresponsible and full of pride. Consider settling on the simplicity of the Bible and faith in the Lord of lords, the Utmost Grand-Master and Savior, Jesus Christ.6. The \\"esotericism\\" of the Bible (the hidden life-giving wisdom, spiritually evident to the mature and humble believer) accommodates your needs for development and salvation as a disciple of Jesus Christ. True Christianity does not deny the claims of occultist, it transcends them and destroys them by Truth-Power. Those of us with understanding do not waste time debating with occultist and others of the \\"strange path\\", we oparate in the Authority of Jesus to advance God's will on earth. In the process of \\"advancing the Kingdom\\" encounters are inevitable, and one is compelled to defeat demons and satanic agents.7.There are no divine merits conferred to anyone on the basis of OBE's, whether Christian or not. Please remember this. If you have to escape from the body-life in order to be saved, you might not escape through the right door at that critical moment. Everything, every issue in your life is reckoned according to the body-state experience. If you are spiritual it is according to how well you glorify God in and with your body.8. Listen, then: Until you are Crucified and Raised with Jesus Christ, the Uniquely begotten Son of the Living God, The Creator-Lord of all manifest \\"realms of protoplast\\", the Motive Mind and Power of all life, the King of Glory, the Supreme General of the Celestial armies, the Messiah-Judge of Israel, the Head of the True Ecclesia-made of the blood-cleansed and light filled believers- that make up his mystical body, who is also the Giver of the Holy Spirit, the bonafide Manifestation of the Infinite Pleroma, the only Savior and Judge of all earthlings and celestial beings, then you don't know occult! \\"D.E.O\\" Yehudah Bob"},{"Title":"The Tiger's Fang","review":"This \\"book\\" is full of plagiarism, as are most of Paul Twitchell's books.For more info on one of the most notorious plagiarizers of the 20th century, go here:http://vclass.mtsac.edu:930/phil/center.htm"},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of the Dead (European Classics)","review":"It took almost six months from the day I ordered this book, until it came out of print and I received it in my mail.

My favorite story was &quot;The Encyclopedia of the Dead&quot;. It sounds so personal, that anyone who knows a little bit about Danilo Kis' life, can see a lot of Kis himself - in this story. Mr. Heim did wonderful job translating this work. However, I was a bit disappointed that Mr. Haim did not make an effort to write an introduction for this book. Writer's notes at the end of the book were extrimely helpful in understanding stories more deeply and understanding what he wanted to accomplish with this work of art.Many of Danilo Kis' reders like to remember him as writer who had Borges for an idol. Please, let us not forget that Kis had admirerers himself - no one less than Joseph Brodsky, amongst others."},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of the Dead (European Classics)","review":"I've not previously read Mr Kis's work and I was not sure what to expect. I read this collection in translation (by Michael Henry Heim). This was the first book I could obtain, and I was totally swept up in the beauty of the prose from beginning to end. This collection of nine stories touches on a number of facets of life: relationships, encounters and experiences. Each is unique. Each illustrates a different aspect of existence, including questioning the notion of divine order.\`Everything a living man can know of death.'Because of these differences, I suspect that each story could be my favourite on a different day or read. Each provides food for thought and the language is exquisite. On this read, I particularly enjoyed \`Simon Magus' and his questioning of divine order, \`To Die for One's Country Is Glorious' describing the final hours of Esterhazy, and the reading journey of the bereaved daughter in the title story.In fewer than 200 pages, Mr Kis has managed to evoke a set of experiences and reactions that linger on in the mind. Where does life end, and death begin? Are the boundaries mutable or immutable? We will each have (or form) our own private views on this question. For myself, I am delighted to have read this book and will be looking to read more of Mr Kis in translation.\`History is written by victors. Legends are woven by people. Writers fantasize. Only death is certain.'Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of the Dead (European Classics)","review":"... and those two are enough in my card catalogue to justify a five-star rating. How many novelists have written even one great short story? I suppose I should have read one of Danilo Kis's novels first, as my first encounter with such an acclaimed author, but I like short stories. I especially admire coherent, cohesive collections of stories written as a suite. \\"The Encyclopedia of the Dead\\" is certainly just such a cohesive suite of stories, all of them concerned with death, all of them more or less metaphysical \\"conceits\\" in the older sense of the word. A comparison to Jorge (not Jose) Luis Borges, the Argentine master of metaphysical prose, is inevitable. Kis acknowledges Borges in his postscript to this collection. The title story is pure Borges in conception.'Simon Magus' and 'Last Respects', the first two stories in the book, are well-crafted prose, at least in English translation, but left me quite unimpressed. They and several later stories are too-clever stylized parables, anatomizing in the mummified cadaver of the religious imagination. Jewish or Christian, it's been done, and done more persuasively.The third story, 'Encyclopedia of the Dead,' however, captured my imagination from the start. The conceit is this: a woman gets special permission to visit a mysterious library. Inside and alone, she searches out a certain book, an encyclopedia of all the people who have ever lived whose names are NOT included in any other encyclopedia. In that book, every detail of the lives of such otherwise forgotten people is recorded. The woman immediately begins to read about her father, who has recently died. I won't tell more; it's a superb construct, a profound synecdoche of the memory and forgetfulness of humanity. In his postscript, by the way, Kis ruminates briefly on his discovery, after the writing, of a real-time counterpart to the 'encyclopedia' -- the underground archives of genealogy maintained by the Church of the Latter Day Saints in Utah.The other Great Story in the collection, \\"The Book of Kings and Fools,\\" also has a real-time counterpart, but the process of writing and recognition were reversed. Kis, in his postscript, tells us that he became fascinated with the \\"true and fantastic\\" pernicious history of the \\"Protocols of the Elders of Zion,\\" that fraud that never seems to be properly exposed and discredited. Kis originally intended to write an essay about the route of dissemination of that anti-semitic forgery, but he discovered that there were so many missing links, between the well-documented initial perpetration and the world-wide self-sustaining willful perpetuation of the lies, that he could only turn to his authorial imagination to complete his essay in fictive form. Once again, the result is a profound sardonic 'conceit,' a story worthy of comparison with the best of Borges.Two out of nine? Good enough! I'm hooked. Let's see, what Danilo Kis shall I read next..."},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of the Dead (European Classics)","review":"I'd heard about Danilo Kis recently, and read this collection on an airplane trip.

It is somewhat dry reading, but the diagrams are for the most part clear. Some of the whole ship detailed drawings, lost something in the reduction and are difficult to read. Much of the information here came from the authors detailed study of the St George model as well as impossible to find rare book references from the late 1600's.I love every aspect of sailing and I'm particularly interested in learning whatever I can about how ship- rigged boats were actually rigged. This book provides some great information on the terminology of the complicated rigging of these vessels, as well as some of the construction details of the spars. In it you will find information on spars, proportions of the same, standing rigging, and running rigging, and the spirtsail topmast (which went out of use after 1720). If you are interested in learning everything you can about square-rigged ships, this is one of the few references still in print. Buy one while you still can. I am very happy with the book.

This book is not for the novice ship builder or new ship modeler not intimately familiar with the structure of a sailing ship. The full ship plates showing all the rigging are very old-school and the size of the images makes it nearly impossible to interpret.

I found google a necessary accomniant...The good: In a dry language, there is a detailed explanation of every line, where it starts, goes, and ends; rough timelines of when various nations felt the need to completely change how that line ran; discussions of various ships, estimates of how accurate various sources are.

He's witty, spiky, elusive and puzzling. His essays lull you into a false sense of charm and nostalgia, but within them are sharp and penetrating comments on human behaviour. They run alongside great Romantic works like Samuel Taylor Coleridge's 'This Lime-Tree Bower My Prison' or William Wordsworth's 'The Prelude' as wonderful, moving pieces of autobiography and self-examination. Plus they are beautifully written, with their descriptions of forgotten places in London, the slowly decaying 'South Sea House', for instance, or the pastoral green of the Inner Temple Gardens, hidden away in the midst of the capital. And behind them, always, is a sense that these nostalgic descriptions are all the more enjoyable because they are hard-won; they come out of the tragedy and courage of Lamb's personal life, and his lifelong struggle with his own depression and with his sister's serious mental illness. They also have a sharply political edge to them - they were published in the 'London Magazine' alongside essays by Hazlitt and De Quincey, and while they seem at first glance simply charming, they often slyly comment on contemporary prejudice.Lamb hasn't been popular through the 20th century - an attack on him by F. R. Leavis and his disciples in the 1930s was the start of the rot, and the gradual decline of the essay has meant he's been almost completely overlooked (though not by the Charles Lamb Society, who are still going in London and meet regularly for lectures - and for Lamb's birthday drinks). So a new edition of Lamb is really to be celebrated, especially one as beautifully produced as this.But alas! This is a lovely edition, but it has one huge flaw for me. There are only 27 essays here and there should be 28: the edition claims to be a reprint of 'Essays of Elia', but it leaves out one of Lamb's most important essays, 'Imperfect Sympathies'. There's not even a note to explain this omission. Why is this important? Well, 'Imperfect Sympathies' is one of the most difficult, challenging, shocking of Lamb's essays - it starts off with a funny skit on why Elia doesn't like Scotchmen: 'I have been trying all my life to like Scotchmen, and am obliged to desist from the experiment in despair'. Scotchmen don't get jokes. They're terribly literal:\\"I have a print of a graceful female after Leonardo da Vinci, which I was showing off to [a Scotchman]. After he had examined it minutely, I ventured to ask him how he liked MY BEAUTY (a foolish name it goes by among my friends) -- when he very gravely assured me, that \\"he had considerable respect for my character and talents\\" (so he was pleased to say), \\"but had not given himself much thought about the degree of my personal pretensions.\\"But then, terribly, the essay takes a darker turn, as Elia voices prejudices about Jewishness and black people. I've always read this essay as a reflection on the nature of prejudice. It's not LAMB who's voicing these opinions - it's Elia, and he's doing so (I think) to make us see how an innocent sounding joke (against Scotchmen), and a bit of 'harmless' prejudice can be the slippery slope to something much worse - as such, it's very timely.But it's up to us, surely, to read this difficult essay and decide for ourselves. Simply leaving it out - without any word of acknowledgement - is bad editorial practice (though the notes to this edition, too, are pretty much non-existent). And it's also giving people a false sense of Lamb - a kind of misguided political correctness which actually amounts to admitting that these editors do think Lamb is a racist old bigot and there are some aspects of his writing which we'd just better not mention. Disrespectful to Lamb, and to his readers, I'd say..."},{"Title":"The essays of Elia","review":"Shamefully I had not read Lamb before. Delightful.

But I'm still angry that I endured this book those many years ago.The subject matter is, essentially, adultery, and more generally, modern angst among a group of 2 couples in modern-day England. All of the characters talk the same, and in the event that one day some mischievous gnomes at the printer's switch the characters' names around in some future edition, nobody will ever notice, since no reader is able to tell them apart to begin with.Most infuriating, I suppose, is Fowles's insistence on reminding you that he went to Oxford every 20 pages or so.

Martin, adulterous, smug, opaque to himself, lost in a fog of alcohol, is a sort of man who thankfully no longer exists. The women in this novel would all have been more fortunate to have been born 40 years later, so as not to have to protect themselves through liaisons with this shabby character.

Daniel Martin seems to me his best, most fully realized novel. The novel carries us over the course of the eponymous character's life, concentrating on his later years. Fowles linguistic richness is incomparable. The first chapter is a model idyl. The shifting point of view takes a little getting used to, but he derives enough narrative force from the device that it's worth the effort. A definite five-star read."},{"Title":"Daniel Martin.","review":"This is one of the great 20th Century English novels. The descriptions of the countryside and customs left me breathless and feeling the heat of the sun and the glimmer of the grass. Fowles gives me hope that literature has not died."},{"Title":"Daniel Martin.","review":"An extra-ordinary novel of ideas and simple humanity. Fowles explores complex questions of identity, culture, politics, love and change. As with all his work, his erudition is breathtaking, his writing simple yet dazzling. The story hooks you, the ideas will keep you thinking for a long time."},{"Title":"Daniel Martin.","review":"I fell in love with the Magus. It is my favorite read of all time. Looking at Fowles' book list I thought I would have years of reading pleasure at his hands. Then I read A Maggot and was horribly disappointed. Daniel Martin does not disappoint! This book was wonderfully textured. Fowles shows his psychological prowess in describing the un-named underbelly of modern existence. And unlike the Magus, this book actually has an ending."},{"Title":"Daniel Martin.","review":"There probably weren't many people who read this novel based on Dan Simmons quoting the opening line in the introduction to short story collection \\"Worlds Enough and Time\\", but at least one person can say that he did. That person was me, which could mean that I'm open to recommendations of things I wouldn't normally read based on very little evidence, or that I'm easily swayed. I'll leave that for other people to decide.But still, that opening line. \\"Whole sight, or all the rest is desolation.\\" The phrasing of it grabbed my attention, still does. It sets the tone for the entire novel, even if you don't realize it at the time, suggesting that unless everything is seen with a clear eye, all at once, it will all fall into ruin. If we can't be critical or objective about our own lives, then our lives will at best be unfulfilled. Worse, we may not even realize it.Fowles' novel follows the life of the title character, a Mr Daniel Martin. Scriptwriter, playwright, he's been spending his time writing screenplays and making a pretty good living at it when he gets news that one of his old Oxford friends is dying. He goes to visit and it opens him up to a life of reflection, connecting him to all the elements of his life that he had abandoned previously. He talks to his old friend Anthony, his daughter, his ex-wife and her sister, who married his friend. This becomes crucial, because even though the novel is too literary to say so, she's \\"the one that got away\\".This isn't a novel where a lot happens. Episodic is probably being kind and it's the type of book where all the exterior action is generally window dressing to everything that is going inside the heads of the characters. Or in this case, Mr Martin. The book is limited to his point of view, more or less, which means that to find out how anyone else is thinking we need to hear them talk. Which they do. Often. The book winds up switching constantly between some very detailed meditations on Martin's values and all he holds dear and his place in them, and people discussing variations on those matters with them. His dialogue, strangely enough, soars. There's a piercing and probing quality to it that works far better than the prose itself at times, which can bog itself down in its own strains of thoughts, enamored in the pure essence in itself (in other words: in love with the sound of its own typing). But the dialogue remains readable and revealing throughout and in some ways it could have been a better novel if he had focused more on this aspect of it. One downside to everyone being literate and well-read and chatty is that, as others have pointed out, everyone tends to sound the same in parts. There were sections with Daniel and Jenny where it becomes hard to tell who is speaking because the dialogue works for them both, which shouldn't be the case (unless one wants to argue that she's attempting to mimic his dialogue patterns in an attempt to get closer to him, which I'll leave to scholars).The prose itself, however, is quite literary. His gift for descriptions is astounding and he's not afraid to show off his rather large vocabulary. There's a description late in the novel of a mist rising and revealing the land underneath it that is quite breathtaking in its quiet and desolate beauty. As I said earlier, the stuff where Martin ponders his life and values and philosophies and so on doesn't always work as well because it can come across as egotistical. Daniel Martin clearly believes these matters are very dear to him and worth pondering over at great length, the rest of us may not be so convinced. Especially since a lot of this is basically a rich Hollywood screenwriter having a bit of a mid-life crisis and wondering why he's not making Art and getting in contact with his \\"roots\\" (which are more Oxford than farmland, although both figure in).Which probably leads to the biggest problem most people are going to have with this book: why should we care? The characters circle around each other and debate their lives but their crises are mostly internal . . . nobody is all that poorly off and it's hard to be sympathetic for upper class people moaning about how their lives aren't meaningful enough. Especially since parts of this seem to be Fowles working in things he's interested in, including quite a few debates on the merits of socialism and the Catholic church. It all swirls around, with none of it really being the focus. Which I give him some credit for, he could have turned this into a literate version of \\"worldly man reconnects with the yokels of his youth\\" but that's not such a British concern, I think. It's more the countryside versus the city life, the allure of money versus spiritual fulfillment and whether one can truly find it through other people. The past is kept at arm's length . . . an early flashback to the days of Oxford tricks us into thinking that the whole book is going to be like that, but from then on we rarely see those days again. They are referenced quite a bit and at times it seems like the whole point of the novel is to prove that you can't live the rest of your life like you're in college, which I think most of us figured out a while ago.And yet . . . as vain as these people can be, as well cultured and mannered and self-absorbed as they can be, there's a yearning in them that I can just about identity with. They're all searching for connections and half the time unable to get out of their own ways. The naturalism (such as it is) of the surroundings almost drowns out the points the novel is trying to make (for most of the Egypt sequence I was wondering why we were spending so much time here) and it sure takes its time getting to a rather simple point. But it's the little moments of devastation that work for me here, the calls between Jenny and Daniel, the gradually more affectionate discussions between him and his daughter, the flirtatious banter between him and Jane's other kids, the guarded and buried way Jane talks to him, and her slow wearing away of barriers. Bogged down in their petty searches for meaning, I found myself fascinated. I can't explain why. Maybe battered by waves of pretension, I found myself submitting but there's an unforced manner to this novel that comes through even as all the attempts to Mean Something cause the book to threaten to groan under its own philosophical weight. It's like a kinder and gentler Updike at times, less concerned with lacerating its own characters so much as setting them loose in the framework to see what happens. If that at all appeals to you, this may be your book. Daniel Martin remains a singular character, perhaps too narrowly personal to resound with a wider group of people, but he remains evocative of a time and a state of mind that only rarely exists these days. And chances are, he wouldn't even notice who was watching, caught in the gradually sharpening miasma of his own coils of thought."},{"Title":"Daniel Martin.","review":"This is something of a remembered review because it's been a few years since my last reading of Daniel Martin. Between my first and second reading there must have been at least 15 years. I expect I shall read it again. The reason I'm writing this now is that it's become apparent that to continue to live in marital bliss, I have to admit that there is a limit to how many bookcases one man should fill. I came across it when making room for my new books. Nevertheless, the next time I read it, it will probably be available on Kindle.This is a masterwork of storytelling of isolation and silences. You can almost see the action unfolding at times. The styles change. Sometimes there is a first-person narrative, other times it's in the third person.The silences are ubiquitous: in parked cars, first-class train compartments, between people. Its power is in what is not said in the empty spaces between Fowles's isolated characters. He writes of using silence like sabers. The book portrays a breakdown of shared values. Nell's professional jealousy and a slow erosion of shared vocabulary create distance between her and Jane. Daniel has cut himself off from the world he knows and is culturally isolated in Hollywood. He is bewildered by the world he finds himself in. Sex, as he sees it, is as an American topic for endless comment. He questions the \\"need to assess and analyze what is really a perfectly sufficient language in itself.\\"This is a work that operates on multiple levels. Locations change from Hollywood, to Oxford, the Nile. Time shifts. In the cool and undemonstrative class-ridden Oxford of mid-twentieth century, Anthony and Jane have a marriage of minds. But Fowles later contrasts this dried-up academic life with the two working-class sisters who are fully alive. Jane responds to crisis with withdrawal into a private world, shutting down parts of herself. The book is replete with symbols. It's a book that gets better with time."},{"Title":"Daniel Martin.","review":"I re-read this book with trepidation. When I read it in my 30s, I pronounced it \\"the best novel of the 20th century.\\" How would I react now? It's still better than Fowles French Lieutenant's Woman. It's not quite great but it is an excellent time warp back to the 1970s with the heaviness and seriousness of everything in life. The intrinsic love story makes more sense now that I am as middle-aged as Daniel Martin. On the other hand, I have less patience with what, I am sure, first dazzled me: the philosophic conversations and the esoteric arguments. But Fowles can write; his description of morning on the Nile is so vivid, I feel I have sailed from Luxor to Aswan. It is also Fowles' damnation of Hollywood as well as a continuation of the Brits vs. Yanks arguments. After 30 years, are Americans still hopeful? In the era of Obama, yes, again. Are Brits still depressed by loss of empire? Racial tensions have increased and economic woes have returned. I would now rate One Hundred Years of Solitude as \\"the best novel of the past century\\" but Daniel Martin would place in the top seventy-five."},{"Title":"Bonds of Blood, Bonds of Steel","review":"Bonds of Blood, Bonds of Steel was a very youthful attempt at writing in my favorite genre. I wrote the book when I was a freshman in high school, and unfornately, at times you can tell. In addition to writing it very young, the publishing company had a few problems in their typesetting department. It's not a very well edited book. In fact, some of the spelling errors make the English teacher in me cringe. Overall though, it's fun book--I had a great time writing it and I certainly hope that people enjoy reading it. It has memorable characters (Daro's my favorite), and a very detailed world that begs for more exploration. The idea of assassins on the side of good was fun to play with--I loved creating the governments--and there are a wealth of stories out there for me. I hope to continue exploring the world of the Assassins of Codoria for years to come. In then end, though, it's a book that is overall a satisfying read--there are some truly beautiful scenes (I like the masquerade) and if it gets a little dramatic at times, it fits the character (Rae's a tad on the hyper side.) Enjoy! I look forward to any comments anyone has. Rebecca L. Frencl"},{"Title":"Bonds of Blood, Bonds of Steel","review":"I was a student of Mrs. Ciardullo four years ago. This book is excellent for young writers because I find myself constantly turning back to Bonds of Blood every time I suffer writers block.The typing errors did not really distract me, but maybe I was biased that the best English teacher in the world had written it.I love this book and appreciate how Rebecca writes---as the audience we know she cares for her characters and we can see her sharp wit.

The book was fairly well done - I'd want to give it 5 stars, but the brilliance of Salvatore and Weis And Hickman and Tolkien rather dims the light of this book. I personally envisioned Rae as my teacher Mrs. Ciardullo. My favorite character is NOT Daro - I rather like Rae more than her partner. I'd prefer more of magic and such, but that's my opinion. After all, it is a well writen book for a high-school student. This can also be called as historical fiction, for no supernatural powers are seen in this book. It can actually happen, and that's what makes this book special. It has a sense of closeness and reality to you - unlike Hocus Pocus mages running around shooting goblins with their fire arrows from their fingertips."},{"Title":"Bonds of Blood, Bonds of Steel","review":"good"},{"Title":"Truth Killers","review":"Once in a blue moon I get my hands on a quick paperback read like Truth Killers. The book is still available if you look hard enough, even though it was written in 1989 and published in 1991. Brock has also written a couple of other novels, namely &quot;Inside the Green Circle&quot; and &quot;Shack Town&quot;.The book cover describes &quot;Truth Killers&quot; as a powerful page turning story of crooked politics and even dirtier crime. A hard punching crime epic that captures the seamy underworld of crooked politicians and the low life crime they encourage. Its about a Senator, under investigation by the Justice Department, who's flying home to Atlanta in his attempt to plug some leaks and come up with a game plan with his partners in crime, the Mayor and a crooked Councilman. He also has problems with his estranged wife as she has blown the whistle on some huge urgan redevelopment payoffs. And in all of this, there is one honest cop who figures out what is going on. The book has some good twists and turns and keeps you wondering. I think what amazed me most was how Brock ended the story. Wonder where that man learned so much about rotten politics? No matter, Truth Killers was an enjoyable read for me. Hope I get to find some more of Brock's work in the near future."},{"Title":"Gestion de riesgos financieros.

The much misunderstood author is given a fair look in this 50 minute overview. They bring us the sad, broken Poe, stumbling through lectures and readings, but they also show us a good man who loved literature and wanted to succeed as a writer.Any student of Poe has been inundated with macabre, morbid tales of involving dead women, drug abuse and affairs. What is disregarded by early biographers are the facts between the tales. He crafted stories with careful excellence, depending on technique, and not the lack of sobriety. He drew from his personal life, but also fabricated complex fantasies that became the model for Stephen King, Arthur Conan Doyle, Agatha Christie and others. His poetry caught the attention of European greats like Charles Baudelaire and Mihaly Babits, who, in turn, translated Poe's works for the world.We see where Poe lived an, and hear not only from his literary works, but his letters and the writings of those who knew him. We are able to attain a sense that Poe was not a monster only brooding in his woes, but a family man who longed to remain with Virginia, who lived with, as he wrote in \\"Annabel Lee,\\" \\"no other thought than to love and be loved by me.\\"The affect of the tragedies which surrounded him are explored, from his poor relationship with his adoptive father to the many deaths of loved ones, lost to tuberculosis. Many men would have been enfeebled to write, but Poe took his sadness and expressed it as literary art.I fully recommend \\"Biography - Edgar Allan Poe.\\" His life has the legendary elements of scandal and addiction, but to know Poe better, it is important to learn beyond the cliches like \\"master of the macabre.\\" This video does that.Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.com"},{"Title":"Edgar Allan Poe Stories","review":"When read by Basil Rathbone, these Poe stories are better heard than read -- if that is possible.

The selection is excellent and of interest you the young reader. The commentary is quite relevant as are the pictures which accompany it. I find that often now, our young people go all the way through the early grades in school and many of them have never heard of Poe, much less read his poetry. This was the sort of stuff my generation and the generation before it grew up on and cut our teeth on. I do not feel I am any worse for the wear. I am fearful that we are bringing up an entire generation (rightfully or wrong, although I feel it is the later) of young folks who will have no appreciation to this great art form and will miss a lot. This book helps. This entire series helps, as a matter of fact and I certainly recommend you add this one and the others to your library. Actually, it is rather fun reading these with the young folk and then talking about them. Not only do you get to enjoy the work your self and perhaps bring back some great memories, but you have the opportunity to interact with your child or student.

But after a wickedly exciting initiation by her cousin Anne, Corrie is immediately enchanted by a handsome Swedish visitor to the English court. Rugar Kallisson has plans of his own, and seduction is merely a means to an end.

This is an original story, full of romance and fun, with great period research and a charming mixture of erotic sex, innocent laughter, and historical romance."},{"Title":"Behind Closed Doors","review":"Set in England (and a small bit in Sweden) in 1576, this is the story of Corinna Huntington, daughter of Jack and Merrie, the Earl and Countess of Straffen (from CAUGHT IN THE ACT) and a Swedish aristocrat. When Corrie is sought by Queen Elizabeth to be one of her ladies, Corrie's father, a former rake, is horrified, knowing the immoral cesspool that is the court. Meanwhile, in Sweden, tall, blond Rugar Kalisson, Count of Aelthar, is sent by his king as a special ambassador to England. Rugar has a low opinion of the English and an even lower opinion of the virtue of English women, but he is happy to oblige his king, thinking it's time the English learned some respect for Swedish men--time for his revenge. And the first woman he identifies for his conquest is innocent Corrie.Krahn makes the court of Queen Elizabeth come alive, adding rich detail to the story and providing us an interesting glimpse into the life of the virgin Queen. (You might want to read the Author's Note at the end first!) The hero and heroine are wonderfully complex and other characters richly drawn. The dialog is interesting and believable.

It is hard to disagree with this assessment, since this tome is really that good and the research which went into it is nothing short of painstaking. George Ostrogorsky introduces his narrative with a thorough overview of the development of Byzantine studies from the sixteenth century onwards, followed by the history of the Empire proper by sections, each of which covers a specific historical period. In addition, each section is prefaced by an excellent bibliographical narrative of Byzantine sources which cover the period in question; these narratives put together provide the reader with a very instructive literary history of Byzantium. Ostrogorsky has a penchant for detail in both the text and the extensive footnotes accompanying it. But let the reader beware: this book is essentially a dry political and military history with some legal, theological, and economic history thrown in for good measure; even the literary history mentioned above limits itself to documents of historiographical value. The author did compensate for the lack of written coverage of the arts and architecture by including nice illustrations of Byzantine structures and artwork. Even as this revised edition was published almost 30 years ago, &quot;History of the Byzantine State&quot; remains a much-revered classic among Byzantinists."},{"Title":"History of the Byzantine state","review":"George Ostrogorsky's book covers all Byzantine history from Diocletian and Constantine to the fall of Constantinople in 1453. It is, moreover, intelligible and useful to the nonspecialist with only a broad historical background. Its particular value is that it imparts an understanding of the *process* of Byzantine history, especially in three key periods. First, the transformation of the decrepit East Roman Empire to a viable state able to withstand great adversities and heavy defeats. Second, the reinvigoration of that state after the iconoclast crisis and its rise to great power. Finally, the unintentionally suicidal policies adopted after the death of Basil II, which led to the breaking of Byzantium's back only fifty years later. Ostrogorsky's copious footnotes - happily, not endnotes - are especially useful because they cite many arguments and authors with which Ostrogorsky himself disagrees. Thus he provides easy access to views other than his own. There are a few minor irritants in the softcover edition, the absence of most of Ostrogorsky's excellent maps being the main one. There is also some little use of untranslated and untransliterated Greek. But neither deficiency adversely affects the book's overall value."},{"Title":"History of the Byzantine state","review":"Ostrogorsky has put together a good single-volume survey of the thousand years of Byzantium. The tale begins, standardly, with Diocletian and Constantine, and ends with the fall of Constantinople in 1453. He takes an omniscient view of Byzantium, focusing neither on the lives and deeds of the Emperors nor the cultural and religious developments, but telling a well-balanced narrative. In that it serves as a useful introduction. However, Ostrogorsky writes without any passion, and fails to humanize the major figures. There are, though, several excellent maps that put others to shame. In all, the book is worth owning for the factual narrative and great maps. If you are looking for an impassioned and entertaining story you should pick up John Julius Norwich instead."},{"Title":"History of the Byzantine state","review":"Ostrogorsky's History of the Byzantine State is an excellent book for the scholar, as well as the interested reader to use for any understanding of the history of the Byzantine Empire. Well written, concise, and thoroughly interesting, Ostrogorsky depicts the transition of a multi-cultural Late Roman Empire, to a smaller but more centralized and powerful Byzantine State, that became the cultural Renaissance for Eastern Europe and the Near East. Anyone wishing to expand his/her knowledge on this important time in history will not be disappointed to read this work"},{"Title":"History of the Byzantine state","review":"This book is a well presented overview of the political history of the Byzantine Empire. Therefore, it suffers from the same problems as most other political history books, it fails to take into account important non-political developments. For instance, the Plague of Justinian is not mentioned. One would thing that a sixty percent mortality rate in Constantinople would earn at least a passing glance. However, the author/publishers are not responsible for the woeful inadquecies of political history. The problem with the book lies in the bizarre lack of maps. (I have the Rutgers University Press, Fourth Paperback Printing, 1995.) There are only two maps (p. 289 and 521). They are both of the Balkans. There is not a single map of Anatolia in the entire book. Why would anyone publish a book in English for a western audience on the Byzantine Empire and not include a single map of Anatolia?"},{"Title":"History of the Byzantine state","review":"Ostrogorski's History of the Byzantine State does a great job describing the relationship between the state, the civil and military aristoracy and small holders.He starts this theme during the early tenth century and carries it forward to the end of the book. It is a story of how the state becomes less and less able to defend itself against the aristocracy.While other writers speak of Ostrogorski's lack of passion about Byzantium's last centuries, this is also an advantage because it allows him to focus on political and military causes of the Empire's decline after 1025.A few years ago I read Vassliev's two volume book on Byzantium and enjoyed it very much. In particular, those looking for a lengthy discussions of culture would do better with Vassilev.But it was only after reading Ostrogoski that I got a clear understanding of the political change after the death of Basil II (and the role of Psellus in them), the wars against Michael VIII after the recapture of Constantinople in 1261 and fourteenth century civil wars.In addition, this is a very well written book. In particular, Ostrogoski does a great job of starting his paragraphs with short, pithy topic sentences. He is also very good at drawing broad comparisons across Byzantine history (Vassilev, by contrast, tends to get caught up in details).In sum, while I am glad I read Vassilev first, Ostrogoski's book has given me a much stronger sense of the outlines of Byznatine history."},{"Title":"History of the Byzantine state","review":"\\"Roman political concepts, Greek culture, and the Christian faith were the main elements which determined Byzantine development. Without all three the Byzantine way of life would have been inconceivable. It was the integration of Hellenistic culture and the Christian religion within the Roman imperial framework that gave rise to that historical phenomenon which we know as the Byzantine Empire.\\" Thus begins the first paragraph of George Ostrogorsky's masterful narrative of Byzantine history. As this quotation demonstrates, Ostrogorsky's writing is a model of erudition, clarity, and efficiency. It would be hard to improve the quality of his prose, and he maintains this level of scholarship throughout the 500+ pages of main text. But the writing has a natural fluidity which carries the reader along rather effortlessly throughout the full span of East Roman/Byzantine history, from 284 A.D. (rise of Emperor Diocletian) to 1453 A.D. (fall of Constantinople to the Turks). Ostrogorsky gives this inherently rich and fascinating material the virtuoso treatment it deserves, and the reader is rewarded on every page by Ostrogorsky's efforts.Of course, readers of this English translation from the original German of the 3rd edition (1963) of Ostrogorsky's \\"History of the Byzantine State\\" owe an immense debt to Professor Joan M. Hussey, whose rendering of the German into English is a masterpiece in its own right. Moreover, through the collaboration of Professors Ostrogorsky and Hussey, the truly extensive references and footnotes have been brought up to date from the 1940 German 1st ed. to the 1967 time-frame of Hussey's 2nd English edition presented here. Of course, in the intervening 40+ years a veritable explosion in the fields of Late Antique and Byzantine studies has taken place, but Ostrogorky's mastery of the original sources, and the German, French, Italian, English, and Slavic secondary literature will not soon be replicated.\\"History of the Byzantine State\\" is a delight to read, and is divided into 8 main chapters. These chapters are respectively subdivided into numbered sections, and both chapters and sections are clearly titled, so that the breadth of Byzantine History is clear through a glance at the Table of Contents.Other reviewers have complained that Ostrogorsky's writing is dry and lacks a \\"human touch.\\" I found the opposite to be the case: \\"History of the Byzantine State\\" has a cogency and beauty of style, and is a model of articulate scholarship. And with such rich material as the myriad colorful historical human figures and locales which populate Byzantine history, it would be difficult to render this history in a boring fashion. Ostrogorsky's emphasis is the political narrative, but he does not ignore social and cultural aspects of Byzantium, and upon finishing his book the reader has a sense of a complete picture of Byzantine history and civilization. In the paperback version now standard the maps are incomplete, but this is easily remedied by consulting an historical atlas or the Internet."},{"Title":"History of the Byzantine state","review":"Recommended for anyone serious about understanding the Byzantine Empire in depth. A richly detailed examination of of both the topic and its historiography."},{"Title":"History of the Byzantine state","review":"This presents too much material to absorb. There are too many names, places, parties, and so on. But it is what I wanted: a sweep through the political history of the Byzantine Empire. Unfortunately, it doesn't have enough maps (just two of the Balkans late in the book), and it's very badly copy-edited."},{"Title":"History of the Byzantine state","review":"This book covers the whole history of the Byzantine state from aound 400 to its collapse in about 1400.The good part of the book is that in a compact way it covers the major political events over that 1000 year period. The not so good part is that it assumes knowledge about many peoples that contribute to the story.When I read \\"The Histories\\" by Herodus I had a terrible time getting through the part on the Scythians. That is because I had know idea who they were. I went to the Net and found a reference to them that was just a few paragraphs, that they were Indo-European, that they may have invented horseback riding, that their decendents still lived in the Cacus mountians. After that I was interested in them and had not trouble reading the material.I say this to point out the biggest drawback of this book. There is no mention of the ethnographic or linguistic relationships between the various groups. Today it is important that Serbs and Russians are enthnically close. This books doesn't give a hint of these kinds of relationships. That makes it more difficult to remember the information.However, it is still a valuable book to help understand the events that made the world the way that it is. It is scrupulous about its sources and there is no question that the information is as accurate as possible."},{"Title":"Blood & Black Lace","review":"Whilst directors with supposed \`artistic' integrity like Pasolini, Vischonti and Rossellini were making films to please a middle class audience of academics and stuffy critics, the real face of Italian cinema was murder mysteries dominated by sex, violence and fetishism. The so called Giallo film cleaned up at the box office and in the early 1970's supplanted the Spaghetti Western as Italy's most successful export. The films were often visually inventive and made no narrative sense whatsoever, but that was the inherent beauty of them. Naturally the majority of these films were terrible, but the exceptions were always worth it. With the advent of DVD and with companies like Blue Underground and Anchor Bay releasing hard to find Giallo's, the time was particularly good for Adrian Luther Smiths BLOOD AND BLACK LACE. Sadly a lot of the information given in the book refers to Video Cassettes, so as a purchasing guide, it isn't particularly helpful. But Smith compensates by providing accurate running times, titles and production credits. This does make the task of tracking these titles down easier. Because of the sheer number of films in this guide, the synopsis and review are very brief, but the guide is presented in a helpful A to Z manner. I was surprised to find Nicholas Roeg's DON'T LOOK NOW included, I acknowledge the film owes a debt of gratitude in terms of narrative, but surely a film produced by a Hollywood studio should be omitted.Generally speaking this is a sterling effort, even if most of the films contained within you would never have heard of. THE DARK SIDE and Allan Bryce the magazine's editor continue to publish some of horror genres most arresting and needed resources. And as ever the book is filled with wonderful full colour images."},{"Title":"Blood & Black Lace","review":"This is a great book -- lots of titles, good critiques, and it doesn't give away the endings. Two drawbacks, though, and they're serious. One, it's copyrighted 1999, which means the availability listings are WAY out of date. And two, the binding is garbage. The book started falling apart the first time I opened it. It belongs in any serious fan's library, but just be aware of what you're getting."},{"Title":"Blood & Black Lace","review":"First, the positive:Their are very few books available pertaining to this subject matter, the Giallo film. What makes this one such an absolute winner is in the fun manner in which it was written, coupled with the fantastic (and often, fantastically lurid!)rare color reproductions of the various film posters, lobby cards and other promotional materials used for these releases. The author starts with a brief synopsis followed by his own personal assessment of the entertainment value of each individual film.Obviously very subjective, but makes for a fun read.Also included are the credits for each film, containing the various alternate (language) titles which will invariably confuse many not as familiar with the genre.Some may argue that the book is quite outdated (published in 1999), but taking into account that the genre's heyday was in the 1970s/80s this is still an outstanding reference guide for those not as familiar or are new to the Giallo. Believe me, their are still TONS of worthy titles from this bygone era still waiting for a DVD release!So, what's NOT to love?? The one negative is in the very poor binding. I am a collector and treat my books with the utmost care. My copy has long ago fallen apart and is now just a collection of loose pages stuffed between the covers. This book is meant to be used, but I would seriously consider this before spending the outlandish asking prices I've seen recently for this book."},{"Title":"Blood & Black Lace","review":"Lovers of giallo cinema: this book must be a gift from the Gods!

The countless photos he provides on each page are of very high quality and in colour. The book itself is printed on glossy yellowish paper...to give the \\"giallo feel\\".

Films are listed under variant titles, too, to aid you in searching for DVDs from overseas. The only problem I have with my copy is the binding is giving way and pages are starting to fall out, but that may be largely due to how frequently I've used it to research new and unusual films."},{"Title":"Looking for trouble: SAS to Gulf command : the autobiography","review":"General Sir Peter De La Billi&egrave;re ranks amongst the greatest of post-World War Two British military commanders. He served in every conflict from Korea to the first Gulf War and ended that career as a full General with two Knighthoods (Knight Commander of the Bath and Knight Commander of the British Empire - the latter of which superseded the CBE awarded previously) a DSO, two MCs and a Legion of Merit. He was in charge of the British special forces who so successfully stormed the Iranian Embassy in London in 1980 bringing swiftly to an end that very public siege. In 1990 he was the British Forces commander under General Norman Schwarzkopf in the first Gulf War. It is interesting to note that he failed Staff College (a pre-requisite qualification for higher military office.) at his first attempt.In this book, which has caused something of another storm - if only because the SAS do not like people writing about their activities (especially former members of the Regiment), the General tells it exactly as it was. As another reviewer said \\"it should be essential reading for anyone seeking to lead people\\" - and not just military personnel.Leadership and responsibility are, by their very nature stressful activities - especially for those who care. Whilst not wishing to belittle - in any way whatsoever!, the stress associated with civilian occupations, stress under fire is probably the greatest stress of all. As General Norman Schwarzkopf said when being interviewed on television; \\"It doesn't take a hero to order men to their deaths!\\" It was that single statement which revealed \\"his\\" own caring nature.Of course, there was a time when British (and other) generals did order men to their deaths in their hundreds of thousands. Today, that particular carnage is remembered as the trench warfare of the First World War. From this book, we are able to learn and understand the intricacies, professionalism and technical detail of how the SAS approach specific problems, how they deal with matters - even those which do not require soldiers operating in covert situations, and, in so doing, we learn how being a general has evolved since those unforgivable times of 90 years ago.Having once been attached to the SAS, I can certainly say that no state secrets are betrayed here. Instead we have an understanding of how and why certain people, with a certain background, adopt a very different approach to certain problems. It's all in the training, it's all a matter of understanding the principles involved and when those leaders of people from non-military occupations read this book, they too will begin to understand the very concept of leadership itself.I thoroughly recommend this book. It is written by a great man who will always prefer the background to the spotlight for that is his nature.NMRetired British Army Major"},{"Title":"Looking for trouble: SAS to Gulf command : the autobiography","review":"The commander of the British force in the Gulf War 1990, Peter de la Billi&egrave;re, starts from his childhood, to finish with his retirement from the army after the Gulf War.

What is unacceptable behavior on civy street, is very desirable, tough and resourceful behavior in the special forces. Among the proliferation of books about the SAS, this is the definitive account on this special force - de la Billi&egrave;re was its commander and then director, he should know a thing or two about it, although he still cannot write it all.

As soon as his last book - Crazyladies of Pearl Street - was available, I purchased a copy, and the first half of the book kept me spellbound.Unfortunately, as the book progressed, I began to see Trevanian as a bitter, angry socialist, possibly because of his own failures in early life, possibly because of his mother's poverty, who knows? At any rate, the Trevanian who I had grown to love became a stranger to me - I just never perceived him to be so un-American, his previous books certainly didn't give any hint of that.Quite a bit of the anti-American, anti-Republican, anti-Bush, anti-business sentiment is expressed in the \\"cybernotes\\" that are published on Trevanian's website. I wish I'd never begun to read those notes, and indeed stopped reading them about 3/4 through them - it was just too much to read how he hated my country and its leaders.I guess Trevanian felt that he was safe in letting the cat out of the bag in his final book, since he was already in very poor health at the time. I only hope that his illness affected his mind, and that the author I enjoyed so much in \\"Summer of Katya\\" and \\"Incident at Twenty Mile\\" had left long before \\"Crazyladies\\" was written."},{"Title":"The Crazyladies of Pearl Street: A Novel","review":"As a long-time fan of Trevanian, I came to The Crazyladies of Pearl Street with the usual anticipation reserved for favorite authors.

For those of us who don't care who Justin Bieber is, the references to older, simpler times is charming. The funniest on-going gag is the mother's constant malapropisms.

I didn't want it to end."},{"Title":"The Crazyladies of Pearl Street: A Novel","review":"When picking up the latest by Trevanian, a reader must bear in mind that Trevanian is a versatile author and that his latest may resemble nothing he has written before. Yet he is one of those rare authors who succeeds, no matter what genre he tries. If you read The Crazyladies of Pearl Street expecting a spy novel like Shibumi, you will be disappointed. If you are a curious reader, expecting to be stimulated and entertained, and to appreciate a good prose, then you will find what you are looking for here.The Crazyladies of Pearl Street is an autobiographical book (sort of), which is narrated by the young Jean-Luke. The story beings with Jean-Luke, his mother and his sister Anne-Marie arriving at Pearl Street, basically a slum. His health-wise fragile, mood-wise fickle mother has received a mail from her husband asking them to join him in Albany. But we never meet the man. We learn that he is a conman, appearing for brief periods of time, enough to charm the mother and get her pregnant, then disappearing, never to be heard from again for many years. So begins the life of this small family on Pearl Street. It is actually the story of an impoverished family on welfare, hardly affording anything, feeding on what the government can spare them. But for a story of such destituteness, it is not a depressing one. Quite the contrary it is filled with nostalgia for a whole different time, when radio and going to the movies supplied the sole entertainment, when America learned to grow up with World War II, when even the soon to be criminal boys of ghetto did not swear. It is a real story that takes you to the 30s and 40s America. Yet I think the trick here isn't that those were the good old days, but that these are the childhood memories of our author. Like every other childhood memory, this one has a longing you can associate with, even though you have never listened to a radio show that did not include pop music in your life. I can only imagine that such childhood memoirs can be very boring as the subject of a novel, but this one's written by Trevanian and not even for one sentence does it lag. From the first page to the last, it is captivating. I love it when a novel can transport me to a time and place I have never been, and does it so successfully that I do not feel like a stranger for one minute, and Crazyladies of Pearl Street does just that.For Trevanian fans, this novel is double fulfilling because it gives you an insight into the mind of this mysterious author. I thoroughly enjoyed reading his takes on radio versus television, IQ tests, religion, contemporary American politics... Some of which are in his cybernotes, not in the novel.Highly recommended to Trevanian fans and non-fans alike."},{"Title":"The Crazyladies of Pearl Street: A Novel","review":"What I love about Trevanian is that it's impossible to label him an any way. Like John le Carre he evolves, he matures and his language and prose reach the level of a true master. Trevanian understands the Japanese concept of \\"the way\\" (the \\"do\\" of ju\\"do\\", ken\\"do\\", aiki\\"do\\" etc) and constantly improves his superb writing skills. If he were is Japan I am sure he'd be named a living national treasure by now. The Crazyladies of Pearl street is evidently autobiographical and written by a man whose age blurs recent events but sheds new light and sharpens what happened more than seventy years ago. If someone is looking for a story, suspense or drama (as in the Sanctions, the Incident at 20 mile, Shibumi) would be (wrongly) disappointed because Crazyladies is more of a painting than a book. A painting so vivid and so artfully done that the reader is transported seventy years ago and lives every moment. It is also a strong distillate of knowledge and wisdom by one of the most formidable authors alive today. Contrary to e.g. Shibumi, Crazyladies is not a book written for the average reader. However, it would be an immense source or pleasure for its intended audiance. Let us hope that we'll get some more from Trevanian."},{"Title":"The Crazyladies of Pearl Street: A Novel","review":"this is sort of more a collection of short stories than a proper novel. there isn't much of a formal plot, issue development, and resolution type of thing going on.what you have is maybe a couple hundred well-rendered vignettes, set in 1930's Albany NY amidst the hardships of the Depression Era,some of which are made quite moving by the realization of how deeply he loved life, and other people. It's a very compassionate novel, in my opinion.trevanian had the rare (and sought-after) gift of being able to quickly put an idea, that most of us are still forming in the unconscious, into a sentence of a few carefully-chosen words.every few dozen pages you might exclaim \\"that's exactly what i was thinking\\" or \\"yes, that's very true\\" or \\"that's very well-said.\\"I say \\"had\\" because unfortunately Trevanian (pen name of Dr. Rodney William Whitaker)passed away recently, Dec 14 of 2005).This is his last novel.i find him, in crazyladies of pearl street, to be reminiscing a childhood in amazingly minute detail. that's what this is. don't expect some complicated novel that resolves some gigantic issue, this is just a fragmented (how do you remember your own early childhood if not in separate snapshots?) series of stories: well-crafted, tender, compassionate, quite human, very American, uniquely Trevanian."},{"Title":"The Crazyladies of Pearl Street: A Novel","review":"I must admit that this story brought back my childhood in the South Bronx. The accuracy of life during the depression could only have been described from personal experience, and I wanted to write to Trevanian to tell him how much I enjoyed his autobiography, for it could not have been anything else. Later I learned that this was so, but that he had died in 2006.I have purchased several copies and sent them to family and friends who also experienced the 1930s when they and their families struggled to simply put food, any food, on the table; and children worked at any menial job that paid a few cents to assist.When Travanian talked of shining shoes, delivering newspapers, carrying parcels, hiding and reading in the public library, all was familiar to me and my brothers.The book is also very readable and enjoyable... as most of his are."},{"Title":"The Crazyladies of Pearl Street: A Novel","review":"Although this is listed as fiction, the details of Jean-Luc Lapointe's rough childhood in an Irish slum in Albany ring too true to be imaginary. The boy's escape came through hours of solitary story games where he plotted and acted all the characters. The responsibilities of helping his often-ill mother and vulnerable little sister weighed heavily on him during the depression years and the outbreak of WWII.A nitty gritty bio that draws you in the way Angela's Ashes does. I became mesmerized by the flow of words and the pictures he evoked.I've not read Trevanian's highly touted novels (Shibumi, The Eiger Sanction, etc.), but think I should give them a try after seeing his wonderful effort here."},{"Title":"The Crazyladies of Pearl Street: A Novel","review":"Absolutely loved this book. It allowed me to experience youth as it used to be and life as the struggle that just living was in times past. I'm hoping for \\"the rest of the story\\"."},{"Title":"The Crazyladies of Pearl Street: A Novel","review":"THE CRAZY LADIES OF PEARL STREET was, for me, a happy trip down memory lane. With references to some of my favorite programs during the golden days of radio...a time when one could escape the boredom of hot summer days by listening to the adventures of \\"The Green Hornet\\" or \\"The Shadow\\", when you could ride with the \\"Lone Ranger and Tonto\\", go on \\"A Date with Judy\\" or be scared out of your wits by \\"Inner Sanctum's\\" squeaking door or sit in a darkened room listening to \\"Lights Out\\". This story recalls a time before television and computer games when one need only an imagination and an inexpensive radio to enjoy hours of entertainment. I'm just old enough to remember those days, but even if your not, you are still sure to enjoy this semi-autobiographical look back at an earlier time in our country's history.Set in Albany, New York in the years prior to and following WWII this story is a retrospective look at a simpler time when most people were \\"poor financially\\" but \\"rich in spirit\\". Narrated by Jean-Luc Pointe, it tells of his life growing up in a poverty stricken neighborhood with his emotionally strong but physically weak mother Ruby and his sister Anne-Marie as they struggle to survive when his \\"charming, con-man\\" father deserts them yet again. Luc is forced to become the man of the house at the tender age of six, a position that he alternately relishes and resents. Filled with memorable characters like Mrs. Cox - the teacher who first recognizes Luc's talent for story-telling, Mr. Kane - the Jewish grocer who extends credit, keeps track of purchases on \\"his slate\\", and provides the luxury of a \\"pay phone\\" (the only telephone in the neighborhood), Mrs. McGivney the lonely woman who spends her days tending to her catatonic husband and who relies on Luc for her only companionship, Ben the cowboy who lives upstairs and other peripheral characters like Aunt Lorna, her slimy husband and his shady associates all add to the tone and texture of this beautiful word tapestry.If you appreciate wonderfully descriptive writing and are subject to bouts of nostalgia then Trevanian is the writer for you and THE CRAZY LADIES OF PEARL STREET is a reading experience that will fill enfold you like a warm cozy blanket and fill you up like a hearty meal."},{"Title":"The Crazyladies of Pearl Street: A Novel","review":"I am a Trevanian maniac.

More closely resembled something my cat coughed up than Shibumi. Reading this new one, I was praying for the end of the world, just so I didn't have to finish the book. I finally tossed it aside after three hundred pages. Look, I understand that Trevanian prides himself on being a master of every genre. Maybe I was the only one who loved Incident at Twenty Mile.

They have enough to deal with with her autistic twin brother Adam. Harry Roth has always been a rude, cool kid who had his kicks by teasing Alison and her brother and torturing his father. But then one day at camp an accident leaves Harry in a wheelchair and even more bitter than usual. Alison recognizes that in a different way her family ignores her too and she procedes to try and be friends with Harry despite his protests.

At nearly 14, she has a twin brother who has severe autism and is an easy mark for a bully named Harry Roth.Alison's life changes when a great-uncle she barely knew died at age 93. Her father decides that to honor his uncle's memory, their family will become regular attendees at their local synagogue. Harry Roth's father is the Rabbi at that synagogue.One's heart goes out to the Rabbi. Harry is openly rude to him; insults Alison and her family; ridicules Adam and storms out of the synagogue. Rabbi Roth is at a loss as how to cope with Harry; a widower who mourns for his late wife, Rabbi Roth has no idea of how to bridge the communication gap with Harry. He is devastated that his own son refuses to observe the Sabbath and attend Temple.Alison remains at sword's points with Harry; an accident Harry sustains at a summer camp has a drastic impact on them both. The day of Harry's accident, Alison's mother storms into Rabbi Roth's office with Alison in tow to blast him out for not accepting Adam in the local Hebrew School. She wishes him ill; she wishes his child were more challenged than Adam.When Harry returns from camp paralyzed from the waist down, it is Alison and the Rabbi who join forces for Harry. The Rabbi offers to tutor Adam in Hebrew for his impending Bar Mitzvah; Alison offers to spend time with Harry and brings him books. Their relationship remains thorny until Harry acknowledges why he has been tormenting the Shandling twins and just what his Jewish faith really means to him and to his father.Alison has a parallel issue of parental communication; she feels that the only thing that stands in her favor is that she does not have the severe autism her brother has. After some soul searching on her part; the Shandlings' part and even that of the Rabbi and Harry, bridges are built and gaps are filled. No promises are made, and the rich dialog and excellent writing are what make this book so wonderful."},{"Title":"Are You Alone on Purpose?","review":"This was Nancy Werlin's first book, which is glaringly obvious in some ways, as her writing has drastically improved since this book's publication. Instead of the supernatural books she's recently been putting out, this squarely fits into the realistic YA box. The book itself pushes the envelope, even looking at the title, with more provocative language than you'd see in many books. It all serves an important purpose (no pointless swearing or anything like that), and in the end, emphasizes the importance of certain scenes with that content, making it far more realistic than many YA books on the market. I spent a great deal of time while reading this book thinking about how drama-starved we are as readers. Werlin's book moves along at a slow pace, I will say that, but it depicts the average life of an average teen, making it a book readers can truly relate to. The main character, Alison, has her own set of challenges, as does everyone else, but they're not overdone for the sake of gratuitous drama, and for that, I have to thank Werlin. Some of the story gets buried beneath the many messages this book tries to send, and the middle seemed to drag on endlessly, but the end result is really worth it. Some of the plot points end on ambiguous, unresolved notes, but the ending of the story was breathtaking.Rating: 3.5/5"},{"Title":"Are You Alone on Purpose?","review":"This book was definitely TOO SHORT. A one-afternoon-long book is not definitely long enough. Not even close.I had this book in my wishlist for a very long time, but I couldn't make myself buy it, because, for me, the characters felt just too young to empathize. However, once I started reading, that was not a problem. Not a problem at all.Beautiful (though too short) love story, with the cute, serious prose that is definitely the trademark of Nancy Werlin. After reading (and, more important: enjoying) three of her books, I'm definitely going to lose all shame and include the rest of her books, finally, in my to-read list."},{"Title":"Are You Alone on Purpose?","review":"I bought this for my 17 year-old daughter.

His analysis of poverty as the result of an export oriented model (as opposed to an economy focused on its own needs, such as that of the U.S., ever since its beginning) became a classic that effected all economic thought in Brazil. Furtado's focus goes from the early XVI century Brazil until the Vargas years of import substitution and industrialization. I strongly recommend this book to any American who wishes to go beyond the usual prejudices about South America and understand some of the issues that lead to under-development. A nice complementary reading is Maria da Conceio Tavares's writings about import-substitution."},{"Title":"Snowshoe Trek to Otter River","review":"This IS an awesome book With two courageous boys fighting for survival in an action packed wilderness adventure. there are 3 stories in this book. I could not put it down once I picked it up!"},{"Title":"Snowshoe Trek to Otter River","review":"While ostensibly a book for younger readers, these three slices of life can be enjoyed by any adult reader with a love & appreciation for the natural world. Author David Budbill is an acclaimed poet & playwright, as well as a student of Zen, and all of that shows in these brief but lovely pages.As far as plot is concerned, the book jacket sums it up succinctly:Snowshoe Trek to Otter River:Daniel's spunk and patience help him battle disaster when the river ice cracks and he plunges into the ice-clogged river.Float Down the Tamarack:Daniel and Seth search for a hidden pool and are rewarded with glimpses of a giant woodpecker, a colony of beaver and the catch of a large trout.The Last Days of Brightness:On a dare, Seth stays overnight in the lonely north woods, faces unknown perils, dines on cattail roots, wintergreen tea and roasted trout to replace the supplies he forgot. His success leaves him with unforgettable memories.What makes this far more than just another \\"Nature is pretty\\" story is the calm, intelligent, deeply felt tone of the prose, which puts the reader directly into the boots of these two boys. It conveys not only the beauty & wonder of the natural world, but also its vastness & power. All of this is done with remarkable simplicity that becomes quietly lyrical in its utter clarity, like a still pond reflecting everything without any need of embellishment.

Behavior problems such as housetraining (lack of it), destructive behavior, fears & phobias are addressed. The book provides detailed, science-based information about aggression. Additional topics include electronictraining, clicker training, and puppy temperament testing. In Vol. 3 Lindsay has done a magnificent job combining science with a practical approach that can be easily used by practitioners.This 3 volume series, the writing of which was a 25 year labor of love, sets Lindsay apart as perhaps the leading scholar in the field today.

Steve Lindsay has put together a comprehensive study of the physiology of dog behavior, how environment, diet, genetics, hormones and more affect behavior and how dogs learn and why they behave as they do, both what we want them to learn to do and wish they would never do.He has information to help prevent problems, enhance dog owner relationships, troubleshoot problems and how to solve them.If you could only read one book on dog training, make it this one, far surpasses the rest.We've trained and bred Dobermans for 21 years and wish we'd had this one to start with."},{"Title":"Handbook of Applied Dog Behavior and Training, Vol. 3: Procedures and Protocols","review":"The weighty price tag might limit this title to all but the most serious pet library holding, while its nearly 800 pages of information will appeal to professionals rather than casual owners - but any serious dog trainer will find Handbook Of Applied Dog Behavior And Training V. 3: Procedures And Protocols essential.

Unlike most dog training books, these volumes are unique in that they do not describe the author's pet method for training a dog. Rather, Lindsay has collated information from scientific studies in order to give the reader an unbiased, scholarly reference guide to dog behaviour and training methods.The information contained here is exhaustive, unbiased, up-to-date and very well researched. Although the books are an intensive read (to say the least!), Lindsay's style is very readable, and the books contain many diagrams and photographs to elucidate his points.Although most useful as a complete set, since the later books reference material and methods covered in the earlier volumes, it is not necessary to read the first books before using the last. The material is well separated into topics and each chapter can stand alone."},{"Title":"Handbook of Applied Dog Behavior and Training, Vol. 3: Procedures and Protocols","review":"First lets say loud and clear: This is a great book to understand dog's behavior. It has absolute credibility since it is backed up by years of research and experience.I bought it in part influenced by other reviews stating this was a \\"COMPREHENSIVE\\" book on dog training and behavior. Not so. You see I looked up the meaning of the word comprehensive. Basically, saying this book is comprehensive is equal as saying it covers everything you would need to know about dog training and dog behavior. Again, it is not the case.Does it cover a lot more than most books? Well, it covers a lot of information... probably more than most books. But it does not cover ALL kind of training. This is important because you might be looking for specific advanced training methods that are just not covered in here. Don't believe me? Just look in the \\"Index\\" and you'll see that many advanced training (sport, protection, guide dog) are not covered.This is the main approach of the author (as I understood and in my very simple own words): Dogs can show very different behavior problems (fearful dog, aggressive dog, etc.). To overcome such problems the dog should receive basic training so that he develops further attention and control of impulses.Of course, it covers much more than just basic training. Basically it addresses a vast amount of dog behavior problems and then show you how to proceed to change the situation.So, the author tells you about basic dog training principles to help dogs overcome behavior issues -which is great! It is just that I expected to find an explanation of advanced training techniques. Still, this book is fabulous and it will certainly be of great help to understand dogs and their behavior.I wish someone could tell me about a book that does cover advanced training techniques.There are a lot of illustrations in the book but most are conceptual maps (or mindmaps if you wish) that try to represent behavior processes. But if you want to learn more about training 101 you might very well feel the illustrations could be way better.The book is certainly a must to become a better trainer or owner and to really begin understanding dog behaviour. So, it sure is a 5 stars book. Probably it is above any thing else written about dogs. I don't know if the others two first volumes cover advanced training techniques or if you should look elsewhere for that. I guess I'll find out latter when I read more books on dog behavior and training.Finally, here is a quote from the author (steven R. Lindsay) that pretty much sums up what this book is about and what are its limits:\\"No compendium of instructions can take the place of competent professional help for properly assesing canine behavior problems and prescribing behavior-therapy and training recommendations. The assessment procedures, instructions, guidelines, recommended devices and uses, behavior-therapy protocols, and training techniques described in Volume 3 assume that the user is appropriately experienced, knowledgeable, skilled, and qualified to apply them in a selective, competent, and safe manner\\".So, don't you dare think this is the only source of information you need. Read everything you can, but the real fact is that you will need to find proper training in a good school and study under the guidance of experienced people. I know that's just what I'll have to do.One last thing, don't fool yourself. This is a book writen with scientific language. I'm sure the publisher must be very aware how scientific language highly reduces the market for the book. I don't have a problem with that because I've read several scientific books. But if you don't like heavy reads... this might be one of them. So, be prepared for that.Ah, did I say I absolutely love this book? It is entertaining, insightful, full of interesting facts about dog behaviour. I just love it! If you love dogs or work with them, this is probably one of the most valuable source of information you can get your hands on!"},{"Title":"Handbook of Applied Dog Behavior and Training, Vol. 3: Procedures and Protocols","review":"I have several dogs and thought it would be good to know a little about how they think things through.

It has two flaws, one of which is the uncertainty of the history of the game. The author tries a \\"shotgun\\" approach by quoting various sources and writers, and leaves the reader with the impression that he is not sure just where Euchre really came from. The other fault I find with this book is the overdone praise that the author pours on his friends, sponsors, and tournament hosts.However, he recovers quite nicely with a solid section of terms and definitions, and continues with several good chapters, including Mr. Lapp's \\"Ten Commandments of Euchre\\". I also liked the section about Loners. Finally, he has a complete chapter loaded with play-by-play analysis of hands as they happended in various tournaments. Some of the actual plays were very strange, but this is how they took place.You will not be disappointed if you get this book. I hope that if and when the author updates The Complete Win At Euchre, he includes a little more information on other variations of the game, and up to date listing on places where to play Euchre on line.

Does anyone play that game at Tournaments? Does anyone play the 2-handed game when they play Euchre with their families or friends?? I thought Euchre was almost always played with 4 players, or sometiomes, 3 players. As for \\"Solitaire\\" Euchre,it sounds interesting, but then again, is there a place on line where you can play this style of Euchre?Then we have the 24 hands in the book. It is clearly said in the book that these hands were played at various Euchre events, and this is how they were played. It is always easy to see how you should have played a hand after it is over with. I enjoyed the stories, and learned from the way hands were played. It helps you learn from the mistakes that did happen in some of the hands. We are all just people, not machines. Other hands were most helpful to improve my way of playing.

What we have here is a popularity contest of sorts. This book is \\"great\\"; this book is \\"so-so\\"; this book \\"stinks\\", and so on, ad nauseum. Let's face it, folks, the game of Euchre is not rocket science. We are not discussing Chess, Bridge, Mah-Jongg, Pinochle, Go, or other games which DO have plenty of skill and strategy. Euchre is a game of psychology, intuition. You have a 24 card deck, five card hands, three hidden cards, and plenty of guesswork. It is a basic game.Let me give you an example with another card game. There are lots of books out there about Texas Holdem Poker. Will any of these books do you any good when you are sitting on two Aces, and the \\"flop\\" has one more Ace, and the guy opposite you with the funny yellow glasses goes \\"all in\\" for $500,000, and you call him with your last $500K, and the River card is the five of hearts? -And he fills a flush and you are eliminated from the tourney? Will Chris Moneymaker's newest book save your derriere here? Will Phil Helmuth suggest that you should have folded because -\\"as it turns out\\", the opponent was going to pull a heart on the \\"River\\"?What makes Euchre a successful game, is that it is easy to learn, plays real fast, and has a strong accent on luck. Having a good partner also helps. The beauty of Euchre is that anyonecan win on any given day.\\"The Complete Win At Euchre\\" is a well-written book, with lots of humor, wit, and interesting illustrative hands. It does fall short in some areas. Then again, just how much can you \\"puff up\\" a simple game? As far as I can see, you don't really need any book to become a great Euchre player. What you do need is a good partner, card sense, aggressive play, and the ability to \\"read\\" your opponents. -And the more you play, the better you will be. - And of course....... drum roll.....You need ...LUCK! (And lots of it). If you can't get a Bower, your game will be sour![...]"},{"Title":"The Complete Win at Euchre","review":"First I will say that this is in fact (sadly) the best Euchre book on the market. It consists of a fairly wide variety of hand situations and strategy as well as tidbits about the history of the game.With that said, this book contains topics and ideas that are good for getting one's euchre brain into how euchre should really be played. HOWEVER, this book leaves a lot of unanswered questions and black holes that really need to be filled.There are also a handful of points Andrews makes that are AT BEST arguable if not blatently WRONG. Things like this really get under my skin considering so many beginners will be reading this book. To start players off with FALSE strategy (yes there is such a thing) seems counterproductive to me. Here's an example:Andrews claims that you shouldn't go alone when your team has 8 points (the game ends at 10 points). While in most cases this is true there are a PLETHORA of situations in which you should ABSOLUTELY go alone. Why? I'll show you one random example...Let's say you're the dealer and the Jack of spades is turned. You pick it up and now hold both Jacks, the 10 of spades, and both red aces (JJ10 A A). You MUST pick this up alone so that you can almost assure your team of making 2 points. Well why not just take your partner too with such a strong hand? Because your partner can HURT your chance of marching and finishing out the game. Here's one way your partner can hurt you (there are multiple ways however)...Lets say the 1st seat opponent leads out the Queen of hearts and your P trumps it (you would have taken it with your ace). Then your P leads back clubs which you are void in. You now trump in with your 10 of spades... and the 1st seat opponent overtrumps you. So much for your almost certain 2 points!It is things like this that the book is missing. Yes it helps with basic strategy, some intermediate skills, and even into some relatively simple \\"advanced\\" plays. But there is really so much more to Euchre that this book fails to make note of.If you read this book will you get better? Probably, assuming you're a beginner or intermediate player. Will it help you if you're an advanced player? I doubt it. My euchre experience has generally been based on online play and I can tell you that I am without question one of the best online (Pogo, Yahoo, etc). Believe me when I say that this book is strictly \\"good\\" but NOT great.Feel free to email me with whatever euchre questions you may have and I guarantee that I will be able to answer them correctly and completely... something Andrews attempts and only comes marginally close to doing.**In Response to Euchre Man IV's Post**I never once claimed that you should always go alone on 8 points. I didn't even infer that you should in MANY or MOST situations. I simply stated an obvious one... one in which your partner has absolutely no chance in helping your team achieve two points. Indeed there are far more situations that you SHOULD take your partner when you have 8 points (duh) because typically your partner will have a positive effect on a given hand. My point was that there are in fact many times where they can hurt you. I assumed that anyone who could follow my initial example could think of other situations on their own... silly me. But here are a couple others you can chew on:-You hold both Js and the three side Aces (or even the two Js and AK A in side suits... although there is SOME chance your partner could help you here.)-You hold JJ+1 and A+1 (there are dozens of varieties of this hand... JJ9 AK, JJK AQ, etc etc etc.)Furthermore, I will return the favor and quote you on a few of your eager yet remarkably uninformative and incorrect statements...\\"Junk! Anyone can \\"stack\\" a hand with one of the bad case scenarios. Here, the left hand opponent leads a red Queen, and your partner hops up with a trump ( a lot of good players will trust their partner here, and throw off a side suit singelton. ) Nothing boils my blood more than to have partner to trump in 2nd seat and blow away my Ace! And of course, your partner just happens to lead your void suit, and your left hand opponent just happens to be void in THAT suit as well. Yeah, yeah yeah...\\"-Okay, so does this mean your partner should lay off with his/her only trump when, for example, they are 3-suited and have no side ace to lead back to you? There are many cases that your partner MUST trump in because it is their ONLY chance at helping your team take a trick in the hand. Of course it would boil my blood as well if they took away my side suit ace winner... hence why going alone is the ONLY correct play. Am I saying that it is impossible to take two points even if you do take your partner? Of course not. But why risk having your partner mess up your sure two points? YOUR PARTNER WILL DO YOU NO GOOD IN THIS HAND! Is that clear enough for you? :) Oh also... you speak as if it would be so MIRACULOUS for a situation like this to arrise. There are only 4 suits in euchre... not 40. It is extremely common for a given player to be void in one or more suits. Trust me, this example is by no means far fetched.Moving on... \\"There are many more instances where your partner can help you than hurt you. In the above example, partner made the wrong guess by trumping, a natural reflex action to be sure, happened to have only one trump, and then made another wrong guess by leading the suit which a designated opponent was void in.\\"-I already mentioned why trumping in on trick 1 is by no means always incorrect. But isn't it correct that your partner could also lead back to you the OTHER suit in which you (the dealer) has a side suit ace in (rather than leading back your void suit and you getting overtrumped)? If so, is there a chance an opponent is void in that suit thus allowing them to trump in? That leaves your partner choosing between 2 \\"incorrect\\" suits to lead back to you (that would mean 2 of 3 suits that haven't been played yet... or 67% chance he will choose an \\"incorrect\\" suit.)These possibilities are quite obvious to advanced players, nevertheless this book is indeed a good tool for those who are beginners or intermediate players.And finally... \\"It's like saying, go alone with the score 8 - 8 if your partner is going to foul you up by having the wrong cards and making the wrong plays when the hand is laid out in a certain way. You have a much better chance of snagging five tricks with your partner's help, than by taking on the two opponents by yourself.\\"-I have already stated a number of situations in which your partner can ONLY hurt your chance at taking two points. Furthermore, in these situations that I have mentioned (specifically the original one for it is the most blatant)... can someone give me a reason to take your partner? Whether these hand layouts are very common or only occasionally seen is irrelevant. To disregard ANY situation in euchre would be ignorant if you are trying to become a better player because every hand and every play relates to other similar situations (after all, only 24 potential cards can be in play and only 20 are ensured to be in play in a given hand... that leaves room for quite a bit of repetition after hours of playing.) That is the basis of becoming a sound euchre player; you must relate past experiences to the cards you hold in your hand at this very moment and then, after a period of time, become aware of how to correctly play similar cards in similar situations.Keep reading euchre books? Sure, go for it. But PLAYING is the only way you will experience the vast number of situations that occur in euchre. So go find some buddies, grab a few brews and have fun!"},{"Title":"The Complete Win at Euchre","review":"The Complete Win At Euchre is an informative and instructional book. Yes, there are three superfluous chapters which could have ommitted. The \\"History\\" section, the \\"Profiles\\" section, and the \\"US Playing Card Story\\" are really not needed; however, the information about Bicycle cards was fascinating. Another chapter on Internet Euchre sites was somewhat incomplete and did not recognize two of the larger on line sites. The rest of the book is terrific, and will improve the game of players of all levels.Harvey Lapp's unique and helpful \\"Ten Commandments of Euchre\\" is great. Lots of good strategy there. The Glossary is very helpful.The illustrative hands at the end of the book are useful and show a play by play approach to the game. I might have tried a few different leads or defenses for three of the hands. Then again, according to the author, each hand was played in the fashion that it was presented. I liked the instructional quizzes and analyses.There is also some good information about live Euchre Tournaments, and the format which is used at most of these events. I have read three other Euchre Books, and I will not use this forum to degrade or crticize these works. Instead, I will suggest to any Euchre player that he / she acquire as much knowledge as possible, and these other books will be helpful.Check this book out - you will be glad you did!"},{"Title":"The Complete Win at Euchre","review":"This book was great and extremely helpful for a beginning player.

The History of Euchre is interesting; however, it seems that Mr. Andrews cannot decide the true origins or roots of the game. The section on the US Playing Card Company is fascinating. The Glossary is very strong. The Standard game of Euchre is well covered; there is not enough information about other variations of the game.I liked the \\"Ten Commandments\\" section by Harvey Lapp. There is also a chapter which gives credits to companies and people who have been an influence in Euchre, or have been connected to the tournaments. Perhaps, a few more names or tributes to more than one other Euchre author could have been added. The section about defense and calls is helpful, but could have been expanded. Ditto for the Internet information.The 25 or so hands at the end of the book are amusing, instructional, and well - presented. Some of the stories were very interesting; others described the play by play of hands from various tournaments and the places where these events were held. Two of the hands had some questionable lines of play; then again, supposedly this is they way that they were played.All in all, this is a good book, and you will enjoy it. I just could not give it 5 stars, as it does fall short in a few areas."},{"Title":"The Complete Win at Euchre","review":"This book covers an introductory to Euchre and it's orgins. He also covers terms/lingo and explains the terminology behind them when applied to euchre. Also there is a section that illustrates hands and you look at each situation and he covers it in a step by step analysis of the play and then discusses the line/course of play. So you have a visual sense and mental sense right before you of how the hand is unfolding and what manuevers are applical in those said situations. This is a good introductory to intermediate level euchre book. Which is sure to help most players take thier game up a level. It's gets you thinking and seeing things in a different perspective and learning these skills is essential and Joe Andrews paves the way. Although Euchre can get a bit more technical he stays away from such and keeps it simple. A very easy read and easy to follow along.

However, the game is well covered.As for the previous post by the \\"Euchre Champion and the 8-8 score scenario\\" (and I quote) -\\"Let's say you're the dealer and the Jack of spades is turned. You pick it up and now hold both Jacks, the 10 of spades, and both red aces (J J 10 A A). You MUST pick this up alone so that you can almost assure your team of making 2 points. Well why not just take your partner too with such a strong hand? Because your partner can HURT your chance of marching and finishing out the game. Here's one way your partner can hurt you (there are multiple ways however)...Lets say the 1st seat opponent leads out the Queen of hearts and your P trumps it (you would have taken it with your ace). Then your P leads back clubs which you are void in. You now trump in with your 10 of spades... and the 1st seat opponent overtrumps you. So much for your almost certain 2 points\\"Junk!

Bruce Franklin has done us a great service by providing us with insights into American society which most of us are too busy or too myopic to see clearly. Franklin's selection of works by America's prisoners from Melville to Malcolm X from O'Henry to Hogan provides a view of America from those who were marginalized by the dominent society. It is important that we as a people see and understand these observations and take them to heart. The introduction by Tom Wicker is as disturbing as some of the collected writings. Wicker, the noted journalist who covered the Attica Riots for the New York Times, lists the hard facts about the prisons of the 1990's. Crammed into warehouses, overcrowded, ignored by social services, the new prisoners are victims of a get tough drug policy which has quadrupled the number of inmates in the United States in the past twenty years, despite a decrease in the overall crime rate. America, the lagest consumer of drugs in the world, is also the largest incarcerator for drug users. Our unenlightened policy has resulted in the United States having more prisoners behind bars that any other nation in the world, including the former Soviet Union. It certainly explains our much bragged about low unemployment rate as well. With two million of our young men locked away in prison, the percentage around to be unemployed is drastically reduced. A boom economy. The unfortunate result of this domestic policy (discounting of course, the two million in prison) are our free young people who are denied adequate educational facilities because prison funds are a priority in the state budget. More and more, prisons are big business: good for construction, good for local employment, good for the politician's statistics, and good for the deep pockets of the correctional specialists. The damage our national prison policy is causing to the fabric of our nation is incalculable and will continue to cause damage for generations to come. Professor Franklin has done his country a great service. But, as previous reviews have shown, many of his fellow citizens would like to ignore this problem and put it out of sight, much like they have agreed to do with two million of their fellow citizens. Shades of the gulag. The delight of this book, however, is that the prisoners'writing shows that, despite being marginalized, despite being crowded, abused, and left to rot in a system of &quot;indeterminate sentences,&quot; some men and women continue to not only preserve their souls, but actually create art and with it the power to move the rest of us to truly see and feel. We are not surprised that the caged bird can sing. We are surprised (to our shame) that it sings so well."},{"Title":"Prison Writings in 20th Century America","review":"H. Bruce Franklin has assembled a remarkable collection of prose and poetry from America's most silenced corner. As a survey of prison literature (both poetry and prose), it educates and questions; as truth from America's most oppressed class of citizens, it is soul-shaking and heart-rending. The selections expose the ugly face of American justice, but also put human faces on its many victims. These days, it isn't popular to want to give prisoners anything, even credit for writing such powerful words. Yet their power cannot be denied. The men and women whose work appears in this book write to communicate their shattered lives with all the passion of any writer in the free world. Their words, sharp as razor wire, are hard to forget, and I commend Mr. Franklin for putting together such an unusual and revealing anthology. -Jeff Evans, Author of Undoing Time: American Prisoners in Their Own Words"},{"Title":"Prison Writings in 20th Century America","review":"The writings in this book gave me an insight into some of the most \\"real\\" experiences in our history.

While many of the works collected herein are deserving of attention and can stand on their own, Franklin's one-note thought process and style ruins one's enjoyment of them. Apparently this is a problem for all of Franklin's works, and the courses he teaches, which often ignore the text and the human reality in favor of his (frequently cardboard leftist) theory du jour.This is no way for a humanist to behave, and of course ultimately it hurts the causes he himself espouses.

It is our duty to record the events such people set into motion. In doing so, David Chandler has written a life's work. The words flow like poetry, the analysis of Napoleon's life and campaigns are rich and supported by facts, few that are even discussed in other works. A monumental addition to any Napoleonic or historical library. Should I teach a class on this subject, this book will be a required text."},{"Title":"The campaigns of Napoleon","review":"levelled at this book and feel much of it is very unjust, allow me to defend it:The most frequent critisism seems to be that it is too 'Pro-British'. I personally found in Chandler someone who deeply admires Napoleon Bonaparte. Chandler's style in writing is he covers all the bases and leaves the reader a certain amount of freedom for interpretation.For example his opening chapter on the issue of ''was Napoleon fundamentally a good or bad man?''. As well as quoting the bad stuff: Jaffa massacre, his rages, The killing of the Duke Of Enghien etc. He also quotes the code Napoleon and puts forth a convincing argument that most of the wars Napoleon fought (Peninsular and Russian campaign excluded) he was forced into by aggressive policy's.That is hardly Pro-British, he argues just as much in the Corsican Ogre route as the Heir to the Revolution route and does it with a in depth prose which leaves us with the full picture.Chandler is deeply critical of Wellingtons early strategy preceding Waterloo, he is critical of the state of the British army (recruitment techniques) and much else.There seems to be a major defence for Napoleon's mental awareness, many aids-de-camp have described there Master well on his Russian campaign. It is a fair statement to say at Waterloo Napoleon was not the same guy as he used to be. I don't see where the debate is in that, How is that pro-British?.Besides he doesn't concentrate much on the Peninsular war so by default the British are not even discussed much beyond Napoleons Continental System against them, Pits coalitions, Moore's retreat and Waterloo (for which he does describe the amount of British involved)Everything else is the Prussians, Russians and Austrians.Someone says ''chandler try's to formalise Napoleons tactics too much'', I find this the most ridiculous charge of all. May I quote from the book:''Napoleonic war was nothing if not complex-a ever-shifting kaleidoscope of moves and intentions''''the most outstanding feature of Napolionic warfare is its limitless variation and flexibility''The author never said Napoleon had one fundamental system, but there are certain key moves and repeated tactics which occurred time and time again, for example his principle that failed at Waterloo in fighting two enemy's by pinning one and destroying the other, we see that on his Italian 1796-97 campaign.Besides it is well know that Napoleon learnt from the pages of books what Frederick the Great, Hannibal and Caesar done before him. Therefore to imply Napoleon never had certain key features in the art of war is to imply he never learnt anything.As for the author undermining Napoleons Marshals, he gives a account (with map) of Aurestadt, he gives a full account of Lannes and Grouchys deaths.The only thing I can think where this criticism comes from is in one small part he describes how Murat would fall behind the men before the full gallop (certainly a necessary precaution). I don't think this denotes Murat's bravery.This book is about Napoleon, if you want to read about 'Napoleons Marshals' you should read Chandlers books with that said title amongst many more..The other charge seems to be it's errors. A work of this magnitude is going to have many errors, either due to the muddy haze of History (for which we will never uncover the truth) or oversight.As to that he'stole' a lot is deeply flawed logic. Previously published books, memoirs etc.. Are the main sources for historians. There is not that many great English language one volume books on Napoleons art of war, just 2 I do believe. That gives good ample reason for this books very existence.Therefore Chandler is at free to borrow from other books knowing he is not taking away someone else's market. Many non-English which had to be newly translated, he quotes all concerned in a comprehensive Bibliography.If Historians didn't do this we would still be reading dated biased Victorian books by Thackery and Macauly.Ultimately even if you disagree with some of what I said above that is fine, but to give this book 1 STAR! Is absurd. A work of this magnitude does not deserve 1, at least give it 3 or 4 and note it's flaws (as many have done)."},{"Title":"The campaigns of Napoleon","review":"I enjoyed this book thoroughly. The maps were excellent, the writing clear. I've read other reviews and there is some question of accuracy of details, but such arguments i'll leave to the professional historians/military folk. I give this book a real thumbs up for the average military reader such as myself."},{"Title":"The campaigns of Napoleon","review":"This volume is usually touted as the best operational study of Napoleon's campaigns. I heartily disagree. The best operational study of the Emperor's campaigns to my mind is A Military History and Atlas of the Napoleonic Wars by Brigadier Vincent J. Esposito and Colonel John R. Elting, published two years before Campaigns came out. This unique volume, which was republished in 1999 by Greenhill in England in the same large format, was designed and written as a text book for cadets at the United States Military Academy, West Point. Not only are the maps outstanding, but the text is one of the best written as a campaign study of any war or series of wars.I have read, and do own, both books. I read the Atlas before I tackled Campaigns and not only is the Atlas much easier to read and understand, it is more to the point and reveals a depth of understanding of both Napoleon and the period that is not evident the Campaigns.One aspect of the book that completely misses the mark is the section on the author's \`analysis' of Napoleon's method of waging war. It appears to be an attempt at putting round pegs in round holes, and goes into some detail of how the Emperor supposedly waged his campaigns. The impression given as the section is read is somewhat pedantic and it generally misses the mark. Napoleon's methods were very simple-he usually struck first, attempted to get into the enemy's rear areas and cut his lines of communication in order to force the enemy to fight at a distinct disadvantage. This is very evident in both the Marengo and Ulm campaigns. At other times, such as in Italy in 1796 and in Belgium in 1815, Napoleon would strategically go on the offensive against a numerical superior enemy and wedge his army between the two halves of the opposing force with the idea of defeating each in detail by bringing superior mass against them one at a time. Sometimes it worked, and sometimes, as in 1815, it eventually did not.However, attempting to codify the Emperor's \`way of war' unnecessarily clouds the issue with unnecessary detail and ends up being confusing as well as being inaccurate overall and painting an inaccurate picture of Napoleonic warfare.Having read both books initially in high school, I was intrigued that one necessarily followed the other with an inferior, though a much longer, work. Both books are very valuable, but to accord Campaigns with the laurels that it has received is to give either short-shrift to the Atlas, or ignore it altogether. That would be a mistake.Campaigns, however, is a valuable book and is recommended to be read and used with care. Some of the references are suspect, such as the alleged memoirs of Bourrienne among others, but overall this is a valuable work, though its use as a definitive source is discouraged."},{"Title":"The campaigns of Napoleon","review":"I read this book and found it to be an excellent history of all of Napoleon's campaigns.

He also uses French phrases with no intrepretation. That criticism aside there is ample use of maps and detailed description of battles and campaigns. As well as the events that caused them. Chandler is sometimes blamed for being pro anglo, but after reading his book you appreciate the awesome ability of Napleon."},{"Title":"The campaigns of Napoleon","review":"This is, without question, the best single volume reference in English on the campaigns of Napoleon. This book is not perfect, and I would agree with some of the negative points made by other reviewers, but I cannot understand how anyone would give this less than five stars. There is simply no other book that is even comparable to this one. This book is to the Napoleonic Wars what Shelby Foote's series is to the American Civil War, absolutely indispensible for any serious (amateur or professional) historian or student of the era.This book is really three books in one: it is partly a biography of Napoleon, partly an analysis of his art of war, and partly a history of his campaigns. It covers NBs youth, his meteoric rise to prominance after the French Revolution, and every campaign that he participated in. I've read this book cover to cover three times, and individual chapters so many times that I've lost count. Chandler's writing style is engrossing and easy to read, not dry summaries of facts and events and dates. He is both a great writer and a great historian.My (or others') disagreements with Chandler on individual points simply do not detract from this masterly work. I would agree, however, that this book is very Anglo-centric, probably its biggest drawback. Historians are often looking for \`balance' in their assessments, and it is in this area that Chandler is weakest. I think he overplays the role of the English in ultimately defeating Napoleon, although this is a problem with virtually everthing that has been written about Napoleon by the English. Oddly, I would also agree that Chandler treats Napoleon with almost hero worship. Too much hyperbole perhaps, but this is more of a literary criticism of the text rather than historical. One negative comment that other reviewers have made regarding this book is that it is either factually incorrect or incomplete/not sufficiently detailed, etc. These are insignificant criticisms in my view. There are no gross historical errors in this book, either in facts or in interpretation, to my knowledge. If you want a balanced, broad view of any historical era, you must read a variety of primary and secondary sources. In the case of the Napoleonic wars, you must read French, German, and Russian sources as well. This book is not the only word on the subject, but the best written in English. This is the BEST book on the subject, this is one of the best histories ever written, even if neither perfect nor exhaustive.I HIGHLY recommend this book. It is WELL worth the money to purchase it and the time spent to read it. If I had to throw out all but ten of my books, this is one of the ten I would keep. I would recommend this book to someone who is not particularly interested in the era, much as I would Foote's series. Don't pay any attention to the reviewers who have given this book less than five stars, they are niggling over trifles. This is an outstanding book."},{"Title":"The campaigns of Napoleon","review":"David Chandler provides a thorough review of Napoleon's 60 battles. He demonstrates that Napoleon, while not an innovator in tactics, was nonetheless a master of innovations developed by others and was capable of great innovation. The subject, of course, is extremely broad, and as long as this book is, it could have been much longer. Chandler omits a great deal of biographical detail about Napoleon to concentrate on his development as a military leader. Indeed, if you find this book too long to read or expensive to buy, I suggest getting a copy from the library and just reading the chapter that gives an overview for how Napoleon went about conducting his campaigns.I do not agree with those who say that Chandler exhibits a British bias. He clearly sees Napoleon as the greatest military leader of his time, and perhaps of all time. In other writings, he has soundly rejected comparisons made by other historians between Hitler and Napoleon. Moreover, he makes clear that, at least in the early years of his leadership, Napoleon was not to blame for the wars that engulfed Europe.Finally, despite the length of the book, I found it to be extremely readable, and not hard to finish at all."},{"Title":"The campaigns of Napoleon","review":"Whilst browsing around a bookshop one day I stumbled across a book by John Elting called &quot;Swords around a throne- Napoleon's Grande Armee&quot;. It looked pretty interesting and as I had no inkling about Napoleon or his Grande Armee I decided to buy the book. After reading it again and again I was hooked!!! I needed more info about the great man and his campaigns. Which brings me to &quot;The Campaigns of Napoleon&quot; by David Chandler.I read numerous reviews and all indications were that this was THE book to get on the subject. Well let me say I was not disappointed. This must be the best one volume treatment of Napoleon and how he wielded his Grande Armee! The book is very thorough and comprehensive...not for beginners. I found I had to read it twice to fully comprehend what was going on. This led me to buy Elting and Esposito's &quot;A military history and atlas of the napoleonic wars&quot;. This book desribed step by step with excellent maps what Chandler had described and more since it dealt with all the napoleonic campaigns and not just the ones in which Napoleon had been involved as does Chandler's work.All in all the above three books are must haves. Swords around a throne describes Napoleon's weapons- his Grande Armee, Campaigns of Napoleon describes the history of his use of the weapon and the atlas desribes how he used it in detail. Get all three!!!"},{"Title":"The campaigns of Napoleon","review":"Could even Shakespeare have imagined the triumph and tragedy that marked the life of Napoleon Bonaparte?Like Caesar, Napoleon rose from obscurity and through sheer determination, utter ruthlessness, and all-consuming ambition to become the ruler of the most powerful nation on earth. And like Caesar, Napoleon's moment of triumph was short-lived, although the Waterloo campaign gave Napoleon the second chance his predecessor could only dream of.David G. Chandler is that rarest of historians who combines the dogged research skills of a born academic with the light writing touch of a master storyteller. While this work is enormous in both detail and scope, it is eminently readable, each page filled with the wonders of the Napoleonic Era.Far from pure biography, Chandler attempts to unravel the genius of Napoleon and explain the man and his times in terms even the military layman can understand. The longevity of this work (published 1973) attests to the success of this endeavor.This book is an excellent choice for the budding military enthusiast, the Napoleonic fanatic, or the reader who wishes to begin his introduction to one of the great captains of history with the finest monograph ever published on the subject. Lavishly illustrated with maps, photographs, and drawings, you'll find The Campaigns of Napoleon to be simply the most accessible work on on of history's great men.Vive L'Empereur! Vive Chandler!"},{"Title":"The campaigns of Napoleon","review":"This is a review of the KINDLE EDITION.The hardcover print edition of this book is 1,100 pages long and weighs 4.2 lbs. So one can see the significant advantage of reading it on a Kindle DX. However, there are two major disappointments with the Kindle edition.1) NO ABLE OF CONTENTS. Are you kidding me? 1,100 pages, SEVENTEEN chapters, divided into sub-chapters, plus (wait for it) Appendices and no ToC? We know the Kindle does not use page numbers, so how is one to navigate this extensive work?2) AWFUL MAP RESOLUTION. Massive fail publisher. The maps are very difficult to see / read, even on the 9.7\\" Kindle DX display. AM I supposed to keep the print edition handy in case I want to reference a map or one of the appendices? Sort of defeats the purpose doesn't it?I know the technology is still maturing, but the publisher and Amazon need to try again."},{"Title":"The campaigns of Napoleon","review":"For anybody wanting just one book to discover the Napoleonic Wars, this has to be the one. It is comprehensive, well written and has many useful maps. As such, it is a most useful purchase.Although it was first written over thirty years ago and is a little dated, no attempts to supercede it have ever been successful. I suspect this work will remain a standard text for at least the next thirty years as well.Like all books, it has it faults. There are those that complain about it being anglocentric. Well, Chandler is British by birth and a graduate of Oxford, so it would be surprising if it wasn't. Would the book have been any better if it had been francocentric or sinocentric? Probably not.There are those that complain that Chandler sees Napoleon as a 'great man, but a great bad man'. It is suprising how many people admire grabbing, egocentric dictators that bring enormous suffering to the world. (I know, he left so many legacies to the world, like a legal system, roads, etc. but did so many people have to die for that?) The fact that Chandler devotes such a massive tome to the man surely indicates a little more than dislike?There are those that whine about minor errors of fact and typrographic errors in this book. Well, if they can do better, they should try.There are also those who complain about a lack of original research. Well, I challenge anybody to write such a massive tome based on primary sources only and complete it in one lifetime. That criticism is banal, to say the least.In all, a great classic, the best place to start for beginners to this period, a work that is not likely to be surpassed for some time, but not without a few minor faults."},{"Title":"The campaigns of Napoleon","review":"Dr. David G. Chandler's \\"The Campaigns of Napoleon\\" has been in print for over thirty years. There must be some reason why it has remained so important and popular. In simple terms it is a masterpiece. In fact it has on numerous occasions been recognized as one of the most important books on Napoleon throughout modern times. It has of late been recognized by le G&eacute;n&eacute;ral de Gaulle in 1967 and later in 2002 by President Vladimir Putin.David, a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society of London and \\"the doyen of modern Napoleonic historians\\", is the former Head of the Department of War Studies at the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst. He is also the author of numerous other books including: Napoleon, Napoleon's Marshals and Dictionary of the Napoleonic Wars.Each of the aforementioned works will be reviewed in time. However, this in-depth review is concerned primarily with the exceptional and scientific achievement of Dr. Chandler's The Campaigns of Napoleon.The work is extensive and covers over 1216 pages and weighs nearly 4 pounds. The text, however, is not fluff but is full of the most scholarly data found on the 60 battles of Napoleon's Campaigns. The book, although large is extremely readable and possesses a clarity of presentation and understanding. David attempted in this extensive work to cover with great detail every aspect of Napoleon's military career. Alas at times the work is a little dry but never boring. The text easily carries the reader from page to page and chapter to chapter. The work never missed its mark.According to the Editorial Reviews \\"Napoleonic war was nothing if not complex -- an ever-shifting kaleidoscope of moves and intentions, which by themselves went a long way towards baffling and dazing his conventionally-minded opponents into that state of disconcerting moral disequilibrium which so often resulted in their catastrophic defeat.\\"David seems to paint a vivid historical picture which brings the reader closer with each page to the thoughts, feeling and decisions of Napoleon. An extensive analysis of the campaigns aids the reader in clarifying Napoleon's military intelligence and war strategies.Some reviewers state that due to Chandlers' British rearing he was bias and always against the decisions of Napoleon and Napoleon the man. However, I believe that the author saw Napoleon as one of the most important men in military history. I see the book as a well balanced thesis on the various textures and colours of Napoleon the man and the varied aspects of the Napoleonic war. It is certainly not bias.\\"The book opens with a brief account of Bonaparte's early years, his military education and formative experiences, and his meteoric rise to the rank of general in the army of the Directory. Introducing the elements of Napoleonic \\"grand tactics\\" as they developed in his Italian, Egyptian, and Syrian campaigns, Mr. Chandler shows how these principles were clearly conceived as early as the Battle of Castiglione, when Napoleon was only twenty -six. Several campaigns later, he was Emperor of France, busily constructing the Grande Arm&eacute;e.\\"A Military History and Atlas of the Napoleonic Wars by Brigadier General Esposito and Colonel Elting, although in some ways a more descriptive work on Napoleon's military campaigns, merely assists in filling in any gaps which Dr. Chandler may have missed. It is NOT better, just different. Neither book, regardless of its size is a true definitive work on the campaigns. Smaller works, containing only one campaign, although providing greater individual campaign insight do not possess the broad balance and military contrast needed to gain any true awareness of the military achievements of Napoleon.The book is an excellent reference tool and should be on the bookshelf of any Napoleonic historian. However I also, like Kevin F. Kiley, noted the questionable references used including: \\"Jomini's work, Liddell Hart's dubious tomes, Marmont's and MacDonald's memoirs, and the dubious memoirs of Bourrienne, which are mendacious and quite worthless, as well as Thiebault's inaccurate ghost written memoirs\\"I fear, however, to give this books a bad review shows ignorance of the topic, a poor reading of the text or a total lack of interest in Napoleon. As Gerald Tamura stated in his review, \\"Most who do will not need to buy another book that covers Napoleon's entire military career. They can spend their hard earned money buying books on Napoleon's individual campaigns, battles, personalities and naval warfare.\\"Dr. Carl Edwin Lindgren, DEdProf of Military HistoryMember of the Royal Historical Society & Fellow of the International Napoleonic Society"},{"Title":"The campaigns of Napoleon","review":"Mr. Chandler is English and does not delight as Americans do in a young republic kicking around the old European nobility. That said, this work is an attempt to cover 20 years of war in one volume. It would take 20 books by various authors to replace it, and therefore is the best starting point for those who do not want to take the time and money to build a personal library on the subject. Note, this is a military history, so it is strong on the movements of corps and divisions and light on Josephine etc."},{"Title":"The campaigns of Napoleon","review":"I asked my partner, a West Point honors graduate who loved Armor, jumping out of perfectly good airplanes and being in NATO intelligence during the Cold War for the \\"Best Book\\" on Napoleon and this is what he recommended to a mere Naval Academy ingenue. I had avoided for years jumping into the broiling waters of Napoleon fanatics and the welter of books taking sides on the man and his works. I wanted something that put Napoleon as a general into prespective without the hype and this book delivered. It was so easy to read. I couldn't leave it behind.I love it as much as Shelby Foote's trilogy on \\"The Civil War\\", William Manchester's \\"The Last Lion,\\" Barbara Tuchman's \\"The Guns of August\\" and John Keegan's \\"The Face of Battle.\\" The scholarship, writing style and information conveyed is as good as history can be. For those who love fiction, I read it in part to better appreciate reading \\"War and Peace\\" next. Chandler was very even-handed in his presentation so as to not distract the reader or detract from the purpose - a keen analysis of the campaigns in the context of the man and his times.It is well worth the money. This is something to buy for your best friends or for other history lovers to whom you owe some great debt of gratitude."},{"Title":"The campaigns of Napoleon","review":"You won't find a better book on the history of the Napoleonic Wars and Napoleon's strategic and grand tactical ideas in the English language. Chandler describes fully each campaign and battle ever personally lead by Napoleon in the greatest detail. His chapter devoted to Napoleon's art of war provides the kind of analysis and synthesis of Napoleon's strategic ideas and battle methods you probably can't find anywhere else. An absolutely fantastic book for anyone interested in either Napoleonic history or the military thought and concepts of one of history's greatest soldiers."},{"Title":"The campaigns of Napoleon","review":"Chandler's work is outstanding in everyway: readability, clarity of presentation, depth of understanding, and the ability to cogently offer it all up to the reader. This book is not for beginners, certainly, for it assumes a basic level of understanding of the Napoleonic era, geography, army organizations, and so forth. However, if you want to reading the single definitive study of Napoleon and his military achievements, this is the volume to own."},{"Title":"The campaigns of Napoleon","review":"If you only pick one book to read about Napoleon and the Napoleonic wars, then this should be the book, or at the very least, one of the book you should consider reading. I can see why Dr. Chandler is (was) considered one of the leading scholars on Napoleonic history."},{"Title":"The campaigns of Napoleon","review":"I purchased this for my husband...it was number one on his wish list. It came before Christmas in excellent condition. When my husband took his initial look through, he was amazed at how much detail there was. This book had been recommended to him by many people who share his interest in Napoleonic era history. He said the author writes exceedingly well and has a fantastic vocabulary. There are lots of visuals in the book as well. Every day he picks up this book and is in awe."},{"Title":"The campaigns of Napoleon","review":"I bought this book after finishing a biography of George Washington, who is often compared to his contemporary, Napoleon, vis-&agrave;-vis their respective quality as military strategists, generals, & national leaders. Why did Napoleon fall into the trap that Washington avoided - clinging to an archaic model of political leadership? I don't know if the book answered that question or not (probably not).Getting through all the campaigns took time, & as others have stated some of the maps were not user friendly. Nevertheless, deciphering them was well worth the effort. Never before have I understood - or cared to understand - the importance of coordination between cavalry, infantry, and artillery.The drama of the gradual buildup to Imperial ascension (including the instructive blunder in Spain) followed by the disastrous Russian campaign with its formidable geographic distances and obstacles, disintegration of overextended supply lines, failure to disregard sunk costs, dogged belief in an unsupported interpretation of the motives and intentions of Tsar Alexander, and finally, the refutation of the myth of defeat by \\"general winter\\" more than repaid the price of the book and the weeks spent reading it.One thing is certain - Napoleon's success was a joint venture. He was a genius and a charismatic leader, but he could not have accomplished what he did alone. Usually, his generals are given some of the credit, which is fair enough; but their post-exile performance deficit raises questions about exactly how much of Napoleon's rising fortune was attributable to their abilities.Toward the end of the book the answer becomes clear. Napoleon was supported not just by exceptional generals but by a Project Manager of unparalleled ability who kept all the levels of planning, implementation, and communication under tight control at all times.The breadth of Berthier's accomplishment is mind-boggling - Napoleon did the high-level specification with his maps & so forth; Bertier coordinated and implemented all the details to make the vision manifest. Anyone who has managed a large scale project under resource-poor, stressful conditions can appreciate the monumental organizational and administrative ability that made Napoleon's success possible: Bertier handled risk assessment, mitigation planning, budgeting, logistics, scheduling, and not the least - ensuring EFFECTIVE communication of directives and changes, which often required skillful interpretation / restructuring / redirection of muddled idiosyncratic orders from Napoleon. All under battle conditions.To do what he did, Bertier had to quickly master Napoleon's strategic designand quickly determine what was needed to make it happen, AND what alterations to make when conditions changed, AND exactly how to communicate the changes so that the correct action would be taken by the generals at the appropriate time.It's not surprising that Berthier wasn't successful managing campaigns on his own; he didn't have a person of equivalent ability to support him. Notice that Napoleon was also unsuccessful without Bertier's support.After his final defeat, Napoleon stated that if Berthier had been with him the outcome of his post-exile battles would have been different. I do not think he was exaggerating. It was simply the truth, although it might have been Napoleon's first full realization of it."},{"Title":"The campaigns of Napoleon","review":"This massive tome is the indispensable work on Napoleonic war. The sweep and depth of Chandler's treatment is outstanding. Whether read straight through or in snippets, it never fails to delight. There is more here than great history, marvelous scholarship and entertaining writing: Napoleon's insights on war, leadership, management and morale, as clearly set forth by Chandler, hold life lessons for all of us. Everyone should read this book, even those without the slightest interest in military history. It has earned a permanent place on my nightstand, the book I turn to whenever I need inspiration, meditation or merely a quiet escape. If I could have only one book, this would be it."},{"Title":"The campaigns of Napoleon","review":"David Chandler, former teacher at the British Military Academy at Sandhurst is often called one of the foremost Napoleonic scholars of modern times. His monumental tome, The Campaigns of Napoleon is hailed as the single best work of its kind and is the work most frequently refered to by lay people. Sadly, this overly and overtly pro-British goliath is filled with a multitude of crucial erors, omissions and misleading statements designed to convice the reader of one of Chandler's main themes; that Napoleon Boboparte was or became insane. Space precludes listing the vast number of mistakes in the book, but a few should suffice. In regards to Napoleon's invasion of Russia Chandler states that his primary source for the strength of Napoleon's army is a work by R. Burton published in England in 1913. An examnination of Burton's work on the campaign of 1812 reveals that Burton's work has neither notes nor a bibliography but &quot;relies&quot; on a handfull of other secondary sources including a work thought to be relaible by many scholars (Bogdonavitch's study of the war)but which is a work that its author says &quot;relies on the word of god almighty&quot; for its athority. In other words, Chandler has no clear idea of the size of Napoleon's army, and thus cannot calculate the number of casualties inflicted by disease, weather, and fighting! A second example is that Chandler states that under Napoleon's &quot;crazed&quot; directions General Junot led roughly 25,000 Frecnh troops to take Lisbon. Chandler paints Napoleon as too psychotic to appreciate the difficulties of the march and then describes how Junot &quot;lost&quot; 23,000 of the 25,000 men ariving in Lisbon with a little more than 1,500; the rest, Chandler implies, are all dead. However, Chandler offers no evidence for his portrait of the event and his version contrasts completely with that of Sir Charles Oman who states in his multi vollume history of the Peninsular War, that while Junot DID arrive at Lisbon with 1,500 men, the reamining 23,000 were spread out along the roads and DID eventualy arrive a few weeks later. A third and crucial example of Chandler's lazyness is his use of the memoirs of Talleyrand, Napoleon's sometime foreign minister. Despite ample evidence that Talleyrand's memoirs are a tainted, biased, and dangerously one-sided view of events, Chandler uses them without reservation to paint Napoleon as a dangerous mad man bent on nothing but conquest for the sake of his own psychotic gratification. Other mistakes abound in what is the most overrated work, in a field, already crowded to the rafters with mistake laden shilobeths. Chandler is at his best when describing events that don't require him to write the historical equivalent of &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; and &quot;Rule Britania.&quot; The descriptions of the major battles and the descriptions of Napoleon's tactis are worth reading. As the book is massive it has the added benifit of covering all of the major battles in which Napoleon took some part. For that it is a worth while refrence text. Beyond that, its obsessively pro-British tilt, its mistakes, and omissions of fact, render it increasingly obselete and, in the hands of those who wont,or can't consulte other works, a dangerously misleading work of propaganda."},{"Title":"The campaigns of Napoleon","review":"If you want to go beyond comic book type of books get some real information on Napoleon, this is your book... It is well written and the battle maps are some of the best I have ever seen.. It will take a couple of minutes to read at over a thousand pages..."},{"Title":"The campaigns of Napoleon","review":"When I purchased this book, I was a complete neophyte in the knowledge of Napoleon Bonaparte. After reading this rather definitive work of David Chandler, I must say I do understand him a bit more.Napoleon was trained in the military to be an artillery officer. He quickly grasped the tactical and later the strategically significant concepts of modern warfare. At a very young age he became a General in the Army of France. His tactics as a small unit leader led way to his promotion at a young age as a General Officer.During the campaigns in Spain he made a name for himself as he recorded military victories. He became a legend. Indeed he was a winner. He became the grand conqueror and won battles in Austria, Spain and onto the heartland of the German Countries.He was relentless in his pursuit of total domination of Europe. He schemed in his campaigns to win his objectives and settle for peace. And like a rubber ball he would set out for his next conquest.While reading this, I started to deduce that these actions resembled the intentions and motives of Adolph Hitler over 130 years later. While Napoleon was a true pedigree in the art of military education, Hitler was but a mere enlisted man with the rank of Corporal.However both of these behemoths sought to conquer Europe. Hitler began with a political usurpation of a Democratic government and escalated his motives to terrorism and finally revolved into a grand Dictatorship. He bullied everyone including his highly competent military staff. Napoleon did the same. He controlled everything from the government of France to his highly competent military staff.In both these leaders they made the same mistake. They underestimated the great bear of Russia.Chandler has opened my eyes. The maps at times are very confusing. However the content is excellent. You must persevere in the reading. Stiff upper lip old boy. After all it was Wellington who won at Waterloo. Five Stars, good job!!"},{"Title":"The campaigns of Napoleon","review":"Others have already stated that this is the definitive single volume book on Napoleon. I am merely agreeing with this assesment. The book is older and some recent research disputes some of the authors views. This is true of any history book that is more than ten years old. What is telling about this book is it is referred to in almost every bibliography from books on the period.David Chandler is a superb historian and a remarkable writer. History books are often dates times and events without much else. David Chandler's books are not that way. He is a storyteller as well as a historian. He uses the facts and documents to craft the narrative that is compelling reading. It is NOT in anyway like a novel except in its ease of reading. Some may argue this point as it is a large volume. I found myself unable to put it down the first time I read it and when I had finished I started over at page one. I return to this book often especially when I am about to read a book about a specific topic on the Napoleonic Period. Reading Campaigns Of Napoleon gives me a backdrop to the book I am about to read. It will be a momentous day indeed when anyone publishes a work to rival this one."},{"Title":"The campaigns of Napoleon","review":"David Chandler's \\"The Campaigns of Napoleon\\" was first published in 1966 but is still often cited as the classic English language interpretation of Napoleon as a military leader. Chandler conducts an extended scholarly examination of Napoleon's military campaigns, including only enough detail of his personal life and political career to provide necessay context. Chandler writes at the operational level of war; cut and thrust accounts of individual battles should be sought elsewhere.The Napoleon that emerges from this study is a brillant, gifted, and charismatic soldier who is also ruthlessly ambitious, and who is slowly but surely corrupted by power. Chandler's detailed exposition on Napoleon's methods of war make clear why he was so successful for so long. Naploeon's ability to visualize the whole battlefield and its moving parts, and to accurately project where those parts might be days to weeks in the future enabled him to repeatedly outmaneuver and outfight his less skilled opponents. Napoleon was also relentlessly opportunistic; the chaos of the French Revolution gave this Corsican of relatively obscure origins many opportunities he might not have been afforded in a more stable late 18th century Europe. Finally, Napoleon inherited a national army imbued with enthusiasm, first for the ideals of revolution and later for the glory embodied by Napoleon's successes.Chandler writes with commendable objectivity, patiently documenting both Napoleon's gifts and his remarkably military accomplishments while refusing to fall under the spell of his visions of glory. Chandler's portrait is balanced; Napoleon is shown as the sometimes extraordinary, sometimes flawed human he undoubtedly was.Chandler's treatment of the Battle of Waterloo as one aspect of the Campaign of the Hundred Days deserves special attention by readers. More recent scholarship may have added additional detail, but Chandler captures the larger picture exceptionally well.This work is highly recommended to the serious student of the military art and of the Napoleonic Wars. Chandler's careful scholarship is essential to understanding the larger era in the military sense. The casual reader may find this book to be both densely written and overly long for easy enjoyment."},{"Title":"The campaigns of Napoleon","review":"Chandler in this book gives a clear and interesting account of Napoleon the General. The italian campaigns are richly described and come to life. Later campaigns seem less detailed or interesting... one campaign after another can tire the reader a little. Good maps and great narrative make this book great for the novice (like myself) and the expert alike. After reading this work I have become an ardent admirer of the amazing person that Napoleon was. Chandler shows very well how Napoleon was the mind behind the Grand Armee, his presence alone making the French invincible. When he did waver and slackened so did all his men. My only criticism is that some battles become to confusing to follow, but in general a very good insight into Napoleonic Warfare tactical and strategic, as well as the ways of the greatest commander of all times."},{"Title":"The campaigns of Napoleon","review":"I approached this huge book with a certain amount of apprehension, but was pleasantly surprised at how readable and efficiently edited it was. I never felt like it was getting lost in excess detail: it's size is more a testament to the richness of the period than any wallowing digressions.If you want to actually figure out who moved where and how far, you may find this book frustrating without some sort of Napoleonic atlas. The maps included opt for a period feel rather than clarity, making it difficult to locate small towns in a jumbled mass of calligraphic labels. Many of the maps span two pages, causing important landmarks to vanish into the thick binding. These problems are very unfortunate, as Chandler's writing has a flowing momentum that is thoroughly spoiled by flipping back and forth between map and text every 3 sentences or so.Another minor problem is that battles are described almost entirely from Napoleon's point of view, with only a cursory presentation of initial enemy intentions. Thus, his opponents seem to move, appear and disappear with little coherence, and the constant shifts in assumptions, temperment, and situation that drove the decisions of his enemies are rarely revealed.As a novice, I cannot comment on the accuracy of the book, but from reading other reviews I would warn against using this book to pass judgment on who was right or who was wrong. The ideological controversy over Napoleon clearly stirred up ferocious sentiments that made most source material from the period hopelessly opinionated and even deliberately distorted. It would be impossible, if not dishonest, for Chandler to reflect the unstable nature of this information without some moral and factual ambiguity, and he only rarely lets us in on the frustrations he must have experienced trying to assemble this mass of inflamed data into some sort of coherent narrative."},{"Title":"The campaigns of Napoleon","review":"This book not only discusses each of the military actions of Napoleon, from his ill-fated attempt to recover Corsica for the Revolution to the 100 Days, but also discusses some of the favorite tactics and organization of his armies. Very readable, although its length will deter any but the serious student of military history. One of the books I had in my duffel bags during the Gulf War."},{"Title":"The campaigns of Napoleon","review":"If you are interested in the study of Napoleon as a military commander, this is the place to start."},{"Title":"The campaigns of Napoleon","review":"David Chandler did an outstanding job with his detailed and \\"not dry\\" analysis on le petite corporal.This is a book that I have purchased several copies of over the years. The biggest reason being people I have let read it haven't wanted to let it go, so I gifted it to them.This is THE read for anyone interested in Napoleonic history, or in the man himself. You'll come away with an entirely new view of the Emperor."},{"Title":"The campaigns of Napoleon","review":"Chandler's Campaigns of Napoleon is a masterful compression of the Corsican's vast military career into \\"only\\" eleven hundred pages. After Toulon, we get the Italian campaign, and then a section on Napoleon's art of war. After that, it's one campaign after another, with descriptions of the political and diplomatic ramifications in between.I have no complaint with the content of Chandler's work, but there were some editing issues such as misnumbered footnotes. That problem may have been corrected in a later edition.The maps are better than usual, but Esposito's atlas should still be handy to augment Chandler. For the general military history enthusiast without a specific interest in Napoleon, Chandler's Campaigns of Napoleon and Esposito's Atlas of the Napoleonic Wars are all that is needed."},{"Title":"The campaigns of Napoleon","review":"David Chandler is the premier British historian on the military history of Napoleon (1769-1821). Napoleon was a Corsican who was perhaps the greatest field general in the long and sanguinary history of warfare.Chandler's book is expensive to purchase, exhaustive to read and it quite simply the sine qua non on where to begin your serious study of Napoleon.What a man the Emperor of France was! A military genius who could be very cruel and merciful. A tireless workaholic whose military genius burns brightly in the annals of history.Chandler's work is replete with maps and illustrations from the Napoleonic era. His writing is clear and easy to follow. The chapter on Napoleon's strategical genius is outstanding. All of the 60 major battles are covered.As a longtime Civil War buff jaded from reading my umpteeth account of Gettysburg I found much of interest in Chandler'swork. This work will be worth your well earned money! It is essential to add to your Napoleonic bookshelf!"},{"Title":"The campaigns of Napoleon","review":"Chandlers' Campaigns of Napoleon is the best single-volume history of Napoleon's military genious with careful commentary on logistics, politics, and innovations. The maps are wonderful and easy to follow. Every American Civil War general studied Napoleon - you cannot understand the military background of the American Civil War without understanding Napoleon and this book is the way to do that."},{"Title":"The campaigns of Napoleon","review":"Upon looking at this book, the sheer size of it is daunting, but after reading it I found Chandler's work to be fairly detailed, very interesting, and very very large. Large, not because of intensely detailed, heavy analysis but rather because he spent an average ammount of time on every aspect of Napoleon's long military career. The book covers such a long period of time that it has to be large, but upon reading it I found myself tearing through chapter after chapter with ease. Each campaign is given a good look at, with more attention to the Itallian campaign since it was where Napoleon's star truly began to rise. Too large to be an introductionary book about the subject I find it to be a perfect book for an overview of each and every campaign. The &quot;advanced&quot; work that is heads above the rest when it comes to covering all of Napoleon's campaigns. Chandler keeps to the subject and does not delve into the long term ramifications of Napoleon's career as he does in his work about Waterloo. Nor is very much of his own opinion stressed. This made the book a little dry at times, but here and there Chandler asserted his own opinions giving the book more life. Balancing opinion with credible work must be quite a chore though. It is also very understandable as to why he sticks to facts and sometimes dry accounts of the campaings. Look how big the books is! Any straying on his part and Phonebooks would look smaller when compared. Anyone interested in the Napoleonic era should have this book. It seems to make a rather good centerpiece from which more detailed studies can spring."},{"Title":"The campaigns of Napoleon","review":"A work of enormous scholarship. This is not really for the casual reader, but for those who truly want to immerse themselves in the subject. If you are looking for a concise history, look elsewhere. Chandler's main narrative is strong, but what separates him from others is his compulsion to tell you the details, asides, cross-references that others omit. If you want the full story, with no punches pulled, you will enjoy this handsome, easy-to-open work."},{"Title":"The campaigns of Napoleon","review":"I first read Chandler's \\"Campaigns of Napoleon\\" in the late 1960s as a teenager. I was enthralled then with the subject material, and with Chandler's vivid portrayal of Napleon's fundamental doctrines and thought. This recent purchase is a re-acquisition after 20 years of not having this splendid book. I will agree that Esposito's and Elting's \\"A Military History and Atlas of the Napoleonic Wars\\" has the edge in terms of presenting the campaign movements and battlefield evolutions clearly with their excellent and numerous color maps. But it is equally true that Chandler's work offers more context on why events unfolded in a diplomatic or economic sense. And Chandler's work has far more examination of the character and personality of Napoleon's principal generals, as well as of his adversaries. And the maps and battlefield discussion in \\"The Campains of Napoleon\\" are excellent in their own right."},{"Title":"The campaigns of Napoleon","review":"Utah Blaine's review is excellent, so another is probably redundant, but...I bought Chandler's Campaigns of Napoleon in the early 70s when I began reading voraciously about the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (inspired by Hornblower). Since then I have amassed a substantial library on the period, in which many of the books are very fine. Of them all this has been my constant companion, never far from my side, warts and all, for all the reasons that Utah so cogently laid out.Now, sadly, after much hard use, my original copy is falling apart, so I'm retiring it to a place of honour on my shelf and ordering another.It really is worth the price.Thank you and RIP, David Chandler."},{"Title":"The campaigns of Napoleon","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. That said, this book suffered from the usual trouble of military history books: maps. The problem in most such books is a simple lack of maps, but in this regard, Campaigns of Napoleon ranks pretty well. The troubles here are more subtle:* Many maps cover two facing pages and quite often important elements are in the gutter where they cannot be read. Obviously, important things are often near the middles of maps, so why not split the map to allow for the gutter?* Many names of both places and minor generals are spelled differently in the text and on the maps. I assume the text is accurate, but the variations in spelling caused confusion more than once.* Oftentimes a town would be named as a destination in the early stages of a campaign, that is, when the relevant maps are still at a large scale. The named, presumably small, town will not be found anywhere on the map. It seems to me that any town important enough to be named in the text should show up on a map that supports the text.I know full well that this book was published long ago, and I will restate how much this book was a pleasure and contributed greatly to my knowledge of the man and his era. The obvious care in the text and scholarship was lost in this book when it was time to create the maps."},{"Title":"The campaigns of Napoleon","review":"For once, the title of a book accurately describes its contents! This magisterial work is a summary of every campaign and battle in which Napoleon was a guiding force. It is a masterpiece of military history which illustrates how Napoleon accomplished his string of victories. Reading this work makes it clear that Napoleon was the original master of what is today called &quot;maneuver warfare,&quot; and many of his tactical principles remain relevant even today. While the detailed treatment of the battles themselves is unmatched in other works, this book is not a particularly complete view of the Napoleonic Era. Writing the history from the perspective of Napoleon as battle commander has clear advantages, but also certain limitations. Chandler does not neglect strategic considerations, but his treatment of the larger diplomatic history of the Napoleonic Wars is a bit scanty. The naval war and the Peninsular War are only briefly sketched. And the political life of the First Empire in France is only discussed as it relates to the ability of Napoleon to wage his wars. None of these limitations detract from the value of Chandler's achievement, but those seeking an overview of the Napoeonic era would be best served with a more generalist work, unless they have a specific and focused interest in the military history.As a final quibble, although the battle narratives would best be read with a separate, dedicated battle atlas, preferably one with topographic detail. Although the maps in the book are quite good, I often found them insufficiently detailed. In some cases, the only battle maps provided were contemporary engravings, which we nearly unreadable."},{"Title":"The campaigns of Napoleon","review":"Having read all the reviews, it pretty clear that there isn't much more I can say about this book which haven't been written already here. I can say that people who wrote badly about this book probably didn't read it very well or didn't read it at all.No one can start off his Napoleonic studies without reading this book. David Chandler's book is the fundamental book in understanding Napoleon and his military career. One of the previous reviewers stated that Military History and Atlas of Napoleonic Wars was better. That should be corrected in my opinion. The latter book provides a great companion book to David Chanlder's work but it lack the depth and understanding of the Napoleon's campaigns as described by Chandler.I kind of considered Chandler's book as a sort of Napoleonic bible, bit overzealous maybe but this book is where most serious students of Napoleon's military campaigns should start. Most who do will not need to buy another book that covers Napoleon's entire military career. They can spend their hard earn money buying books on Napoleon's individual campaigns, battles, personalities and naval warfare."},{"Title":"The campaigns of Napoleon","review":"I knew very little beyond pop culture and some vague memories from high school about Napoleon when I purchased this book. I chose this volume because of the ratings it received. I found the book comprehensive and detailed. I learned about the nuts and bolts of Napoleonic warfare: the formations, the weapons, all of that. The book goes into great detail about each battle and the tactics used. There is some history of Napoleon's life outside of warfare - his childhood, his relationship with Josephine - but details in these areas are scant as the book mostly focuses on his wars. The book is quite long and some stretches were not so easy to get through. Overall, the writing is easy to read but, again, there are parts that are quite dense but no so many that I couldn't make it through. In the end I found it a remarkable book for the way it let me inside Napoleon's mind. I got to experience his genius, his confidence, his ruthlessness. I came away with a clear understanding of who he was on the battlefield and how he handled negotiations with other nations. From relative obscurity, he rose to control Europe from Spain to Russia, and then lost it all. There are few stories like this in the history of the world. This book is a terrific overview of the man and his political and military achievements."},{"Title":"The campaigns of Napoleon","review":"I first encountered Chandler's Campaigns as a tank company commander hoping to gain some insight into &quot;mind and into one of history's greatest soldiers&quot;. Suffice it to say not only does my autographed copy occupy pride of place on my Napoleonic bookshelf, but it is recommended reading for all of my students studying the Napoleonic era. This is superb military history, detailing the often brilliant and always bloody march of Napoleon's armies. It is THE definitive work on the subject. Indispensible, irreplacable. A must for serious students and anyone remotely interested in military history."},{"Title":"The campaigns of Napoleon","review":"Chandler does a thorough job covering Napoleon's campaigns, from his early days as a French soldier all the way to his defeat at Waterloo and exile to St. Helena. This is a military history, with tactical diagrams accompanying descriptions of battles and detailed accounts of things like marches and army composition. Chandler does a good job balancing the small tactical details with the big strategic picture. Political or social history is only mentioned insofar as it pertains to Napoleon's military career. It definitely helps to have a general knowledge of the period before delving into this book.Throughout the book, Chandler attempts to get inside the mind of Napoleon, to analyze his patterns of thinking and see the reasons behind his actions. Much of it is good and reasonable, and serves to enlighten the reader as to Napoleon's possible motivations and patterns of action. For example, Chandler spends a chapter analyzing Napoleon's method of waging war and fighting battles. Some may argue that it's a bit simplified, but it's a valuable reference point. The psychoanalysis tends to stray a bit further off the mark. However, it's not without its merits and can be quite instructional if one can control for possible author bias. Chandler is an Englishman, which sometimes shows through. The book may or may not have a slight pro-England bias, but it's not so heavy-handed as to detract from its value. It's an unfortunate fact that history books always have a bit of bias, whether the author allows his to show through or tries so hard to avoid it that he goes too far in the opposite direction. Keeping this in mind, the level of bias here is no detriment.This is probably the best-written and most thorough single-volume military history of Napoleon, and is actually quite accessible to beginners."},{"Title":"Language in action: A guide to accurate thinking, reading and writing","review":"A Must-Read for all those interested in language and people skills.

Understanding background that both readers and writers bring to a topic and impact their presentation - even when working hard to be objective - can not only improve to communication but provide insight on what is importatnt.

I picked this up thinking I was going to get one of those typical beach reads . . . you know -- girl works at some ridiculously well paying job in London doing some kind of work that allows her to somehow meet a man that can't possibly exist in nature -- good looking, sensitive, they have great chemistry and all that. But that's not what this is. This really isn't a love story at all -- despite the title. I wasn't really feelin' this at all. The story is completely unrealistic -- which can be fun -- but this plot line had so many holes in it -- it was just annoying. As a reader, you are unable to care about her relationship."},{"Title":"The Boy I Loved Before","review":"Unless you live in a hut, we've all seen the movies where a character is suddenly tranferred back to her youth (Jennifer Garner in particular?)Flora, the novel's heroine, encounters that moment at a friend's wedding where she wants to do it all over again.Considering I didn't finsh the novel because there wasn't enough of a draw to the writing style and story line to keep my attention, readers may enjoy the likable heroine."},{"Title":"The Boy I Loved Before","review":"This is a travel-back-in-time story a la \\"Big\\" and \\"13 Going on 30\\", but with a twist. In this case, Flora's parents go back in time with her, and only people who love Flora recognize her in her 16-year-old body.Much of the book is shallow and lacks an emotional core, but toward the end, Flora makes a connection with a boy her \\"age\\" and makes peace with her issues in a believable way. She also manages to make things better for the people she loves as a result of her time travel.Overall, though Colgan's prose is glib without a lot of depth for much of the book, the ending is very satisfying and makes the book as a whole worth reading."},{"Title":"The Boy I Loved Before","review":"Was I the only one who noticed that the back of the book couldn't even get the character's names right (It's Sashy on the back, Tashy throughout the book)? I've read Colgan's other books (Talking to Addison, Amanda's Wedding), and I was disappointed in this one. It was still Colgan's writing, but the characters didn't hook me. I'm so tired of reading about women who are apathetic about the man they're with (both Flo and Tashy/Sashy are)- shouldn't authors start giving readers some credit for recognizing when their characters are so obviously in a dead-end relationship? Do they think women are that pathetic and desperate? In any case, when the first three chapters so clearly indicated that Flo and Tashy were with men they didn't even really like, no less love, I almost put the book down. But I kept going because I thought the premise of the book was so good. And once Flo becomes a teenager again, it did pick up. Still, I wished Colgan had been a little more original with her characters, and a lot less predicatable. I'd read another Colgan book first before picking up this one."},{"Title":"The Boy I Loved Before","review":"I have a confession to make. I normally don't read books set in England. I don't know why; maybe it's because I can't relate to the locations. I pulled this off the shelf at the library and didn't realize it was set in England until I began reading it. I almost stopped right there, but the storyline is one of my favorites so I continued. I am glad I did.Colgan was able to capture the confusion of her character and the incredible sense of a 32-year old being trapped in a 16-year old's body. I loved that. How amazing it would be to be able to \\"see\\" oneself at that age once again. It's easy to look back on our teenage years and think life was great, but we certainly do forget how confining it was and how, once we get used to the freedoms of adulthood, it would be impossible to go backwards.I liked the character and found her situation to be both silly and interesting. I also like the conclusion of the story. It was very satisfying. All in all, I really enjoyed this book, and read it in one sitting. And yes, I also noticed the errors in Tashy's name in the questions at the end of the book!"},{"Title":"The Boy I Loved Before","review":"The Boy I Loved Before by Jenny Colgan is an interesting take on a known concept. While at her best friend's wedding, thirty-two year old Flora wishes to be sixteen again. Her wish is granted, but with a unique twist: she does not go back in time sixteen years and relive her teenagedom in the 80s, but rather in the present day.The writing was quite lively and made me laugh out loud many times. Pop culture references run rampant throughout the book. Flora is silly, serious, selfish and selfless in turns, realizing that she never really grew up, but that adulthood does have its good points.If you enjoy books or films that employ the \\"be careful what you wish for\\" / \\"wanting to be young again\\" plotline, and if you enjoy comedies, definitely check out this book. It's worth the read."},{"Title":"The Boy I Loved Before","review":"Yep, this is light-hearted fantasy. Can you imagine having a 32 year old friend of yours suddenly show up as a 16-year old? And say that the last time she saw you was at your wedding, which isn't scheduled for another month? What would you do? Well, isn't it obvious? You would ask how you looked! And how the wedding went.Yes, Flora, the heroine of this story by Jenny Colgan, has gone back in time. But only a month back, not 16 years back. Still, she has the knowledge of a 32-year old. Will she stun her friends with her skills at cooking? Yes, you can read this book and find out.Is this mainly a comedy or is it a more serious look at what we'd do if we had a chance to live part of our lives over again? I was laughing too much to figure that out."},{"Title":"The Boy I Loved Before","review":"Flora is a 32 year old accountant who is in a serious relationship with Oliver. One day she and Oliver go to her friends Tashy's wedding and when Tashy is cutting the cake Flora makes a wish that she could be 16 again. The next thing she knows she is being awakened by her mother in the room she had as an adolescent. It appears she and her parents went back in time to when she was 16 only Flora finds out that they only went back in time a month. Its kind of confusing at first but gets interesting when Tashy, Oliver, and John Floras old high school boyfriend know her and remember the past that she had just left. They all try to find a way to get Flora back to her regular 32 year old self but in the mean time come up with some very funny adventures and a serprise twist at the end that is very interesting."},{"Title":"The Boy I Loved Before","review":"This is a fairly typical chick-lit sort of novel, which is not a bad thing.There's a British girl who has a curvy-sort-of figure, and she'sdissatisfied with her love life and career.

What if her parents are completely oblivious towhat's going on, and insist that she goes to school and obeycurfew? And what if this girl takes up with the younger brother ofthat gorgeous boy she knew in high school, you know, \\"the one whogot away\\"?That is the premise of The Boy I Loved Before, a very clever, funstory with few flaws. True, it's a little hard to understand how themain character Flora manages to become younger and her parentshave forgotten but she and her friends haven't, etc. etc., but if youcan get past that sticky point, then you've got a fun novel which willappeal to high school age on up. If you're looking for a good chicklit book with an extremely interesting twist, then look no further, TheBoy I Loved Before is for you!"},{"Title":"The Boy I Loved Before","review":"The story itself was an interesting concept, and I enjoyed the ending, which is crucial to whether or not I actually recommend a book. The book did have some flaws. Some parts of the book were too drawn out and for a story like this one, it good have been slightly more compact. All in all, a good read if you can get into it and stay into it."},{"Title":"The Boy I Loved Before","review":"Thirty something accountant Flora Scurrison seems to have it all making plenty of money though the hours seem endless and having a nice boyfriend Oliver who treats her well. So Flora wonders why life seems unfulfilling and tasteless.At the wedding of her best friend Tashy, Oliver proposes. Instead of leaping for joy, Flora wishes she could start over again. To her shock, something magical or a curse occurs; Flora finds herself as a high school sixteen year old, but not back in time. It is still the Bush Junior period, not the Reagan era and Tashy is still getting married next month. Tashy and Oliver are in their thirties though they recognize the sixteen years old Flora. Over the next month Flora relives her teens, but will need to decide between thirty-two and sixteen when Tashy says I do.THE BOY I LOVED BEFORE is a refreshing chick lit tale with a few twists that bring an entertaining uniqueness to the story line. Similar in some respects to Peggy Sue Got Married with a Fountain of Youth twist as Jenny Colgan's heroine does not go back in time only in age; Flora's reliving her school days is amusing to follow as she brings adult knowledge with her. Chick lit fans will enjoy this humorous entry that is based on something many people dream of: a second chance at youth with the knowledge of experience.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Boy I Loved Before","review":"Jenny Colgan has a wonderful way of telling a story and keeping your attention.

A MUST read for anyone who is living through or has lived through the trials & tribulations of small town growth in America. The scenario could have take place in any small community as we strive to maintain our simple, quaint way of life while realizing that growth (hopefully controlled growth) is inevitable.

Certainly if you are a resident of North Florida this is essential reading - as the characters and events, although fictional, are actually based on a real town, with real characters like these, in Alachua County.While Carl Hiassen got his literary start just a few miles down the road (in what is fictionally portrayed as the college town down the road in the book) - his focus has turned southward. Behnke provides a glimpse into what was once the territory of the notorious Pork Chop Gang of machine politics and how little has actually changed as we have entered the new millenium.This is a town, fictional as well as real, that time has forgotten - or at least one that has forgotten that the Civil Rights movement ever occurred.To get a glimpse of the realities upon which this story is based visit [...] and see how truth is often far stranger than fiction.Behnke's portrayal, however, has significance for all in America. Small town politics is the foundation upon which our nation - and our national politics - rests. If you are concerned with corruption in politics, ineptness in government, or the mean-spirited and self-interested actions of the \\"power elite\\" you should train your eyes to local politics. And this is what Behnke has marvelously done in telling this story.There is a lesson in here for all Americans.Charles Grapski"},{"Title":"Tortoise Stew","review":"I read this book holding my breath: the characters, and they ARE \\"CHARACTERS\\" - had enough depth to make me start trying to guess who they are, but then enough wackiness to let me know they had to be made up! A funny, fairly realistic portrayal of what happens when it's all about the money. Any area has its tales of growth vs. no-growth, but Florida as usual goes over the top! I liked this book so much, I selected it for our book discussion group and I know we'll go into the wee hours trying to figure out who's who. An easy read with lots of laughs and just enough of a cautionary tale to make us stop to think."},{"Title":"Tortoise Stew","review":"From the first sentence, this book had me interested despite the slightly cheesy cover and title. It quickly went downhill from there, though. Sure, if you live in the area you can understand many of the things Behnke talks about, but for those who aren't familiar with politics or annexations and whatnot, Behnke leaves you in the dust. She throws names at the reader like confetti, not seeming to care whatsoever that it's incredibly difficult to keep up, and she assumes that two pages of a person's life story right after his introduction is suitable enough \\"depth\\" for the character--it's not. It got interesting whenever the book delved into Kelly's haunted past, but the character still felt very empty, as her language didn't change whatsoever when she was upset or insecure about something, and she made decisions that the reader can't understand since there was not even a hint to what Kelly was thinking at the time (she breaks up with a guy and then when he asks her out on a date, she swiftly says, \\"Okay\\" without any explanation to the reader that maybe she was having doubts or what have you).If you're more into plot than style, then this book is definitely for you.

One such author is Seressia Glass and her book \\"Through the Fire\\" was a pure delight. This book is the sequel to \\"Three Wishes\\" and gives us Brandt Hughes' story. When I first read about Brandt in \\"Three Wishes\\" I knew he was something special.Since the tragic death of his wife and son, life for Brandt has been a gamble, with the painful toss-up of which would win -- life or death. Except for the love and support of his family, he muddles through life -- barely seeing, feeling or caring. On the anniversary of his deceased son's eighth birthday, an old army friend from Serena Bay, Florida calls in a favor. Brandt accepts.Dr. Willow Zane, famed psychologist and self-help guru, returned to her hometown of Serena Bay, to open a clinic for those in need of help. However, Willow has been living with demons of her own and at times finds it hard to move on. When she meets Brandt, not only do they feel a deep attraction toward each other, but an intense source of comfort as well. He gives her the courage to try to rid many of her demons, and in turn she helps set him on a path of forgiveness and living.I loved this book! The love scenes were touching and simmering. The relationship between Willow and Brandt was heart wrenching and tender. Ms. Glass really delved in the psyche of the characters and you were able to understand why they behaved as they did. Mack, Willow's brother and Tony, her best friend were wonderful secondary characters. I would love to see their stories in a future book. (I hear there's a sequel to \\"Through the Fire\\" coming soon.) I also enjoyed catching up with Maya (Brandt's sister from \\"Three Wishes\\") and her family.This is the fourth book I've read by Ms. Glass. She is a talented, creative writer. Her other books, \\"No Apologies,\\" \\"No Commitment Required\\" and \\"Three Wishes\\" are definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Through the Fire","review":"Dr. Willow Zane, a famous self-help guru to the stars is about to realize her dream for Phoenix Haven, a refuge for those needing help getting through grief and guilt. Returning to Serena Bay, Florida was Willow's chance to help more people and be closer to her brother. However, she feels like a hypocrite because she has not faced all her past demons and continues to harbor grief and guilt of her own. Even with the building of the new sanctuary, there is someone out there trying to derail her dream and it puts Willow's life in danger. With only a few weeks left to complete renovations on Phoenix Haven, Willow needs a master carpenter to finish the restorations of the mission and in steps Brandt Hughes.Brandt has nothing to live for and the day he got the call to help with the final renovations for Phoenix Haven saved him. With something to keep his mind occupied, Brandt embarks on the task of renovating the mission. However, he is also there at the request of his best friend to protect Willow from the increasing threats on Phoenix Haven and her life. Yet, what he finds besides a woman who is not only a celebrity, and whose book gave him the ability to live day to day, is a woman who he emotionally connects with. For him, Willow is an enigma but one he cannot stay away from or deny his need for. Will he be able to protect Willow from her unknown aggressors as well as from his own inability to let go of his past?THROUGH THE FIRE is a wonderful title for this love story because both the hero and heroine had the ability to rise above their pasts in order to find true love. The characters were well-developed which allowed readers to understand and feel their pain. The compassion both main characters possessed was very remarkable and made them engaging. The build up to the romance and scorching intimacy is a definite plus for this story. The author also does a good job in the suspense area as she kept me guessing on who was trying to destroy Willow and what really happened to Brandt. Overall, this was a really good novel with the right mixture of suspense, romance and intimacy. I also was able to take some gems of advice from this story about the ability to move past guilt and grief because we all deserve happiness.Reviewed by Cashana Sealsof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Through the Fire","review":"Readers would have met Brandt as the brother of the heroine Maya in the author's book Three Wishes. He had lost his wife and child and was grieving. However it is only in this his own story that we really get to see the depth of his despair at losing his child and how much emotional baggage he carried over this.Brandt is a skilled carpenter and his friend Mack ( and former Commanding officer) asks him to work on the restoration of an old church as well as look out for his sister Willow who has been receive death threats.Willow is a self-help guru and best selling author, who likes to help people and is in the process of building a sanctuary where people can come to get help. But she herself is fighting her own demons by herself.Their journey of getting to know each other, becoming friends and falling in love is a passionate and very emotive one. Brandt and Willow learn to trust each other and that they can depend on each. Along the way each helps the other to deal with their own personal demons and heal."},{"Title":"Through the Fire","review":"Through the Fire tells a story of 2 people hurt by love. They are convinced that they will be outsiders when it comes to their vision of love. Your heart breaks when you learn how life has hurt them, and you hope that they will find the courage to believe that something better is just around the corner. At first, I thought that the story dwelled too much on their past, but I came to realize that the release of pain can take years. It takes time to repair damage, especially if you hide from it instead of embracing it. And, at their defining moments, Brandt and Willow chose a path to help themselves first, before helping each other. This author delivered a story of enlightenment, hope, and love. I enjoyed this story, finding it a journey to release old hurts myself, and accept forgiveness."},{"Title":"Through the Fire","review":"I really liked this book, the sequel to Three Wishes (which I also really liked). The author did a very good job of developing the main characters, which helps the reader feel their pain and makes their growing romance all the more touching. Characters and scenes from Three Wishes make a reprise in Through the Fire. I highly recommend this book, but read it after Three Wishes."},{"Title":"Through the Fire","review":"This book is phenomenal. I commend the author for creating a romance story that is profound and endearing. With both Brandt and Willow battling their own personal demons, in additon to their feelings for eachother, you can't help but root for them. I love balanced romance stories that are based on so much more than lust and superficial conflict. Ms. Glass is gifted and tells this story so that you genuinely understand each character's past, flaws, and motives. I would LOVE to see sequels to this book and hope that the author writes stories for Mack and Antonio."},{"Title":"Through the Fire","review":"THis is my 3rd book by Seressia Glass and she is fast become one of my favorite authors! After first reading Three Wishes, I was psyched when I saw that she'd written a 'sequel' to it focusing on the brother of Maya - Brandt. In Three Wishes, he intrigued me... and did Ms. Glass fulfill my fantasies in \\"Through the Fire\\"!This very well written book focuses on the lives of two hurting people tortured by the painful events of their pasts. Brandt's son and wife had died four years ago. This had been revealed in Three Wishes... but the details had not been. We come upon Brandt and he's on the edge, about ready to relinquish his hold on life and eat a bullet, thus ending his inner torment, nightmares, and self-loathing. A phone call from an his old military sargeant Mack gives him an out, and he jumps at the chance for a change of pace. Assignment, renovate a historic mission chapel owned by psychologist/self-help guru Willow Zane, writer of \\"The Phoenix Priciple\\" - the book Maya gave Brandt to read in Three wishes that gave him a little bit of peace, for a time. (Great tie-ins to first novel really made this a treat!)Willow is successful, sought after, and striving to make her vision of Phoenix Haven, a retreat/center of healing for hurting people, a reality. She is also Mack's sister... a fact he neglects to mention to Brandt when he asks him to come to Serena Bay, FL to work on the mission. She's a SURVIVOR.. but at a cost. Underneathe the professional exterior, she feels she's a hypocrit, because inner demons from her past (abandonment, abuse, and betrayal) still haunt her. She's emotionally bound, sexually traumatized, and though she doesn't realize it, aching for release from her own torment.You KNOW these two wounded heroes are bound to fall for eachother HARD, and they do, but in the way of hurt people, they stumble over bombs of misunderstand - which of course add to the drama! But I loved how Brandt helped Willow through her fears, and eventually allowed her to help him with his own. WARNING: LOVE SCENES DO NOT DISAPPOINT! The realism of these wonderful characters was portrayed so well, so in-depth and believable. I felt their pain. I felt their passion. I felt their ultimate hope for a future together.GREAT JOB, Ms. Glass!! Again, YOU ROCK! I highly recommend that anyone looking for a satisfying, exciting, dramatic read, READ THIS BOOK.. you will NOT regret it! I enjoyed it so much, I'm reading it again!"},{"Title":"Through the Fire","review":"This sad but heart warming of story of two emotionally wounded people who find love and happiness with each other is very moving. I almost cried in some parts but laughed in others, there were a few funny scences. However I wonder if the 'stalker' plot was a bit contrived, I worked out who it was before the end. I look forward to the sequel"},{"Title":"Wild cow tales,","review":"Wild cows, as the author explains, are just plain ornery, uncooperative cattle that resist all efforts to be rounded up. As a young Texas cowboy in the 1920s and 30s, Green made a living going after these hard-to-catch cattle, and this book is a collection of accounts of his successes (if he ever missed any, he doesn't mention it). Usually he works alone, on horseback, gathering up cows a few at a time and driving them to the nearest train station where they can be shipped to market. Typically he has worked a deal with the owner, buying them &quot;range delivery,&quot; and spending sometimes many weeks to outsmart the critters, often one by one, to get them roped, corralled, or whatever it takes.A young, tough, wild cowboy, as he often refers to himself, he has more than his share of hot, sweaty work, getting bunged up, frustrated, and frequently outmaneuvered. On one job, he's also shunned by a whole community of folk who regard him with disdain as he works to gather up a herd of cows for a bank collecting a bad debt. Each account is different, presenting a very different situation, and Green takes the reader along as he mulls over the problem, tries this and then that, eventually finding a solution.I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It's a departure from other books about cowboying, and it gets very much into cowboy psychology and the wealth of knowledge acquired in dealing daily with cattle. Green writes in a conversational style, with dry humor and a leisurely way of setting scenes and describing action, meanwhile building a kind of suspense as he figures out each time how to outsmart his &quot;wild cows.&quot;Thanks to the University of Nebraska Press for reprinting this and many other classics of western literature. Western illustrator Lorence Bjorklund provides many fine drawings, and with the cover design from a painting by W.H.D. Koerner they capture the spirit of this book wonderfully. I happily recommend this informative and entertaining book to anyone with an interest in cattle ranching and cowboys."},{"Title":"Wild cow tales,","review":"Ben Green probably writes one of the best cowboy stories I've ever read.

I'm about half way through. Nice that the stories are short and you can set it down while life interferes with your reading. Meantime we bought this to read then pass on to a brother out of the country who requested it. This author did a number of other books in the same vein and style. Horse tales too. Search or click on his name at the top of the page here. I think if you are raised outwest andinvolved with the outdoor world this might appeal to you. But if you are from the city maybe not so much...then again perhaps you'll catch Wild Cow Fever after reading this and go off to live your version of City Slickers. Also if you like dated stories these are to some extent but still very enjoyable and would appeal to people who remember that era as well as just enjoys reading about that time in life. Politic's and times have certainly changed since then."},{"Title":"Wild cow tales,","review":"What a great look back at what times were like in the life of a real cowboy. Well written.

For instance, you can view this book's content, including all of its images, and the original page numbers, at John van Wyhe's britishlibrary website. This online version includes an excellent indexing and search facility that contains more information than the book's actual index.2. This book describes Darwin's studies of how carnivorous plants catch, ingest and digest flies. The experiments are historically significant... and amusing, if only for the interesting forms of gunk used by Darwin to study the plants. Of the 18 chapters, the first 11 deal with one specific variety of sundew, Drosera rotundifolia. The twelfth chapter covers other varieties of sundew. The thirteenth and fourteenth chapters are on the Dionaea Muscipula (Venus fly-trap) and Aldrovanda vesiculosa (an aquatic trap). The fifteenth describes the Drosophyllum lusitanicum (Portuguese sundew), the Roridula dentata, and the Byblis. Chapter 16 covers Butterworts (Pinguicula), while the final two chapters examine Bladderworts (Utricularia).3. If you are interested in Darwin history: In \\"Insectivorous Plants,\\" we see Darwin the experimentalist, with his old friends, colleagues and family, uniting in 1874 to catalogue and understand insectivorous plants. Included in the studies are long-time Darwin associates Hooker and Thistelton-Dyer from Kew, Sanderson (experimenting with plant digestion) at University College London, Asa Gray at Harvard, and Darwin's sons. There was some correspondence with Lyell, on this topic, but Lyell's friendship with Darwin had soured, and Lyell died while Darwin worked on this book. This book initially sold more rapidly than The Origin of the Species. Francis \\"Frank\\" Darwin met and married Amy Ruck, his first wife during this time. George Romanes, who had studied with Frank at Cambridge, joined the family at this time, and may have had an influence on the book. Darwin also corresponded about such scientific greats as FC Donders. And so Insectivorous Plants will be interesting to those who are familiar with Darwin's life and times. If you want to read Darwin's correspondence during this time, see \\"The Life and Letters of Charles Darwin\\" (F. Darwin, 1905, also available online). Chapter 13 covers insectivorous plants. As the book went to press, Darwin wrote Hooker: \\"You ask about my book, and all that I can say is that I am ready to commit suicide; I thought it was decently written, but find so much wants rewriting, that it will not be ready to go to printers for two months, and will then make a confoundedly big book. Murray will say that it is no use publishing in the middle of summer, so I do not know what will be the upshot; but I begin to think that every one who publishes a book is a fool.\\"4. If you are interested in evolution, and the the evolution of insectivorous plants: There isn't much if any discussion of evolution in this book. If I'm not mistaken, Darwin took something of a break from evolutionary theory and natural selection when he wrote this book. As far as I know, Darwin didn't spend much time speculating about the evolution of these plants. Apparently, there isn't much of a fossil record of carnivorous plants. As tests of genetic similarity have improved, there has been new speculation about the evolution of carnivores. Some sources: A) Juniper, B. E., Robins, Richard J. and Joel, D. M. (1989).

If you are interested in learning more about carnivorous plants, take a look at the list of sources I'll post under Listmania. I feel confident that the new book by Barry Rice will be an excellent source. There are excellent books to consider that have been authored by Gordon Cheers, Peter D'Amato, Rica Erickson, Barry Juniper et al., Patricia Kite, Francis Lloyd (1940's), Allen Lowrie, Charles Nelson, James & Patricia Pietropaulo, Nick Romanowski, Donald Schnell, Adrian Slack, Dorothy Souza, and others. The new book by Rice is probably the most important new book since Schnell (2002) and D'Amato (1998), both highly recommended. Much depends on your interests and level of knowledge.

Kemp. O.C.'s son, Kenny, has skillfully contrasted for the reader both the trials of being human as well as the divine victories sometimes encountered in this test we all call life. I was especially touched by the scene most revealingly shared with us by Kenny when, as a defensive and rebellious young adult who had moved away from home, his father nervously stopped by one Sunday morning and humbly asked him if he would like to go to Church with him. Kenny described how his father uncomfortably, and without judgment, stood there: \\"If he'd worn a hat, I'm sure he would have been holding it, running his hand around the rim nervously\\". Through Kenny's skillful artistry with words I actually FELT the depth of selfless love O.C. had for his son in condescending himself so. There were tears in my eyes, but they were tears of joy in the human capacity for divine love that we inherit from...Somewhere. Whether Kenny meant it this way or not, the CARPENTER that O.C. emulated was obviously the Man from Galilee. By the way, Kenny let down his own defenses and mercifully went with his Dad that morning, inadvertently revealing that in spite of his youthful rebelliousness there remained a bit of the compassionate Carpenter in himself, as well. If a book only ever touched one life, it would certainly be worth writing. In this case, the book has more than touched me. It has transformed me and given me new resolution to try to be a better, more loving person. Thank you, Kenny. ~ T. McKnight"},{"Title":"Dad Was a Carpenter: A Father, a Son, and the Blueprints for a Meaningful Life","review":"Rare first self-published edition of the award-winning memoir likened favorably to 'Tuesdays with Morrie.'

Kemp's decline from ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease) and the remarkable lessons his son Kenny learned in the aftermath of his father's death as he cleaned out a garage his dad had spent 40 years filling up. Full of touching and humorous anecdotes, this is a book that will make you laugh and cry and, if your father is still alive, give him a great big hug!"},{"Title":"Dad Was a Carpenter: A Father, a Son, and the Blueprints for a Meaningful Life","review":"This is a very easy book to read. A personal account of the author's father and lessons he taught in his lifetime. I particularly enjoyed the quote at each chapter head - providing poignant direction.The book is extremely well written with a clear heart, positive tone, and outlook on events that contribute to the author. Interpreting life events in this way can do nothing but add to one's life. Perhaps that is the greatest message of all here."},{"Title":"Dad Was a Carpenter: A Father, a Son, and the Blueprints for a Meaningful Life","review":"There are not many books out there that both look beautiful and have the capacity to move the reader. Kemp's Dad Was A Carpenter is one of those special books. From the first to the last word, the reader is spellbound by the powerful yet subtle storytelling. In the end, we realize that we are holding a book that has been carefully crafted -- a book that offers us an opportunity to look at all of our relationships in a different light.This is not a book that is overly sentimental or cliched. It is a truly original and moving book and can and should be read and enjoyed by everyone.If you liked Tuesdays With Morrie, you will love Dad Was A Carpenter. There is no question about it."},{"Title":"Dad Was a Carpenter: A Father, a Son, and the Blueprints for a Meaningful Life","review":"Dad was a Carpenter was written in a simple yet imaginative style. It is such an easy and pleasant reading experience. Kemp paints a picture of his father that is real-life. There is nothing flashy - but there is substance to this man. As I read, I could see the parallels between their relationship and that of myself and my own father. The world is full of &quot;non-hero&quot; type fathers who teach their children and just survive life and yet make it so full of memories for their families. When you have finished the book, you feel as if you personally know O.C. Kemp (the father) and have traveled through life with the Kemp family and have become a part of their family. As you read of the experiences in each chapter - you find yourself comparing your life's experiences with that of the author and his father and saying to yourself - &quot;Hey, that's me and my Dad.&quot; Reading this book will make you want to share it with everyone. My wife and I have already decided what to give everyone for Christmas this year - &quot;Dad was Carpenter.&quot;"},{"Title":"Dad Was a Carpenter: A Father, a Son, and the Blueprints for a Meaningful Life","review":"Writer and filmmaker Kenny Kemp won the Grand Prize in the prestigious Writer's Digest National Self-Published Book Awards for his memoir DAD WAS A CARPENTER: BLUEPRINTS FOR A MEANINGFUL LIFE, beating thousands of competing entries. The judges ruled well, for this beautifully written story of father, a son, and the meaning of life is must read.Kemp begins his memoir with the words, &quot;I lied--Dad was not really a carpenter. He didn't work in the trades at all. He was a pharmacist--an ordinary man with poor eyesight, gapped teeth, and no hearing in one ear...&quot; Yet Kemp doesn't lie at all. For concealed beneath the ordinary veneer is an extraordinary father whose talented hands and imagination could see possibilities in the rejected, the mundane, and the discarded. Out of cast-off patent-room lamps, he created a chandelier. From equally simple materials, he created a go-cart. Out of an accident, he inspired a son to pay for damages and make the repairs himself. And the ability to see beyond the broken, the cracked and faded inspired a son's imagination with words and with film.DAD WAS A CARPENTER: BLUEPRINTS FOR A MEANINGFUL LIFE will only take an hour or two to read, but the subtle life lessons shared within will remain with the reader for a lifetime. The son who learned the value of straightening nails has shared a profound philosophical view of life in the telling of his story. Indeed, the simple carpenter that lay beneath the skin of pharmacist will touch the heart of any that reads DAD WAS A CARPENTER: BLUEPRINTS FOR A MEANINGFUL LIFE.

Like other recent bestselling books, specifically, Tuesdays with Morrie and The Greatest Generation, and perhaps, All I Needed to Know...I Learned in Kindergarden, the reader comes away from this book with a profound appreciation for the wisdom, humility and sacrifice of a loving parent/teacher. Do yourself a favor, read Dad Was A Carpenter and then give a copy to someone you care about. Reading Mr. Kemp's book is like saying four of the hardest words to say in the English language, &quot;I love you Dad.&quot;"},{"Title":"Dad Was a Carpenter: A Father, a Son, and the Blueprints for a Meaningful Life","review":"It would be hard to imagine anyone reading, &quot;Dad was a Carpenter&quot; without taking his, or her, own trip down memory lane. A quick and easy read, this book is a must for anyone who needs to do some closet cleaning to rid some old heartaches and get on with life.Let's face it, being a kid can be as bitter sweet as life in general. In the end, most of us survive even our teenage years, though not enough of us reflect on the experiences and lessons of our fathers and mothers that molded us into what we ultimately became.For some, those memories are too painful to recall. But like Kenny Kemp, some of us are able to look back and see that our parents were really all that we hope to be with our kids; loving, well meaning, imperfect, but basically decent and good.Kemp's account about life with his dad written years after the funeral is a healing balm for the resentments built up during our teenage years and for too many us, carried on far too long and far to deeply into our adult lives. Through Kenny's eyes we learn that O.C. Kemp was probably much like our dad, a regular guy who loved his family and did his best to provide as well as he knew how.A great book for sons, fathers, mothers and daughters alike. Inspiring, easy to complete in an hour if one can only read through the inevitable tears and many pauses for personal reflection.If O.C.

If you really want to feel what a life lived by authentic faith and true moral belief is all about, take this in hand and read each chapter slowly, then stop and listen.

A journey so well crafted that it is impossable to put down until his final words finish in a resolution of peace and love. Kenny Kemp leads us across the monumetal gulf that separates every child from his parental counter part and illuminates each step with insight and understanding. Can we know who our parents really are? Can we understand the world they passed through. Perhaps it's impossible. But Kemp gives us hope that just maybe we have a chance to get out of our own skin for a moment and look back to find that so much of what we must discover in ourselves is really uncovered in someone who came before us.

Great book, I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"The technological society","review":"Before proceeding with this review, let me just say that no fewer than a hundred pages could be trimmed from its content without diluting its message at all. Many of the examples used in the book are extremely dated; while I think I'm fairly well read, I confess that I'm not really up on the vicissitudes and catfights of French academic sociology in the early 1960's (to give but one example). With that being said, this book is worth well worth the time spent reading its 436 pages.This is undoubtedly one of the most important books of the twentieth century, and if you accept its thesis you won't be able to look at the political milieu in the same way ever again. (If you agree with it and it doesn't change the way you look at things, you haven't grasped its importance.) Most political theorists take ideology to be a central point from which \\"real world\\" consequences emanate. In other words, a Communist or libertarian ideology in practical use will produce a particular type society and individual divorced from the actual technical workings of the society. Liberals and conservatives both speak of things in such a manner as if ideology is the prima facie cause of existence - but as Ellul shows in painstaking detail, this is wrong. What almost everyone fails to grasp is the pernicious effect of technique (and its offspring, technology) on modern man.Technique can loosely be defined as the entire mass of organization and technology that has maximum efficiency as its goal. Ellul shows that technique possesses an impetus all its own and exerts similar effects on human society no matter what the official ideology of the society in question is. Technique, with its never-ending quest for maximum efficiency, tends to slowly drown out human concerns as it progresses towards its ultimate goal. \\"...the further economic technique develops, the more it makes real the abstract concept of economic man.\\" (p. 219) Technique does not confine itself merely to the realm of technical production, but infiltrates every aspect of human existence, and has no time for \\"inefficiencies\\" caused by loyalties to family, religion, race, or culture; a society of dumbed-down consumers is absolutely essential to the technological society, which must contain predictable \\"demographics\\" in order to ensure the necessary financial returns. \\"The only thing that matters technically is yield, production. This is the law of technique; this yield can only be obtained by the total mobilization of human beings, body and soul, and this implies the exploitation of all human psychic forces.\\" (p. 324).Ellul thoroughly shows that much of the difference in ideology between libertarians and socialists becomes largely irrelevant in the technological society (this is not to say that ideology is unimportant, but rather that technique proceeds with the same goals and effects.) This will doubtlessly please no one; liberals want to believe that they can have privacy and freedom despite a high degree of central planning, and libertarians want to believe that a society free of most regulation and control is possible in an advanced technological society. Libertarian fantasies seem especially irrelevant given the exigencies of a technological society; as Ellul notes, as technique progresses it simply cannot function without a high degree of complexity and regulation. \\"The modern state could no more be a state without techniques than a businessman could be a businessman without the telephone or the automobile... not only does it need techniques, but techniques need it. It is not a matter of chance, nor a matter of conscious will; rather, it is an urgency...\\" (p. 253-254). Can anyone really doubt Ellul here, especially seeing as how twenty-plus years of conservative promises to downsize government still result in more regulation and bureaucracy with every passing year? Planning, socialism, regulation, and control are the natural consequences of technique; an increasingly incestuous relationship between industry and the State is inevitable. \\"The state and technique - increasingly interrelated - are becoming the most important forces in the modern world; they buttress and reinforce each other in their aim to produce an apparently indestructible, total civilization.\\" (p. 318).This is not an optimistic book. Given that the nature of technique is one of a universal leveling of human cultures, needs, and desires (replacing real needs with false ones and the neighborhood restaurant with McDonalds), Ellul is certainly pessimistic. He does not propose any remedies for the Skinnerist nightmares of technique somehow leading to a Golden Age of humanity, where people will enjoy maximal freedom coupled with minimal want: \\"...we are struck by the incredible naivete of these scientists... they claim they will be in a position to develop certain collective desires, to constitute certain homogeneous social units out of aggregates of individuals, to forbid men to raise their children, and even to persuade them to renounce having any... at the same time, they speak of assuring the triumph of freedom and of the necessity of avoiding dictatorship... they seem incapable of grasping the contradiction involved, or of understanding that what they are proposing.\\" (p. 434)."},{"Title":"The technological society","review":"I first read this book in college in 1971. It has had more lasting impact upon my view of the world than any other book I read at that time. I go back to it every now and again. Anyone interested in the effects of globalization and the drive to faster and faster technological change and the maximizing of shareholder value should read this book. We are driven to compartmentalize our relationships to become efficient, the ultimate law of technology. Our relationships with our families, our neighbors, our communities, our friends and our government are impacted by the drive for efficiency."},{"Title":"The technological society","review":"In this famous volume, Jacques Ellul explores the role of technique in the modern world. In Ellul's view, ordered efficiency is the first and foremost law of the technical world, with widespread implications for human life. Modern man lives under a framework of artificial operational objectives he wasn't designed to cope with. Technique has turned men into mere resources thrown around wherever the technical system finds them most useful.The technical system is no longer within the reach of human control: it has taken on a life of its own and constitutes an independent force consuming more and more of the non-technical world around it. Men do not use technique: technique uses men. The argument behind this is not as metaphysical as it may appear; in much Ellul is as materialistic as Marx and seeks to penetrate the social reality's &quot;essence&quot; just as Marx did in Capital.The sociology and philosophy of this work is original, radical and logical. Whether you agree or disagree with Ellul, you are bound to be influenced and impressed by the intellectual effort put into this book."},{"Title":"The technological society","review":"This book put me in mind of Francis Fukuyama's The End of History and The Last Man. Both document the ascendance of the person who is a rational and insecure seeker of comfort, afraid of passion and psychologically tiny: the individual with a small &quot;i&quot;. Ellul is pessimistic. Our plight is due to our complete immersion in technique, the end of which is &quot;the one best way&quot; and efficiency. Against this there is no appeal and human spirituality and individualism are left behind as the &quot;mass man&quot; is created. This is the person who seeks only pleasure and entertainment and doesn't see his/her loss of uniqueness, beguiled by the products of technology and the promise of material progress. Technology is the answer to all things and the destroyer of all that is not technique. This is not due to a malign intent but simply the result of technique itself. There is no escape from technique, it permeates our world. An excellent example is the writer who, though wanting to express a different perspective is forced through the sieve of the techniques of the publishing business in order for the composition to see the light of day. Ellul makes a strong and frightening case. The one major oversight, for which we cannot blame one who wrote in 1964, is the power of the Internet for individual expression. He would, however, likely maintain that although this is an outlet for expression, the individual's voice is still lost in a cacaphony of other voices, as a result of the techniques of computer communication. Not an easy read, this book is an intellectual delight. Ellul's ideas are even more powerful today for the fact that they have not been contradicted but reinforced in the 35 years since he wrote."},{"Title":"The technological society","review":"This book reads like it was written in 1998 but it was written in 1964! Basically all the current ills that humanity must endure with his technology are all elucidated decades before other supposedly astute &quot;intellectuals&quot; knew what was even going on! He uses the example of man using &quot;technique&quot; to show how we use technique in everything we do from education to politics and how over time technology shall overwhelm any attempts to control it and how a totalitarian state is all but inevitable. Extremely well written and researched. It really should be cited by more authors and read more widely. I would definitely recomend this book to anyone who wishes to learn more about the technological society in which they live."},{"Title":"The technological society","review":"It has been said by some Ellul has proven mistaken because of the decentralization brought by modern technology. This is based on a very common misunderstanding.When you couple Ellul's &quot;one best way&quot; with the words of another author, the situation becomes clear.&quot;When the inhabitant of a democratic country compares himself individually with all those about him, he feels with pride that he is the equal of any one of them; but when he comes to survey the totality of his fellows and to place himself in contrast with so huge a body, he is instantly overwhelmed by the sense of his own insignificance and weakness. The same equality that renders him independent of each of his fellow citizens, taken severally, exposes him alone and unprotected to the influence of the greater number. The public, therefore, among a democratic people, has a singular power, which aristocratic nations cannot conceive; for it does not persuade others to it's beliefs, but it imposes them and makes them permeate the thinking of everyone by a sort of enormous pressure of the mind of all upon the individual intelligence.&quot; Alexis De TocquevilleThe common perception of decentralization is in fact the application of the &quot;one best way&quot; by a multitude of special interests. There is nothing whatever to the idea that decentralization debunks Ellul's work. Each of the individuals spoken of by Tocqueville applies the &quot;one best way&quot; to his or her own pursuit. The decentralization is in the ends, not the means.The charge Ellul's assertions are unsupported misses the fact the assertions need no support other than an eye to see what is going on in the world all around us.This book is one any educated person should be ashamed not to have read."},{"Title":"The technological society","review":"If a book can be rated for just making you think than this is one.Actually, the late-Jacques Ellul had been involved in the Reformed Church in France and was Professor of Law and Sociology and History of Institutions at the University of Bordeaux.His Reformed theology wrestling with Marxist influence helped build his observations that have been appreciated by both social conservatives and liberals. He drew from the only viable Marxist critique - that industrialisation, in essence dehumanizes people (separates them from what they make). Just look at how impersonal Western society has become (this is just one aspect). Ellul goes further and describes the fetish for technique (e.g. learn something, do it, have power). A good current example of this is contemporary education (the road to power is knowledge, hence the Technique of the classroom). The danger lies in the Falleness of man with knowledge of Technique without proper morals and valuing.However, Ellul often fell into the French deconstructive mindset, which always makes it difficult to build upon a proper weltenschaaung (worldview).Ellul was a very humane man, who sought to be informative."},{"Title":"The technological society","review":"Ellul, like a true philosopher, begins at the beginning to analyze the place of technology in modern human life. Rather than endorsing or assaulting technology (although it often seems more like the latter), his purpose is to bring his reader to awaken to how technology determines our lives. I took a class in Philosophy of Technology with this and William Barrett's _Death of the Soul: from Descartes to the Compuer_, (also highly reccomended), and it radically recreated my worldview."},{"Title":"The technological society","review":"This book is a highly significant and most important treatise on the cold, hard demonic presence that constitutes the role of technique in our world, and how it birthed \\"The Technological Society.\\"I would refrain from using such an easily miscontrued and loaded term as \\"demonic presence\\" to attempt to encapsulate what Ellul delineates in this book with consumate skill and near faultless powers of reason; but I think it pretty much fits the bill.I would recommend Ellul's \\"Propaganda: The Formation of Men's Attitudes\\" to accompany this book as they dovetail superbly. Perhaps The Technological Society first as it paves the way for Propaganda; one can't exist without the other. And Robert Merton's translation of the former seemed to be more fluid and easier to digest then Kellen & Learner's version of Propaganda. It also introduces key concepts towards an understanding of Ellul's complex analysis of how men's attitudes are \\"formed.\\"The Technological Society is a book of immense insight, clarity of thought and mesmerising, profound passages on reality as it is shaped by technique. He presents a world inhabited by the \\"mass man,\\" in a massified societal complex, which of necessity dictates techniques devoid of humanity to manage it effectively. Technique constitutes a kind of perfect intelligence, whose only point of reference is itself and whose focus is on the efficient integration of the soft, warm, and weak creatures that are mankind. Too wilful, chaotic and numerous are we that techniques of management; organization; regulation; health; information; etc, are inevitable to achieve a universal \\"best practice\\" for our own benefit. Or really for the interests of that thing known as society. This phenomenon even births techniques to soothe and placate the soul of man lacerated by the cold, efficient scalpel of the technical apparatus.It is both the poison and the antidote.These two quotes from the book will suggest something of Ellul's thought here:Definition of technique-\\"In our technological society, technique is the totality of methods rationally arrived at and having absolute efficiency (for a given state of development) in every field of human activity.\\"Machine and Technique-\\"All-embracing technique is in fact the consciousness of the mechanized world.Technique integrates everything. It avoids shock and sensational events. Man is not adapted to a world of steel , technique adapts him to it. It changes the arrangement of this blind world so that man can be a part of it without colliding with its rough edges, without the anguish of being delivered up to the inhuman. Technique thus provides a model, it specifies attitudes that are valid once and for all. The anixiety aroused in man is soothed by the consoling hum of a unified society.\\"The Characterology of Technique-\\"Technique worships nothing, respects nothing. It has a single role: to strip off externals, to bring everything to light, and by rational use to transform everything into means. More than science, which limits itself to to explaining the 'how,' technique desacrilizes because it demonstrates (by evidence and not by reason, through use and not through books) that mystery does not exist. Science brings to the light of day everything that man had believed sacred. Technique takes possession of everything and enslaves it. The sacred cannot resist. Science penetrates to the great depths of the sea to photograph the unknown fish of the deep. Technique captures them, hauls them up to see if they are edible - but before they arrive on deck they burst. And why should technique not act thus? It is autonomous and recognises as barriers only the temporary limits of its action. In its eyes, this terrain, which is for the moment unknown but not mysterious, must be attacked. Far from being restrained by any scruples of anything sacred, technique constantly assails it. Everything which is not yet technique becomes so. It is driven onward by itself, by its character of self-augmentation. Technique denies mystery a priori. The mysterious is merely that which has not yet been technicized.\\"As has been noted by many, and addressed by Ellul in the forward to the book, his views seem essentially fatalistic, pessimistic, with no potential for escape from the virtual prison he presents here.I view it far more as an essentially honest and unflinching record of his gaze at the world we live in, perhaps even more relevent now than when it was first published in 1954.And it is also a challenge: what can we do to counter this presentation of a world encircled by an almost otherworldy phenomena that cares not for humankind?What is technique? Why has it birthed a world of machines, of technology?I believe that this book has a huge piece of the puzzle to answer those questions. Technique may seem a boon to our current state of civilization, a saviour of humanity even; this book may reveal that it has a secret undiagnosed pathology that results in it being mightily inimical to man."},{"Title":"The technological society","review":"It is the victory of technique over humanity that man has become almost entirely incapable of appreciating the weight of Ellul's arguments. The attitudes of men are both technicized and monocerebral. Ever notice how comparatives such as 'faster' are regularly used in speech in a manner that reveals the speaker to equate such concepts as synonymous with the penultimate comparative, \\"better\\"? Ever notice how wholly humane, moral, ethical, and, dare i say it?, spiritual considerations do not enter into mind of the modern engineer in the least - except by way of footnotes which \\"unfortunately\\" need be discarded when making a \\"real life\\" \\"concrete\\" decision?In short, in my estimation man (in general, though individual exceptions exist) has no longer a relevant moral or ethical frame of reference except that which is provided him by technique.Would this book change the attitude of someone? If they were truly interested in learning and had an open mind - yes. But it is a fact that the technical worldview forms just as much the solid foundation of modern man's emotional belief system as any other cultural construct before. That it would probably fail is not the fault of Ellul - and be that as it may, i don't think he set out to change anybody's mind per se, merely to report the inevitable - upon which information people have the total freedom to act as they wish.Ellul's study is comprehensive and reasonable. The text is accurate, and generally comprehensible, but the translation into English has some very minor problems in the case of individual sentences, resulting at times in slightly eccentric English - which is not a surprise given the weight of the text.i truly look forward to reading the rest of Jacques Ellul's works."},{"Title":"The technological society","review":"Read this book, but be prepared as it is very challenging, slow going at times in the extreme , and ultimately potentially disheartening...It surely IS one of the most important works of the 20th C."},{"Title":"The technological society","review":"I've only begun to read the book and it appears to live up to its reputation as an important critique of modern society.

Jacques Ellul (1912 - 1994) was a French philosopher and social thinker who proposed radical theories concerning the nature of technology and modern society. Ellul was also a devout Christian and contributed to theology advocating a sort of Christian anarchism. This book in particular although dated was to play an important role in providing an understanding of the importance of technology for modern society. Ellul leans in the direction of Luddism arguing that technology can pose an increasingly de-humanizing effect cutting off man from his natural freedom and leading to harming psychological effects. Ellul also appears to have predicted what may have been the internet in which he argues that books will come to be replaced by a general information storage bank. This book served as an influence on many future social thinkers but was unfortunately also to play a role in the formation of the Unabomber Ted Kaczynski who was radically opposed to modern industrial society. In recent times, technology has developed at an even more rapid tempo and many of the problems considered by Ellul have only increased since the 1960s when he wrote this book. Ellul considers several possibilities for his predictions of the year 2000 and I found many of them to be uncannily accurate looking back from today.To begin with the book considers the technological society and examines the notion of \\"technique\\" by which is meant not only machine technology but an entire pre-determined complex standardization of means. Ellul's writings on technology may be compared to similar musings by such figures as Oswald Spengler or Thorstein Veblen. Ellul's understanding of technological progress sees a pre-determined course for human development which may only be interrupted by some radical measure or change or even as Ellul notes a divine intervention.The book includes the following chapters -Techniques - examines the role of technique and technology on modern society. Notes the role of \\"the machine\\" and the increasing relevance of the machine in the formation of modern industrialized society. Ellul also considers the importance of science, but notes how even science has become superceded by technique in which technology may further science and not the other way around. Examines the role of history including primitive technique (which includes magical technique), Christianity and technique, the Sixteenth century, and finally the Industrial Revolution. Explains the importance of the Industrial revolution and the formation of the bourgeoisie (as they developed from the Puritans).The Characterology of Technique - considers the role of technique in civilization, noting the importance of traditional technique and society (explaining the role for example of artisans and noting how technique led to the development of slavery. Contrasts this with the modern situation noting the role of automatism and self-augmentation and explaing how technique itself becomes autonomous. Considers technological monism in which the entirety of technique is taken as a whole including the theories of Lewis Mumford and notes the role of propaganda as technique and the formation of technological universalism.Technique and the Economy - explains the influence of technique on the economy in the role of distribution and the division of labor. Considers the theories of Karl Marx, Fourastie, and Keynes as they relate to the role of technique and the economy. Explains the consequences of technique on the economy, the role of economic technique and observation and on action, as well as the contrast between planning and liberty. Considers the great hopes - the role of economic technique on progress, the role of increasing centralization, and the considerable change towards an authoritarian or anti-democratic economy.Technique and the State - explains how technique has made possible an increasing influence of the state. Notes the state's encounters with technique including the contrast between ancient technique and new technique, as well as private and public techniques (noting the increasing role of a public sphere) and the reaction of the state to techniques. Includes a discussion of the repercussions of technique, including the role of evolution, the technological organism, the relationship between politicians and technique, and finally the rise of the totalitarian state. Notes some further repercussions of technique including pointing out the dangers of unchecked technique as can be seen in the creation of the atomic bomb for example.Human Techniques - explains the influence of technique on human society, including the modification of time and motion in which time has come to take on a more important role in modern industrial society, the creation of a mass society influenced by technique, and the role of human techniques. Provides a review of some forms of technique including educational technique, the technique of work, modern propaganda which has been culminated in the role of technique, and the role of amusement, sports, and modern medicine. Considers some further influences of technique including the rise of l'homme machine in which man himself is taken to be a machine (as first considered in the theories of la Mettrie) and the \\"fixation\\" of the workers, notes the dissociation of man brought on by technique and the triumph of the unconscious in which modern man tries to \\"flee\\" from industrial society into the unconscious as well as the disturbing formation of the mass man within modern society (noting the increasing role of advertising) and some of the involuntary psychological effects brought about by technique. Explains the role of a total integration of technique, the technical anesthesia, the integration of technique with the spiritual through art, surrealism, and jazz and the obsession with nature, and the final resolution of technique noting the role of capitalism in contrast to state Communism and the role of revolution.A Look at the Future - provides a prediction for the year 2000 including the influence of population growth, Huxley's theories and the role of genetic research, and the influence of a universal databank with direct access to the human mind. Finally, considers the notion of a lost \\"golden age\\" noting the influence of science and scientists (such as Einstein and Oppenheimer) on modern society and maintaining that many famous scientists have ill-considered opinions on the role of science and the future. Finally, considers the increase in diseases of the nervous system and some of the harmful effects of technique on modern man as well as the increasing dangers of further technique.This book provides an interesting series of reflections on the role of modern technique on society. Although the author could never have predicted the rise of the mass media and the increasing relevance of the internet and computers I felt that many of his predictions and warnings were uncannily accurate."},{"Title":"The technological society","review":"Ellul has had a lasting impact on me.

His book \\"Shades of Loneliness: Pathologies of a Technological Society\\" is another great book -- it covers psychological pathologies (e.g., depression) but the more interesting analysis is how technology affects everyone. Pathologies are the worst case but the book really focuses mainly on normal people in modern society.

This book sets forth the pernicious effect of technique (and its offspring, technology) on humanity. Considered by many to be Ellul's most important work, the book sets forth seven characteristics of modern technology, each of which serves to make efficiency a necessity. The seven are rationality, artificiality, automatism of technical choice, self-augmentation, monism, universalism, and autonomy. These characteristics create a system that \\"eliminates or subordinates the natural world.\\" Instead of technology serving humanity, Ellul notes that human beings have to adapt to technology. The present focus in schools prepares young people to handle computers and information, but does not \\"develop in a balanced way all the faculties - physical, manual, psychic, and intellectual.\\" Our present system emphasizes \\"rote learning instead of personal observation and reasoning.\\" In addition, what is needed is that \\"the child develop a social conscience, understand that the meaning of life is the good of humanity.\\"Ellul goes through one human activity after another and shows how it has been technicized - rendered efficient - and diminished in the process. He shows that technique possesses an impetus all its own, tending to slowly drown out human concerns and infiltrating every aspect of human existence. A society of dumbed-down consumers is absolutely essential to the technological society because the only thing that matters technically is yield, production.This is not an optimistic book, given that our lives are suffused with technology.

He claims that the drive for efficiency destroys the capability of defining a local identity which is the essence of human autonomy. There is only one most efficient way and that way becomes the only way.Ellul fears of a standardized society are as pertinent today as ever. However he gives little evidence that it is technique alone which drives this. His book is a series of unsubstantiated claims that technique centralizes. The history of the last 35 years since the book's publication in 1964 of the decentralizing aspects of technology shows that he has only a naive grasp of the problem."},{"Title":"The technological society","review":"I had to buy this book for a Building Technology class.

Varasdi explodes so many of these myths, and so convincingly, that he makes you wonder about other things &quot;everyone&quot; knows is &quot;true.&quot; A great read, and a great book to read with others, so you can share your thoughts."},{"Title":"Myth Information: More Than 590 Popular Misconceptions, Fallacies, and Misbeliefs Explained!","review":"I was looking through this book recently because I had read and reviewed a book called Modeling Behaviors from Images of Reality in Television Narratives: Myth Information and Socialization by Tony R. DeMars. I think someone reading that book about influences of TV shows on childrens' behavior who doesn't quite grasp the idea of the myths we build our world around as reality would do well to read this book also--as well as a book that came out in the mid-80s called No Sense of Place, by Joshua Meyrowitz. Some people seem to have a hard time stepping back from their 'reality' and seeing these myths."},{"Title":"Myth Information: More Than 590 Popular Misconceptions, Fallacies, and Misbeliefs Explained!","review":"If you're going to try to correct falsehoods, it's best to make sure that you yourself are correct. In the first few pages of the \\"A\\" section, Varasdi repeatedly refers to early aircraft as \\"aerodromes\\" (which is like calling a \\"racing car\\" a \\"racetrack\\") and claims that Horatio Alger wrote about young boys because he was homosexual (when in fact he was a pedophile.) The book is entertaining in places, but is best viewed as a diversion rather than a source of solidly-researched information."},{"Title":"Myth Information: More Than 590 Popular Misconceptions, Fallacies, and Misbeliefs Explained!","review":"Too many older/mundane topics, no source info and at least five key errors. But besides this, \\"Myth\\" is an invaluable source of historical information.The average American would learn a lot by reading it. Highlights include Christ not being Jesus's last name, the real effects of alcohol, snow not being white and many others. So many interesting things !!To help the future reader, here are the errors:- Blood in our veins is a \\"purplish blue\\". This is false - *all* blood is red. It's dark-red when returning to the lungs (before re-oxygenation) but red nonetheless.- The Boston Tea Party was a response to the British undercutting Dutch tea prices. Actually, it was the anger over a looming British monopoly and yes, taxation without representation that did it. By undercutting, British tea would have been cheaper than other brands on the market..BUT..there was still a tax on it. This is because the Brits lowered, not removed, the taxes on tea. The taxation story is true after all - just incomplete.- \\"Ring around a Rosie\\" started in 1347 and is associated with the Black Plague. Wrong. This version of the nursery rhyme's beginnings is a complete fabrication and the author simply went along with it. Like above, he used bad sources.- John Hanson was the first President of the United States. Not true. Hanson was the third, not the first, President of the Confederation Congress. And the title he had included \\"in Congress assembled\\" - meaning a different posistion than what Washington had !!- Crazy Horse led the charge against Custer in The Battle of Little Bighorn. There is no evidence of this. All we know is that Crazy Horse was a *participant* in the battle. He should not get more credit than this.- Glass is more like a liquid than a solid. No scientist will confirm this. There are still unknown properties of glass - but we know that it's not a \\"liquid, molecularly\\" which the author claims.- Karate began in India. Actually, it was the islands between Japan and China that did it. The people here were of Japanese heritage - so it's Japan after all.Shouldn't have mentioned:- The Baby Ruth candy bar was named after Grover Cleveland's daughter. Well, if you want to believe the company that made the bar - they historically said this. But a simple examination reveals that it was really named after Babe Ruth. Cleveland's daughter had been dead for 15 years before the introduction of the bar in 1921. And 1921 is right after Babe Ruth became a household name. Many have suggested over the years that the company chose \\"Baby\\" to avoid paying royalties to Ruth.I don't think there's any more errors in the book - so watch out for these things (and many other old-obscure entries) and enjoy...."},{"Title":"The Little Brown Handbook","review":"The book arrived nice and quick but was advertised as a paperback w/ 53 pages and was actually a hard cover.

I spent so many hours and hours pouring over this book that I'm reviewing right now, which is the Little Brown Handbook and I'm the better for it in that my grammar is so improved that even my teachers have told me that my grammar has improved. They say &quot;Hey. Your grammar improved&quot; and I say yes, I know it done has and I owe it all to the little brown handbook which I done brought and it was worth just about every penny and I mean that sincerely because it's a book that you will find the same way and you too will be able to write real good.

I recommend it to anyone who be having trouble with grammar and stuff because lots of people do and they axe me how I done improved it and it's very simple and that is the little brown handbook and I would even go on television and endorse it for free, yup that's how much I like this here book that I have right here with me and I would lend it to you but since this is being red by someone right now, I don't know who you are and I don't know if I can trust you to give it back since I don't know you at all, and I mean no offense by that, no, none at all.

We barely used this book, and class is almost over.I don't understand why a book called brown is actually blue, but ok. I loved the price here at Amazon for this book, Amazon's NEW price was only $5 higher than buying it used at any of my local used book stores.The size (dimensions) of the book is convenient. Not too big to haul around all the time, but the print is small and I think with all the textbooks we have to put up with all the time, our eyes start bugging out. Do they really need to cram all the material in such a small space? I appreciate the lighter load, but upping the font one point can make a world of difference. All in all, the book is sturdy, and it's laid out fairly well, making it not too difficult to find what you are looking for, so that is a plus. The paper is slightly slick, without too much glare, for anyone who ever studies outside between classes, you will appreciate this.The kinds of questions the book has are really stupid, and with no way to evaluate your own work, you have no clue before you turn in your assignment if you are on the right track or not. I consider that a huge minus. Another huge negative if your teacher is like mine and gives all the assignments and doesn't grade them or even look at them until the end of the term.I do not think I am really qualified to evaluate the contents of the book, regarding grammar, english rules, etc, since that lack of knowledge is why I am taking the class in the first place, however, it seems to cover a huge range of rules that I never learned before and I will not be reselling it to the used book store.

Virtually every nuance of English grammar is discussed at length, including the subjunctive mood (yes, English has one), and the Passive voice (yes, the one your English teacher always asked you not to use!). The book has 883 pages. I will value this even more when I go to graduate school next year.Why is this book useful? Have you ever wanted to know how to correctly use question marks, commas, and quotation marks? Well, virtually every punctuation mark in existence is explained in the book. Typically rules of usage are given first, and then the explanation is followed by an example sentence. This format makes learning the concepts very easy.There are also extremely helpful chapters on the use reasoning skills, reading and thinking critically, revising, editing, finding sources, and many, many more helpful topics. The book has sections on MLA, APA, CBE, and Chicago Styles of citing works. So whether you need to write a paper for a Psychology class or an English class, you can find help here. There are also tips included on how to do work in various fields, such as the humanities and social sciences. Another informative section is Glossary of Usage chapter. Included here are commonly misused words, and an explanation of their correct usage (and examples of such usage). For instance, did you know that \\"lay\\" is transitive and \\"lie\\" intransitive? Or did you know that the past participle form of \\"lie\\" is \\"I have lain?\\"I could go on and on about what is included, but there is just so much, it would take more than a few pages!

It was in between using two Diana Hacker books Rules for Writers and the Bedford Handbook.For myself, this book is very comprehensive. If I could, I could have taught the entire course using this text, although our college requires an additional \\"reader.\\" There are enough sample essays and other pieces in here that the reader portion could be done with this book. Its approach is encyclopedic to grammar, punctuation, usage, and spelling problems.I also found its section on composition essentials very well done, particularly chapter 4 on paragraphs. I found their explanation of how to do MLA papers and research papers in general quite useful.Before we used this textbook, I would usually download supplementary information from net websites on paragraphing and MLA papers to fill in the gap between what students wanted to know and what the textbooks said on these and other subject. However, the Little,Brown Handbook was so full of information, that I did not have to do that during the years I used this book.This is a good book if one is embarking on a serious campaign as a writer. When I was more active as a writer, I found that other writers and copy editors on publications I worked on continually stocked up on such books. These are the best places to look for clarification on problems of grammar, mechanicws, and usage. Surprisingly, even for the experienced degreed writer, what such books say about improving rhetoric or diction is often useful, the basics we can forget easily.As such, even though our college has moved back to Hacker, I will keep it out as a reference for my own writing and editing.Yet, as a text book for an individual composition course, its sixty dollar price, makes the book an outrageous drag on already emptied student pockets. The scandal of the price of university texts needs to be exposed and investigated."},{"Title":"The Little Brown Handbook","review":"Although intended primarily for students, The Little Brown Handbook is an excellent reference for all nonfiction writers. While writing my own recent book on option pricing, I consulted it often regarding the use of colons, semicolons, dashes, and other fine points of punctuation. It even served as an arbiter of correct grammar and usage in the occasional dispute with my copy editor! Almost everything critical to good writing is covered--from organization, paragraph coherence, and sentence structure, to punctuation, word choice, and issues of style--and in sufficient detail to be useful to the working wordsmith. Guidelines for academic writers, a discussion of the American Psychological Association (APA) style employed in the social sciences, and suggestions for use of the internet in research, also appear in The Little Brown Handbook. All in all, this book should be found near the Strunk and White classic, The Elements of Style, on any writer's bookshelf. I would unhesitatingly recommend it to anyone who writes, either for pleasure or for a living.Jeffrey Owen Katz, Ph.D.Author (With Donna L.

However, the current product's functionality and most of all its technical support service are sufficiently flawed to cause students to drop the course or to perform poorly, below their actual writing ability and motivation level.Pearson's registration process and its printed directions are complex, requiring needless information from students in order to register in the instructor's correct online course. In some cases, students were still waiting for help from Pearson tech support two weeks into the semester -- just to get registered at the site. Further, the registration process is complicated enough so that students who make an error are unable to back out to repair the error; they remain locked in a dead zone, registered at MCL but not in the instructor's course. I have not received confirmation that Pearson is revising this procedure in its December 2008 upgrade.I have had to call Pearson's tech support repeatedly, often several times a week. In almost every case, the technician is unable to answer my question and must \\"send it up to a specialist.\\" The technicians are always professional, but they do not have the answers I need to be able to continue with instruction in my course. Support for students is as bad or worse, they report.This past weekened, Pearson decided to do an upgrade -- in the middle of the academic semester. For my purposes, the key strength of MCL is its support of the instructor's revewing process of student writing. I am able to embed comments directly in student work and return that work for student revision. During the upgrade, Pearson changed the functionality of MCL's buttons, in effect hiding my comments from students. Of course the upgrade was done when there was no tech support available to anyone -- in spite of their 24/7 logo, so the course again ground to a halt. It turned out that in some cases the comments survived (if they could be found), and in other cases students needed to resubmit their papers, and I needed to recorrect them in order to trigger the \\"new and improved\\" model. Hours and hours of work were wasted.Because Pearson has decided to develop MCL unattached to its course-management sytem, CourseCompass, the course-management tools in MCL are extraordinarily weak. One example: If students do exercises to remediate errors in writing, the instructor must open every single exercise to find the student's score. Amazingly, Pearson has developed a roster that is not organized around the student name but rather the Pearson exercise. The function becomes useless to the instructor.Font size, wasted screen space, unnecessary scrolling and clicks: all contribute to an inelegant screen and a clumsy experience.I have worked with Pearson's CourseConmpass for years. I was involved in the Beta for MCL. I have taught blended and online courses for years using various platforms. I can adapt and can find end runs around dead ends. But this product, while good in concept -- is flawed. It was sent to market too soon, and tech support was never brought fully into the loop. If you adopt this product now, be prepared for great frustration. Be prepared too for emails and phone calls from your students. The complaint are endless.To Pearson's credit, they have provided me with the email addresses and phone numbers of some key MCL players. They are mostly good listeners and are certainly well intentioned. They tell me they are working day and night to improve their product. I tell that that my students and I are working day and night to be able to use their product. My students should be working hard at learning course material, not at figuring out dinged-up web sites. Not so good.Wait a year. Then try what might have become a wonderful product. There is great potential here."},{"Title":"The Little Brown Handbook","review":"The book is in an excellent condition.

Abbott wrote this book in 1903. Abbott suggests, \\"The theological movement which had radically changed the character and spirit of the Church had in America many leaders; chief among them I count Horace Bushnell, Charles G. Finney, and Henry Ward Beecher: the first, the prophet of faith; the second, the prophet of hope; the third, the prophet of love.\\" (Pg. 10)Interestingly, he observes that \\"The doctrine of the abolitionists, summarized in the last four clauses of the platform published in 'The Liberator,' Mr. Beecher never accepted; he was not an abolitionist... he believed that this cause of freedom was best subserved by remaining in the Union, by sustaining the Constitution, by treating slave and slaveholder alike as brother men... and by trusting to the moral influence of persuasion to bring about [slavery's] gradual abolition in the states where it already existed.\\" (Pg. 154-155)Of the infamous accusation that Beecher had an adulterous relation with a married woman, Elizabeth Tilton, \\"nothing of a suspicious character was proved against him, except certain letters written by him... counseling the permanent separation between Mr. and Mrs. Tilton... Mr. Beecher gave both verbal and written expression to the poignancy of his regret, in language which was subsequently distorted into a confession of crime... That he kept silence concerning these charges, until they were given to the public in a form which made silence no longer possible, was in accordance with Mr. Beecher's lifelong principle, to pay no attention to slanders against his name.\\" (Pg. 292)He notes, \\"Mr. Beecher was one of the first ministers in the Christian Church, if not the very first in this country, to advocate the doctrine of evolution as a doctrine which, so far from being inimical to the cause of Christ, was certain to prove its friend and supporter.\\" (Pg. 317)He admits that \\"one important exception\\" in the topics for Beecher's sermons was the absence of even one sermon on the crucifixion: \\"'We cannot find,' say the editors, '...that Mr. Beecher ever preached directly on that subject; on the contrary, he often said that it was impossible; the subject was too awful and sublime.' With this exception, Mr. Beecher was, in the strictest and most primitive sense of the term, a preacher of Christ.\\" (Pg. 347)This sympathetically-told biography is of great use to anyone wanting to know more about this important American religious figure of the 19th century."},{"Title":"The Mercenary: Year 1000 : The End of the World","review":"&quot;Year 1000&quot; gets off to a good start.

The basic idea underlying his argument is what he calls the 'Evolutionary Value Principle', which states, \\"The correct set of values, in any evolved being, is the one that will give its holder's genes the maximum advantage in terms of natural selection.\\" (p. 63). From this value, Cameron derives the following axioms which serve as the basis of his philosophy:(a) Natural Selection is the only source of value information that we have discovered so far in the universe.(b) A correct value set, unless it is empty, must have a source of information. It can have no authority for me, if it comes from obviously random events.(c) A complete and correct value set should not be self-contradictory. It must give a one-dimensional criterion.(d) Values should concern real-world variables, not simply a sensation of success in the brain produced by simulation.(e) Something matters: the nihilist view that nothing matters at all may not be disprovable, but it is one of my axioms not to accept it. (p. 70)My Comments:First, let me just say that I think Cameron is on the right track. In the course of his book he throws out most philosophies, theologies, and religions as useless. Though the argument that they are social creations isn't very clear, I think that is what he is driving at and is the reason why he sees them as worthless in determining values - they are relative and indexically located. So, having admitted that I agree with his basic premise, let me point out some of the major problems I see with his philosophy.My biggest problem with his argument is that he is ultimately arguing for uncontrolled reproduction; he advocates people have as many children as they possible can because in the long run the only thing that really matters is having kids. According to Cameron, \\"There is no amount of misery and suffering which should make us give up the chance of transmitting our genes into the future, if there is even the slightest hope of doing so.\\" (p. 185) The logical conclusion to this argument is population control based upon external factors (famine, drought, disease, war, poverty, etc.) which results in misery. Now, according to evolution and excluding any sentience humans might have, Cameron is right. But this is where I disagree with him. Because humans are sentient and aware of their purpose (gene replicators, nothing more), they can conceive of artificial and internal means of population control (limiting birth rates, birth control, etc.; e.g. China) so as to maintain an optimum population as well as maximize individual level comfort. There is absolutely no need to procreate like rabbits and let natural selection sort things out. If our sentient minds can't maximize healthy reproduction while minimizing suffering, what good are they? Is quality of life not at all important?My second major problem with Cameron's book is a point he repeatedly tries to make that is nearly indistinguishable from racism (I'm trying to give him the benefit of the doubt because it could easily be seen as such). He repeatedly tries to make the point that Europeans (and their North American ancestors) are headed toward extinction. I find this to be a particular naive and ethnocentric argument. His point is that where Europeans and North Americans have reduced their fertility rate to below replacement levels, members of third world nations have increased their fertility rates or maintained them at higher levels. The result will be the eventual 'extinction' of North Americans and Europeans, \\"Malthus would be astonished, two hundred years later, to see his descendants in the midst of a crisis of infertility which might lead to their extinction, but enjoying a level of wealth unparalleled in the history of the world.\\" (p. 161). The problem with this thinking is that Europeans are just part of the human species. If they cease to exist as a distinct race (either through interbreeding or through decreased breeding) they are not truly extinct as a species until humanity becomes extinct. For some reason Cameron seems to equate the disappearance of Europeans with extinction and preemptively mourns the loss of a group of people. Based on his own theory, so what if Europeans cease to exist as a distinct group among humans - isn't the idea really just natural selection working its course. If Europeans are not selected, it's their own fault and it is not really a significant loss to humanity because evolution selected the best course. Sure, Cameron wants his specific genes to continue, but he should leave the ethnocentric biases out of his philosophy.Two more problems and I'm done. The next problem I have with Cameron's argument is a false dichotomy argument he employs - either extinction or limitless children. These are not the only options. As noted above, humans are sentient. They are different from other animals. Despite the similarities, Cameron has to admit the difference; and because humans are different, different rules may just apply. There are any number of potential solutions to the problem of extinction, limitless children is just one of them. If I opt not to have children but work as a sociology professor teaching other people's children, is humanity done for? Please! It's a false dichotomy, a scare tactic and nothing more.The last problem includes something I should have mentioned earlier - the book is self-published. I believe, because it is showing up on Amazon, that you may eventually be able to buy this from someone other than the author, but I actually wrote the author in England and had him ship me a copy of the book. Because it is self-published it is in desperate need of an editor. There are numerous grammatical and spelling mistakes that a careful reading would catch making for periodically interrupted reading, which just plain bugs me.Overall, despite the major problems with the argument that I have pointed out, I think Cameron really does have a good point - the only real way to determine societal values should be based upon the survival of the species. If he can take out his ethnocentric argument and give human sentience some credit, he might be on to something big."},{"Title":"The Synonym Finder","review":"&quot;The Synonym Finder&quot; is a thesaurus in dictionary form. There are no word definitions or pronunciation guides. Words are listed alphabetically, as they would be in a dictionary, and an exhaustive list of synonyms is given for each definition of every word. Clarifications such as &quot;informal&quot;, &quot;slang&quot;, &quot;archaic&quot;, etc. are provided where appropriate. There are 1.5 million words in &quot;The Synonym Finder&quot;, including variations on the same root word. That's more than 4 times the number of words in &quot;Roget's International Thesaurus&quot;. If you simply want to find synonyms, this is the book for you. It isn't as versatile as a thesaurus that is organized by subject, but it's more to the point and easier to use if you are simply looking for word alternatives. Roget's is a better research tool, but this is a better and far more efficient synonym finder, and I think that students will prefer it to Roget's. My one pet peeve about the book is that the hardback edition doesn't have a dust jacket. The publisher may have thought a dust jacket would just be a nuisance on a reference book, but I would have preferred one for protection. I only wish &quot;The Synonym Finder&quot; were also available as software, as I have limited space for books within arm's reach of my computer. I use &quot;The Synonym Finder&quot; more frequently than my dictionary, Roget's Thesaurus, and Random House Word Menu combined.

This is the OED of thesauri, indispensable and perfect beyond comprehension. You will want to order this in hardcover, for you will find yourself using it again, and again, and again, and again.When I bought this book I actually did comparisons between the synonyms in this book and others, and was astounded. I don't remember the word offhand, but this book had over twenty synonyms, while Roget's had seven. An Oxford thesaurus had eleven, but that was as good as it got.The most important thing about this book is that the synonyms are relevant.

There is simply no other book in the English language that is more comprehensive (the number of pages is an obvious give away) nor more helpful. As a lover of language, I frequently examine other such books, and always find that they come up short against this exhaustive resource. What makes this particular reference so valuable is that it recognizes each word usually has more than one meaning, and when it gives a synonym, it is by meaning, not simply by word. Moreover, the reference gives various examples when a word is used as an adjective or adverb, and either as a noun or a verb. It's this breadth and depth that makes this particular synonym finder so extraordinarily superior to the competition. My only lament is that it doesn't include antonymns, but then the book would probably be too large and too cumbersome.

Over the years I have bought and used other thesauri and have discovered that none helps me find that elusive word as well as The Synonym Finder. I am not a writer, but I do value the quality of my writing. Frequently I find that I want to say something a certain way. I know there is a word that expresses the subtleties of what I want to say, but I cannot think of the word. I have found that the only book which can lead me to that word nearly every time is The Synonym Finder. No Thesaurus has ever been so consistently helpful to me. Recently I have found a stiff competitor (thesaurus.com) that works very well, but it is not a book. For anyone who wants a source that you can hold in your hand and find that word.

English is my second language.I recently purchased the Synonym Finder (SF). I am disappointed with the SF, in comparison with the superior and richer RIT.The most helpful review on this site says: \\"There are 1.5 million words in the SF [...]. That's more than 4 times the number of words in the RIT.\\". How misleading! It is not the number of repeated words that is important, but the number of index words and word-assoociations. The organization of the SF is linear (\\"dictionary form\\"): the same word is merely repeated over and over. The RIT is hierarchical and associative, leading the reader systematically and efficiently from perfect synonyms to \\"near\\" and \\"related\\" words, and of course includes antonyms and word-lists as well.The SF has nearly 20,000 index words. The RIT has over 25,000. Check it out!Try to find index words like \\"at first sight\\", \\"bring together\\", \\"consequently\\", \\"downplay\\", \\"easy on the eye\\", or \\"fine-tune\\" in the SF. And these are just a few examples.But the big difference between the linear SF and the by-category RIT is not just the number of index-words, but the natural way one searches for a synonym associately. For each index word, the RIT will recommend perhaps only ten alternatives, but each of these is an entire category, leading to 20, 50 or 200 more. The SF, on the other hand, will just provide a linear list of 5-15 other words - invariably a poorer set of choices.Of all the dictionary-format thesauri, the SF is probably the best. But it consistently pales next to the Original RIT. Three stars, not because it is a bad thesaurus in any way, but because if I were to give it 5 stars, I would have to give the RIT 10 stars!"},{"Title":"The Synonym Finder","review":"I love using the exact word...but it doesn't always pop into my brain.

What a book. The only reason it isn't 5 star is because I didn't realize that it was going to be so big and heavy! I originally wanted this book to be able to go in my purse but that's completely out of the question now. I should have realized it'd be so thick. It has quite a lot of material."},{"Title":"The Synonym Finder","review":"A dictionary style thesaurus, The Synonym Finder an absolute essential for anyone from college student to professional author, who needs a reliable reference for synonyms. The depth of references is unparalleled, and the ease of finding a desired word is as simple as looking the word up in a dictionary. If there is one drawback to The Synonym Finder is that it is not available in an eReader format."},{"Title":"The Synonym Finder","review":"What can I say that hasn't already been said in the title? This is way better than any of its competitors. I think I own around 5 of these books and keep one in every place I hang my hat. Hats off to Rodale!"},{"Title":"The Synonym Finder","review":"I've been using the Synonym Finder for almost twenty years. It is by far THE SINGLE BEST writing resource I own. I have multiple copies, one in my office at home and one at work. When I was working on my MBA a number of years ago, I found it to be an invaluable resource while I researched and wrote countless papers. I have given this book as a gift to graduating students moving on to college, and to friends starting advanced degrees. They all love it. My grade school kids love it too since it helps them avoid using the same word over and again.The cover of the paperback version says on it, \\"Over 1 Million Synonyms...The Largest and Most Comprehensive Thesaurus in Print\\". They are absolutely correct. Look for yourself. Open one up. If you do even a minuscule amount of writing, you'll love this resource."},{"Title":"The Synonym Finder","review":"To begin, I suppose I should mention that I'm a writer. It's not that you have to be a writer to get your money's worth out of this book, but you do have to at least have a need or a wish to play with words. The Synonym Finder was recommended to me by another writer friend whose opinion I greatly value and the day it arrived I found she was absolutely spot on. This is a reference I use, if not on a daily basis, often.I find it easier to use than most thesauri and each word has a wealth (\\"abundance, heap, pile, mass, ton, great deal, profusion, bounty, plenitude, plenteousness, bountifulness, copiousness, amplitude; cornucopia, bottomless well, treasury, gold mind, mine\\") of synonyms. If you like words, you can easily get lost in its pages.I heartily recommend this book as a must-have reference tool to be kept within easy reach."},{"Title":"The Synonym Finder","review":"One of a kind. You may never need a thesaurus if you buy this book. Indispensible for writers, poets, speakers. This is my second copy; I wore out the first one. I hope someone out there will undertake an update of this 1970's masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Synonym Finder","review":"As a writer, The Synonym Finder is my favorite reference. I use it more than the dictionary or any of my other books. It has been out for years, and even today no Thesaurus comes close to this one.Do not buy another Thesaurus, you're wasting your time. The Synonym Finder is definitive."},{"Title":"The Synonym Finder","review":"I inherited my copy from my dad, who was a playwright - and I find it invaluable for my own writing - prose as well as songs.

As part of my research for developing a freelance commercial writer practice, I read \\"The Well Fed Writer\\" by Peter Bowerman. In his discussion of writer tools, Bowerman recommended \\"Rodale's Synonym Finder\\" above all others.Thesauri are a basic tool for writers. Most good writers have a command of the language. What's needed is a quick reference that gives alternative choices to words they have in mind. For examples, if they used a term earlier in a paragraph and wish to avoid repeated use of the same word, Rodale's alphabetical organization is preferable to the organization by subject found in the better-known Roget's Thesaurus.Roget's will always be the gold standard of thesauri, but when time is of the essence, Rodale is the ticket."},{"Title":"The Synonym Finder","review":"This book marched on the scene back in the late '70s with little attention, but it is far and away the best book of its kind.

I use it every day, and have recommended it to other writers in my field. As a reference tool, it's simply invaluable!"},{"Title":"The Synonym Finder","review":"Over 1,200,000 synonyms! Forget the sparse Merriam-Webster Thesaurus and its stuffy rules regarding what is and isn't an exact synoym for a word. Most people use a thesaurus when they have only a vague idea of what word they are looking for. They need words that are closely related and somewhat related. This is where Merriam-Webster fails. Roget has declined over the years and its most recent edition is inferior due to its binding, paper (cheaper and thicker feeling), tabs (now every two hundred words instead of one hundred. Why bother at all?), etc. This thesaurus is the best out there. The only improvement possible would be thumb indexing added. Don't waste your money on anything else."},{"Title":"The Synonym Finder","review":"The Synonym Finder is absolutely the best thesaurus in print, sez me. It is an invaluable tool for the serious writer. It is more comprehensive and easier to use than any other thesaurus I've ever seen. Students, business writers, novelists - all need a copy right at hand to speed up and improve the writing process."},{"Title":"The Synonym Finder","review":"I was unaware of how poor the binding is until it was delivered.Regardless of how careful one is in handling, the binding will not last long.I now see that there is a hard copy edition available.I have returned the paper copy and may order the hard copy/"},{"Title":"The Synonym Finder","review":"I'm a writer. Words matter to me, and I take pleasure in revising and polishing until each word delivers the right point and emphasis, and a look for sentences in which the sounds echo the sense. I've tried many resources including \\"What's What,\\" and \\"The Ultimate Visual Dictionary.\\" I've found no one resource fully satisfactory. I want a word finder that is complete and very fast. I don't want to interrupt my thinking with word searches.The strength of this book is its completeness and directness. However, that completeness comes at a cost; the print is small and the paper thin. When I turn from writing at my computer, I need to change glasses to read the print in Synonym Finder, and even then I find myself also reaching for a magnifier. Fumbling with thin paper is also slow. There are no thumb tabs for easy access as on my edition of Roget.There is also no categorizing of meanings as in my old, hardcover Roget Thesausus, so sometimes I need to look up several words before I find what I want. In the end, it takes as long to find the word in Rodale as in Roget. There, all the words I need appear together, though I must start looking at the index. In Synonym Finder there is no index. The search is direct, but I need to look in multiple places.For those who write at a computer as I do, the ideal solution would be an electronic word finder. There is one on my computer, and it is always the first place I turn because it is instant. It distracts less from the thought processes of writing and polishing. However, it is way too small to provide the richness of vocabulary that I seek. I've looked for other electronic word finders without success. This book would be perfect if it were electronic.. How could it be that nobody has filled this need? As it is, I'm still using my Roget and waiting for the electronic version I dream of."},{"Title":"The Synonym Finder","review":"Complaint: Creepy, Spooky. Not in the 'Finder' as primary words? What gives? In fact these were a couple of the words I was HOPING to find synonyms for. I know of Eldritch for creepy, but assume there are other words for it. I wa a bit disappointed that such a common word wasn't used... I of course was inventive and tried looking up less 'standard' words to start from, like 'unnatural' and 'hellish.' Those seemed to work better.Minor foible aside, you can turn to pretty much any page and learn a whole lot of new words! This, I can tell, will be an absolutely indispensable desk reference... Especially since I want to write some esoterica and Lovecraftian purple prose with a pseudo-archaic affect. This should make for an excellent compendium of obscure and half-forgotten lore.Love it! One other minor quibble, I kind of wish it had antonyms too, like your usual thesaurus. But, then the book would probably be twice as long. So, I'm okay with it! It's already a truly massive tome."},{"Title":"The Synonym Finder","review":"No doubt great but in this day and age, should be on searcheable CD format.

I cannot recommend it highly enough for other writers and students."},{"Title":"The Synonym Finder","review":"I've used this since the early 1990s. It is, indeed, really, still the best thesaurus.But, if you work on a computer, thesaurus features built into the operating system or a program, are more convenient and getting better!Which leads me to my big, big criticism of this product that I have had for decades: they need to update it in content and media. It mostly just needs more words added and new words added.But most importantly, it needs to be digital! It is, a good enough product, that I would PAY to have access to it on my Mac. I would use it all the time in email, in InDesign, in web site design work I do, in Pages (word processing), Keynote (presentations), and many other programs that access the built in Mac dictionaries. There are multiple dictionaries on the Mac including an English thesaurus. Products of Oxford (but not that Oxford). So adding it to the already there dictionaries on the Mac seems possible.If the publisher made it cloud based, they could keep it up to date all the time and run it on any device. Most users of thesauri use them with a connection and sitting down.It is a great published product that needs to, finally, enter the digital age!"},{"Title":"The Synonym Finder","review":"For fresh writers who are looking at ways to expand their vocabulary and add a little more character to what your saying, this is the book for you.

It was a great buy!"},{"Title":"The Synonym Finder","review":"I don't know how I first ran into \\"The Synonym Finder\\", but I have been using it in my high school English classes the last four or five years. At first, students are hesitant to use it. I don't know if they are intimidated by its size or are just plain too lazy to heft it back to their desks. However, once students do use it, they find, as many other reviewers have, that \\"The Synonym Finder\\" is quite simply the best thesaurus out there. And it is reasonably priced too.Don't waste your time and money on other thesauri that don't adequately help you.

Some of them are even actually decent. The Synonym Finder is the best of all of them. It is unlikely that any other thesaurus will give you more word options than will this one.I have come across a few isolated instances where The Synonym Finder is lacking a useful synonym, such as for the verb \\"teach.\\"Oxford American Writer's Thesaurusoffers about 21 synonyms, among which is \\"illuminate.\\" That's a nice one, and The Synonym Finder doesn't have it. However, The Synonym Finder has a total of *65* synonyms, among them \\"enlighten\\". So you be the judge.Moreover, for \\"teacher\\",Oxford American Writer's Thesaurusoffers about 21 synonyms. The Synonym Finder has about 70. Further, The Synonym Finder has main entries for \\"teachable\\" and \\"teaching\\", which theOxford American Writer's Thesaurusdoes not have at all.

I wish that someone could provide an electronic desktop or pocket edition of Rodale's synonym finder in conjunction with a dictionary. The desktop models available by Franklin are antiquated and too limited. Additionally, Microsoft's thesaurus used in its Word program is also too limited and their supplier Alki seems to have no interest in expanding the add-on program that increases the number of synonyms by approximately 140,000 but when comparing a simple word like large, even with the add-on by Alki, there are only 16 synonyms available in comparison to 156 synonyms available for the same word in The Synonym Finder. Additionally, The Synonym Finder was published in 1978 and revised in January 1979, almost twenty years ago. While I realize that firms gravitate towards the areas where they can make the most money, i! ! t is unfortunate that nothing has been done to update this fine work. Look also at the other publications, book or electronic, such as Webster, and see how limited their products are as well. If you have some ideas, I would lend a willing ear. At a time when President Clinton's misguided focus is on classroom size, he and others should be focusing on the real problems of education and increasing rather than decreasing the educational requirements. Don't send our children out into society and expect that society will provide the skills that educators have not taught. Will society correct the problem or will drugs, alcohol, sex, violence, divorce and broken homes, and the power that money can buy lead us to equate our values based on an addiction of material possessions and the death of our true freedom; when is enough, enough? Help renew our focus and save our children from the constraints of materialistic greed and support the expansion of their knowledge, useful skills, ! ! and chance for lifelong happiness and the respect of others! .

Generally, I felt the book was a good buy, as it offered an alternative to my use of some other similar kinds of books, as this would mean that I would have within reach, a number of books to check up words and expressions."},{"Title":"The Synonym Finder","review":"My dad turned me on to this decades ago, and I'm on my third copy (having worn out the first two).

The invaluable resource not only gives you dozens of alternative words, it also includes archaic and rare usages, too.Simply the best!Although I rarely use these types of books when I'm writing my first draft, The Synonym Finder and it's companion, published by the same author, Word Finder, is never far from my reach during the re-writes. My only complaint would be that I haven't yet found it in software form."},{"Title":"The Synonym Finder","review":"I've heard it said that using a thesaurus can poison your style. When applied to some of the older books in this category, that may be true, but never Rodale's. It's a treasure trove! I work from the 1978 edition in which Laurence Urdang begins his Introduction with the curious statement that &quot;...there is no such thing as a true 'synonym.'&quot; So use the book with caution!No other thesaurus I've seen facilitates that caution. Rodale's enables you to look at the word choices with enough objectivity to see the wealth of nuances of meaning reflected in each one.This book is indispensable, reliable, accessible, and fun reading!"},{"Title":"The Synonym Finder","review":"Writing descriptively with creativity and color is necessary because without voice, one needs to suggest tone and passion to communicate the author's perspective. The Synonym Finder is THE resource for engaging writing. Forget about other regular so-called thesauri; their only use is to start a fire on a crisp, cool night or for a barbecue! The Synonym Finder is bound well, made of quality paper, and will lay open flat for easy reference. A couple of times, I've been unable to find a specific word, but then I turn to a more specialized thesaurus or dictionary for slang, foreign expressions, sexuality, etc. This book sits at the top of my list of reference books!

It helps you find a word for an idea that you can't quite define or explain, or find a word you're looking for but can't think of, or find words you never would've thought of, or sometimes even find words you didn't know could have that same meaning.

I bought it anyway. Now, about the only answer I can come up with is that it is a real \\"humdinger\\",and instead of getting rid of others that I already have;I guess I'll keep them all.I have several real good ones,but they are really all different and it's quite impossible to say which is best.Therefore,about all I can say is that this is definitely one of the best around,and you could never be disappointed if you choose this one.First of all it is huge,with 1,500,000 words, and makes the claim that it contains more words than any book of its kind.It has 1361 pages,and has a soft cover.One very important aspect of the book,is that it lays open when placed on a table,and the pages can be turned with one hand.It is important to note that generally hard cover ones have this ability,but most soft covered ones do not.Some references like this,(i.e.Rogert's)are arranged by subject and alphabetically;but this one is completely arranged alphabetically,like a dictionary.This book goes into considerable detail about words and doesn't simply give a exhaustive listing of similar words with the same meaning.It explains how various synonyms carry different meanings and how they are to be used.Before I sat down to write this review,I thought I would compare how several of my Thesauruses dealt with a word and was very surprised that there were big differences;which only goes to prove one thing;that being,that it is impossible to say one is better than another.When you turn to a Thesaurus to find \\"the perfect word\\",you don't always find it;and what you really need is more than one ,because if you don't find it in one,maybe it'll be in another.Summing up;this is an excellent Thesaurus,very easy to use,has an astounding number of listings,is reasonably priced,will give many years of service;and whether it is the only one you have,or one among several,you'll be very satisfied with it---at least I am."},{"Title":"The Synonym Finder","review":"When I joined a world-wide technology company I said to the resident technical writer/editor, &quot;Let me tell you what is the best theasaurus.&quot;She said, &quot;It's on the shelf behind you.&quot;She was right!!!

It's how I learned towrite- on the old Apple IIe...you're looking at a SCREEN.and when you're trying to get clear on a line or a word or a way ofexpressing idea, or you're struggling with the BEST way to communicatewith your reader...you're looking at a SCREEN.Just the mere physical act of looking away from that SCREEN,opening the book, changing your focus, finding the page andseeing a different font style can interrupt your pattern,and open up your mind to a whole new way of seeing andthinking about the subject.It's not just about the words, it's also about the state change.It's a 10-second exercise that gets you OUT of the problem andINTO the solution.The real power is the combination of the two working together,hand in hand.Not everyone needs this level of fanaticism, but there's an unmistakabledifference between the \\"talking at them\\" style of copy that's soprevalent today, and communicating with your reader in a way thattells them that you know them you understand them, and you careabout them in a way that nobody else in your market does.The Synonym Finder can help you get there faster than you wouldany other way."},{"Title":"The Synonym Finder","review":"This was recommended to me as a resource if you're looking to vary your vocabulary in writing, and it's perfect.

He is one of a rare breed of intellectual, the philosopher-teachers in the style of Plato, Aristotle, or Socrates. Duncan's insight into the methods and motivations of ancient, medieval, and modern political thought is of the rarefied type that allows the originator of the insight to teach it to others. Any student or hobbyist of Early American history would be remiss to deprive their library of this work, which explores, analyzes, and contrasts the road taken with the road not taken, and presents the latter as a viable option unexperienced by Americans."},{"Title":"The Anti-Federalists and Early American Political Thought","review":"In this insightful work, Duncan clearly delineates between the concerns and priorities of Publius (The Federalists) and the concerns/priorities of the Anti-Federalists (who were technically in a manner of speaking the true-genuine \\"federalists\\") as expressed through key passages of their various tracts during the framing. This work also provides a significant alternative to the \\"straussian school of american political thought\\" regarding the framing which in general, has too easily dismissed the \\"historical context\\" in which the Anti-Federalists thought and wrote. Duncan's discussion of the Anti-Federalists' ancestral ties to early american (New England) communal puritanism provides an interesting contrast to straussian Michael Zuckert's exposition on the transformation of (New England) american puritanism in his book\\"The Natural Rights Republic.\\"Eric B Martin"},{"Title":"Workbook/Lab Manual for Dimelo tu!: A Complete Course, 5th","review":"Got this from amazon so I could get a better deal.

When the previous reviewer says the piano parts get a little sparse, he means it, and unfortunately unlike in the previous books, you can't turn to the lines of other instruments for fill-inspiration. This also means it's a heck-of-a-lot easier to play than the other books (maybe this is a good thing for you?)Still, it's Ben Folds, who pwnz all things piano and the piano ballads (Luckiest, Fred Jones Pt. 2) are sure to please."},{"Title":"Ben Folds - Rockin' the Suburbs: Piano/Vocal Transcriptions","review":"You need to have some adaptability to truly be able to put up with this as a songbook.It's not that the product isn't useful; it's just that it wouldn't surprise me if they spent a day on this. There are some really silly things that exist in this book. The best examples comes from Carrying Cathy. The song is transcribed in Gb, but there are accidentals everywhere because it seems that every couple of measures, the transcriber chose to temporarily understand that F# is the only way to transcribe this song. The Augmented 7th leap up at \\"There was >always&lt;\\" to modulate to the key of the raised VII is quite brilliant. Well done.However, for the less discerning and more work-hard-and-bang-your-head-against-the-wall-until-it-works types out there, this is a great book.I can still use most of the songs in the book, but I do run into bizarre choices quite often. The distinction between the left and right hand in The Ascent of Stan, for instance, is pretty silly.I would say that it's a great fake book, but I have two points against that:1.)The bizarre absence of conformity to the accepted fact that music is relative and chords have functions in keys which the knowledge of enables tasteful embellishments.2.)It's Ben Folds. His piano parts are iconic, and almost impossible to fake with chord knowledge. The only way you'd be able to fake it is if you could play the actual piano parts anyway.So don't take this rating the wrong way here: 3 out of 5 is pretty fair, I'd say. Too many of these shoddy to average books have padded ratings because of the joy the reviewers get in playing music by an artist they love."},{"Title":"Ben Folds - Rockin' the Suburbs: Piano/Vocal Transcriptions","review":"The book is great -- now I just wish I had 4 other musicians to make it sound more like the CD."},{"Title":"Ben Folds - Rockin' the Suburbs: Piano/Vocal Transcriptions","review":"Just like the other reviews said, it's great music but the repeats are a pain.

And surprisingly, the simple piano accompaniment is not bad at all.Call me over-protective, but this is not humor I intend to share with the younger ones. \\"Whose Child Is This?\\" and \\"Here I Come A-Borrowing\\" make me laugh hard, and the parodies do not diminish the beauty of the original carols for me. But I wonder how the originals might survive in young minds after learning these very funny, but sometimes racy lyrics. And I am not too keen on answering, in the setting of the holidays, some of the questions that this content would probably provoke.Not all jokes I hear or tell are suitable for youngsters, nor do I think they have to be.

However, due to some profanity and other issues expressed in the lyrics, it's not suitable for kids. In fact, I'm not sure I would share it with the adults in my family at Christmas. While my family loves this kind of humor, it's disappointing to see the use of profanity (and God's name being used in vain) in a book connected to Christmas.

The series was very popular in Japan spawning a 50+ episode anime series, 2 animated movies, 2 live action TV series, a live action movie, 2 series of manga, novels, bilingual comics, english novels(printed in Japan), as well as loads of special editions and merchandise!*ahem*Hajime Kindaichi is the grandson of the famous Japanese detective Kousuke Kindaichi, a popular fiction character(much like Sherlock Holmes) who was popular in 70's and 80's. Kindaichi is a genius, especially when it comes to solving difficult crimes. Miyuki Nanase is Hajime's oldest friend and she often accompanies him on his adventures.Each Kindaichi story is a murder mystery(often serial murder) where the murders are carried out in a seemingly impossible way. Kindaichi puts the clues together and finds the link between the victims until he figures out who the murderer is. Then, usually, he tricks the murderer into giving himself(or herself!) away.Volume 1 \\"The Opera House Murders\\" is the tale of Fudo High's drama club who take a trip to an island to prepare for the drama competition in the wake of the suicide of their best actress. One by one, members of the drama club are being murdered in ways that mimic the play they are rehearsing, The Phantom of the Opera. After the first murder all lines of communication with the outside world are cut by a vicious storm and the fact that someone has cut the line on the boat.I won't say anymore because I don't want to spoil the mystery......As with all Tokyo Pop titles the print quality is lacking, but for the price there is no sense in complaining. The translation isn't as smooth as it could be. Some of the truly beautiful prose found in both the original Japanese and the bilingual editions are lost. Sometimes the dialogue is choppy and the jokes don't translate well, but overall it isn't a bad translation. One nice thing about the TP editions is the fact that each book is one self contained mystery. The mysteries in the original editions often spanned 2 or 3 smaller books.Kindaichi is a wonderful read. I loaned my bilingual editions to all of my friends and everyone, male and female, anime fans and otherwise, enjoyed them.I highly reccomend this to fans of manga and anime, as well as fans of mysteries. Even if you don't normally read mystery stories(like me) give Kindaichi a try. You'll probably enjoy it.Another plus of these books is the fact that they have a great repeat factor - after the mystery is solved it's fun to read them again and look for the clues(which are there!) that point to the killer!Just for fun: There is a sequel to this particular storyline. The first animated Kindaichi movie(not currently available R1) is \\"Return to Hotel Opera\\" and it draws heavily on the events of this storyline and further explores the past tragedy of the owner. The animated movie is based off a Japanese Kindaichi novel(which is quite a bit better than the animated film - they changed many things in the anime) which is avialable in both Japanese and English, though you may have a tough time finding the English edition outside of Japan."},{"Title":"The Kindaichi Case Files: The Opera House Murders","review":"I stumbled apon this accedentily, sorry for spelling, on the Tokyopop web site.

Kindaichi series is one of the greatest Mystery I have ever read along with Agatha's Ten Little Indian and Edogawa Rampo's Japanese Tales of Mystery and Imagination. The English version seems pretty accurated. The only question I have is How many cases TokyoPop planned to release? So far, it seems like they will release 12; however, I remember they are much more than that. I'm not remember exactly how many since it've been awhile since I read them, and the serie end couple years ago. I think the manga serie alone has at lease 19 full cases and some shorter cases.After this manga serie end, the creator also created another manga serie I don't remember the name, I think it's Dun, Detective School or something along that line. The serie has the same theme and feeling as Kindaichi series, althought I don't like it as much.

Lately I've taken an interest in horror manga/anime, I've been pleased with what I was seeing but I felt like there had to be something better out there for a murder mystery series. The Kindaichi Case Files is one of those \\"better\\" series I've been looking for, in fact so far it's the BEST murder series I've EVER encountered in any form (that includes manga, anime, books, and regular TV Shows). This series has everything that I was yearning for, humor, intelligent killers, emotional background stories, and revenge! I can't even begin to tell you how much I enjoy well done tales of vengeance. By the end of each story I was half cheering on for the killer who had been so terribly wronged by their victims in the past. Although I warn you the manga is currently Out of Print (OOP) outside Japan and although most volumes are easy to track down used on Amazon, there are a few that are difficult to come by at a reasonable price.Japan Positive Reception/HonorsKindaichi is one of the earliest works in the mystery manga genre, basically it's THE mystery manga. The Kindaichi series started serialization in Weekly Shnen Magazine in 1992. In 1995, the manga won the Kodansha Manga Award for shnen. In Japan, there is a total of 56 volumes with 35 cases, 17 Kindaichi's short cases and 7 Akechi's short cases. Together, the volumes have sold over 60 million copies in Japan, making it one of the best selling manga of the 1990s.(Lack of) U.S. Positive Reception/HonorsCurrently this manga series is OOP outside Japan, Tokyopop released the first 18 volumes and stopped due to bad sales numbers. Although they lost the rights to Kindaichi when Kodansha pulled the rights from all of their series away from Tokyopop. I can't comment on how good of a job Tokyopop did on the translations/editing since I have no access (or understanding) of the original Japanese manga volumes. I will say though that I think it's GREAT that each individual volume is usually twice the size of a normal manga, and contains an entire murder mystery story. Although they did split at least one story into two manga volumes.It's series like this that make me wish that all manga was simply available in a high quality digital format! Why? Because here I am recommending a series with all my heart, but not every volume is easily tracked down. PLUS perhaps if manga distributers didn't have to take into account actually going through the process of manufacturing the book itself this series might stand a better change of being rescued and being completed in the U.S."},{"Title":"The Kindaichi Case Files: The Opera House Murders","review":"The Kindaichi Case Files is one of my favorite manga series. I have tried to read other mystery mangas but none of them can stand up to the intrigue of Kindaichi's Case Files. Kindaichi is a really down to earth laid back guy who has a very high IQ and knack for noticing the small details nobody else sees. One of the greatest things about this manga is the fact that there are clues to solving the case in the drawings. So if you look carefully enough you maybe able to find the casebreaker before Kindaichi does. Compare that to other mystery mangas where you really have no idea what's going on until the main character reveals the solution. With every case, you will notice your ability to solve the cases begin to improve. This is one of the few mangas that will exercise your mind as well as entertain you."},{"Title":"The Kindaichi Case Files: The Opera House Murders","review":"Personally, I believe this is one of the best detectives book I've read.

I think I feel the same things she felt because sometimes I feel fear to be in Colombia, my native country. That's what she also felt.I liked the book a lot, and I didn't have a favorite part of the book, because I liked the whole book...I would recommend this book to people because I think it's really interesting and it's a true story.

Excellent intro to Clusters"},{"Title":"In Search of Clusters (2nd Edition)","review":"As other reviewers have said, this is an excellent book and is a *must have* for anyone exploring practically any aspect of cluster computing. Even beyond the quality of the information conveyed, the writing style is wonderful and the author makes an otherwise abstract and cumbersome topic quite readable and quite approachable. This book is regarded as the Clustering Bible worldwide, and I've seen copies placed prominently in the bookshelves of individuals in Beijing, Tokyo, Paris, and the US. Microsoft's own Cluster Server was codenamed 'Wolfpack', as an honerable reference to the cover art of this specific book.Aaron McKeeClustering Products ManagerTurboLinux Inc."},{"Title":"In Search of Clusters (2nd Edition)","review":"This book provides a terrific introduction to the hardware, software, and systems architecture of parallel computing, candidly discussing the issues and trade-offs in various approaches. The emphasis is on clusters, but there is lots of information on the whole continuum from single processor machines to SMPs to clusters to distributed computing. Pfister will leave you with a better understanding of things like how SMP machines keep processor caches coherent, what the differences are between SMP, NUMA, and distributed computing, how various cluster products work, real world cluster issues (like system administration), programming models used in parallel computing, and why programming code that runs efficently on these architectures is usually the hard part.The book is somewhat dated - nothing about Beowolf for example - but the concepts remain valid. Many of the issues are illustrated with reference to mainframe clusters, especially IBM's 390 sysplex, which I found particularly interesting since I don't have much experience with these systems.The style is highly readable and informal, but not insultingly non-technical. The book is loaded with opinion and insights - it is not a dry textbook of issues related to clustering. Highly recommended for anyone in the business of creating information systems that need to run fast."},{"Title":"In Search of Clusters (2nd Edition)","review":"Other reviewers, both publishers and individuals, have already said many good things about this book. Believe them all. There's plenty of meat for the greying professional yet it's accessible (and enjoyable) to the relative neophyte.The author has been compared to Scott Adams. While his style is eminently readable, I think this may not entirely do it justice: I'd be more inclined to liken his ability to present detailed concepts in an approachable manner to that of Richard Feynman - though as a non-neophyte with an intense interest in the subject matter my evaluation may be biased.If you have an interest in high-performance, high-availability processing and/or SANs (whether you call them 'storage area networks' or 'system area networks'), there may well be no better single source of information. If you simply have an interest in computers in general, you could just read it for fun."},{"Title":"In Search of Clusters (2nd Edition)","review":"The revision, like the Original is fresh and engaging - offering complex technical concepts in bite sized, palatable parcels.Mr. Pfister has done something wonderful for the computer industry with this book. The term clustering has been miss used and miss understood, often with drastic consquences, since Digtal released VMS V4.0 (and within clustering) and UNIX vendors tried to copy it.Greg Pfister has done a level set, defining terms and concepts and than comparing each implementation's strengths and weaknesses with a unique blend of clarity and humor.I recommend this book for 3 camps: I consider it classic example of how to write a technical book, it is helpful for anyone wanting to develop or exploit reliable systems and it is a must read for folks considering or already involved with NT server Enterprise Edition."},{"Title":"In Search of Clusters (2nd Edition)","review":"Mr. Pfister with humor and clarity has explained scalability.

The world has changed and unfortunately this book has become a history book.The book was written before SMP became ubiquitous, before virtual machines with massive multi-threading, before application servers with clustering, before widespread use of web technologies.But it provides an interesting history of HW based clustering, clustered batch processing and scientific parallel processing capabilities."},{"Title":"In Search of Clusters (2nd Edition)","review":"About a month ago I started work on a project running on a small cluster and involving the Oracle 8 Parallel Server at a low level (writing the Distributed Lock Manager support libraries for a certain OS). At this point, I'd never used (or even seen!) a clustered system, and I knew nothing about clusters at all. Then a colleague loaned me the first edition of Dr Pfister's book.Unwilling to be over-eager to learn anything out of 'paid' time, I opened the book with some trepidation, expecting to find the usual dessicated prose and tons of TLAs. What a pleasant surprise! From the 'legal stuff' at the front of the book ('a kind of garlic'), right through to the bibliography ('I found this paper almost unreadable'), the author understands the need of the reader to remain conscious through what is potentially the dullest of subjects and emerge, slightly surprised ('Did I actually enjoy that?') at the other end. Thousands of college lecturers have a lot to learn from this man!The second edition of the book is more a re-write than an update, and just as packed with anecdotes, humour (right down to pseudo-Paul Simon lyrics - people were hanged for less in the Wild West), and at the same time, probably the most thorough explanations of the why/how/when/wheres of clustering you will find in any book. As the quote on the back says 'This book is what would happen if Scott Adams wrote a book on parallel computers'...Full marks!"},{"Title":"In Search of Clusters (2nd Edition)","review":"With the advent of the Clustering Technology Formerly Known as Wolfpack, clustering has entered the computing mainstream. As a contributor to several white papers and studies on the subject, Shannon Knows DEC is no stranger to clustering technology. Nevertheless, while plenty has been written about clustering, vendor-specific collateral and trade press articles leave a great deal to be desired. Until now, customers seeking in-depth knowledge of modestly parallel computing have been unable to turn to a comprehensive information source. In an effort to cater to prospective adopters of Microsoft Cluster Server or NUMA-based systems, IBM engineer and cluster guru Greg Pfister recently published In Search of Clusters, Second Edition. In this 550-page book, Pfister manages to render a variety of complex technical issues understandable to those of us who do not possess a degree in computer science. The author makes ample use of analogies (including the now-famous \\"pack of dogs\\" example from which the Wolfpack sobriquet was derived) to point out the differences between parallel, cluster, and distributed systems, and to help his readers make sense of acronyms such as SMP, MPP, and NUMA. Technically oriented readers will appreciate the fact that Pfister reviews various clustering implementations-and the strengths and weaknesses of each offering-in great detail. The book hardly qualifies as light reading, but if you can understand SKD, you'll have no problem getting your money's worth from Greg's tutorial. In Search of Clusters, Second Edition (ISBN 0-13-899709-8) is available from AMAZON.COM. If you're contemplating the purchase of a clustered system, or if you're looking for insightful coverage of this evolving technology, In Search of Clusters definitely belongs on your bookshelf. Terry Shannon Publisher, Shannon Knows DEC"},{"Title":"In Search of Clusters (2nd Edition)","review":"While struggling through this book, I spend more time thinking about the characters of this author than about cluster. He has this unique style of telling a subject like a friend telling you a story and it goes like : I am going to tell you this .. but first let me explain why I tell you this .. and now I want to tell you how I am going to tell you this .. and finally this is this, believe you me .. OK, truth is - I lied, it is actually this ... and on and on. He successfully made &quot;this&quot; simple and understandable to a certain degree, but the &quot;how I, why I&quot; portion mix with some high IQ humours did confuse me no end - though it is fun. I find that at some stage I have to use a finger to point to a key sentence and said &quot; OK, Pfister is going to tell me this - lets see how&quot; - then at some stage I will have to judge whether he has finished what he promised and is already on to new stuff. And, he does choose some words that I suspect is more often used in classical literature - rococco, dischotomies, litany, etc - which although harmlessly infrequent, does add some irritation to the already burden mind. All things considered, going through this book is fun. In case you are one of those like me that is quite lost and struggle a fair bit, I did find chapter 6 fairly readable - so perhpas you want to starts from there and work backward/forward if other chapters frustrated you a fair bit."},{"Title":"In Search of Clusters (2nd Edition)","review":"OK, so perhaps you don't need this book, but you'll enjoy it anyway!The best review and tutorial on clusters available, this book is also funnyenough that you probably don't want to read it in a quiet environment."},{"Title":"Gracia divina vs. condena humana","review":"Este es un libro que merece leerse varias veces... Phillip Yancey toca un tema dif&iacute;cil pero absolutamente necesario en un tiempo donde el hombre se aparta de Dios y comete errores que lo separan todav&iacute;a m&aacute;s de &Eacute;l. Como cristianos nos hace falta tener un comprensi&oacute;n correcta de las formas c&oacute;mo Dios nos ve, de c&oacute;mo nos podemos acercar a &Eacute;l cuando estamos en pecado, y de c&oacute;mo su coraz&oacute;n puede ser formado en nosotros para acercarnos a aquellos maltrechos por los caminos equivocados de la vida. El libro habla de la inmensa gracia de Dios, de los ejemplos concretos de esta gracia manifestados en Jes&uacute;s, de las par&aacute;bolas ilustrativas, del amor extravagante del Padre, del perd&oacute;n que es para nosotros un acto &quot;antinatural&quot;. Para ello usa historias, recursos narrativos que llegan a lo profundo del coraz&oacute;n. A la par toca problemas tan dif&iacute;ciles donde la gracia es comprometida muchas veces por el institucionalismo, el legalismo, la rigidez, el orgullo, ret&aacute;ndonos a buscar la fuente principal que nos debe guiar perman&eacute;ntemente, la Gracia de Dios, en lugar de la tendencia humana a condenar. La fiesta de Babette es la par&aacute;bola moderna del gran fest&iacute;n d&oacute;nde ir&aacute;n solo los enfermos, rechazados, adictos, corruptos, quebrantados emocionales que Dios quiere salvar a trav&eacute;s de Jes&uacute;s. Y la escritura de Yancey nos reta a cambiar nuestra vida eclesi&aacute;stica y religiosa para que la &quot;Casa del Padre&quot; quede abierta a los enfermos, necesitados y todos aquellos que no tienen pastor en esta sociedad post-moderna.

Not within a bubble of formalism or theory, but in relation to other spheres of existence, from the most quotidian chores to our dreams and fantasies.Her approach to considering art reminds the reader that there is quality in all of our experiences -- that even international banking can relate to the creative process! Certainly poetry, music, and dance are all natural fits with the visual arts, and sometimes it's easy to forget that.And I especially enjoy when Tabios is &quot;naughty,&quot; playing with the inherent irreverence and absurdity in Tom Friedman's work! One would never find an essay like that in an art magazine!"},{"Title":"My Romance","review":"MY ROMANCE (Giraffe, 2002) is more than a collectionof essays on Art.

Many, if not most, are carefully refined maxims learnt from a long career practicing at law. I am not a lawyer, but a great many of the lessons that &quot;a good lawyer&quot; learns apply perhaps even more to everyday life. In addition, Cominskey's clear commitment to good old-fashioned ethics, often epitomized by the military codes he quotes, give the work a heavy measure of credibility.The key to most of the rules is that they provide a ruthlessly clear standard for living. For instance, &quot;Remember The Alamo/The Attorney-Client Privilege. Is there a 'need to know?' Loose lips sink ships.&quot; Similarly, &quot;Never expect anyone to keep a secret. If you are sharing something with them, then expect that they will likewise share it with others.&quot; And, a final example,&quot;In the practice of law You have no friends, Only opponents and potential opponents. Forewarned is forearmed.&quot;The discerning reader will find himself applying some of this unequivocal wisdom to daily life. Keep your secrets. Be respected. Work hard. Be careful, put your interests first. By stating these guidelines that lawyers (those who survive, anyway) learn in their first few years, Cominskey provides anyone with a &quot;little Bible&quot; that will seldom mislead.If the legal profession lived up to the clear, moral ethics in this book, our society (of which, by the way, &quot;lawyers are the custodians&quot;) would work seamlessly and justly. But if we can't have that quite yet, perhaps we might be able to enhance our own lives with the simple secrets of life that &quot;A Good Lawyer&quot; learns.(Cominskey's book gets four stars for clarity, integrity and usefulness. Five stars are reserved for literary masterpieces.)"},{"Title":"A Good Lawyer: Secrets Good Lawyers (& Their Best Clients) Already Know","review":"too bad this little gem is out of print and is not being reprinted. everyone should read it whether a lawyer or not."},{"Title":"Black night, white snow: Russia's Revolutions 1905-1917","review":"Harrison Salisbury, correspondent to the \\"Second World\\" of Russia during some of the most dramatic moments of its 20th Century history, occasional novelist and intellectual representative of a bygone (American) liberal elite, is now increasingly relegated to footnote status in most texts dealing with the time. Nonetheless, he had a first-rate mind, was \\"fair and balanced\\" in his reportage (meaning he neither knowingly lied about the social horrors of Communist regimes like Walter Duranty nor became an apologist for the West like many emigres from Arthur Koestler on down). He was a good reporter and a gentleman, in the old sense, who found himself, time and again, the only correspondent available to write about the bad conditions constantly emerging from even worse situations within the \\"Communist bloc\\" nations.His magnum opus, it seems, is and will be THE 900 DAYS: The Siege of Leningrad. I recall being greatly impressed, as well, by THE COMING WAR BETWEEN RUSSIA AND CHINA, especially when the border war between Vietnam and China, in 1979, seemed to bring this nightmare scenario one step from realization.BLACK NIGHT, WHITE SNOW is a valuable retrospective on the three Russian Revolutions, the one in 1905 and the two in 1917. The book's structure is generated by the juxtaposition of two lives, that of Czar Nicholas II and Vladimir Ulyanov, AKA \\"Lenin\\", whose character (or lack of it, in Nicholas' case) was to become so crucial for the lives of the subjects they would rule.About Nicholas II, then and now, about the best thing you can say is that he was a tragic figure, and leave it at that. Salisbury's Nicholas displays the worst features of what I call \\"inherited wealth syndrome\\". Moving beyond entitlement into realms where it seems somehow unnatural to lift a finger to help yourself, he proved fatally susceptible to the worst kind of sycophancy, and compounded this error by an almost psychopathic denial of reality, sacking all of his underlings who dared tell him the truth about the rot at work in the foundations of Russian society.When Stolypin, (the Russian Premier after 1905 and, according to Solzhenitsyn, the last man who might have averted the catastrophe of Boshevism), was assassinated, in the presence of Nicholas II, the Czar didn't even go to his funeral. Little things like that say alot.Where reform and positive action seemed too much for the Czar to contemplate, mysticism took over, resulting in the elevation of the demonic Rasputin to de facto control of the country. When Rasputin, in 1916, in his turn was killed, the Czar and Czarina Alexandra treated it as the ultimate national tragedy, and blamed all the horrors that happened afterwards on the inability of the aristocracy to tolerate the \\"holy man.\\"Salisbury's treatment of Nicholas II is eye-opening, but his Lenin is a revelation, particularly for those who think that the evils of the Soviet system began and ended with Stalin. Lenin is generally seen, even now, as basically a bourgeois intellectual derailed from following a university or magnate path by the execution of his elder brother, Alexander Ulyanov, when the latter was implicated in a plot upon the life of Czar Alexander III. From then on, Vladimir was bound to be a revolutionary - but one who would not make the sentimental mistakes about people that had led to his older brother's death.So - working against the government, Vladimir was exiled, ending up out of touch and frustrated in various foreign countries, until the final explosion of 1917 brought all non-resident chickens home to roost.But Salisbury deftly, if sketchily, depicts the adult Lenin as a functioning manic-depressive, capable of instances of Hitlerian assertion of willpower, followed by (transitory) sieges of \\"nervous collapse\\", black moods devoid of energy and meaning, when it seemed he'd given up on himself and everybody around him, and would withdraw into the nearest tolerable natural setting to recoup his energies.Everybody has faults, of course, but Lenin's rollercoaster fanaticism is the kind of defect that should disallow one from public service. And it was this mental attitude, chockful of the meanest kind of spite and petty vindictiveness, which set Bolshevism on the course it would take, into Stalin's hands.Such insight into the progenitor of \\"Leninism\\" is one of many things that make BLACK NIGHT, WHITE SNOW stand out, at least in comparison with more \\"textbook\\"-like tomes as Robert Goldston's RUSSIAN REVOLUTION, or even Solzhenitsyn's imaginative \\"biographical novel\\" LENIN IN ZURICH.Another aspect of those times that is ably recaptured by Salisbury is the sheer chaos, the anarchy of \\"the dark people\\" (ie., the Russian masses), which propelled the Revolution into an arena where a dedicated madman like Lenin could take control.But one could go on and on about this book. Judging by the absence of reviews, either editorial or customer - not to mention its current unavailability by this bookstore and others - it seems not to be read that much anymore. There are other things one should read first, of course, when it comes to literary work about the Soviet Union. Solzhenitsyn springs to mind, Rybakov and others. It was after all, one thing to write ABOUT Hell on Earth, and another thing to write about it after living through it: the second P.O.V. definitely has higher moral standing, however decent a human being the \\"writer from outside\\" may be.If there were just time enough, both Salisbury and the \\"more authentic\\" Soviet-era dissidents would be read. Make time to read this book."},{"Title":"Black night, white snow: Russia's Revolutions 1905-1917","review":"Harrison E. Salisbury is an unusually talented writer. It is worth noting here that I said 'writer'. There are many talented historians... but few talented writers who set themselves to the worthy task of chronicling the epic events of the past. Salisbury, then, is an exception and a welcome exception. Where modern academics seem to treat interesting, artistic writing of history as the invention of Satan himself, Salisbury recognises that by giving history a touch of literary flair it becomes that much more alive, more dramatic, more interesting.I've heard it often said in high praise of historical work by the casual reader that a given book \`reads like a novel'. Unfortunately our esteemed modern intelligentsia largely overlooks the fact that this is considered praiseworthy in a historical work and thus we get myriad volumes of bland, text-book-like accounts of what are in reality dramatic, lively and fascinating events. I think it is fair to say of \`Black Night, White Snow' that it reads like a novel.I know any academics (which I suppose as a matter of technicality I rank amongst) reading this have probably concluded from the above (providing, of course, that they are not familiar with Salisbury's work or indeed this book itself) that this is then a second-rate work of history - a populist work with few academic merits. This is absolutely not the case. Salisbury's work on the history of Russia's three revolutions is marvellously researched, taking in a wide range of Russian and English sources as well as a variety of others. He uses many primary sources - such as the letters and diaries of Nicholas and Alexandra, first-hand accounts of Lenin -by individuals such as Nadezhda Krupskaya, his wife - as well as a variety of accounts by a whole range of people who lived through the events herein told of.The centre of the narrative is the dual lives of Lenin and Nicholas (a format taken further in Salisbury's later dual biography of Mao and Deng, \`The New Emperors' - also recommended reading). Both, as Salisbury points out in his Author's Note had little mastery of the situation and the events and Lenin not so much led the Revolution to its eventual conclusion in a total Red victory as he rode the wave of revolution to the highest pinnacle of power. He deliberately sets out to wade through the sea of myths surrounding the events of 1917 in order to find the truth and to portray things as they seemed to those who lived through them - drawing on extensive primary sources, as mentioned above. The book does well to portray Lenin's nerves and his frequent fits of depression as well as Nicholas' spectacular apathy and ignorance, as well as the ease with which the court personalities were able to manipulate him - especially his German wife and through her a certain Siberian \`holy' man.Despite Salisbury's liberal views he does not fall into the trap of whitewashing Lenin's evils - that is to say the Red Terror he unleashed - and does not even attempt to make them seem morally equivalent to the measures taken by the Tsarist government before its collapse. Indeed the final chapters of this book, taking place after the Red October coup d'&eacute;tat (as opposed to Revolution, one of the myths Salisbury dispenses with), almost make one think that this book could have been called \`Black Night, Red Snow' in view of all the blood the Bolsheviks spilt as they became increasingly desperate to hold power.Salisbury also does well to build the suspense of the book, even though most readers will be well aware how the story ends. Lines such as the following, placed at the end of a chapter, do well to make this an interesting read by building something of a sense of foreboding:\`November 1, 1905, Nicholas II had jotted into his diary this entry: \\"We've made the acquaintance of a man of God, Grigory from the Tobolsk Guberniya.\\" Grigory, of course, was Rasputin.'This book, it should also be noted, as considerable scope. It begins with a description of events from the halfway point of the 19th century, continuing through to the winter of 1919-20 in the final pages. This vast, 70-year narrative focuses, obviously, on the period of the reign of Nicholas II and the ensuing years of 1917-8. It gives due attention to the events of 1905-6, talking about the rise, and fall, of the Gapon Society and Bloody Sunday, as well as the original Soviet. The accounts of the escapades of Rasputin, the veritable dictator of Russia for about a decade, are colourful indeed.Suffice to say this is a fascinating book, and exciting read and highly informative and well-researched. I recommend it to anyone interested in the events of this era - it is certainly amongst the best of the works dealing with this particular topic. I am personally of the opinion that this is even better than the much-acclaimed \`The 900 Days: The Siege of Leningrad', if only because the events it deals with are that much more pivotal to the history of the world and that much more dramatic. Though Salisbury is little read these days it is not a fate deserved by such a talented writer and historian."},{"Title":"Black night, white snow: Russia's Revolutions 1905-1917","review":"1977's \\"Black Night, White Snow\\" is Harrison Salisbury's superb account of Russia's descent into revolution between 1905 and 1917. Salisbury, who spent years in the Soviet Union as a journalist and author, combed various memoirs, archives, and the memories of surviving participants to produce a detailed, almost day by day narrative of the fall of the Russian Czar, the brief moment of democracy that followed, and the second Bolshevik revolution that ultimately turned Russia into the Soviet Union.Russia on the brink of the First World War had never known anything but autocratic government. The Czar's secret police and soldiers had successfully suppressed every revolutionary effort. However, the combination of a weak and indecisive Czar Nicholas II, the stresses of a failing war effort, and the presence of several organized opposition groups created a perfect storm of political chaos in 1917. The Bolseviks, a minority party among those seeking change, are here represented by Salisbury to have been both ruthlessly opportunistic and incredibly fortunate. Lenin, recalled from exile with the fall of the Czar, managed to ride the wave of political change to a position of complete power, forever changing Russia.Salisbury writes in the journalist style that would be made famous for a later generation of readers by David Halberstam. His account is full of personalities and the intersections of human judgment and random chance. His slow unspooling of the chronology of the Russian Revolution creates a palpable sense of suspense, as the Czar misses repeated opportunities for a better outcome, and a well-intentioned interim government fumbles away an opportunity for demoncracy. The counter-revolution by the Bolsheviks succeeds almost by a sense of mystical fate in collapsing the house of cards that was Russia in 1917.\\"Black Night, White Snow\\" is an even-handed and enthralling account of the Russian Revolution by an author who knew Russia and the Communists extraordinarily well. His account is very highly recommended to students of the history of Russia and its tumultuous years of revolution."},{"Title":"Black night, white snow: Russia's Revolutions 1905-1917","review":"This is a scholarly book that names specific persons, location, and dates in the gradual move through Russian history of the last two Czars. It does not read quite like a novel, yet the author does his best to keep a sort of plot going. There is way too much here for a quick read; it has too many details for that. It seems authoritative and free of bias."},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"Surely one of the most prolific writers working today this author turns out bestsellers under three different pen names. Rather than an effort to be mysterious, she explains that \\"the three names are designed to let readers know which of my three different worlds they will be getting when they plunk down their hard-earned money for one of my books.\\"There surely is a lot of \\"plunking down\\" going on as her titles, whether by Amanda Quick (historical settings) or by Jayne Ann Krentz or Jayne Castle (paranormal focus), make cash registers ring. Lie By Moonlight, her latest in the history/romance field is typical Amanda Quick, which is precisely what readers' want - suspenseful, romantic, and rich in Victorian period detail.Consider the opening lines: \\"Midnight in a fog-shrouded graveyard. There could be no darker place on the face of the earth....\\" Who can resist reading on?Concordia Glade is a twenty-something teacher with unique notions about education. She accepts a position as headmistress to four young orphaned heiresses, and journeys to a lonely old castle, Aldwick, to take up her task.Her charges are charming, their welfare seen to by an unknown person of wealth. However, Concordia's enthusiasm begins to wane when she finds that her predecessor vanished without a trace and, even worse, she suspects that there is an evil plot to sell the girls as courtesans.Meanwhile, in far off London, Ambrose Wells, a 19th century private detective has agreed to investigate the death of a young woman. His research takes him to the grounds of Aldwick Castle, where to his astonishment he finds the building afire, dead bodies about, and a woman and four girls riding off on horseback.Will Ambrose champion the five? Of course, he will. Will he and Concordia be attracted to one another? This is a Regency romance. But, who is behind the vile plan to sell the girls and why?- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"I enjoyed this book for the following reasons. First, both of characters are likeable. I really dislike heros that fit into the catergory of, \\"I'm a man, your a woman, therefore I'm better than you.\\" Ambrose Wells doesn't fall into that type of hero. Second, although, both characters have baggage stemming from their upbringings, neither are so stubborn and foolish that it gets in the way of their story. Both of these points are very important to me when considering a good book.I would also like to point out that this book makes mention of a Cabinet of Curosities. These cabinet is also mentioned in the Jayne Castle book \\"After Dark\\". The character John Stoner, I believe was in another Amanda Quick book, but I can't seem to remember what book that was. I thought that this would be interesting to point out to those who might not of noticed it.The reason I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 is because I wasn't able to really feel for the characters. In other words, I wasn't able to see them falling in love. The story focused more of the plot of the 4 girls and their situation than the love story. I thought that was rather disappointing. However,I think this is a good book and I don't regret spending the $25 dollars for it."},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"Concordia Glade ia a freethinking, independent teacher. She has had to hide her true idenity since the death of her parents ten years ago. Her parents were very free thinkers and had been married to other people. Therefore being illigetimate, she had wisely changed her name. Now she finds herself teacher, friend, and protector to four young ladies in her care. While teaching them at a secluded castle she discovers they are to be auctioned off to the highest bidder by a notorious criminal. Immediately she comes up with a plan to escape from the castle with her charges.Ambrose wells may very well be the last practicioner of Vanza in England. The mystic discipline has fallen out of favor over the years. He spends the wit and energy gained from his dedication to this lifestyle by solving mysteries and answering puzzling questions. In the course of an inquiry he meets Concordia as she and her charges escape from their captivity.There are so many unanswered questions about the situation and both Ambrose and Concordia are very courious people. The more they learn the more questions. Wherever the search leads, deaths follow.The attraction between the two of them is hot and quick, suddenly Concordia can believe in love at first sight. But marriage because of obligation is not in her vocabulary.Ambrose's mentor John Stoner returns late in the book and has his own thoughts on the relationship between Concordia and Ambrose. He is a delightful character and I quickly checked to be sure he was the Vanza student who was saved and sent to the island to study by Edison Stokes in I THEE WED.This is typical Amanda Quick and it is wonderful. I loved it. I read it in one sitting."},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"I will not rehash what was stated by the previous reviewers. Suffice it to say, I agree that \\"Lie by Midnight\\" is one Ms. Quick's best books in years. I envy and appreciate her ability to come up with interesting story lines and fascinating characters book after book. Read and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"I haven't read Amanda Quick since I finished Lavinia & Tobias' 2 stories. This one seemed to follow the same formula. Two non-societal leads get thrown together under criminal circumstances and the female insists they partner up to solve the mystery. Except in this case, Cooncordia Glade is a teacher with modern & unconventional sentiments. Ambrose Wells is the same person of inquiry, but with a better sense of humor. The mystery wasn't very tight, I found the motive not matched to the crime.There is so much explaining dialogue in this novel, and a lot of the time I felt like they were just recapping events so that the reader, all who apparently have short attention spans, could remember what was going on.In my humble opinion, I think Ms. Quick lost her way writing this book, and went with telling a story about dull mystery rather than focusing on the funny and complex Ambrose, Concordia's love and dedication to help foundlings that society would rather board up and ignore, or the endearingly interfering four students, Edwina, Theodora, Phoebe and Hannah. Speaking of whom, how many times those four names were stated together in this novel, I haven't a clue. But it's probably upwards of 500. Almost each time the 4 of them are mentioned, it's not as \\"the girls\\" or \\"the four students\\" or \\"Ms. Glade's girls\\" or \\"Concordia's pupils\\" or any other number of ways of referring to them, it's \\"Edwina, Theodora, Phoebe and Hannah.\\" But that is besides the point.I much would have rather read about Concordia being headmistress of a girls school and seeing how she inspires and gives hope to the forgotten children. This book instead was just a romance with a backdrop of a not very intelligent mystery.Amazon won't like me saying this but DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY BUYING THIS BOOK. If you like Amanda Quick, just check it out from the library. This is one of her less than great novels. Normally she's superb."},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"Concordia Glade has to set fire to the castle where her four schoolgirl charges are at risk in order to rescue them. However, their escape nearly goes wrong, until Ambrose Wells, reformed thief, appears on the scene for his own reasons.Thus starts a series of events which include murders, disguises, romance and complex plots. The usual Amanda Quick hallmarks are there - fierce rather than handsome hero, strong women giving up their virginity at the drop of a hat, journeys in carriages in the fog. This book is set in the Victorian rather than Regency period, although this makes little difference to the overall feel of the book. We meet the Vanzagarian society again, with John Stoner (a young man in \\"I Thee Wed\\") as an old Vanza master.This book was definitely a return to form after the rather disappointing Tobias March and Lavinia Lake series. No surprises in this book, it's standard fare, but well-written and gripping and fun too. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"This book works on many levels, which is a tribute to the meticulousness of the author. It is a romance, a mystery, a wonderfully atmospheric period piece, and a character study. The author has a theme which she carries through to the end with a twist (and you probably won't see it coming).I also enjoyed that she went down several layers of English society for her Victorian protagonists, giving her a great deal more flexibility with plot. Concordia and Ambrose are no hothouse plants, nutured in the English aristocracy and hidebound by tradition, but orphans who have learned how to survive by their wits. Yet they each have a core of goodness and decency, and the real question is whether they can overcome their sad childhoods and embrace the feelings they develop for each other.Well done and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"In the latter part of Queen Victoria's reign, Miss Concordia Glade accepts a position at Aldwick Castle as headmistress to four teenaged orphan girls. She gradually becomes aware that her employers are up to no good especially when she overhears them talk about auctioning off the girls. The place is well guarded making it almost impossible to get away but Concordia and her wards build and set off explosives that cause a diversion so that they can get to the stables.Once there they are caught by one of the guards but inquiry agent Ambrose Wells appears in the stables and helps them flee to his townhouse in London. He was hired to find out who killed Nellie Taylor. His investigation leads him to crime lord Alexander Larkin who is behind the auction that will soon take place. Ambrose intends to keep Concordia and her teenagers safe while he also seeks evidence that he can take to the police. Concordia, who believes she is the equal of any man, helps him until one of the perpetrators concludes she knows too much and must be gotten out of the way.Amanda Quick can always be counted on for quirky characters that don't fit into society and as a result are freer than most of their peers, but also find ways to get in trouble. While working together the two protagonists realize they are attracted to one another while the teen quartet play matchmaker nudging them along until one of them proposes marriage. LIE BY MOONLIGHT is one of MS. Quick's most charming and entertaining historical romantic investigative novels that she has ever written.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"Amanda Quick seems to get better with each new book. She also seems to be one of the few romance writers who can come up with a heroine -- Concordia Glade, in this story -- who is more than just the usual Lady Doormat. Concordia has a backbone without being a b**ch, is sensitive without being simpering and intelligent without over-apologizing for it. She's a woman with modern ideals trapped in a time where that and her unusual upbringing are scandalous to proper society. She has to hide who and what she is just to survive and to do what she loves, to teach.Ambrose Wells could easily have been the Lord Neanderthal of so many other bad romance novels, tall, dark, overbearing and condescending. But Ms. Quick doesn't allow him to degenerate into that clich&eacute;. Of course he has a mysterious past and he's incredibly handsome, but he respects Concordia instead of trying to dominate her. He works *with* Concordia, not around her in order to protect her young pupils and to solve the multiple murder mystery. Like any man of the time he would certainly prefer it if she didn't put herself in so much danger and allowed herself to be protected more, but once he realizes she's not the type of woman to cry for help and hide behind a man, he learns to accept that and her, and to love her for who she is instead of despite it.The mystery itself is a good one. Why were the girls taken from orphanages and tutored like Ladies? The answer isn't as easy as it first seems, although Concordia's conclusions were logical given the information she had. I certainly didn't see the bigger picture until she and Ambrose were able to dig further into things. The story moves along at a fast pace and there are some genuine surprises along the way, twists in the plot I never saw coming.I'd actually recommend this book to people as good fiction, and since I usually mock romances for fun, that's saying a great deal."},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"Quick is back in the late Victorian era with an irrepressible teacher, Concordia Glade. She meets Ambrose Wells, one of the last members of Vanza, while trying to save her four young pupils.

A minor character from Quick's Vanza novel, I Thee Wed,is reintroduced as an older gentleman linking the earlier period novels to this one. The mystery is interesting, there is the humor, and the story is fast paced. As always you will not be disappointed in this story. It makes a fun beach read."},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"I listened to the audio book, and the reader was not very good.

I found that I enjoyed it while I was reading, but after finishing it (which was only yesterday), I've already forgotten half the characters and large chunks of the plot.The story lacked some of the zest, romance, and spice of her other books, and I never really felt the chemistry between the hero and the heroine. They (and their blossoming relationship) felt hollow to me compared to some of the other characters that she's created. I'm in the process of reading one of her other newer ones right now (\\"Wait Until Midnight\\"), and I'm already finding that the main characters and their romance in that one seem to be coming to life much more quickly for me than the characters in \\"Lie By Moonlight\\".The story was overall not bad... worth reading if you just want an enjoyable, easy read, but some parts of the story really do border on silly. If you've read some of her other books, she makes a return to the whole \\"Vanza\\" thing in this one, although I never did figure out what purpose it had to the overall plot, and thankfully it did not take up half the book. The villains in the story are very weak and you never really feel much threat from them. I was hoping for some kind of unexpected twist at the end to spice it up a bit, but it didn't happen. It was a predictable Scooby Doo ending... \\"I'd have gotten away with it, if it weren't for you kids!\\". You could see the \\"twist\\" coming a mile away.So overall... it made me grin a few times, made me chuckle, made me roll my eyes a bit, and although I liked it, I'm really glad I took it out of the library instead of paying money for it. If you like the period type Private Investigator book, I enjoyed Quick's \\"Slightly Shady\\" and the other two books with Tobias March and Lavinia Lake much more than I enjoyed this one.

The last two AQ books I've read have been lacking her usual style and comic flair. Finally, she seems to be back on the right track. Lie By Moonlight has a protagonist who is likable and with whom one can relate, Concordia Glade. She is a bit of a modern woman and has distinct ideas regarding women's rights, but that only serves to make her character more interesting. The hero, Ambrose Wells, is a likable sort who actually began life in much less fortunate circumstances. He's not as overbearing and brooding as some Quick men. They have the usual mystery to solve and have a host of sidekicks, including a gay man - very unusual for a regency romance. Quick treats each character well.The plot is fast-paced and there are a few twists and turns. Overall, this is an excellent example of a good Amanda Quick work."},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"This was an excellent read. Full of suspense and romance with a lot of spice. The story starts out with Concordia hiring Mr.Wells to find out what really happen to her sister who she suspects was murdered. Meanwhile she trying to protect her students from certain harm and danger. Then there the mystery Mr. Wells himself who Concordia finds intriguing despite herself. This is a must read novel don't be surprise if you finish in one day."},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"When she learns that the female students she is teaching at a private boarding school are being sold as courtesans to the highest bidder, Miss Concordia Glade takes it upon herself to save them from this fate. She hatches a plan to sneak the girls out of the school and keep them in hiding until she can figure out their next step. What she doesn't expect is that a dashing gentleman named Ambrose Wells will turn up in the middle of her escape and help she and the girls to safety. Under Wells' protection, Concordia and the girls remain in hiding while the man in question tries to figure out who is behind the dastardly scheme to steal these young ladies' innocence.This is one of the only romance novels I've read in which I had no problems at all with the plot. The heroine didn't do something stupid that made me wish she would just grow up or mind her own business (which has happened frequently in the past with some of my favorite romances including Kingdom of Dreams by Judith McNaught and Love Me Forever by Johanna Lindsey). She had a dream at the beginning of the book, in this case to become the headmistress of her own school, and she went on to achieve it instead of letting it fall by the wayside when she got the guy (this was my main problem with Quick's The Paid Companion). And finally, she wasn't some young girl fresh out of the schoolroom who had no idea what she wanted (which happens more often than I could name). Concordia had a mind of her own, a passion for her students, and an even greater passion for the man in her life. All in all, this novel was essentially a perfect romance for me, and I can't think of the last time I felt this way. I would recommend this book wholeheartedly to Amanda Quick fans who might feel she's fallen off her game recently (which I thought when I read her newest book, Second Sight). It has all the mystery, wit, and excitement of a Quick, but it's done so well I can't think of a single complaint."},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"Completely modern Concordia Glade hopes some-day to establish a school for girls. But when she learns that the four girls in her charge are in danger--and might be subjects of a white slavery ring--she moves into action attempting an escape. Fortunately, professional investigator and seriously mysterious sometime thief Ambrose Wells is in the midst of his own investigation into the peculiar boarding school where Concordia taught. He helps Concordia and the girls escape, but finds himself falling for the strong-willed teacher.Concordia insists on becoming Ambrose's partner and employer as they search for the truth behind the mysterious boarding school and the criminal masterminds who have invested so much in these four students. But the criminals are intent on having the girls back--and don't draw the line at murder. Ambrose's mystical training and skills will be called to the ultimate test, both to confront the criminal masterminds who rule much of Victorian London, and to withstand the emotions he endures as Concordia repeatedly ignores his instructions and insists on thrusting herself into danger.Author Amanda Quick combines a darkly mysterious hero with a quirky and amusing heroine in a charming romance. Fortunately, both Concordia and Ambrose soon recognize the attraction they feel, but true love is never easy--especially when it involves a 'modern' woman who is unconcerned about her reputation and who is convinced that Ambrose only wishes to marry her to spare her from being 'ruined.'Quick makes the Victorian setting of her novel, with its continued emphasis on 'society' and its gradual transition to a more liberated worldview, come alive. Her writing is charming and witty. It's hard not to enjoy reading LIE BY MOONLIGHT.LIE is not exactly profound and the characters left me both chuckling and frustrated at some of the silly things they did, but Quick once again delivers an enjoyable diversion."},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"The well-toned male torso of sexy hero Ambrose Wells that emblazons the cover of Amanda Quick's latest novel, LIE BY MOONLIGHT, is sure to make it another New York Times bestseller. The classical statuary image used is as seductive as any modern-day Australian Gold Tanning Product poster. Quick knows what attracts her fans and LIE BY MOONLIGHT delivers passion, lust, adventure, and a suspenseful murder mystery along with a thoroughly modern perspective on one Victorian lady's view of the relationship between the sexes.The privacy of the palms in the warm and richly scented conservatory cast in moonlight creates the perfect spot for a sizzling rendezvous between lovers that showcases Quick's mastery at creating a steamy, sensual, and satisfying romantic scene. This kind of writing is what has attracted millions of readers to Quick's historical novels, as well as the contemporary novels she writes under her own name, Jayne Ann Krentz. The pure male cover guaranteed that lust would be found between the pages of LIE BY MOONLIGHT, but the conservatory scene is one you'll read more than once.\\"I thought you intended to ravish me\\" are hardly the words one would expect from Concordia Glade, a teacher in Late Victorian England in charge of four orphaned young ladies at Aldwick Castle. In her late twenties and raised by parents who fell in love at first sight and made some scandalous decisions to be together, Concordia boldly pursues her feelings for Ambrose Wells, the knight in shining armor who arrives unexpectedly at Aldwick Castle just in time to help her and her students escape a fiery castle and a scheme to sell orphaned girls for brothels.Courageous, smart and independent, Concordia has an unconventional and liberal view of the relationship between the sexes and social rules of the day, even allowing one of her students to wear pants inside the elegant mansion in which they are taking refuge. Concordia encourages her girls to read novels, including \\"sensation novels\\" and exposes them to a broad range of subjects that would allow them to pursue careers of their own --- shocking teachings for this period of history.Intrigued by the small flower tattoo above Ambrose's left pectoral and inflamed by her instant attraction to him, Concordia Glade trusts Ambrose with her safety and that of the four girls --- Hannah, Phoebe, Edwina and Theodora. Working together, Ambrose and Concordia unravel a trail of scandal and blackmail to identify the \\"gentleman\\" and other so-called respectable members of London society who are secretly behind many unexplained deaths and deceptions.Despite the ways of the secret society Vanza, to which professional thief turned \\"private inquiry agent\\" Ambrose Wells practices, he no longer is \\"master of his passions\\" in the presence of Concordia Glade. Concordia threatens his self-mastery and he doesn't care. Ambrose openly admits to her, \\"There is no hope for me, is there?\\" When Concordia gives herself to him for the first time, she has no regrets and tells him, \\"You were the right man.\\" Unconventional to the core, Concordia's proposal of marriage to Ambrose defies the decorum of the period, speaks volumes for women's liberation and suggests that men like Ambrose Wells were not threatened by the freethinking women who were present in Victorian London society --- but then what man wouldn't welcome a woman who would \\"lie by moonlight?\\"--- Reviewed by Hillary Wagy"},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"If you like Amanda Quick (Jayne Ann Krentz, etc) you will love this mystery/romance historical fiction.

In her early books, her Quick books we were filled with great characters, great plots ,and some great sexy scenes.

I thought the character development fell short, and we had more dialogue than actual excitement. I found myself interested in the story, liked the characters, but not wanting to go through all that reading for such a simple plot. Again, OK."},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"Another Amanda Quick winner. She writes so intelligently and descriptively. You could almost feel yourself in the graveyard! And I loved the end, and not just the love story-this story just made me feel good!"},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"I was pleased with this Romance, mostly because the story was so interesting. This teacher, Concordia (What a name!), escapes a burnings castle (they set the castle on fire themselves by the way) with her students. Bad guys are on their tail and it's up to our heroine to save the lives of these young women.In comes tall, dark, and handsome. Ambrose kind of takes over, but not really because our heroine didn't have things under control. His showing up is more of just a happy accident. So, we don't necessarily have a \\"Man rushes in and saves the day\\" situation, because lady was already saving it... she just got some extra help.Anyway. There's a really well developed mystery going on about why the girls were pretty much being schooled and raised properly to be farmed as wealthy wives for underclass crooks. More than once I just wanted to punch one of the bad guys right in the nose.Concordia is very intelligent and very independent, but not so independent that she's frosty and unlikeable. She likes Ambrose from the get-go, so not a lot of pretending not to like each other, which aggravates me the majority of the time. She's also very loving, with a touch of sisterly/motherly to her that softens her up and makes her even more likeable as a character.Ambrose is, you know, your general awesome hero. He's got the jaded past, the unbelievable smarts, the wealth, and the smarts. But he's also funny, indulgent with the girls (like a brother or father), and not overly protective or \\"Me Man, You Woman\\".The \\"romantic\\" parts weren't over the top or so frequent as to be a hindrance to the storyline. As a matter of fact Ms. Quick made one of them turn out downright hilarious. I appreciate this.There's mystery, wit, and adventure in \\"Lie By Moonlight\\" along with a great story of a woman that's not afraid of herself, her feelings, or her dreams.Applause to all the Concordia's out there. May there be an Ambrose for each of you!"},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"I believe Lie by Moonlight is my favorite Amanda Quick novel because it is the first of her books that I've read. Immediately, I was taken and very impressed by the writing style, the hero/heroine interaction, and the detailed setting. This story involves multiple characters with complex personalities and individual voices. As a writer myself, I'm very impressed and will continue to read the author's work under the various pseudonyms. Highly recommended for the novice writer who wishes to learn from a professional. By the author of Windrunner."},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"This is a historical romance about a teacher determined to protect her charges (four young ladies) against all comers. However, rather than being a gold digger, the hero here is the Victorian equivalent of a private investigator who just happens to practice mystical Eastern arts (and possesses a chest remarkably like a marble bust according to the cover). So the book is about two eccentric individuals colliding in the midst of madness, mayhem, and murder... which is standard cookie-cutter formula for Amanda Quick, who is on my chocolate-chip-cookie-comfort-books list. So I knew exactly what I was getting into and got exactly what I wanted, but I feel like I could have read any of her recent books because they've gotten so formulaic."},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"It's not a terrific book, it's not a memorable book, and it's not an enthralling book. To understand the underlying Vanza you have to have read the other Vanza books. The plot is terrific and it could have been a great book but it does really fall short.I don't regret reading it and will probably read it again (it'll be like I never read it!) but I'd say to get this from the library instead of buying it."},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"This Quick novel, although I did like it enough to read it the whole way through, did not contain the same suspense as some of her better novels. The ending was only minimally surprising and the plot was enough to keep someone interested, but not enough to be DRAWN to the book at all. Much of the time I felt like, \\"Oh, I guess I'll read that now...\\""},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"It felt like an Agatha Christie mystery with a little romance thrown in. Ambrose used to be a thief but is now a private inquiry agent (private investigator). He sees Cordelia (a teacher) and her four female students running away from a fire and helps them. The girls had been kidnapped and the plan was to sell them. Some people are murdered in connection with the events. The story had no major flaws, but overall, I did not enjoy it as much as I had hoped. I wasn't surprised or delighted. Once or twice the story felt a little plodding and slow, especially at the beginning. Cordelia and the girls were escaping from the castle and the girls kept expressing their fears. Cordelia kept saying we've practiced this before, just keep to the plan. I like strong and smart heroines as much as anyone, but Cordelia was unpleasantly strong and smart. She was almost too bossy, too perfect and overly confidant that she could handle herself in any dangerous situation. She was too demanding that Ambrose include her or do certain things. Overall, the story was ok, but I wouldn't recommend buying it.Sexual language: mild. Number of sex scenes: two brief scenes. Setting: Victorian England, sometime around 1890. Genre: historical romantic mystery with suspense.For a list of my reviews of other books by this author, see my 4 star review of \\"Sizzle and Burn\\" posted 2-09-08."},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"This is an interesting romance set \\"late in the reign of Queen Victoria\\" and it throws you into the story from the get-go. You first meet Concordia Glade and her young students as they are running away from the burning castle they've been staying in. This is also the moment that Ambrose Wells enters the story. He's investigating the castle and is a little put out that it's burning down but he offers to help Concordia and her four charges. The whys of their residence at the castle is interesting and the two main characters are quite well suited but their attitudes to sex are quite modern.I loved the way Ambrose received \\"payment\\" for his services. He came across as quite an interesting character with lots of depth. The four girls really didn't come across as deep characters, but there is an opening for them to have further adventures.For it's type it's quite good, and I did enjoy the story and enjoyed the ride, it's only after I finished reading that I started having some reservations about some aspects of the story. I look forward to more of the Vanzarian stories."},{"Title":"Lie by Moonlight","review":"Yay, another Vanza master, this time in the Victorian era. Ooh, sends shivers down the spine just thinking about how quick, how intelligent, how agile, how inventive Ambrose Wells is, yum. Truth be told, his father was murdered when he was a young teen, and Ambrose turned to a life of crime to support himself - until he met his match whilst burglarizing a Vanza master! Now he's turned from the dark side and is one of the good guys. He's investigating a possible murder when he encounters determined schoolteacher Miss Concordia Glade, hastening four of her tender orphaned charges away from some suspicious goings-on at their \`school', a heavily guarded castle. Concordia suspects the girls are being groomed for something very nasty and illegal, and smuggles them out with Ambrose's assistance and a couple of well-placed bombs! Hooray for Chemistry! Things turn into a very murky stew with further murders a-plenty, and the grim possibility the young girls are being hunted down ruthlessly. Naturally, Ambrose and Concordia get on the job to protect and defend. Concordia is a delight - unconventional, passionate, and such a champion of \`her girls' your heart will be caught. Ambrose, on the other hand, is knocked for six by Concordia; something most unusual. He is, after all, a control freak - he is a Vanza master.

In this one, two mostly estranged sisters are struggling to move forward in their lives. Meghann is a lonely divorce lawyer who has lost her sense of purpose in life. Years before, she and her sister Claire were separated when their mother disappeared and Claire was reunited with her biological father. Claire is a single mother whose entire life is consumed with caring for her 5-year-old daughter, Ali. For years, the sisters have struggled to reconcile what happened and the emotional fallout from the separation. When Claire meets the love of her life and starts planning a wedding in only two weeks, she and Meghann are forced to come together. Meghann, at an emotional and occupational crossroads, jumps into the wedding planning with both feet, struggling to both protect her sister and simultaneously support her. While visting her sister, Meg meets Joe, a completely lost apparent vagabond who inexplicably connects with her against all odds. With all of the complicated emotions, damaged characters and relationship landmines, the book really is an emotional rollercoaster.For me, the best part of the book is the relationship between Claire and Ali and Claire's attempts to balance the demands of her own heart with her responsibilities as a parent. Claire is a very genuine, \\"real\\" character and Ali is unspeakably adorable. In terms of the plot, I felt like the author went one step too far in pulling on the emotional heartstrings, with a plot twist that was almost too coincidental to be believed. I enjoyed the book, read it quickly and cared about the characters, but the plot was just a little too over the top."},{"Title":"Between Sisters","review":"At first I thought this book was hard to follow, but turned out a really good read.

It's the second book by Hannah I have read and she has a way of writing that sucks you in and you get invested in the characters' lives. Excellent book!It was so much more than a book about sisters.

She has been forlorn ever since she made a decision twenty-five years ago that benefited her beloved younger stepsister but left her alone. Their mother left the two siblings behind in Sacramento while she went off to Hollywood. Sixteen at the time, Meghan worried about her younger sibling Claire so she called the father of her stepsister. He came immediately as Claire was family, but Meghan felt he left her out as her father was someone else. The relationship between the sisters was never the same.When an estranged husband of a client almost kills Meghan, her colleagues and her psychiatrist tell her to go on vacation. Meghan has no place to go until Claire calls to tell her that she is marrying singer Bobby Austin. Meghan leaves Seattle for the campgrounds owned by Claire and her father in Hayden, Washington to protect her stepsister. As she realizes that Bobby loves Claire, Meghan falls in love with former doctor Joe Wyatt, who has more ghosts to contend with than Meghan.Though the angst at times feels overwhelming, fans of relationship dramas will take immense pleasure with Kristin Hannah's strong cast. Meghan, as the center of the tale, enables the audience to see deep inside her soul. The rest of the ensemble augments that perspective so that the audience observes a powerful tale of childhood demons that motivates adult behavior. BETWEEN SISTERS is more than just the relationship between the siblings, as the audience will appreciate this deep character study.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Between Sisters","review":"I have ready several of Kirstin Hannah's works, and I have never been disappointed.

I loved the characters in this book and plead with Ms Hannah to bring them all back to life in a trilogy! The entire cast of characters were very well thought out and depicted as every day people and professionals making their way in the world. I love the way she gave each one of them their own special personality quirks and the way humor was wound into the dialogue. The witty remarks helped to soften the tension and brought them to where the reader could really relate. After all, don't we all think these things and wish we'd said them? I love the pairing of Meg and Joe's story. Claire is just automatically loved. But, beside the main characters, Ali was a joy to encounter: the chatterbox little munchkin who weaves her way in and out of everyone's heart. Gina the best friend and loyal sister who everyone wants to possess in their family. And Mama.....I'm imagining her reunion with Sam someday. How romantic it would be to put that relationship right....trade her free spirit with Sam's sense of responsibility to family and visa versa and you could have a real Dallas type Dynasty going!The way this author addresses the delicate issues legal and medical professionals face that can affect their personal and professional lives is excellent. You see the extreme, the obsessed, the egocentric and negative. You are relieved when sensibilities are rescued and fascinated by the process.Although I most definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a good romantic relationship drama and praise Kristin Hannah for her excellent skills, you might feel as I did; a bit disappointed in the way the ending was wrapped up so quickly. It was almost contrite. I'm truly hoping Ms Hannah did this purposely so she could continue the story in another novel......Don't wait too long Kristin!

Meghann is definitely a surrogate mom to Claire though, as their mom who does nothing but sleep around with men, and is totally into her acting, has no time for the girls. But things change when Sam comes along. This is Claire's dad, and he is bitter that he never knew about having a daughter. He and Meghann don't get along, so Meghann leaves Claire's life for a very long time, causing an estrangement there for sure.When they grow up though, Meghann who has been more or less living on the streets, is taken under the wing by a caring teacher. She pursues a wonderful career as a divorce lawyer, and rolls in piles and piles of money. Over time, she becomes very snobby.Claire, on the other hand is very down-to-earth and doesn't mind getting her hands dirty. She owns a resort on a campground and had a daughter Allison unmarried whom she adores.Meghann is always very disapproving of Claire's very down-to-earth ways when the two make contact. It seems Meghann always knows just how to set Claire's teeth on edge. Especially when Claire meets the love of her life, Bobby, and wants to marry. Meghann of course, is nothing but critical of the whole thing.Yet, she wants to go to Claire's house and pay a visit, to talk her out of the impending marriage of course, but when she gets there, things change. Meghann decides to keep quiet and help with the wedding and so she does. But the two of them have a lot of hurdles to work through. They get through it, and then tragedy strikes Claire later in this book. It is then when Meghann opens her eyes, and realizes the love she has always had for her sister.And this is not all. There is a character, Joe, in the story who is just as down-to-earth as can be. When Meghann goes out and gets drunk one night at a bar, these two connect and a flicker of romance is in the air. It didn't seem to matter that Joe Wyatt lived on the streets as a bum. Meghann loved him anyway, interestingly enough. So she had no room to talk about Bobby and Claire anymore.

I haven't gotten much done today because I can't put this book down. Great Characters, great storyline, plenty of action and plenty of passion. This will be THE beach book of Summer of 2003. I can't wait to pass it on."},{"Title":"Between Sisters","review":"COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN, READ IT IN TWO DAYS.... a great story about family with wonderful likeable characters I would give it more stars if possible. Thank you Ms Hannah. Looking forward to reading your latest."},{"Title":"Between Sisters","review":"What a good story! The characters seemed so real. I miss them. Confirms that family is so important in this life!"},{"Title":"Between Sisters","review":"It was an interesting enought book up until the middle of the book and from there it was pretty predictable"},{"Title":"Between Sisters","review":"This was a wonderful story about the bonds of sisterhood. For anyone that has had or does have a sister it is a powerful reminder how special that relationship is."},{"Title":"Between Sisters","review":"If there is one thing author Kristin Hannah likes, it is stories about sisters. So, not unlike True Colors, we have another book about sisters. This time it is two sisters (Meghann & Claire). Older sister, Meghann, is a successful divorce lawyer but unlucky in love. Claire is a single mother and caretaker of a popular lodge. Meghann and Claire are not as close as they used to be, but things may change now that Claire is getting married.This is a good story. Again Hannah does a good job with character development and emotions. I think there was more romance in True Colors, which I liked more. This one is just about relationships between sisters."},{"Title":"Between Sisters","review":"This is the first book I have read by this Author and it will not be the last. This book has everything, great characters, wonderful plot and surprises. I will say that if you don't like a story that makes you cry, then don't read this. It's not a bad cry by the way, but you get so involved in the story that you find yourself there anyway. I downloaded it on Kindle and the formating was fine. Kristen Hannah has all the makings to be a must read."},{"Title":"Between Sisters","review":"I loved this book. Had a hard time putting it down and getting my chores done for the day. The sisters were so different yet so alike. I love how she writes about the Pacific Northwest with such detail. I passed this one to my sister."},{"Title":"Between Sisters","review":"I love finding a wonderful new (to me) author! Kristin Hannah is definitely in that category. Between Sisters is a touching story of missed opportunities, the depths of grief, love and the unbreakable bond of sisters. The story of Meghann and Claire is one of shared happiness and heartache, love and loss, and most of all, hope. Whether you have a sister or not, Ms. Hannah's words will take you in and not let go, even after you turn the last page. Note to reader: have a tissue handy."},{"Title":"Between Sisters","review":"Loved this book and all of her books. Kirstin Hannah is such a great author."},{"Title":"Between Sisters","review":"Another great read by Kristin Hannah. This endearing and mildly philosophical tale about two sisters learning tolerance and opening their hearts was well written as are her other very entertaining novels. I rated it less than perfect only because I had wanted the soft cover and received a very nice hard cover edition instead and because my favorite Kristin Hannah story remains Summer Island.

Wonderful book."},{"Title":"Between Sisters","review":"I don't understand how anyone could give this book less than 5 stars. It's a touching story about the strength of sisterhood bond. I was so moved by both sisters' stories and the growth of their relationship. I very seldom shed tears when reading a book, but this one did it for me. Congrats, Miss Hannah, for giving me a book that I could not put down."},{"Title":"Between Sisters","review":"Well the rest of the reviewers have told you the plot premise. It was an ok read. I have enjoyed Hannah's other books much more. As a health professional, the medical scene were a bit far fetched and that was very distracting for me. Won't recommend it to others."}]`),F={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},O=["disabled"],L={key:0},B={key:1};function q(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=y("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",x,[(t(!0),a(g,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),p(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",B,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",L,"See more"))],8,O)):b("",!0)])}const N=u(F,[["render",q],["__scopeId","data-v-dd8845bd"]]),W=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/55.md","filePath":"library/55.md"}'),M={name:"library/55.md"},R=Object.assign(M,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(N)]))}});export{W as __pageData,R as default};
