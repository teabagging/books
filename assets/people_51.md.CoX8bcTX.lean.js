Pecola Breedlove, our protagonist, is distraught at the fact that she's a black skinned girl living in a white girl world. Mrs. Morrison does an outstanding job in her descriptions of everything with beauty in her novels. For example, whenever something that appears attractive in the novel is mentioned, it usually has the word white attached to it. By following the book closely you can tell that with everything beautiful white is the word, with everything distasteful, is described black.Unfortunately Mrs. Morrison can take awhile before she can convey any points. One reason for this is because she changes narrators often, which makes following her points difficult. Mrs. Morrison also does not separate herself from any other novels that address struggling minorities. The character creates a fantasy world to leave her problems instead of using reasoning and creativity to address her challenges. Mrs. Morrison has created another in a long line of protagonists that point the finger instead of being self reliant. When posing questions about novels, authors should address ways to solve them among the way. Even if the topic happened fifty years before I was born. It's a book that was well written, but wasn't going anywhere from the start."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Indeed, Toni Morrison's The Bluest Eye is a novel that forces the imagination to reach into the conscious to find Jesus the giver of imperfect humanity as Pecola Breedlove is that symbol. She is not the tragic character many believe her to be; she is, I am convinced, a symbol of the divine. She yearns for blues eyes as those eyes are a representation of what is best in the world. If that is not a fact, that is because of the imperfectness of those who created the \\"ugly\\" in blue. Pecola did not do that; therefore, she is not tragic. Her gift is that she let the human beings around her dump their \\"garbage onto her.\\" Jesus did the same thing. The Bluest Eye is a superb work. It forces one to travel deep, into and underneath the human spirt into the divine.

As highly educated as we both are, this book was down right repulsive. I am against banning books and sometimes read them on that principal alone.

However, the entire plot of the novel revolves around the human desire for sex. The book disgusted me with its extensive descriptions of child molesting and prostitutes. I would have thrown the book away if I didn't have to read it for my honors English class. It blows my mind how this book is in many book clubs and how the author won a Nobel award. The entire book is sick, and if I didn't know better, I would say that its main audience purchases it at adult book stores."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"When I started to read this book I honestly thought it would be a nice book about racial identity, feeling good about who you are, etc. A book like that would transcend races and speak to everybody. The Bluest Eye does not celebrate the beauty of the black individual but instead simply and grotesquely trashes white characteristics (i.e. blonde-straight hair/blue eyes.) So if a little blonde-haired blue-eyed girl reads this book is she supposed to feel ashamed to have these characteristics?Toni Morrison does not impress me at all as a writer of substance because she doesn't add to anything; she reinforces a stereotype that white people=bad because the media pushes the idea of the ideal beauty as a white woman. Maybe she's upset because even black men tend to find white women more attractive than black women. Whose fault is that? The media?Another thing to consider is that during the \\"golden age\\" of film (she goes through a big thing about going to the movies and wanting to have blonde hair like the movie star) a majority of the moviegoing public was white in America, therefore the movies reflected the majority of their audience. I'll tell Toni Morrison a secret about movies, Japanese movies promote Japanese women as the most beautiful in the world. Maybe if Northern Africans made movies they could promote the black female. Are white filmmakers supposed to deny the beauty of white women because some little black girl might feel left out? Ridiculous and petty.So to me, this book is one big promotion of the downtrodden \\"victim\\" that is the African-American. Aren't people tired of this yet?"},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"As this story continued on I felt connections with the characters.

To others, she is considered ugly and looked down upon because of her dad's past. Her only wish is for blue eyes, so she too can be beautiful."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"There are no words that I can use to convey the beauty of this book.

I found some minor difficulty in identifying the order of events, particularly because it skipped around a lot. As the book went along, it became easier to piece the puzzle. The lengths one goes to for beauty can destroy you. This was true for Pecolia. She strove to be beautiful and have blue eyes but when she finally achieved this, she went insane. This problem of desiring to be beautiful still exists in today's society. Anorexia and Bulimia are major forms of destruction that affect young teenagers. After completing this novel, I feel that I have gained a better understanding as to what beauty truly is."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I was anxious to read this book, I know Oprah loved it and I heard alot of great reviews.

I really liked it because it gave deep details of everything that happened. One's life can be different from someone else's by just one feature, and the book gave those distinct details. A young girl about the same age of the main character might wonder why things have to be the way they are. She might even want to change the way she looks, just like Pecola did. From the way things seemed to me, Pecola and all of her family and friends were having enough trouble living in the 1900's. Living in a small state like Ohio made matters worse, but through it all they stuck together. As young as some of the main characters were, they seemed to know what things were about and how to deal with them. The families in this book really went along with one of the themes: Put up with what you were born with; make bad things good. From my point of view, reading this book would give you a view of what real life is."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Every book Tony Morrison writes speaks to me.

Her latest &quot;Paradise&quot;--some folks said they didn't understand it. Well I knew all of the characters in the first chapter. The same with all her books. She usually grabs me in the first sentence and sometimes the first paragraph.

It was about the culture, the history, the prejudices in Africa. It gave an insight on how these had affected the characters&iexcl; feelings, emotions and behaviour. The book was beautifully written but at the same time so intense that it invoked in me bitterness, sympathy and sadness."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book was so sad. The final chapter left me feeling a little hopeless and heart broken for Pecola. The ending was unexpected and I felt it made it worth reading. I felt some of the book was a little disjointed.

I would recommend to others."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I read this book on vacation. It's a very quick read and the symbolism of the bluest eye is quite easy to understand. The text is very similarly written to other Morrison's books. It is another story about the frustrating and tragic events of African American life. This text focuses on a group of girls growing up and their parents. This is a great text for freshmen and sophomores to read in their English class as a study of culture, racial divides and the symbolic structures that exist in American culture and in many other parts of the world that have been taught to believe (mostly by history) that the world is easier, more beautiful through blue eyes than brown."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I was amazed to see that Ms. Morrison, even in the infancy of her career as an author, was so vividly able to define characters, to get inside them, to portray them in a way that leaves the reader torn betwen pity and hatred, anger and respect. This is a skill which is shown in all of her work. I do agree with her own later assessment that the form in which the narrative was laid out was difficult to follow and definitely not the standard we have all come to love in such works as &quot;Song of Solomon&quot; and &quot;Beloved.&quot; I am, once again, pleased and astounded that she is always able to make you see some of the darker sides of her characters, the sides that we all possess, but are not obvious to those around us. She writes each character as if they each are revealing their individual souls. I applaude you, Ms. Morrison, for always being true to your characters. What this novel is missing that is so important is continuity of plot. You really don't get the sense throughout most of this book that it is, in fact, a story about Pecola, whereas I never had this problem in her later works. Certainly, her work is not approached by the light-hearted reader, for you never put down a Morrison book without having been deeply affected. The same is true here."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book is practically poetry.

The story is about humans becoming. Peccola is merely the recipient of all that has been handed down - her ugliness, her self loathing. I found the different points of view challenging. She draws the characters as complex beings, rather than one-dimensional monsters.If your looking for a happy ending, keep looking. Though Ms. Morrison admits to some faults in her afterword, the story moves and teaches, the most we could ask of any story teller."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book gives the reader a clearer understanding of what it is like to suffer from racism in this country. It is a must read for people of all races - there is a good reason why Oprah picked it for her new book of the month selection!"},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Seriously, this is the only review of this book? She uses bad language and there is a lot of sexuality? Unfortunately, I haven't read this book (which is why I am looking at it on Amazon in the first place) but I thought people who looked at this page deserved a better review than that, so here is the Amazon.com review of the other cover version of the novel:Oprah Book Club Selection, April 2000: Originally published in 1970, The Bluest Eye is Toni Morrison's first novel. In an afterword written more than two decades later, the author expressed her dissatisfaction with the book's language and structure: \\"It required a sophistication unavailable to me.\\" Perhaps we can chalk up this verdict to modesty, or to the Nobel laureate's impossibly high standards of quality control. In any case, her debut is nothing if not sophisticated, in terms of both narrative ingenuity and rhetorical sweep. It also shows the young author drawing a bead on the subjects that would dominate much of her career: racial hatred, historical memory, and the dazzling or degrading power of language itself.Set in Lorain, Ohio, in 1941, The Bluest Eye is something of an ensemble piece. The point of view is passed like a baton from one character to the next, with Morrison's own voice functioning as a kind of gold standard throughout. The focus, though, is on an 11-year-old black girl named Pecola Breedlove, whose entire family has been given a cosmetic cross to bear:You looked at them and wondered why they were so ugly; you looked closely and could not find the source. Then you realized that it came from conviction, their conviction. It was as though some mysterious all-knowing master had given each one a cloak of ugliness to wear, and they had each accepted it without question.... And they took the ugliness in their hands, threw it as a mantle over them, and went about the world with it.There are far uglier things in the world than, well, ugliness, and poor Pecola is subjected to most of them. She's spat upon, ridiculed, and ultimately raped and impregnated by her own father. No wonder she yearns to be the very opposite of what she is--yearns, in other words, to be a white child, possessed of the blondest hair and the bluest eye.This vein of self-hatred is exactly what keeps Morrison's novel from devolving into a cut-and-dried scenario of victimization. She may in fact pin too much of the blame on the beauty myth: \\"Along with the idea of romantic love, she was introduced to another--physical beauty. Probably the most destructive ideas in the history of human thought. Both originated in envy, thrived in insecurity, and ended in disillusion.\\" Yet the destructive power of these ideas is essentially colorblind, which gives The Bluest Eye the sort of universal reach that Morrison's imitators can only dream of. And that, combined with the novel's modulated pathos and musical, fine-grained language, makes for not merely a sophisticated debut but a permanent one. --James Marcus --"},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I don't know if its just me, but this was simply the worst book I have ever read. I normally enjoy the &quot;Oprah's Book Club&quot; selections, however I found this selection disjointed, uninteresting and hard to follow. Knowing that this was the #1 paperback at the time that I purchased the book, I continually forced myself to keep reading the book because I thought that it would get better. It never did! I was so frustrated by the end that I had to tell someone about it!"},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The Bluest Eye is about race relations and, as such, can never be completely understandable to a non-American such as me. It revolves around a simple and very sad story of rape, incest and the victimisation of a little girl in 1940s America. It is told from the point of view of blacks - this was before the term African-American - and partly in another child's voice. The little girl thinks herself ugly and envies the looks of blue-eyed whites. That a black child could consider herself physically inferior was a real shock to me, and for considering this only, the book is worth reading. One wonders how much this has changed in the last four decades.There is a broader subject, however, which is the psychological impact and destructive power of models of beauty, especially feminine beauty. This, unfortunately, is only alluded to and could have been addressed in far more depth. The book also lacks the victim's own voice. Because it is told in chronological disorder and from different protagonists' angles, the story tends to be less strongly felt. At times it almost reads like a documentary. Perhaps this is for the best, since some scenes might have been unbearable if told by the central character herself. Still, while interesting and often revealing, this book too often gave me the impression of being unfinished."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Toni Morrison made the characters in the book come alive. I can relate to this book because everyone deals with racism, it doesn't matter the age or color."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Morrison's The Bluest Eye is clearly concerned with focusing on the effects of racism on a young black girl, Pecola. The novel is well written material that varies in point of view, giving it spice, and can be characterized as &quot;easy reading&quot; -- although it is still deep in content. The book does have several flaws. First, being an &quot;ignorant&quot; white male, I personally had difficulty identifying with the situation of Pecola. Second, the theme of destructive white racism is counteracted by the situation of Pecola. The fact that Pecola's family is so disfunctional detracts from the validity of the theme, causing Pecola's life to be looked at as an isolated incident and also destroying the intended universality of the theme. Finally, on a personal note, the constant descriptions did get quite annoying at times. The Bluest Eye is for the reader who is eager to be depressed by pessimism. In the historical context of the period during which it was written, the novel is wonderful, but it hardly can be applied accurately to modern society."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book is one of the best books I have ever read and I recommend it to anyone. The only thing that will make this little girl happy is to have blue eyes. She thinks that by having blue eyes all the pain she has suffered in the book will be wiped away. Everyone will like her if she has beautiful blue eyes and it seems too cruel not to give her that wish. It is such a simple wish that is impossible to grant or is it? Having blue eyes myself, I can tell you that one physical feature doesn't make you loved anymore or less, but it's the fact that she thinks it shows just how innocent her thinking is. I don't want to give away any of the story, but it is one that will touch your heart and make you angry at one point, shocked at another and sad at the same time."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This is one of the best books i have read.

Pecola Breedlove is driven towards insanity because she refuses to see the beauty that lies within herself. She sees only the white &quot;blue eyed&quot; doll as the only acceptable form of beauty and since she has been told that she is ugly her whole life, she has no control over her obsession with blue eyes. The same sterotypical ideas of beauty exist today more than ever.

After reading the book again, I am again struck by how much she can say in this little book. Pecola is a pathetic figure that makes one truly question their place in the world. The idea that to be beautiful one must look a certain way is an idea Pecola struggles with every day in her search for &quot;the bluest eyes&quot; as many of us in today's world also struggle to be happy with our identities. I enjoyed reading this book and highly recommend reading it."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Morrison's style, while easy to read, necessitates that herreaders stop and think about what is really going on in the novel.It's possible to breeze through the book without giving the events much thought.

I doubt any reader could not want to reach into this book and remove Pecold Breedlove from her family's abuse and insanity before it ultimately engulfs her. Doomed from the start, Pecola becomes the innocent victim of everyone around her. Toni Morrison has captured the evils of racism, incest, and abuse, and shown their very tragic results through Pecola in a very haunting, yet unfortunately all too real, manner. Without a doubt, one of the most emotional stories I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Was I moved by this novel? Yes. Is Toni Morrison a literary genius? Yes. Did this book deserve the Nobel Prize? Yes.I have read quite a few of the reviews for this book and there is a contention of people who seem to believe this novel was written simply to trash whites and victimize blacks. While I do believe there is a certain degree of anger directed at the Caucasian race in this novel, one must take a step back and look at everything more objectively. Yes, white people were bad in this novel... but were the blacks so good? Surely one must realize nearly every black person we meet in this novel is extremely flawed in some way. I think it is quite pretentious to believe that Toni Morrison simply sat down one day and decided to write a book about how bad blacks have it.When I started reading this book, I thought it would be about racial identity among African-Americans. When I finished, however, I realized the message this book contains deals with beauty in general. Whether you are black or white, you can appreciate the moral of this novel: Accept who you are. After all, if Pecola's eyes had really turned blue, what then? She would have looked strange. No one would have loved her any more. I believe Toni Morrison did a fine job of showing her thoughts on the subject of race, identity, and individual beauty.Everyone ought to read this book."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Originally published in 1970, Toni Morrison's &quot;The Bluest Eye&quot; was the first novel by a writer who would go on to receive the Nobel Prize for literature, and be acclaimed as one of the major literary figures in the United States. But if you wish, ignore the author's history and just go ahead and read the book: it is one of the most powerful, devastating portrayals of African-American life ever written.&quot;Eye&quot; centers around Pecola Breedlove, a small Black girl from a horrifically dysfunctional family (in a 1993 afterword, Morrison describes them as &quot;a crippled and crippling family&quot;). Pecola's story begins in the fall of 1941, but Morrison moves back in time to tell the fuller story of the girl and her family. Morrison's skill as a writer is evident from the opening pages, in which she chillingly deforms the archetypal, Eurocentric &quot;Dick and Jane&quot; readers.A central theme of &quot;Eye&quot; is how Black children's psyches can be damaged by the Eurocentric foci of American popular culture. Figures like the Raggedy Ann dolls and Hollywood stars become ominous figures in Pecola's tragedy. The story is full of memorable, often grotesque characters, such as three prostitutes (described as &quot;merry gargoyles&quot;) whom Pecola loves.&quot;Eye&quot; is full of painful, shocking incidents that illustrate the contours of human cruelty, abuse, and brokenness. I believe that this novel shows Morrison to be a true literary heir of William Faulkner. &quot;The Bluest Eye&quot; may strike some readers as just too horrific and depressing, but I believe that it is a novel that deserves an attentive readership."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"As one reads Toni Morrison's THE BLUEST EYE, the reader first gets the impression that the battle for survival in a white dominant world is a hopeless one. The events of the novel are filtered through the eyes of an adult Claudia McTeer, who remembers what it was like to be a nine year old child back in the fall of 1940. Claudia shares her duties as a narrator with an eleven year old Pecola Breedlove, who suffers unspeakable cruelties at the hands of her father and by extension of society in general. The world of THE BLUEST EYE is full of damaged people, some of whom, like Pecola suffer in waves that drown their basic selves. Others, like Claudia and her sister Frieda, suffer, but find the strength to resist and to grow, perhaps even to heal and to forgive. Others, like Cholly Breedlove and his wife suffer but in ways that allows that suffering to grow into a malignancy that devours what may once have been decency, the result of which is to create an entirely new human whose sole function is to release their pain by inflicting greater pain on others.This concept of coming to grips with suffering in a healing context or permitting that suffering to overwhelm the book's major characters is a function of the bitter racism that was then prevalent. When truly innocent children like Pecola suffer, her obvious pain elicits a powerful sense of sympathy from the reader. She has done no wrong, but the failings of her parents to come to terms with their own suffering from racism, make Pecola's agony unendurable. What Morrison has accomplished in her four season howl of pain is to make it clear that despite the horrendous mistreatment of Cholly towards his daughter or the coldness of Pauline towards Pecola, there are no true villains present. Morrison gives a mitigating rationale for the brutality of those who shower brutality on others. When Cholly rapes Pecola, he is re-enacting the rage that he felt years earlier when his first attempts at lovemaking were interrupted and ridiculed by a trio of white men who thought it great fun to watch a pair of adolescent blacks fumble at what was to them a momentous and life affirming event but to the whites merely a source of racist entertainment.By the end of the novel Morrison suggests that Pecola's quest for blue eyes was mirrored by nearly everyone else who sought their own version of blue eyes. Everyone fails at their own quest, but it is the attempt to survive by finding a meaningful quest that renders that quest worthwhile in the first place. Suffering, then, is seen as only the first step toward redemption. It is what one does with that suffering that permits one to grow or to die. No author has said this more clearly than Toni Morrison."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"It's hard to believe that this powerful, beautifully written story is Toni Morrison's first novel. As always, Morrison's prose is masterful and her imagery is sublime. It says a lot about Morrison's skill that this is one of the most disturbing books I have ever read. For me, this was essentially a story about how much pain and abuse can be heaped upon one small, innocent child before she breaks. Pecola, the young black girl at the heart of the story, has committed no crime except being ugly. As she is repeatedly hurt, negligected, ostracized and violated by everyone around her, she concludes that if only she had blue eyes, she would suddenly become lovable. Morrison invites all of us to examine our hidden prejudices when it comes to race and appearance. It's not a pleasant experience, but it is a meaningful one. This book stays with you, and you'll be glad it does."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This is an excellent book. I actually read some of the paragraphs out loud just because they sounded so beautiful.....I don't agree with the authors conclusion in the &quot;afterward&quot; that she, the author, should not have assembled the narrative into &quot;parts that had to be reassembled by the reader&quot;. I thought it worked extremely well. I usually get bored reading about the characters' family, their parents and grandparents, etc., but in THIS book, I was in awe of the author that she could make me enjoy reading about every single character in the book. I believe that Toni Morrison actually DID lead her readers &quot;into an interrogation of themselves for the smashing.&quot; That outweighed the pity we felt for the character. This book deserved the Nobel Prize - which it won. This book is worth the price and was a pleasure to read.

Herquest for beauty in a racially prejudiced world and the destruction ulitmately leads her to is both sad and understandable. There are so many forces working against this child that she cannot possibly overcome all of them and while reading the book, my heart just went out to this tiny victim of a society that has such a narrow view of human worth.

It's a very short read, and at times i suppose, tangetal or confusing organizationally. But if you've read anything by morrison you know that the seemingly disorganized way she writes is all part of the final feeling you get. It truely is heart wrenching, seeing what pecola goes through, with no resolution. The graphicness with which she describes certain things, is absolutly necessary, you need to be disguisted. If you've never read toni morrison and are curious about this book - get it. But don't put it down after a chapter or two because it seems unorganized and you dont know where it's going.

(We had read Beloved as a class, so I was curious to read more books by Toni Morrison). The Bluest Eye is without a doubt one of the most wonderful books I have ever read. I was moved to tears at points throughout the novel, and I am rarely so deeply moved by books. For the record, I believe this to be a better introduction to Toni Morrison's style than Beloved is. Beloved, while extraordinary, can be confusing ... The Bluest Eye is not. I sped through this relatively short novel and was left wanting more. Do yourself a favor and read this book!"},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Several of Toni Morrison&#65533;s books have been noted as strange. The Bluest Eye does not fall short of all the others.The book goes into vivid descriptions of everything, including the episode of the Pecola Breedlove being raped by her father. Morrison also uses the omniscient point of view to let you know the thoughts of all the characters, from the gossiping women of the small black town of Lorain Ohio, to the thoughts of Cholly, Pecola&#65533;s father, while he is raping her.Throughout the book Morrison gives you flashbacks into the characters life to help you understand why they think the way they do now. I found this style of writing confusing. I thought the book would be all about Pecola and her struggle, although it was quit the opposite; Morrison spends more time telling the sad and tragic story of many characters throughout the book.This will stick with me for a long time, but only because I was left with a lot of questions. Not about Pecola and her desire for blue eyes, I understand that perfectly. I&#65533;m wondering about the author, and how she concocted this sad, odd, and very tragic story in her head."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison, is a magnificent piece. It is focused on an 11-year old black girl named Pecola Breedlove, who falls prey to the false notions of white superiority. The white community, her family and Soaphead Church promoted this notion.There are plenty of ugly things in the world and Pecola is subjected to most of them. She's abused both mentally and physically, and raped and impregnated by her own father. There's no doubt to why she think and feel ugly, she yearns to be the opposite of what she is-yearns to be a white child, she wants the blondest hair and the bluest eyes.Toni Morrison's The Bluest Eyes was sad yet liberating. She goes in depth about self-hatred, which keeps her novel grasping the reader attention. In the book, she gets across a very powerful idea that is found in every society today. Although the book is written during the 1940's and most of the events that occur mirror that time period, the main idea transcends to this day and age. With a persuasive argument in mind and a poor, innocent black girl to appeal to the reader's pathos, Morrison craftily writes her story. Morrison's argument is how influential society can be on an individual and how strongly it's ideas and views are impressed upon that individual. The ideas and views that she speaks of mostly pertain to beauty and what makes an individual beautiful. This idea of beauty can turn someone's life upside down and in the end lead him or her to madness. Morrison is trying to impress upon her reader's what a negative effect society's ideas and views can have on an individual and how that individual's life is changed forever.Toni Morrison is also the author of Sula, Paradise, Song of Solomon, Tar Baby, Beloved, and Jazz. She has worked in publishing and has taught at various universities. Morrison is currently the Robert F. Goheen Professor at Princeton. Along with the Nobel Prize she received in 1993, Toni Morrison was also awarded the National Book Foundation Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters in 1996.The book will have no value to you if you can't use your imagination and put yourself in Pecola shoes. You need to be open-minded to grasp the object of the book."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I understand that Toni Morrison is heralded as one of the leading African-American writers in the States. I have no doubt that much of 'The Bluest Eye' echoes the memories of African-American, even in contemporary times.The problem with 'The Bluest Eyes' for me is that it was not accesible to me as a foreigner. I found the title a crude and obvious metaphor of self-hatred due to race - and I don't mean to reduce it to just that but for a non-literary reader, it is how it appears to be. The plot and metaphors used in the novel did not engage me as a reader because I found it devoid of poetry. I did however, liked the interesting style that Morrison uses by switching to different voices. The novel could have been more sophisticated but it failed to hook me and I did not find it memorable. What I can recall is that it is filled with sorrow - and perhaps it is exactly as Morrison intended and for which, she achieved, but it did not encourage me to return to her writings.I understand that this may not be an accurate view of the novel and I can understand why it may be popular and applauded in America. However, a novel is often judged on its appeal in the way it moves the reader. Unfortunately, the style and language that Morrison employed in this novel did not capture my attention."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I have seldom felt as depressed as I did the day I finished reading &quot;The Bluest Eye&quot;; not because I was sad it was finished, but because it is simply an overwhelmingly depressing book. So, if you are fond of books that make you feel this way, you will love it. Personally I hated it for this reason, but I give it an extra star because at least it made me feel at all."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I had to do a huge project on this book and know it cover to cover. From someone that HATES all assigned reading with a passion, I loved this one. DO NOT read it if you are already depressed though - it can be a killer. Don't let that discourage you, it's a great book, and one that you'll always remember."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"A novella or a collection of vignettes? No plot, just a theme, incestuous sexual abuse among unfortunate African-Americans in the mid 20th century, and childhood anecdotal reminisces, didn\`t satisfy me. Though filled with wonderfully creative metaphors and similes that were worth applauding, poetic writing simply does not suffice for story. Maybe one day Pecola, Claudia, or Pauline might be fleshed out and made the heroine of a novel with beginning, middle, and climax, which will intrigue with its complexities, but 'Blue' was more like reading a writer's notebook containing sketches of potential characters for future novels. I've read other books by T. Morrison that were hung on a plot... like The Song of Solomon and Paradise, which I would recommend to readers who want more."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Having blue eyes myself, it's hard for me to comprehend why someone would want to change the beauty and uniqueness of oneself. Yet, the authors explination of young Pecola's life gives the answer to that statement. Pecola is growing up in a rough household in which her parents constantly argue, her brother constantly runs away, and Pecola hides behind her &quot;ugliness.&quot; The young girl feels that if only she could conform to the societies ideal beauty her family life would change into a more loving and caring enviroment. Since the society looks upon &quot;Shirley Temples&quot; as the ideal beauty, Pecola feels that if only she would have blue eyes she would be beautiful and all her problems would go away. I felt that even though this book takes place in the 1940s, the same problems exist for young girls growing up today. The tall skinny supermodel look is something all young girls of the 21st century strive for. Just as in the 1940s the ideal beauty was to be white with blonde hair and blue eyes. I feel that the descriptions of this book may not be appropriate for children, but a mature young adult would find it educational."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Reading the bluest eye was my first time ever reading a Toni Morrison book and I have to say I was very confused and distraught while reading this book. I have heard rave reviews about Ms. Morrison and decided to read the book. The writing of this book is choppy and all over the place, this leaves you confused yet yearning to read more because you know it will get better. The bluest eyes takes you into the lives of the Breedloves, a poor African American family during the time of racism, prejudice and injustices. We meet the character Cholly, Pauline, Pecola and Sammy. You would think they are the main characters and in a way they are but \\"Claudia\\" seems to be telling the story. Along with the lack of character development, there is a lot of description of characters who could have been tapered down and we should have dug more into Pecola's story, since the book s about her wanting blue eyes so that she will be loved. Overall the book was okay but I was expecting more from a Toni Morrison book. I am 20 now so when I reread the book in a couple of years I hope the revelations that it s to spark are sparked within me and I see the meaning of the book."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I have read much of Toni Morrison's work. This is par for the course - outstanding. 5 stars. The prose is exceptional, and the story pulls one along at a fine pace. The characters are beautifully built, and the descriptions could be poetry, but the book is not long-winded by any means, and one never loses the story thread in mucky floridity, and I am pulled through until I am regrettably at the end. I don't know how Morrison does this in the short space of 224 pages - she weaves a complete, magical story around totally believable characters, and keeps me enthralled. I wish there was more material out there like this."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I think with Toni Morrison's The Bluest Eye you either love it or hate it there's no in between because Ms. Morrison didn't hold any punches when writing this American classic. And yes, The Bluest Eye is an American Classic and it should be assigned as required reading since it explores how society can basically demoralize and cripple an entire generation of people and how it becomes cyclical if not addressed. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Book was in good condition as the seller stated, but the pages are yellowing from age which makes me think I payed way too much for it. It also took forever to be delivered. I ordered several things off Aamazon that day and every seller managed to get me my orders within a week in a halfor sooner, this order took over 3 weeks. I needed this book for a class, and barely got it in time."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I still remember the quote I heard that first fueled my desire to start reading The Bluest Eye, by Toni Morrison. \\"If my mother was in a singing mood, it wasn't so bad. She would sing about hard times, bad times, and somebody-done-gone-and-left-me-times. But her voice was so sweet and her singing-eyes so melty I found myself longing for those hard times, yearning to be grown without \`a thin di-I-ime to my name.' I looked forward to the delicious time when \`my man' would leave me, when I would \`hate to see that evening sun go down...' \`cause then I would know \`my man has left this town' Misery colored by the greens and blues in my mothers voice took all the grief out of the words and left me with a conviction that pain was not only endurable, it was sweet.\\" Immediately, I was struck by the poetry of her writing. The way she personified misery with greens and blues and the set up of her oxymoron \\"sweet pain\\" was amazing to me. Toni Morrison's unique style and evocative imagery appeals to readers of all kinds.Every sentence of the book portrays a new image. The first sentence of chapter one, \\"Autumn\\" and already readers are intrigued. Morrison writes, \\"Nuns go by as quiet as lust, and drunken men and sober eyes sing in the lobby of the Greek hotel.\\" The reader finds themselves pondering the unusual simile of nuns and lust, and the ironic juxtaposition of nuns and drunken men. The tone of the sentence helps to set up the over all mood of the passage.Throughout her novel, Morrison utilizes similar stupefying creative language that allow her readers not only to imagine and create pictures, but allow them to feel, and evokes emotion. She uses several metaphors, for instance, the longing for blue eyes, by Pecola, an African American girl who is looked down upon because she is ugly. Pecola believes that blue eyes are the representation of the beauty associated with the white middle to upper class. Morrison also uses the growth marigolds to represent the health and growth of Pecola's baby. When the marigolds don't bloom, Pecola's baby does not live.With her use of figurative language, Morrison appeals to her readers pathos. She describes Pecola's want for blue eyes, \\"It had occured to Pecola some time ago that if her eyes, those eyes that held the pictures, and knew the sights-if those eyes of hers were different, that is to say, beautiful, she herself would be different...Each night, without fail, she prayed for blue eyes. Fervently for a year she had prayed. Although somewhat discouraged, she was not without hope. To have something as wonderful as that happen would take a long, long time.\\" The visual imagery of a young girl hoping, longing for a certain color of eyes makes the readers sympathize, and feel pity for her Pecola. They long with her, that someday, she may indeed get her blue with beauty eyes.Readers are sure to fall in love with the writing of the novel, and have their hearts broken by the plot itself. Continuously interesting, and beautiful, The Bluest Eye draws readers in, consumes their emotions and is sure to evoke all kinds of emotions."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I've bought this audiobook as a help to understand it.

Her parents Cholly and Pauline, and older brother Sammy, all believe the family is cursed with it. Pecola's parents viciously fight and Sammy runs away from home on a regular basis, while Pecola tries to make her body disappear.All of the ugliness in Pecola's life would vanish, she believes, if only she had blue eyes. Such pretty eyes - belonging in the faces of priviledged white girls, smiled upon and coddled by all the world - would no doubt see and bring more beauty than anything belonging to a dark-skinned child.Pecola's simultaneous obsession with and hatred of blonde-haired, blue-eyed girls is shared by the story's narrator, her friend Claudia. Despite living in a decent-enough home with her parents and sister Frieda, Claudia still notices the white girls in her world and fixates upon them, even hating blonde baby dolls for what they represent.Then along comes Maureen Peal, a new classmate whom everyone instantly adores. Yet Maureen, half black and half white, further complicates Claudia's musings. She both hates Maureen and longs for the friendship and acceptance of such a perfect, beloved being.One scarcely has to be black or a little girl to appreciate Morrison's message in this unforgettable novel. Most of us have, in some shape or form, longed to change our physical selves, truly believing that our lives would be more beautiful if only we could alter our appearances.This classic is certainly worth the acclaim it has had over the years, and will remain in readers' memories."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This novel impressed me as being a rich, poetically transcending, yet highly personal portraiture, of \\"small town\\" life, from across the tracks, in early forties America.

It was an exciting and soulful stew of a story, dark and esoterical enough to keep the reader involved along it's journey.

With very vivid detail and meaningful language, Morrison puts her soul out there for everyone to see. Morrison opened up my eyes to the painful outcomes our society can create. This book kept me turning the pages so I could see what happened next. Morrision?s use of language made me feel like I was right there beside each character listening to all their stories. Morrision?s organization of the book sets you up to the ultimate understanding at the end of the book. As a lover of fiction this is a novel that I will never forget. It offers us poetic language and striking detail that takes us on a journey through life.This novel tells us the story of young Pecola Breedlove who desperately yearns for blue eyes to gain acceptance and love. Everyone torments this young, African American girl, in her hometown of Lorain, Ohio because she is unsightly and does not look like the symbol of beauty, which is blond hair and blue eyes. Pecola lives in an abandoned store and has a very disturbed home life. Her drunken father is very abusive, her mother is a strong woman, but is in love with the symbol of beauty and her brother always seems to run away. Each of these characters has a devastating effect on Pecola?s destruction on her quest for blue eyes. Pecola?s life changes profoundly for the worse. She is inevitably shattered by the negative thoughts of people all around her and destroyed by the emotional and sexual abuse from her family.This novel expresses some serious themes that are present in our society today. Morrision presents to us the notion of black self-hatred and what society does to people who want to be beautiful. It hurts me to know that the only thing Pecola prayed for was blue eyes. Pecola just wanted to be loved and capture the attention her family was not providing her with. This is a very good book to read if you are feeling down about your appearance because it makes you realize that you cannot go by what society thinks is beautiful, you have to go by what is on the inside. Pecola was a beautiful girl on the inside but nobody realized that because everyone was too caught up with what beauty is on the outside. Pecola hated herself because she wanted to be just like Shirley Temple and all the grown-ups emphasized this too. The lesson in this story is people need to be true to themselves and know who they really are and not be caught in the deadly trap of the media or society.If you like serious, touching, make you want to cry, fiction novels, then this is the book for you. I think anyone can learn something from its deep and somewhat hidden themes. This novel touched me and made me want to go find Pecola and give her a big hug and say to her ?I will be your friend.? This novel threw me into a whirlwind of different emotions. At times I just wanted to cry and at other times I was completely raging. There were times when I wanted to scream at the characters and there were times where I just wanted to put myself in Pecola?s head and defend her and make things right. This book should reveal to you how bad things can get in our society and that we need to stop them from happening. I think that this is what Morrison was trying to get across. Everyone needs to realize these things and then we can work on changing them for the better."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Toni Morrison's The Bluest Eye is an intriguing book about why beauty gets wasted in America. The story revolves around many main characters, Claudia MacTeer, Claudia is a fighter she rebels against adults' cruelty towards children and against the black community's respect of white beauty standards, and she is nine years old. Frieda MacTeer is ten; she is Claudia's older sister, Frieda, like Claudia is independent and stubborn. But because she is closer to adolescence, Frieda is more vulnerable to her community's admiration of beauty refraining to the white color of your skin. Frieda is more educated about the adult world and sometimes more courageous than Claudia they live with their parents in Lorain, Ohio.Pecola is the protagonist of the novel. She is 11-year-old black girl. She thinks that she is very unattractive and that having blue eyes would make her beautiful. She inactively suffers the abuse of her mother, father, and classmates. She is lonely and has a great sense of imagination. Pecola's father, Cholly is reckless, but in a dangerous way. Having experienced early embarrassments, he takes out his anger on the women in his life. He is capable of both affection and fury, but as the story unfolds, rage gradually dominates. Pecola's mother, Pauline believes that she is ugly, resulting in her being lonely and cold. She has a distorted foot and visions herself as the willing victim of a dreadful marriage. She finds meaning in romantic movies and in her job caring for a rich white family, not her own. Pecola's father has tried to burn down his family's house, and Claudia and Frieda feel sorry for her. Pecola loves Shirley Temple; she is her symbol of the perfect girl, believing that whiteness is beautiful and that she is ugly. Pecola lived with the MacTeers for a little while but then decides to move back in with her family, and her life is difficult. Her father is an alcoholic, her mother is isolated, and the two of them often beat each other. Her brother, Sammy, regularly runs away. Pecola believes that if she had blue eyes, she would be respected and loved and that her life would be altered. In the meantime, she frequently receives confirmation of her own sense of ugliness. The cashier at the candy store looks right through her when she buys candy; boys tease her, and a lighter skinned black girl, Maureen, who temporarily was friends with her makes fun of her too. She is wrongfully held responsible for killing a boy's cat and is results in being called many disrespectful names by his mother.We discover that Pecola's parents have both experienced complicated lives. Her mother, Pauline, has a deformed foot and has always felt secluded. Pauline gets absorbed in movies, which confirm her principle that she is ugly and that idealistic love is reserved for the beautiful. She encourages her husband's violent actions in order to strengthen her own role as a martyr. She feels at her best when she is at work, cleaning a wealthy white woman's home. She adores this house and despises her own. Cholly, Pecola's father, was abandoned by his parents and brought up by his great aunt, who passed away when he was in his young teens. He was humiliated by two white men who found him having sex for the first time and made him carry on while they watched. He ran away to find his father but was rejected by him. By the time he met Pauline, he was a rootless and wild young man. He feels trapped by his marriage and has lost interest in life completely. Claudia and Frieda discover that Pecola has been impregnated by her father (Cholly), and unlike the rest of the neighborhood, they wish for the baby to live. They give up the money they have been saving for a bicycle and plant marigold seeds. They believe that if the flowers they planted live, so will Pecola's baby. The flowers refuse to grow, and Pecola's baby dies when it is born prematurely. Cholly rapes Pecola a second time and then deserts the family, he dies in a workhouse.Pecola desires blue eyes so much that she visits a man named Soaphead Church. He was born Elihue Micah Whitcomb. he is a light-skinned West Indian. He hates all kinds of human touch, with the exception of the bodies of young girls. He promises that he will give her the bluest eyes (this is where the book receives its title) and she believes him no matter what other people say. Pecola goes mad, believing that her cherished wish has been completed and that she has the bluest eyes.The Bluest Eye is an excellent book if you like touching reads about beauty and views on life. It is depressing and shocking in parts. There is a very interesting narration that is distorted when Morrison runs its sentences and then its words together these start off each chapter. There are two children, Dick and Jane. They are always happy and playing and it seems as though they have a perfect life. They never confirm that these children are white but the way she describes them leads us to believe they are. Many things keep you hooked on the book, and I personally couldn't put it down. Toni Morrison uses other skills of great literature plus there are so many little conflicts that surface throughout the book that when you get to the end of one, another tension is being created. I recommend this book to anyone who would like a new perspective on life and our beliefs as Americans."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I had several friends who knew that I enjoyed reading anything by Toni Morrison who told me that this book would be an excellent read for me, and I can assure you that it was . . . This book took me back to my own hometown, my roots, my southern upbringing, and presented to me all of the horrors that I discerned as a child. The smell of the book, the feel of its heavy contents, sometimes, I did not know whether to laugh, cry, or punch a hole in the wall. There are certain books that evoke emotion in me and then there are are those that do not. I was moved by all of this and then some. Pecola, could have been any little African American girl that I could have ever known, it could have been me, my sister, my niece, the girl next door, my best friend, or anybody. I just know that everything that ever was in terms of life just seem to swallow me up as I consumed more and more . . .I never once had to force myself to read this novel. I only read because reading was all that I could do to place myself in the shame and embarrassment of this girl-child who wanted something that was so obscure but in her small mind made it necessary to have. There was the part about the Mary Jane candy -- and about how the teacher, the man at the candy store, and even her own mother Mrs. Breedlove and their reactions to her that told her she was insignificant,ugly, dumb, stupid, and nothing that she could ever say in life would ever matter or ever do. She was Pecola and she was just better off gone. She even erased herself, by herself. She knew the reactions that others had about her but why? What made her so bad? What made her so ugly and so ashamed? Thought patterns that were already shaped by others peconceptions or opinions of her . . . I suppose. But why?I could not help but empathize with the pain of the character.My feelings for this book far exceeds what I felt for &quot;Beloved.&quot; Little Pecola was living an emotional hell. Not only that but she was deceived by believing that if she only had blue eyes that her life in someway could be different or maybe even beautiful.The climax of this book for me was not the part about the incest. Though it angered me deeply that the character had to go through another painful episode in her life. But what really grabbed me was the scene in which she is beaten, cussed out, and slapped for accidently knocking over a blueberry cobbler. I knew then what ailed the child. She needed not only a mother's love, but a mother's understanding.This book could be reviewed, critiqued, and examined in so many different ways. I felt this book. It made me think . . . And question. I suppose I will be reviewing this book time and time again amongst various reading circles. Pecola was as real to me as my hands and my feet. I felt her heartbeat as I devoured page after page. This book left me spent--for I cried a thousand raindrop tears that fell silently upon the broke."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"In her novel, The Bluest Eye, Toni Morrison organizes the plot into strategic sections in order to convey the message of an ironic world through the eyes of a twelve year old girl. Morrison uses the idea of a \\"perfect world\\" as a child would imagine it and tells it in a single paragraph: the \\"see Jane and Dick\\" children's tale. As the novel's guide, the tale serves as both an ironic symbol and as a foreshadower in its organizing of the plot. The novel is divided into four parts: autumn, winter, spring, and summer. Immediately preceding the first part, which is autumn, are two pages whose stylistic prose make them so distinctive. Here, Morrison presents the readers with the childhood tale most remember reading: \\"Here is the house. It is green and white...It is very pretty...See Jane...She wants to play...See Mother...See Mother...Play, Jane, play.\\" (3). This fourteen-line paragraph is then repeated a total of four times throughout the book, each one a little different from the rest in its style. It is the fourth run of the tale that is most significant, though. Morrison divides her parts into sections, or chapters. All except the first chapter of each part begin with a short segment of the tale. The appearance of the segments is in the same, sequential order that was first presented in the beginning. What is included in the tale and the chapter it is appearing is how the tale serves as a foreshadower. The first chapter with this distinctive element begins with \\"HEREISTHEHOUSEITISGREENANDWHITEITHASAREDDOORITISVERYPRTTYPRETTYPRETTY\\" (33). As one keeps reading, he finds that the chapter is primarily about the home of the main character, twelve-year-old Pecola Breedlove. This chapter gives the reader a glimpse of the young girl's horrid physical surroundings. Irony comes into play with the realization that Pecola's home is not \\"green, white, and pretty,\\" but is merely a run-down storefront. The next chapter's tale segment includes the part about Jane, America's perfect poster child introduced in children's literature at a tender age. As the \\"Jane chapter\\" is actually about Pecola Breedlove herself, the reader then realizes for the first time that \\"Jane\\" is a symbol of Pecola. Both girls have their idea of perfection and yearn for a friend. Many chapters later in the spring part, a new chapter begins with \\"SEEFATHERHEISBIGANDSTRONGFATHERWILLYOUPLAYWITHJANEFAHTERISSMILINGSMILEFATHERSMILESMILE\\" (132). In accordance with Morrison's pattern, this chapter was about Pecola's father, Pecola Breedlove. As she does so in other various chapters, Morisson enables herself to present a glimpse of her significant characters' motives. Irony is again a major factor when the reader learns more about the person inside Cholly. He is a cold-hearted, disrespectful, and abusive man who rapes Pecola. Needless to say, these traits are very much in contrast to those traits that a father like Jane's would possess. By using the children's tale of Jane and Dick as a guide throughout the novel, Morisson is able to effectively organize her plot line with grim foreshadowing and elaborate irony, thus enabling her to reflect the tragedy of a young girl with an idea of life perfection."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Morrison is an excellent writer, by far one of the best. However, I was disappointed by this book for different reasons perhaps than others have found this book to their dislike. I was nauseated by the portrayal of black men in this novel! Black men in the Bluest Eye are irresponsible, sex-crazed, child molesting, drunks and this is just in the first couple of chapters. Though a case could be argued that black men are not portrayed in a REALISTIC light in any medium,I must say that I kind of expected more from this exceptional writer!"},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"After reading other reviews about this text, I had to add a few comments. What this book is not: It's not an 'easy' read. It's not a 'simple' message. What it is: It is enlightening. It IS thought-provoking. And, it is moving.In Ms. Morrison's afterward (1993), she suggests that the book may not move everyone--but touch many. I agree. It will not move everyone. But for anyone who has experienced any part of what Pecola experiences (especially as a child), you will be moved. And, if you are fortunate enough to have some turnaround in life, you will be moved to help others (again, especially children), so that they have abundant self-worth and self-appreciation.Ms. Morrison, I was moved!"},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Nothing can evoke our sympathies like an abused and alone child. The Bluest Eye investigates the effects of racism and poverty on the most vulnerable and the most impressionable. Morrison here is at her psychological best, keeping her focus on the life of Pecola, while conveying the brokenness of the child's world view. As a result, The Bluest Eye is among the most accessible of Morrsion's long fiction and an excellent introduction to this national treasure."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I first read this book about three years ago when my brother, the high school English teacher, gave it to me for Christmas. I plan to read it again.As with Ms. Morrison's other works, the language in the Bluest Eye is sumptuous. Filled with descriptions and conversations that put you right into that time and place. Sometimes those places are warm and charming, but other times they are cold and humiliating.The Bluest Eye is a book that you experience not just read."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I first read this book a few years ago and was surprised by thepower and beauty in Morrison's words. After reading the book again, Iam again struck by how much she can say in this little book. Pecola is a pathetic figure that makes one truly question their place in the world. The idea that to be beautiful one must look a certain way is an idea Pecola struggles with every day in her search for &quot;the bluest eyes&quot; as many of us in today's world also struggle to be happy with our identities. I enjoyed reading this book and highly recommend reading it."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The Bluest Eye is a page turner, but as a first-time Morrison reader, I am hoping her other novels are better constructed. While the story is gripping and powerful, Morrison tends to lapse into explanations rather than letting us come up with our own analysis. This leads to a novel that seems more concerned with drilling the reader with the moral of the story than letting us experience the actual story. The summaries say that this book is about Pecola Breedlove and her wish for blue eyes, but really it is about the people around her and how they deal with the main issues of the book--racism, beauty, love, power, and acceptance. You won't find many hidden messages in this book. However, I looked forward to reading more whenever I had a chance, and that to me constitutes a good book!"},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I read this novel and it was excellent. It had a wonderful plot. Although the story was very detailed, it captured what was going on so anyone could understand. Some parts were very tear jerking. At moments it made me realize what a good life I have had. Hearing all the abuse that went on makes me thankful. I could not imagine being abandoned and then abused. For the two small children in the book that were abused by Cholly and watched him abuse their mother I am sure that they could never get those memories out of their heads. Pecola, that poor young girl, she seemed so helpless. I felt like jumping in the book and taking her away from the awful place. Overall this was an excellent piece. I could read it over and over again. I can see how this book got the Nobel Piece Prize, it was great. I enjoyed reading &quot;The Bluest Eye&quot; by Toni Morrison."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I was 14 years old when I first read this book. &quot;Oh my God, what is wrong with this girl (Pecola)&quot; was the first thing I though when I read about her character. &quot;Why would she want blue eyes, she is definitely crazy&quot;. The reason I thought this way was because I was from an island where black is beautiful. Everytime I looked in the mirror, I thought I was beautiful. Later in college, in read this book again and cried for the lost innocence of Pecola and I cried for the self-hate and internalized racism of my people. I realized that no matter how many time or how many ways we said that black was beautiful, too many of our children felt differently. As an English teacher, I have assigned this book for reading and talk, discuss, debate, and flat out argue with my students (all black) about the ways we annihilate ourselves as a people. Who is light skinned, who is dark skinned, good hair, pretty eyes--all designed to tear us apart like it tore Pecola apart. I still cry for Pecola's lost innocence and lost self worth but I use it to teach my students about their own self worth."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"In 1984 I happened upon The Bluest Eye in my high school library. It literally changed the way I saw the world, beauty and my 16 year old self. How pleased I was to learn that Oprah had picked this forceful book! It is not an easy read, it is not a happy, sunshine, everything-is-going-to-be-okay read, but it is realistic read about race relations and the power of sex and the power of hatred. I've read the negative reviews and wonder why people are so defensive about the racism - look at the setting's time and when the book was written. And since this was Toni Morrison's FIRST novel it was impossible for her to &quot;Sell Out&quot; in its creation."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"On the positive side: &quot;The Bluest Eye&quot; has some breezy, sharp dialogue; some of the descriptions are well done; and, structurally, it is mildly interesting, although largely whimsical (e.g., the changes in paragraph justification). On the negative side: the symbolism is awful; there are many bland and/or trite descriptions (e.g., &quot;leaden skies&quot;); it is bloated with overworked, competing, confusing, and clumsy modifiers (i.e., adjectives and adverbs); the characterization is thin, and it is executed in a series of disjoint and amateurish character sketches; the narrative tells too much, while showing and evoking too little; and, the ending is just plain silly.In &quot;The Bluest Eye&quot;, Morrison's characters are superficial and pigeonholed. It seems obvious that Morrison approached the story with ideas, rather than images (just read the afterword), and then forced her characters to act out these simplistic ideas. Here Morrison is too preoccupied with social, psychological, and moral messages; and, her characters and situations are contrived to provide didactic illustrations of overdrawn generalizations. Because of this, the reader's attention is pulled away from the characters as unique and complex creations, and focused on the messages, or &quot;lessons&quot;, the characters are intended to help convey. Just read other people's reviews and this is obvious; many reviewers identify with Pecola only as a young black woman in the abstract, and urge others to read this book because of the &quot;issues&quot; it raises. This is evidence of both inartistic writing and unimaginative reading.Morrison's symbolism is abstract and artificial. Particularly bad is her use of blue eyes to symbolize \`a cultural conception of beauty' or \`stereotypical beauty'. An artistic, or poetic, use of symbolism should be image-oriented, evocative, and the symbol should embody the essence of what is being symbolized. Blue eyes are a poor symbol for \`cultural ideals of beauty' because blue eyes do not provide a compelling and instinctual image of such a thing; and, because blue eyes purport to symbolize an abstract and intellectual concept, as opposed to a concrete image or quality. That is why this overreaching symbolism must be spelled out explicitly in the book. When you picture blue eyes do they immediately and instinctively evoke a sense of \`cultural ideals of beauty'? Of course not. These connections must be manufactured. As bad as the symbolism of blue eyes is, Pecola's desire for them reduces this symbolism to a ridiculous allegory.Another complaint I have is that Morrison never withholds an image. Everything is graphically described and, therefore, the images become confused, overwrought, and numbing. Sometimes the best way to get across the sense of an image is to hold it back and work around it with more powerful, definite, and effective images. The incestuous child rape is a good example of where it would have been better to cleverly work with the reader's imagination but shield the actual act from view, letting the reader experience the situation rather than react to it. In being so explicit, Morrison conveys the facts, but not a heightened and controlled sense of the events. The images lose their power to evoke because they are so uniformly morbid, overdone, unfamiliar, and evidentiary. It is sometimes said that such unswervingly bleak portrayals are &quot;true to life&quot; and &quot;real&quot;---which invariably leads to their discussion in real-world terms. But these situations are not real---they are unbalanced, unimaginative, concocted, and phony.To end on a positive note, here is my favorite passage from the book: &quot;When you ask them where they are from, they tilt their heads and say \`Mobile' and you think you've been kissed. They say \`Aiken' and you see a white butterfly glance off a fence with a torn wing. They say \`Nagadoches' and you want to say \`Yes, I will'.&quot; This is pretty good stuff."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book was wonderful. Not for the pleasure of reading another novel, but for teaching a powerful message (regretably for most white people).

There is so much pain, etc. in this read. It is somewhat uncomfortable to read because we are guilty of some of the same things, or have had the same thing happen to us.

If any story has the power to change a person's perspective on life, it is this one. I'm really surprised at some of the reviews, I guess they just didn't get it the way some of us did. Its definitely a book some people would be uncomfortable with but a story I think everyone should read.Pecola Breedlove is a little black girl who longs for blue eyes with the belief that people would love her and care for her if she had them. She has a lack of self-confidence, believing she is ugly and her life is one of sadness and pain. Throughout the book, you get glimpses into her life as it changes characters. These are people who did something mean to her, who touched her life in a negative way. These were people who were angry and took out their anger on this one child. She was the victim of everyone who touched her life.There is no happy ending to this story. Its sad, unbelievably so and it makes you think about the ways even slightly that you affect people's lives. Pecola never knew what it was like to be cared for or treated decently. She was lonely and alone. Anyone who was ever a victim will remember how they felt through the story of Pecola.

The love Pecola never had, Morrison allows her readers to give and for that I am truly grateful for her work. 5 stars all around!"},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"As solemn as it is touching, The Bluest Eye distinguishes itself from other literary works for its extraordinary prose, structure, and exploration of an exceptionally weighty subject matter through an introspective look into the lives of African Americans in a time of exceptional turmoil and crossfire in mainstream culture. The novel delves into the ethics of humanity and the corrupt faades manifested by unrealistic desires and distorted ambition, ultimately revealing the destructive and unpredictable nature of human beings. Take Pecola, a child born into an abusive family, who desperately, horrifically, wants to have the blue eyes which would make her beautiful and acceptable to herself. The work targets her fears, dreams, and desires through others. As Pecola is a weak-minded and inexpressive main character, information about her is received intravenously through those around her: a drunk of a father, a mother blinded by abstract notions of good and false ideals of beauty, and three whores who feed her stories and lies. The main notion of the novel, Toni Morrison had argued upon its publication, is to create such a medium through which individuals, characters, could stand for themselves. Morrison ardently enforces this abject realism through selective characterization and through her exploration of the ambiguous in the sense of moral reprehensibility. The novel lacks the squeaky clean figures of prior fiction dealing with similar subject matter. Some individuals in The Bluest Eye are shamelessly without dignity while others, rather than being cleansed by conventional and stereotypical principles of ideal moral behavior, are corrupted and tainted by them.Stark contrasts between values, and attitudes, and ethics distinguish each character introduced in the novel. Yet interestingly, there is an omniscient intermingling of what is considered ethical versus what is considered immoral. We are constantly reminded of the randomness of existence, the inescapability of both acts of good and evil in life, and the corruptibility of the most pious of people. Love, like so many emotions, is explored in the many heart wrenching scenes which comprise of this book. Indeed, as Morrison wrote in The Bluest Eye, \\"Love is never any better than the lover. Wicked people love wickedly, violent people love violently, weak people love weakly, stupid people love stupidly\\" (p. 206). However strange, different, poor, or stupid we are, we are all capable of love, of causing pleasure and pain. Yes, Pecola does receive the gift she so desperately yearns for, yet the cost of this treasured boon is her and her family's destitution. We are finally given her perspective as she careens into penury and insolvency. She can only find peace by withdrawing deep into herself. In this state, she loses her sanity, everything with which she can possibly utilize to comprehend and interact with a reality she so desperately wanted to reject. The Bluest Eye shows us the destructiveness of human passion and desire. That which makes us ambitious, reverent, and triumphant can also corrupt and devastate us. An excellent read whose implications linger long after the last page; The Bluest Eye is indeed an incredibly indisputable work of excellent literary fiction."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"After taking a class on American literature and being assigned Toni Morrison's \\"Beloved\\" and really feeling the emotion from that novel, I decided to read another one of her books, \\"The Bluest Eye\\". I understood the reasoning behind the scattered chapters where Morrison introduced and explained the histories and background for the characters but I struggled when I got tangled in the imagery. Morrison describes settings, actions and images in length before getting anywhere. I think the themes of the American definition of \\"beauty\\" as well as the oppression that Cholly and Pecola both feel in the novel is beautifully described and heartbreaking at the same time and though hard to read, was necessary. Though not justifying the rape of Pecola, Morrison explains why it happened and how much Cholly truly loved his daughter. The theme of paralysis shown in Claudia, Pecola, and Cholly shines through and the reader can really feel how trapped each one feels in their skin. Not being able to change a situation that has gone so terribly wrong and not being able to find a \\"way out\\". This novel really opened my eyes to what poverty and oppression does to people. This book was really hard to put down but left a pit in the bottom of my stomach after completing it. This is definitely a book that needs to be read and is still prevalent in today's society, forty years later, and is promised to make an impact."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"With The Bluest Eye, Toni Morrison brings us into the world of Pecola Breedlove, a young girl whose self-concept/ego is stunted from developing, whose psyche is essentially murdered, by a combination of an internalization of negative societal images (of blacks, and of women) and a lack of a network of support. Morrison weaves narratives of people whose life spheres intersect with Pecola's, because, as she explains in the preface, Pecola's ego is too damaged to cohere its own story. In the end, the violent violation of Pecola by her very flesh (her father) is too much for her fragile, barely-formed ego to handle, and it disintegrates, leaving Pecola in a permanent state of oblivion and senility.The Bluest Eye explodes the \\"Dick and Jane\\" ideal, in which the values of the \\"West\\" are used as a measuring stick against which all other cultures are judged. In their very essence, Western ideals are hierarchical: they rely and ground themselves in a demarcation of spheres of inferiority and superiority. In this way, Western ideals are built through processes of exclusion (and inclusion).Morrison explores how such a culture, in which only one ideal is accepted as superior, in which a hierarchy dictates how individuals think about the worth of things, can damage the soul/ego/person of individuals who are on the lowest rungs of the hierarchy, for their gender, race, and class, and how some individuals defy this ego-death. Through the intertwining stories of two sisters who are socially and economically in the same position as Pecola, but who have additional means of coping with the oppressive environment (such as intimate relationships with each other and with their parents, for example), Morrison shows how it is possible to make meaning and develop agency in spite of oppression. Primarily, Morrison implies, such resistance is made possible through the strength and resilience of social, personal, and familial networks.The picture Morrison paints is not ultimately one of bleakness and social death. In fact, most characters in The Bluest Eye find ways of making meaning in their lives in spite of societal conditions. Pauline, for example, affirms herself by claiming her pain in childbirth as valid, her body just as sensitive as white women's: \\"I hurt just like them white women.... What'd they think? That just \`cause I knowed how to have a baby with no fuss that my behind wasn't pulling and aching like theirs?\\" (125). Claudia's mother, on the other hand, learned to cope in ways similar to whites, yellows, browns, and all others: \\"she developed a hatred for things that mystified or obstructed her; acquired virtues that were easy to maintain; assigned herself a role in the scheme of things; and harked back to simpler times for gratification\\" (126). Claudia and her sister coped within the bounds of their intimate relationship with each other, and more or less understanding that despite their mother's fits of wrath and their father's absence, essentially they were loved, provided for, and protected. They had a home, they were not \`outdoors', like Pecola.At the core of the novel is a reliance on relationships to tell the story of Pecola, as Morrison explores the web of influences within which Pecola suffers her tragic ego-death. Each relationship manifests itself as some sort or expression of love. Pecola's rape is instantiated by an urge in her father to recreate with her what he had had with Pauline long before their marriage had disintegrated into endless fighting. Cholly glances tenderly at Pecola's foot wrapped around her calf and is reminded of a time when he felt loved, and loved deeply. Soaphead's perversion also begins in love: he describes with affection his affinity for little girls. They are, essentially, the only ones around whom he feels perfectly safe, because he does not feel violated by them--their bodies don't offend him. He is not \\"a pervert\\" in that at heart, he craves the bodies of little girls. However, his instinct for love and its transformation into action has been perverted. Taking solace in the only type of body that could not possibly hurt him, he hurts back, he becomes the oppressor. Thus the colonized/oppressed becomes the colonizer/oppressor. Soaphead mimics the oppressive conditions by which he feels violated in replicating the power asserted over him into power asserted by him onto little girls.Although oppressing conditions have the power to pervert manifestations of love, The Bluest Eye is not only a story of perversion, it is also a story of transformation. \\"Love is never better than the lover. Wicked people love wickedly, violent people love violently, weak people love weakly, stupid people love stupidly, but the love of a free man is never safe\\" (206). And, it should be added, good people love deeply and unselfishly. Claudia's father, for example, protects her from manly conquest, her mother nurtures her, while her sister loves her openly, honestly, and deeply. And so Claudia understands what anyone might arguably recognize as a constructive image of love: on Christmas day, for example, Claudia imagines her ideal present--sitting in mamma's kitchen, her daddy playing the violin, her senses fully engaged, enveloped in love. Pecola, who feels no such stability from her mother because Pauline's home is essentially her white employers', also receives no support from her brother, who is often missing, and is not only not protected by her father in the face of manly aggression, but is violated by him. As such, it is perhaps not surprising that she does not seem to understand love, how to \`get it': Pecola constantly asks others, \\"How do you do that? How do you get somebody to love you?\\" (32)."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Author Toni Morrison novel The Bluest Eye received much praised from avid readers, book clubs and critics alike. Having soul, powerful and compelling characters and the undeniable truth landed Toni Morrison's novel in readers' favorites and Oprah's book club as well. Toni Morrison proved that she is capable of penning back to back bestselling novels that does more than reach the surface level in the literary industry. With issues such as racism, self-hatred and sexism Ms. Morrison creates The Bluest Eye and others alike.The novel is an engaging, interesting story involving a girl who desperately desires blue eyes in order to make herself acceptable to the white population of Lorain, Ohio. The Bluest Eye is a touching story and warrants high commendation for the insightful telling of a young girl's outlook on life in her limited society. The theme of this book touches on so many social issues; from whiteness as the standard of beauty; seeing versus being seen; the power of stories; introducing sexual behavior and abuse from parents.Racism and self hate being the two main issues in the book are centered on a trouble African American family. As it is now \\"whiteness\\" was considered the standard beauty during the time of The Bluest Eye. Pecola is fixated with having blue eyes because she believes that this would alter her life for the better. White beauty will change the way that she is seen and therefore the way that she sees the world. Pecola needs feel affection from somebody, but her family and the members of her community are not capable of loving her because they have been damaged and hurt in their own lives.The only con to this novel is that it is a bit choppy."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Toni Morrison is a tremendous writer who really makes me think, and this book was no exception. The details of the story are absolutely tragic- a young girl is raped by her father and bears his baby, who dies. Meanwhile, she's so full of socially-created self-hatred that she wishes for blue eyes, which she comes to believe she's been given. The writing in this book is astonishing. Morrison has managed to produce something more than unmitigated sadness, even though so many details of the story are tremendously sad. This is a powerful book."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"How can you truly convey the horror of a situation without horrifying words. Reality is profanity and Morrison gets that- she never chooses a profane word in place of something else but, rather, uses that word because it is the only one that can be used. Wonderful book about finding your own beauty."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I have read many excellent books in my time, including modern novels and disturbing novels. But never have I read such a disturbing piece of splendidly crafted modern literature. William Faulkner is splendidly crafted, but not particularly disturbing. Charles Dickens is disturbing, but he is not modern. Toni Morrison, though, is the only novelist I have ever had the pleasure to read who has managed to combine both characteristics to create something fresh, if not pleasantly so.One of the aspects of the story I enjoyed most was the way in which the perspective jumps from person to person, and the narrative from first to third person and back again. The story begins with first person narratives from Claudia, who does not really have a part in the story, but it creates a feel for the atmosphere surrounding the story. It then goes on to describe in third person the adult Breedloves and their lives, past and present. I won't spoil the end; you have to read it yourself to feel the intense emotions that can only be experienced by reading it. But the jumps in perspective, and the slight confusion they create help to encourage the confusion that should rightly surround this novel: does this really exist? How can we have allowed it to continue?A word of caution: this book is not for the faint of heart, or stomach. Many people do not realize that books should be screened and rated the same way movies are, if one's scruples demand one not read/view certain scenes. There are reviewers who were shocked and sickened by this book, and thought it repulsive. I found the details only added to the emotion overdrive I was obliged to suffer in order to finish this book. But I will never forget it, and that is truly the mark of an excellent novel. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The Bluest Eye, Toni Morrison's first novel, is filled with so much emotion. Before reading this novel for my honors literature class, I had never really connected to the literature. While reading The Bluest Eye, I thoroughly bonded with the literature and went on the emotional roller coaster Morrison displays in her poetic style of writing. Often I would find myself questioning how and why could such terrible things happen to a little girl so misfortunate like Pecola Breedlove.This novel really broadens my view of literature and the messages the author try to get across. After this enjoyable read I feel like I no longer have to struggle to find symbolic meanings, but instead feel the mood the author is trying to put in their audience's mind. This novel really touches every emotion there is and it was an enjoyable read for me. It gives you the feeling that you are really connecting with the characters and their feelings in novels. I would definitely recommend Toni Morrison's first novel, The Bluest Eye."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Written in the 1960's, and published in 1970, this book delivers a perspective of the victim to a horrible rape. Way ahead of its time. If the topic, even 37 years later, is too chillingly graphic a topic, stay away.As Morrison's first novel, it features some stylistic edges which are not as evident in her later works. First, the prose seems more majestic and incredibly tight. She reminds me more of Zora Neale Hurston in this book than in any other - but in each there is a Hurston-like style to her prose. Secondly, the story line is not as harsh about the white man - there is a rape of a man by white men and some bitter words - but the depths of the white man's evil upon the black man is not as resoundingly elicited here. Lastly, she delivers the narrative through the eyes of children - none even teenagers - which she never does in subsequent novels.The eye color is merely symbolic of racial self-loathing. The sexually molested protagonist, Pecola, is the party asking for eye colors not established by others of her race. She amazingly sees her request for the eye color to come true, a sign of her mind's betrayal to her psyche while living through the impregnation of her young body - a product of a rape committed by her now incarcerated father. Her happiness resounds when delivered the new eye color, a symbol or signal of her mental break down.Sexual deviation rings as a common thread. A self-proclaimed minister, Soaphead Church, enters the book in the last quarter to describe his thoughts to us in diary form. He is a sick person whose thoughts reflect what we see too often in our morning papers in regard to the Catholic Church's agents - but at least Soaphead loves little girls and does not touch them.Twisting us through the town of Lorain, Ohio, Morrison reveals the skeletons of many closets. Most are apparently good people. All are full of love. We concentrate mostly on poor Pecola and her demon father Cholly - each who are loving, but not necessarily receiving or giving in a good manner. As Morrison states, \\"Love is never any better than the lover. Wicked people love wickedly, violent people love violently, weak people love weakly, stupid people love stupidly, but the love of a free man is never safe.\\" This sentence could be included in all of Morrison's other novels.No comedy in these pages, just great prose and tremendous story telling. Among all of the American novelists of the last 50 years, I believe none can tell a story more articulately, nor more prophetically. As bitter as this tale may be, it was a delight to read."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrision paves the way for a new era of American literature, one that does not replace the old so much as it enhanced our understanding of it.

Toni Morrison's portrayal of Pecola is upseting but realistic in the way that society treats &quot;outcasts&quot;. Pecola wants to become the perfect blue eyed, blonde haired girl. She thinks with blue eyes she will be well liked and popular. It is sad because when Pecola actually thinks she has blue eyes- she is as far from being the &quot;perfect&quot; girl as possible.

I started out reading this book as an assignment for my English class, but was quickly caught up in this book's beauty. Pecola's life is as real as real can get. As the daughter of a social worker, I am acquainted with the black child's daily struggle to be accepted. I sympathize with her, in the sense that she was &quot;ignorant&quot; enough to be something that she can't. But Pecola is not the one to blame. Society has implanted in young black children's minds that they must be like the majority to be accepted. This shows the immaturity of our young nation. We say that we have abolished slavery, but what about the young black children that are enslaved mentally? The have been forced into believing that they have to change to be accepted. I applaud Morrisson for showing our misinformed society for what it is.

This intriguing discussion of white imagery occassionally investigates the false lives of black wifes, who create an image for themself to obscure the painful reality which makes up their life. This story will strike a note of familiarity not only with black readers, but anyone who has ever been told that they are not beautiful."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I read this book for a class in college. Ms. Morrison is amazing in that she had so many layers in this book, so many things that are hinted at and almost unseen. Also, the racism portrayed in this book also hit a strong point in me-- as an Asian American, I know what it is to have that much self-hatred at such a young age. It is bitter, without hope, and depressing, but it wakes people up and hopefully makes them think &quot;why&quot;. I read this book two years ago and it has not left me since. The language is beautiful, and although the layout of the chapters was harder to understand, the history (and hence depth) of the characters make the whole book understandable."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Since I am not from the south, it was hard for me to read this book, at first. But then I started to understand the talk easier as I kept reading. I am sure that everyone has thought about what it would be like to be a different race because I know that I have. This book would be very interesting to anyone that wants to know what it would be like to be a poor, ugly, African - American girl. Toni Morrison puts a lot of depth in describing every little thing that is going on around this girl's life. Some parts I thought were too in depth, but that is what makes the book more alive.The eleven-year-old black girl, Pecola Breedlove, that lives in America, prays for her eyes to turn blue: so that she will be beautiful, so that people will look at her, so that her world will be different. This is the story of a poor helpless girl that gets humlitated and sexually abused by her father. What she thought were her friends, Freida and Claudia, were just there to feel sorry for her and to be happy that they weren't in her ugly shoes.Read this book and find out what Pecola Breedlove's life experience was like!"},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I found a trend in the reviews- people appreciated the story, but did not think the violation of Pecola was necessary. It may be difficult to take, but I think it conveys an important message. That scene, as well as the author showing us the trials and &quot;evils&quot; of other characters, shows the reader how the pain and prejudice felt by the African-American characters transforms them and makes them more likely to devalue their own people in order to feel some power themselves. Power that is taken away by the opressors. Cholly, her father, passed on his humiliation and powerlessness(his first sexual experience interrupted by the white people in the field) to his daughter. Morrison's portrayal of others also supports the point I am trying to make. Even Freida and Claudia find satisfaction knowing they have it better then Pecola and that gives them a sense of superiority. Superiority not felt when they compare their situations to that of the white neighborhood, or interactions with others who disregard them due to color. I think this book was wonderful and the &quot;uncomfortable&quot; portions are necessary to its impression on the reader."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"TBE was a well written book. Toni Morrison did a wonderful job conveying the sad happenings that unrealistic standards set by society can have on young African-American women.

Imagine that your only wish in life was to have blue eyes and for people to notice you. This is what you find in the book's main character, Pecola Breedlove. The book focuses on Pecola's unfortunate young life. She wishes for a life completely opposite than the one she is born into. I felt that Morrison's use of plot in this book helped to keep the book from being a pity-party for Pecola. Her actual rape and pregnancy by her father isn't mentioned until after it happens chronologically in the book. You do feel sorry for the poor young foster child that everyone thinks is terribly ugly, but for those reasons. She was a foster child and she was ugly. You don't learn the reason her parents are gone until the mention of the rape. Her use of plot keeps the reader interested to see what type of family life she did have and what made her become a foster child in the first place. When I first looked at The Bluest Eye, it looked like very easy reading, but I was wrong. There are many well-hidden messages throughout the pages of this book. Some of which may include that beauty is in the eye of the beholder or that if you think you are beautiful, you are. Once Pecola thinks that she does actually have blue eyes, her happiness is seen through her conversation with her imaginary friend. She feels that people stare at her now because they are jealous, not because they are gawking at her ugliness. This book contains very adult-orientated situations and probably wouldn't be suitable for younger readers. However, I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in a book that will toy with your emotions and make you realize how lucky you are to have lived the childhood that you did."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I am a journalistic-writer. I do think part of it is owed to reading this book, and I say 'part' because when I started reading it, it was one of six novels by the same person, I was reading at the time. This happened within two months of late 1999. First I read Jazz and last was Beloved. I still remember, and very clearly, how the writer was deliberate on most descriptions, descriptions of people, their shapes, their colour, their hate and love etc... I FELT the writer's darring attitude. I saw how she preferred to be at her best honest about things and concepts which as humann beings in our cultures, sometimes we chose to look away from. Things that make us feel ashamed. Ashamed that others might see us seeing them. Ashamed that we are thinking about them. Invariably ashamed of who we are. I think this in the end makes us remain victims of whatever shames us in the first place and then victims of the shame that comes as a result. But the 'Bluest Eye' takes a step towards freeing one from that shame, as one is forced to experience and think and challenge the issues that makes one ashamed , not only as an individual but also within a culture. The book is incredibly short for the topics it covers so well. My most memorable of those descriptions of issues, issues that make some of us think the way we do, was the narrative on the history and the 'state of mind' of the 'doctor' that 'gave' the girl her bluest eyes. And the irony that surrounded it. Well I understood many things I read and also think that I failed to understand some. What I felt in the end was pain, frustration but instead of the helplessness described in the book I felt the opposite, I felt more free, realizing that most of the pain I was feeling in general I could make a choice not to experience, I could easily choose to feel good and beautiful, which I am, without blue eyes or a high education, and I could overlook the stereotypes and operate by my own rules. In early 2000 I left a better paying Job, monetarilly, and I started freelance-writing, which has paid me in ways that others cannot count (in money terms) or understand. But that too does not matter, because I know I am the one who deliberately makes and controls the judgments now. I feel free.

This is evident by the fact that there are almost no white characters (the only white people mentioned are those Mrs. Breedlove works for and those who force Cholly's \\"act\\" in the fields and possible ancestors of Soaphead Church).Read Deeper. The love or hate an individual puts into a society effects the love or hate that individual will put into a society once given the opportunity to exercise such agency. This is the novel's universal message. Not necessarily racism or sex.Read deeper. This novel does place blame on the white controlled media for the self-loathing from which many African-American suffer. But blame is not exclusively that of white america. Cholly suffers from self hate not only because of his experience with white americans but also because of how his father treats him. Therefore, since he experiences hate, he puts hate on his daughter. The lightskinned black children impose hate on dark skinned children.Read deeper. Even the disgusting Soaphead Church must cause one to wonder why he is the monster he is. Look at how his family treated him. Look at the symbolism of the seeds.For readers who describe this novel as \\"hopeless\\", look at the use of \\"we\\", particularly in the section featuring Cholly's aunt.

Also, I think that Toni Morrison is trying to tell her audience that instead of judging someone you should help them no matter what the circumstances may be, because you could end up changing their life.

This book is set in 1941, and cute little Shirley Temple is what America is in love with. Pecola believes that the only way anyone can be beautiful is if he or she had blonde hair and blue eyes. Pecola wishes that her eyes would turn so blue that anytime someone walked past her, they would look at how beautiful she is. Toni Morrison takes the depressing thought that beauty is blonde hair and blue eyes, and gives it a cruel and tragic twist. She introduces you to where Pecola is now, and goes back through her life, the life of her mother, and the life of her father. She reveals the dark side to the readers in just little enough amounts that you can't guess what is going to happen next, making you read the next chapter just to find out what else the book might reveal. This made the book so exciting to read with twists and turns around every page. The way Morrison describes everything, it's like watching a movie, without the sticky floors and talking people. Over all, this was an exciting book to read. The plot is so unique that it immediately catches your eye, and keeps your attention throughout the whole book."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison is a great book to read for the philosophers of any age.

Toni Morrison is an award-winning author who writes with details, examples, and most of all, heart. She writes about subjects that she is familiar with- such as the treatment and discrimination of black people in the earlier days.In this book, Morrison describes the life of a girl named Pecola and her family who have been ill-fated from the start. She shows the contrast between the way Pecola is treated in her family and in society in general. For this reason and others, she desperately dedicates her life, prayers, and dreams to transform herself into someone that looks like Shirley Temple. Due to her unfortunate physical appearance, she is mistreated gruesomely by her family and others. She is raped and impregnated by her own father and when she reaches puberty, she is whipped and punished for misunderstanding.I recommend this book to people who like heart-felt stories and are not afraid to be taken in by the atrocity of truth. The book is a quick-read that is full of events which will not bore you. I enjoyed reading it a lot as well as learning some facts about history that I would have otherwise been negligent to. So pick up this book and open up your eyes, because there is lots to think about!!!"},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"African American Women and How They See Themselves(A critical review of Toni Morrison's The Bluest Eye)One of Toni Morrison's greatest works is The Bluest Eye. Toni Morrison is a Nobel Prize winning author and has written novels on African Americans and their position in America for several years. The Bluest Eye in particular, depicts how African American women see themselves and how they see white women.Toni Morrison tells the story through a character named Claudia MacTeer. Claudia is very young while she tells the story of herself, her sister Frieda, Pauline and Cholly Breedlove, and most of all, Pecola Breedlove. As she grows older, her realization of Pecola's terrible fate grows and her empathy for her fills the reader with the same empathy.Claudia is perfect for the narrator because she is both young and open-minded. Although she is unsure of whether her view is correct, her view seems more correct because her mind is not filled with the corruption of the other characters. Claudia, unlike the other black women in the story, is very comfortable with who she is. She likes how she looks, and instead of adoring Shirley Temple cups and cute, little, white baby dolls like Frieda and Pecola; she despises them, and rips the dolls heads off.Throughout the novel, Toni Morrison shows several messages that whiteness is superior. Besides the obsession with Shirley Temple and white baby dolls, light-skinned Maureen is more loved and accepted then the other little black girls. The idealization of white beauties in movies and Pauline Breedlove's preference for the little white girl she works for over her daughter are still more ways in which she shows America's obsession with white.Even grown women depict the views towards white beauty. Pauline Breedlove, although saying she will love Pecola forever, views her as ugly and, as said before, learns to love the little white girl she cares for more than her own daughter. Geraldine, a woman who has grown up hating blacks and regards herself as a \\"clean black\\" as opposed to those \\"dirty niggers,\\" despises Pecola and looks at other black children with disgust.Above all, Pecola suffers the most from this hatred of blacks. She becomes confused with the way people treat her and begins to believe that beauty brings love. The one thing she wishes for, above all else, is blue eyes, with blue eyes, the bluest eyes in the world, she believes she will be beautiful, and in turn find love and happiness.Toni Morrison does a terrific job showing how black women view themselves compared to those \\"white beauties,\\" making her audience shudder from disgust, and weep from the terrible realization of what life once was like, and still is in some parts.I loved the way Toni Morrison presented The Bluest Eye and will never forget how much her writing influenced me. She's done a great job affecting people with her writing in the past, and it is still affective today."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book is an excellent read. Morrison captures the life of young Pecola Breedlove as if it were her own. The descriptions are vivid and one could imagine oneselves in Pecola's place, dreaming for blue eyes.

The lives of the characters appear to jump out at you and you find yourslf engulfed inside the story."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I was so sure I'd love this book. I'd heard so much about it on [T.V.]. However, although the story line held my interest (it was in no way spellbinding), and the prose was sufficient, I was very disappointed that Toni Morrison went to such lengths to include bad language and disgusting imagery. I was sickened, not by the subject matter, but by the gutter-dredging manner in which she presents it. Toni went out of her way to get it in there, necessary or not (and it was not).The story could have been told without all the sensationalism of filth. I finished the book (this book with no end) and dropped it in the return slot of my local library. Maybe someone will enjoy it. Personally, I will never waste my money on Toni Morrison again."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Let me begin by saying that I am an educated caucasian woman with a masters degree. I live in a town that has many African Americans, many of whom are close friends of mine. I was forced to read this book in an undergraduate literature class, and since then I have never been able to get this disturbing book out of my head. Bravo to Toni Morrison for being such an excellent writer, for a bad writer couldn't have stirred up such horror in me. I do not criticize her writing talent as much as I do her subject matter. It was horribly graphic and left me with a very disturbing feeling every time I read it. In fact, we were instructed to write a paper on this book and I refused. I spoke with the professor and was given permission to write about another book. Again, Toni Morrison is a brilliant writer. However this book left me with nothing but hurt."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"But depressing. Isn't reality hard enough?"},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Toni Morrison is an amazing and inspiring writer who uses imagery and metaphor to lead the reader through the depressing life of young Pecola, the novels main character. The reality of prejudice and hatred toward blacks in the early 1900s is depicted throughout the novel through Pecola's hardships. The story is told years later by one of the characters involved in Pecola's life. This gives the story a childlike innocence, yet is still told from an adult. The Bluest eye is extremely heartbreaking and gloomy, however is inspiring and leaves the reader anxious, yet petrified to hear what poor Pecola will have to endure next. Morrison's language is so well perfected that it is difficult to believe that this was her first novel. Personally, I usually prefer more upbeat novels; however, this novel was amazing! Some scenes were hard to read because of the deep description that Morrison included, yet it was an exceptionally significant story for hearing how it was to live as an ugly black family in the South. I would recommend this novel to anyone!"},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"It was my first time reading something by Toni Morrison, and was sad to say that this book was very depressing, it jumped around alot, and she was overly descriptive. I wasn't sure if I was reading about snow capped mountains or the wicks of candles, when she used to convey different things about the way a person appeared, it was very distracting. The moral of the story was true to life and sad. I would not recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"In the novel The Bluest Eye, by Toni Morrison, the text evadesmany themes that develop throughout the book. The novel does a goodjob of developing the themes, such as hope, racism and coming of age. Pecola Breedlove, an 11yr. old girl, grew up in a neighborhood where racism was much more vigilant that current day racism. Pecola encountered many grotesque experiences throughout her life. An abusive father that raped and empregnated her was just one of the many examples of the coming of age theme. Pecola would pray and hope for blue eyes everyday of her life.The text dragged at various times in the book but still kept my attention by the use of depression description of the book. Personally, I thought that the novel compared to the novel Avalon. Both books similarly give specifics on the theme of hope. Pecola hopes to gain the acceptance of her society and the book Avalon describes the hardships of struggling family trying to find the perfect place to stay in their new home, America."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I had high expectations of reading this book I had heard rave reviews about and was looking forward to a wonderful experience that I had heard accompanied all of Toni Morrisons books.

After reading the last page I was disenchanted and will never pick up another one of Ms. Morrison's books."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Toni Morrison is an excellent writer but I don't care for her book The Bluest Eye. I think it was wonderfully written but I didn't like what she wrote about. Morrison conveyed many powerful messages throughout the book. She wrote about society's view of beauty, and emotions, such as love. She also touches on the subjects of wealth, racial, and social problems. Toni Morrison writes a story about incest, domestic violence, prostitutes, alcoholics, and racists. The Bluest Eye is a powerful book. Pecola is struggling with her identity. She wants blue eyes and to fit in with the rest of society. Throughout the story we don't get a good sense of who she really is. Morrison focuses on Pecola' s family and friends and we don't really know just who Pecola is or why she wants blue eyes. Pecola becomes just another character in the book. We lose focus of who she is and what she wants.We never read from Pecola's point of view. I think that Morrison wanted us to see what her life was like and what the people around her were like with out her coming out and telling us. Toni Morrison is very descriptive in her book. We are able to see the setting of the story and what the people are like from her descriptions.In Toni Morrison's book The Bluest Eye, she describes people in detail. They are judged by their skin color, social standing, and amount of salary. Kids are only able to play with certain kids, not allowed to go to certain houses because they feel that they have to stay within their social class. Toni Morrison wrote a good book. It doesn't have a very good ending but it has many powerful messages. Morrison wrote about Pecola wanting to be accepted by society. She describes people in Pecola's life that affect her desire for blue eyes."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"i always finish reading a book, even if it's rubbish. but i quit a third of the way thru. i didn't need to hear any more sexual abuse descriptions. otherwise i felt it was a well written book.not anti-white. it highlights important issues.thanks for listening."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Ok now...

I just have mixed feelings about this book altogether."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"In an amazingly academic afterward, Toni Morrison discusses the writing in THE BLUEST EYE and analyzes her goals, where she achieved them and where she did not. If I understand her correctly, she wanted the reader to participate in Pecola's process of self-discovery (or lack of) and learn that every witness is responsible for destroying the life and oppressing the feelings of this child. She claims to have not acheived this, that \\"readers were touched, but not moved.\\" I'm not sure of the real difference in being one or the other but I suspect she meant that the readers were \\"not moved\\" to change. Toni Morrison asks a great deal of herself if she feels she was unsuccessful with THE BLUEST EYE. I was astounded by its poetry, its revelations, its pain and its deep wisdom. If ever a book was wise, this is the one.In terms of structure, this book is a masterpiece. Told from the point of view of two young black sisters (who are poor but better off than Percola) this book narrates the story of Pecola, her mother and father, and the Ohio community in which she lives in the 1940s. Each characterization is so thorough you can almost reach out and touch them; the chatter is so euphonious you can hear it and, despite the weight of this tale, take delight in each personality. Without a bump, we get the stories of her mother, her father, and the upstairs prostitutes, as well as of several other people who help destroy Pecola. Finally, there's Soaphead Church a self-made community wizard to whom Pecola makes her demand for blue eyes. Soaphead sees what this is about and writes a letter to God the style and intent of which has to be the first of its kind in all of contemporary literature.And Pecola herself? In insanity, she finds solace. We've seen her everywhere, everyday and never notice or chose to ignore her. She's on streets and in parks of every city, lost in her own world, forgotten by others and outside the margin of any community we can recognize. It is, in so many ways, one of the saddest stories ever told. In insanity, Pecola finds the only comfort she can. I'm aware that this sounds exactly like the pity that Toni Morrison would want to avoid. In conjunction with this pity, is awareness."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I First off I would like to note that I previously attempted to read this book in high school and again in beginning years of college, but as many may know Toni's language and word selection can be some what hard to follow so I never completed it, till now!When I got pass page 3, I was totally engaged to the book. Rarely putting it down, maybe that explains why I finished it in 2 1/2 days. Reading on my travels to and from work.I must say that this book has gotten me inspired to read (even though a senior in college, reading wasnt something fundamental for me). Even though I didnt grow up in the times of this book. I felt the impact of every character, felt the environmental assimilations, felt the hurt and despair of the overall point that was trying to be put across to the audience.I myself a BLACK female can truly relate to this book, and if you are looking for something that doesnt sugar coat [possible] real life experiences, and will make you FEEL the despair that some young ladies [mostly minorities] go through, and how a society can influence what others do and how they feel. Then this Book will do just that!"},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book was presented in an original and unique way&#65533;the language of the book is much different from any others I have read. Toni Morrison has a way with words that illustrates the book vividly and captures the deeper meaning behind the words. The Bluest Eye is not about the perfect traditional family, but instead about a young girl, Pecola, who is tormented by her family and schoolmates as any ugly black girl. Her only wish is to be the stereotypical beautiful American, like Shirley Temple&#65533;blond hair and blue eyes. She feels if she has blue eyes, everything in her life would be better. Claudia and Frieda MacTeer befriend Pecola and allow her to stay with them during hardships with her parents and after her father burned down their house. Claudia and Frieda remind me of my friends who stand up for me when others discriminate me because I am half Chinese. I have many friends, like Claudia and Frieda, who have defended me when others have called me names because I did not fit the mold of the perfect &#65533;American&#65533; in their eyes. This story uses Pecola as a reminder of how humans can be malicious to others that may not fit societal standards of beauty. At the end, Pecola is violated in the worst way possible by her father and becomes crazy. When Pecola becomes crazy, she achieves her wish of having &#65533;blue-eyes&#65533;. I encourage you to read this book to find out how Pecola gets her wish. Although the ending is sad, the message conveyed in this book is deep and meaningful&#65533;one that everyone can learn from."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Brought to life by Toni Morrison, The Bluest Eye is an extremely powerful story that tackles some of the difficult challenges people face to this day. I thought the tale was an unforgettable one. Toni Morrison uses just enough detail to let The Bluest Eye stick out in a person's mind for a lifetime. The way the author writes allows a person to understand things very clearly.The Bluest Eye is the story of Pecola Breedlove, a very unfortunate looking, young black girl living in Ohio in the early 1900's. Pecola's one main wish in life is to have blue eyes, hence the title of the book. She spends her entire childhood praying for these blue eyes so she may look like Shirley Temple and the other blonde haired, blue eyed, white girls in school. Throughout the story, are small tales of Pecola's family past, and explanations of why her life is so horrible. The various tales are written in block form, though, and therefore are very easily distinguishable from one another. As I read this book, I was saddened by the horrific events that this poor girl has to encounter, and shocked by the way people treated African American girls in the past. This story relates to many problems teenagers, adults and children still have now days in our society. Racism, family problems and loving your heritage are highly discussed issues in this book.I would recommend The Bluest Eye to anyone interested in reading books that tell true life stories. Though I thoroughly enjoyed this book, not everyone will. If you are not the type of person drawn into stories that may make you feel depressed or upset at the way things used to be, then I would not tell you to read this book. To like this book, you have to enjoy reading back to what things were like a couple decades ago, and the hardships people went through in public situations and at home."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This is the first novel by Toni Morrison I have ever read but it certainly won't be my last! She demonstrated the things that I have always believed makes a wonderful author, like their ability to create an image in your head. This is a talent Morrison has been heavily blessed with! At times I felt as though I truly knew the characters that perhaps they were even living and breathing beside me! Morrison enriches each phrase with colloquialism, similes, metaphors, and makes each sentence and phrase a delight itself. Another talent of Morrison is her ability to evoke an emotion inside you! At times I felt so strongly about what was happening, I believe I felt just as thecharacter it was happening to would have. She had me wanting to jump up and protest what was happening or feeling sorrowful for the lose or misfortune of the characters. Morrison also used more than one narrator which is sometimes difficult to accomplish without awkwardness but I think she did this well; by doing so she added aninteresting flare to the book!I'm not a very avid reader but when reading The Bluest Eye I found myself eager to turn the page curious as to what would happen next! I read this book in connection to a school assignment and for once my work came easily; it was simple for me to discuss and reflect on what I'd read; because this novel has so many deeper meanings that really make you question yourself. I think this book literally dares you to explore the truth. It made me step back and think about what our society considers beautiful and how those people that aren't what that is are affected by it everyday! Pecola, the main character, is an African American and struggles everyday to combat her ugliness vs. society's view of beauty. She herself has always believed she is ugly and never once chose to contradict it!Here is how Morrison described Pecola and her family's ugliness it, \\"You looked at them and wondered why they were so ugly; you looked closely and could not find the source. Then you realized that it came from conviction, their conviction. It was as though some mysterious all-knowing master had given each one a cloak of ugliness to wear, and they had each accepted it without question....And they took the ugliness in their hands, threw it as a mantle over them, and went about the world with it.\\" To Pecola, and the society, to be beautiful means to haveblonde hair and blue eyes or ultimately to be white. Now imaginehow she herself the total opposite must feel. This leads to her idolization of Shirley Temple; this can be easily compared to how young girls of today idolize celebrities for there skinny figures and...This prolonged believe just eats her away until the point where she feels that even her own mother couldn't love her unless she herself were to be beautiful, to have blue eyes. Although her believe about her mother's feelings for her are not far from the truth, can you even begin to imagine the pain that a child must endure to create those feelings?This novel brings you on a journey through the adolescence of young Pecola Breedlove. As mentioned earlier this difficult time in a young girl's life is only made worse, with her struggle with ugliness and yearning for beauty! As it is her life is already more difficult than the average young girl's. Pecola lives in poverty and filth with a drunk father, a mother that doesn't love her and a brother who constantly runs away. Imagine being in her situation and then add having no friends and being the subject of hatred from the entire town. I don'tbelieve it could get much worse, but somehow it does! Not onlydoes she experience emotional abuse as she is constantly ridiculed but she experiences physical and sexual abuse from her family.Morrison invites all of us to examine our hidden bias in the matter of race and appearance. It's not a pleasant experience, but it is a meaningful one. I believe this book and it's message is one that will stay with you for a long time if not forever, and I think you'll be glad it does. Reading books such as this, along with reality and other media, is part of what educates our society about the issues and it'simportant that we remain educated. I know that as I read this novel I just thought how lucky I am. I myself being a teenage girl have a tendency to take things for granted, and a lot of the time I think things are pretty bad. I'm personally grateful for writings such as The Bluest Eye that put things back into perspective and remind me how lucky I really am! I think that's something we all need from time to time.It's a great story and a real page turner, you'll be sure to fly through the pages in a flash! However, I also say this with some caution the story is not always pleasant, in fact its rather graphic and profane at times, and I would recommend the reader be at least fourteen years of age. This novel can be overwhelming and depressing but ultimately I'd say it's quite an enjoyable book. I know that the day I finished the book I was actually disappointed; because I had finished the book and there was no more of the story that had so easily enthralled me! I also personally see this as a story-line that may be more favorable towards women but that's only my opinion. Also because there is so much to be discussed in this book I'd say it is a wonderful choice for any group reading or book club. Once again I strongly recommend reading this book, find out what happens to young Pecola in her struggle through life!"},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"\\"The Bluest Eye\\" should be read by all Americans, especially African Americans. First, let's begin by saying that the novel is not just about Pecola and her sad journey, but it is about the journeys that we, African Americans, take through a world which has been defined and constructed by the majority. It is about how we negotiate or attempt to negotiate those sometimes confusing and confounding paths which have been constructed by the West. The key to the novel is the passage: \\"There in the dark [in the movies] her [Mrs. Breedlove's] memory was refreshed, and she succumbed to her earlier dreams. Along with the idea of romantic love, she was introduced to another -- physical beauty. Probably the most destructive ideas in the history of human thought.\\" And, these ideas have been passed down to us generation after generation, and they are the worst characteristics of the society in which we attempt to find our self-worth and our \\"humanness.\\" The coin of the realm is \\"beauty,\\" and, with it, come love, romance and power. If one is bereft of \\"beauty,\\" then one cannot be loved. Isn't that what the West tells us. And into this \\"bad soil,\\" we plant our seeds (our children); some will survive -- only if the soil is manured by enlightened parents, or, as Claudia says at the beginning of the novel, they will adjust and not improve. If we judge ourselves by the superficialities of the West, then we will never realize our potential. We will become \\"Pecola\\" -- \\"a winged but grounded bird, intent on the blue void it could not reach.\\" The sub-text is important in Morrison's novels. It is about freedom and self-realization; it is about de-constructing imprisoning worlds and constructing worlds in which we define freedom, good, evil and -- \\"beauty.\\" The lesson is found at the end of the novel; it is an appeal to us not to let happen to our children what happened to Pecola. Her odyssey begins with the question: \\"How do you get somebody to love you?\\" She finds the answer, but it is horrific and fatal. She gets the blue eyes (not the bluest!), and the \\"horror of her yearning is only exceeded by the evil of fulfillment.\\" She falls over into insanity which protects her from our silly preoccupations with \\"beauty\\" and \\"romantic love.\\" Read the novel again!"},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"No one writes a novel like Toni Morrison. No one. Her descriptive style is incomparable. The clever narrative pulls you in from the start. The language is beautiful. \\"The Bluest Eye\\" is a novel with many intricate stories that all intertwine and read more like poetry than anything else.The book's main character, Pecola Breedlove, is a poor, dark skinned, black child. She is considered to be ugly, and she is teased and ridiculed by most of the people that she comes into contact with. She sees that society's image of what beautiful looks like does not look like her. While society merely tolerates her, it warmly embraces it's beautiful people. The beautiful people had money, dressed nicely, and typically had white skin and blue eyes. Even a light skinned black girl with pretty clothes and green eyes was accepted in society as being beautiful. Pecola equated this acceptance into society with love. Perhaps if she had blue eyes, the bluest eyes, then she too, would be loved... What was unthinkable at the time the book was written is possible now. One CAN buy colored contact lenses, change one's hair length and color, and even bleach one's skin if one wants to. There are still many people out there who are being made to feel like Pecola did. \\"The Bluest Eye\\" invites us to not only feel sorry for poor Pecola and people like her, but also to examine our own views as well."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This is an example of work that made Toni Morrison a Noble Laureate.

I decided to read it in spring of 2002 because I became a student of creative writing in local college (reading various types of novels help in learning the craft) and a friend who read it also encouraged me to read it.I regretted not reading The Bluest Eye sooner, however I think the delay made me more appreciative of Toni Morrison and her style of story telling. And she can write!Only a writer of great intelligence could describe a character in prose for more than ten pages. An example began around page sixty-one where she described a woman so well that by the time I finished I had the character pictured and I mentally carried a faint scent of talcum that the character might apply on her body on a hot Georgian afternoon as she did her chores. I got so lost, I mean lost in Morrison's description of supporting characters in The Bluest Eye that I occasionally forgot the main story.The story, expertly told from POV of two sisters, falls short of telling us more about Pecola and her quest for \\"blue eye\\", but it didn't matter because the back-stories and her style of delivery made up for it.

She is convinced that the only way her life could improve would be that she look like Shirley Temple. Liekwise, many adolescents in our country have the same preconceived notions set in place by movies and the media. Morrison's writing tenique, although sometimes very detailed, is complementary for the subject matter being presented. She repeatedly goes off on tangents about specific characters, but this only adds to the development of the plot. The descriptive dialoge leaves the reader feeling the same pain and abuse that Pecola felt and, at the same time, feeling compassion for the racial hatred that was inflicted so prevelently in that community. I think that the material dealt with in the book is intended for a mature audience. I would definitly recomend this book for adults to read."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Despite the many bad reviews I read, I decided to get this book from the local library: I absolutely adore it!In the book, Morrison tells stories set in Ohio around the turn of the century from a black perspective. It points out many aspects of black life that are unknown to e.g. my generation, which include not only the repercussions of segregation in the New South but also ideas and ideologies that existed in people's minds and motivated their actions.In response to the negative reviews, it's true that there's not that much of a plot and I understand that if one is expecting a straight-forward, neatly woven story around one main character, it might be unsatisfactory. It's also true that some of the themes in the book are grossly disturbing. But Morrison has had the delicacy to present these themes without judgement or blame.If you can be open-minded and curious, I would truly recommend this book. I believe it is a must-read for anyone who seeks a comprehensive understanding of humanity."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"\\"The Bluest Eye\\" by Toni Morrison is a novel that one does forget. In \\"The Bluest Eye\\", the reader is thrown into a world many Americans didn't know existed. It tells a story about one girls quest to change her eye color to look more traditionally beautiful. Meanwhile, throughout the story the reader is introduced to many individuals that all have unique stories of their own. Just when you think that you dislike a character, you soon find out their life's story; your perception of them changes, albeit not always for the better.Overall the story is heart wrenching and interesting. Although, I have not read anything else by Toni Morrison, I believe that this book speaks highly of her writing ability.I give it 4 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The Bluest Eye, Toni Morrison's auspicious debut novel is an unsparing study of the corrosive effects of racism on a little girl, Pecola Breedlove. The novel is narrated by another girl, Claudia McTeer, and divided into four seasonal sections. Morrison draws upon her autobiographical experience growing up in a mining town, Lorain, Ohio, and one feels the winter chill and \\"tough love\\" of the McTeer family in contrast to Pecola's brutal and abusive childhood.Perhaps most damning is the way in which the characters internalize the vicious and subhuman images of blacks, and lavish their affection on white icons like Shirley Temple. Claudia is the lone dissenting voice in this acceptance. Despite the tragic story she tells, Morrison's lyrical prose redeems the bleakness and even her secondary characters like the Maginot Line are unforgettable. Though perhaps a bit formally clunky, the novel points toward the author's Nobel prize-winning achievements like Song of Solomon and Beloved.[...]"},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This is a pretty sad story but it was an incredible well written story that keeps you reading and wanting to know what happens next.

Highly recomend this book."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I had to read this book a few years back for a school assignment and I remembered it quite well as the most fascinating and gripping story I had ever read (and I'm an English major, so I feel like that's saying a lot since I read so much). Anyways, you don't have to be an avid reader to enjoy the pure truth of this novel. To keep it brief, Toni Morrison is a incredibly bold and honest writer and the topics she brings to surface in \\"The Bluest Eye,\\" while slightly dark, are discussed in an amazingly courageous fashion. It doesn't matter who you are, or what interests you - you NEED to read this book. You will definitely walk away from it with new insight on life. Its as simple as that. I don't want to give away any plot details of the book. Just know that its absolutely worth reading."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"My first experience with Ms. Morrison came through \\"Beloved.\\" I read it on my own not knowing what to expect, and the book ended up going way over my head. I became so frustrated and intimidated that I said I would never attempt to read another Toni Morrison book again if it was as difficult as \\"Beloved.\\" However, I talked to others about it, and they advised me to read her earlier works. I also watched many interviews with Ms. Morrison especially by Charlie Rose. I fell in love with the wisdom she possessed and the issues she sought to explore in her books. So I decided to go to the beginning of her works, and I am oh so glad that I did!Yes, Pecola is the character who specifically wishes for blue eyes. However, Pecola is only one character of many in one family of many suffering with self-loathing. This book is about so much more than the victimization of a child. It is about the development of self-hate of individuals, the violence it produces in families and communities, and how communities so worried about their outside appearances to please the gaze of those looking upon them, build a foundation of sinking sand. When that foundation gives in, the community crashes down most heavily on the most vulnerable. However, there are bright spots in the most unlikely places or the most unlikely people (Miss Marie, China, and Poland) IMHO.The story won't make you happy, but it is meant to make you more than just sympathetic. Ms. Morrison plants many nuggets of truth throughout the book, and leads you to a gold mine of it at the very end. I am glad to have given Ms. Morrison another chance and am on my way to starting \\"Sula!\\""},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"In The Bluest Eye, Toni Morrison examines society's perception of true beauty and its impact on self worth. The Bluest Eye's female protagonist, Pecola Breedlove is enthralled with the fair and favored image of Shirley Temple. This however, leads to Pecola's inability to define herself by any other standard of beauty, besides that of a prevailing racist society, which dominates the storyline of The Bluest Eye. Through this rigid domination of society, Morrison demonstrate how the power of society's views not only define the perception of others, but also one's own perception of themselves, as well as feeding into society's opinions can cause a major disaster.Through Claudia's character, Morrison shows how along with society, the family background from which we come from, plays a vital role in how much of an impact society makes one perceive their self. Claudia is able to stand firm knowing she is black, and yet still beautiful since she is rooted in a stable family who loves her as well as taught her how to love. Pecola on the other hand lacks the experience of having true love or being accepted by her own family, as well as lacking the knowledge of self-value and how to love herself. Event after traumatic event, her self-worth decreases disabling her from being able to grow and learn the value of self worth and the true meaning of beautiful. Claudia expresses how Pecola became the one, who makes everyone around her feel beautiful.Overall, The Bluest Eye is an excellent novel, full of excitement, anguish and ralization that beauty is skin deep and not just an outward apperance."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Toni Morrison's debut, The Bluest Eye, is not for the faint of heart; it contains graphic sexuality, including child abuse. However, if you can get past that, it is truly a beautiful novel. Toni Morrison paints a picture of black people living in America that is neither overly kind or overly cruel, and for me it augmented my appreciation for the culture.The plot is simple and devastating; Pecola Breedlove is a young black girl, not very attractive, pregnant with her father's child, and a bit of a social outcast. That may sound melodramatic, but the young characters who are able to feel both sympathy and some empathy for the girl add a touching human quality to the novel, as well as middle-aged prostitutes, who show a love for the girl that others do not.The first half of this novel is truly great. The writing is precise and poetic, with the occasional elegant metaphor. The writing in the second half does not falter, but the plot does lose ground a bit. When the focus turns away from the young girls, I did not feel as connected to the story. However, the bizarre and slightly disturbing ending (which lends the novel its title) is masterful and strange.If you are new to Toni Morrison, I would advise starting with Sula. It is not as good as Sula, Beloved, or Song of Solomon, but it is very much worth your time."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book is beautiful. I read it at least 6 times a year and each time I notice something different. Usually Ms. Morrison's books are complex and a bit hard to follow but this book is simple and straight to the point."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Toni Morrison to me is the most powerful writer living today. No one matches her for sheer guts and poetry. From the very first page of \\"The Bluest Eye\\" she took my breath away. Her switching of voices and viewpoints at first intrigued me and rang with an unmistakable authority -- remaining with me as long as she stayed with the women. But when she switched to the men, it began to feel manufactured. Her chapters began to remind me of Annie Proulx short stories when she tells you the complete background of characters before getting to the critical scene and dialogue. And I wondered why Morrison gave us everyone's viewpoint but the central character's.Then I read Morrison's Afterword, which explained that she didn't want to \\"lead readers into the comfort of pitying her rather than the interrogation of themselves for the smashing.\\" She proceeds to smash her own novel and is surely her own worst critic. Her criticism becomes more and more convoluted and academic to the point of obscurity and all I can say is that I'd sure rather read one of her books than attend one of her lectures. It also demonstrates why her writing must be poetic rather the prose.I found the book a daring, thought-provoking, and exciting experiment. What struck me, that I'm not even sure Morrison was aware of, was this: The \\"ugliness\\" that the Breedloves experienced and projected had less to do with being black, or any color, than from the effects of alcoholism in the family and their inevitable and progressive degeneration. In Pecola's denial of this, she latched on to color instead. This is not to belittle the devasting effects of racism on people, but to explain why one child turned in on herself, while Morrison and her character Claudia responded with healthy anger -- especially when you consider the contrast of Pecola's experience to that of Frieda and Claudia with Mr. Henry.A devasting first novel, but not her greatest.Dana Bagshaw, author"},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The Bluest Eye is a very well written portrayal of a child who is without a semblance of parental love, goodness or guidance and the vagaries of the community within which she lives.

People are judged by skin color, social standing, salary level and their fashion sense, among other things. We want to be &quot;better&quot; to each other, but I believe it is the nature of the visually-equipped &quot;beast&quot; to judge before we get close enough to one another to know the person beneath the outer shell.

I, too, have been getting turned off of Oprah's recent selections because of what seems to be a running theme of abuse and betrayal, but Oprah was right about this one.

Pecola, Claudia, Frieda, and the Breedloves are all described and describe in such clear, eerie precision. They are not characters in a book, they breathe on their own. Through all the poverty, tears, fear, disgust, self-loathing, hate, wanting, sex, disbelief, and wishful thinking, this story is a melting pot of stories, each character adding his and her own ingredients that will shock and sadden you along the entire way, concluding with the frightening, unexpected (to me) finale."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I read the book in one sitting.

The book takes you through the life of each character - all I really wanted to know about was Pecola - but in the end I realized in order to know Pecola, I had to know the people who affected her life. The story shows how words and actions compound and how people can be made to feel inadequate. In searching for adequacy they may hurt the very people they love. It's a survival thing - survival of the mind - which in the end, Pecola was unable to do. The story is sad and it doesn't shed a lot of hope. It proves you can distroy someone with words - maybe not with your words alone, but your words on top of other's.

The difficulties she encountered only continued at home with a drunken father, a distant mother, and a run away brother. But, through everything her only wish was for blue eyes, the bluest eyes. Believing that the blue eyes would make her beautiful.The story of Pecola really brings forth emotions such as anger, sadness, disgust, and sympathy within the reader, it is because of this I enjoyed the novel so much. Any novel that can have a reader experience so much emotion has got to be good. The writing style that Mrs. Morrison uses keeps the reader wanting to know more. I also enjoyed the fact that there was a good lesson to be learned from this story of this young girl that encounters so many trials.

Her mother is a maid to a rich white family. He mother is so corrupted by society she is in love with the white person's way of life. Every day the is told through different mediums, to live a beautiful life of love and happiness it must resemble that of a upper middle class with family. This way of thinking causes here to abounded her role as a mother and devote her love to the white family of which she serves.The father of the house, named Cholly, is a drunk who ends up destroying the mind of his young daughter, Pecola. He takes no responsibility as a father because of is constant abuse of alcohol. In the end his lust and greed lead him to violently raping his daughter.

She thinks that is she just had blue eyes she and the people around her would be happy. In the end Pecola gains her blue eyes, however the affects of the eyes where not what she had hoped for.This book deals with many issues surrounding racial discrimination. The main theme Toni Morrison was focusing on through out the book was how, because of the years and years of the white society beating in the idea of racial inferiority into the minds of African Americans. Soon the black race was starting to believe the inferiority of there own people to the white man. Toni Morrison has captured this idea very well, splendid work."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison was an interesting and creative novel. The book is based in Lorain, Ohio which was Morrison's home town. The books focal point is about a little black girl named Pecola who believes that the only way she can be pretty is to have the blondest of hair and the bluest of eyes. She also beleives that all of her problems would be solved if she accomplishes this. She is abused mentally by the society that she is in and even physically by her father who rapes and impregnates her.It is not just Pecola in the book that falls subject to the feeling inferior and abuse, but most of the black community in her town as well. Claudia is another protagonist in the book that witnesses all that happens to Pecola. Claudia lives with her sister Frieda and her mother in a house that is poverty stricken. Claudia narrates the book as an adult looking back at the past when she was nine years old.The main enemy of the book is not a tangible object or person, but is more of a way of thinking back in the time. Internalized racism is this way of thinking. The black community is targeted by this idea and begins to believe their own inferiority to whites. Pecola being the main character suffers the most from internalized racism.This was the first book that Toni Morrison ever wrote and the reader can tell by her styles of writing. It almost seems as though she is testing writing styles and speech. From reading the book I can tell that Toni Morrison was experimenting with fiction because the content form is sometimes fleeing from the main idea.Pecola's experiences throughout the book leave her unsensible, a product of her own ideas of herself based on racism in the town. This book was poignant with a depressing tone and at the same time very interesting and informative. Morrison's writing is creative. This book requires interest in a different kind of writing and an open mind.

If you feel that's a compelling line to start a book with, read it, how it chronicles Pecola's intense desire for blue eyes, and the stories woven therein."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Toni Morrison's first novel is a very melancholy yet fascinating piece of literature. The Bluest Eye includes a mixture of emotion and torment. This work of fiction, like many of Morrison's other pieces, is extremely vivid and controversial. Though the author herself is African-American, the black society is looked down upon in most of her stories. \\"Only when the lesson of racial estrangement is learned is assimilation complete,\\" Ms. Morrison says in Time Magazine's \\"Special Issue: The New Face of America\\". By declaring this, she expresses her belief that the everyday ordeals in which the black community has endured should be exposed in order for the other races of America to learn more about it.For instance, this particular piece emphasizes a great deal on the \\"standard of beauty\\" which consist of white or light skin, attractiveness, as well as beautiful eyes. The idea that whiteness is superior is implied throughout the novel. \\"Frieda and she [Pecola] had a loving conversation about how cu-ute Shirley Temple was.\\"( The Bluest Eye, p19). Claudia, the main narrator, shows the black girl's adoration for the white girl. Other themes evident in the novel are sexuality and that appearance is everything. Morrison's The Bluest Eye is about particularly one little girl's disheartening transition in life from childhood to womanhood, and all the while, longing to be beautiful.The novel opens with introducing Claudia's family and reveals right away that Pecola has been impregnated by her father. The reader already gets a sense that Pecola is from a \\"broken family\\" and the daughter or a very fraudulent man. She stays with Claudia's family for some time while her father is in jail and she is separated from her mother, Mrs. Breedlove, and her brother, Sammy. Claudia's mother gets frustrated with Pecola living with their family, but they feel sorry for her.After a while, Pecola moves back in with her family and life becomes more difficult. Her parents are continuously arguing and physically fighting, while Sammy frequently runs away. She also has a hard time at school, because she is constantly teased by white and black classmates as well as discriminated by her teachers. A pretty black girl named Maureen Peal befriends Pecola temporarily, but ends up making fun of her; this is when she realizes that beauty is everything. Pecola is even more convinced if she was attractive, then her life would be better. She assumes that she would have more friends, be liked by everyone, and loved by her parents if only she was beautiful.The reader later receives insight on Pecola's parents' distressful childhoods. Mrs. Breedlove's feelings towards the white actresses and beauty are similar to Pecola's in that they both long to look like them. They want to live up to their \\"standard of beauty\\", but know it can never be. Pecola's father, Cholly, was abandoned as a baby and raised by his great aunt who died when he was in his early adolescence. He was once embarrassed by two white men who caught him having sex and made him continue while they watched. He was careless and nave when he met Pecola's mother and once they were married he became unhappy with his life from that moment on.Cholly comes home one day to see Pecola washing dishes and ends up [attacking] his own daughter. Morrison goes into great detail about the ordeal. In the beginning of the novel, Pecola starts menstruating and towards the end she gets pregnant. The story is not just a changing of age, but the maturation of Pecola sexually as well. Claudia and her sister, Frieda, want Pecola's baby to be born, but it unfortunately dies prematurely. Cholly rapes Pecola for the second time, runs away and dies. Pecola is overwhelmed with happiness and believes she has the bluest eyes, meaning she can now be content with her life.The story of Pecola is overall depressing and reveals that happiness may come in the most unexpected ways. Tony Morrison's works are not for everyone, but if you are looking for a challenge, you will find it in this novel. Morrison discloses African-Americans' views of themselves and other races in the community. As the reader, you undoubtedly learn more on the differences in races and cultures through the eyes of a black girl who envies the white people, but in actuality is simply looking for happiness in life. This a good book for learning about African-American life of the time, but not exactly a thriller or romance. It is a good quality book and a serious read and may not be taken lightly."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Toni Morrison's The Bluest Eye consists of a series of interrelated stories, told from the perspectives of different characters, that revolve around the novel's protagonist, Pecola. Pecola is a young black female who longs for love and acceptance, two desires that go unfulfilled by her dysfunctional family and the racist world around her. Pecola believes her problems would be solved if she had the \\"superior\\" blue eyes characteristic of white children. Pecola holds to her dream of possessing blue eyes as a way out of the isolation and misery she suffers. Her mother Pauline hates her own home and turns to maintaining one of a white family. Her father Cholly betrays Pecola and impregnates her.At times the novel is somewhat graphic in its depiction of the disturbing behavior of Cholly and Soaphead Church, a man who takes pleasure from little girls. Morrison succeeds in creating a novel rich with emotion. The plight of Pecola is heart-wrenching and poignant. Her harrowing ordeal evokes sympathy from the reader. Although Claudia and Frieda MacTeer, two young black sisters who befriend Pecola, have been exposed to some of the more vulgar aspects of life, they still possess a sense of innocence. Unlike everyone else, the two want Pecola's baby to live. In a touching scene the sisters sacrifice their bicycle money and plant marigolds, hoping that if the flowers grow, so will Pecola's baby.Although parts of the novel are quite unnerving and depressing, as a whole, I found the novel to be very moving. I would recommend it to others. However, I prefer Morrison's later work, Beloved, to this novel. I thought this novel flowed nicely and somewhat loosely but I liked the interwoven structure of Beloved. Nevertheless, I would give Toni Morrison high marks on her first novel, The Bluest Eye."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I really enjoyed this novel. Morrison creates many interlocking stories that join together to create a masterpiece. Pecola's idea of beauty and her desire to be beautiful through having blue eyes creates a powerful message about the treatment and class of blacks during this time.

This compelling story brings tears to your eyes from the treatment these young girls endured. I really liked this book."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This first novel is a brave attempt to describe the longing for happiness through beauty, as perceived by a black child in miserable circumstances. Miss Morrison links this longing to the disadvantage of race, but I think it is a desire that is universal. Ugliness, misery, poverty, and incest are not limited to a specific race. The fragmented thread of the story unfortunately took away the power of the author's message.However, Miss Morrison more than compensated readers with subsequent works like 'Beloved' and 'The Song of Solomon'."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The Bluest Eye is a novel about a young girl named Pecola Breedlove who wants so badly to be loved and accepted by society. It takes place in 1941 in Lorain Ohio, a small town where the author Toni Morrison grew up. Pecola is a black girl growing up in an America where the love is for blonde, blue eyed children. She prays every night for her eyes to turn blue so that she will be beautiful, so that people will look at her, so that her world will be different.Living in an unstable family, with a mother who shows no love for her children, and a father who is a drunk, you wonder how things can ever get worse for this young girl. The author explains how her life is the way she is with sections explaining the mother and fathers upbringing. With no friends, and everyone in the town looking down upon her, it's no wonder things went the way they did. Two young girls, Claudia and Frieda in which partly tell the story of this saddened child, do befriend her, better than anyone else ever has. They stick up for her when the boys tease her about her skin and the fact that her father sleeps naked, they feel sorry for her when tragedy comes, but this still does nothing to save her from the curse she was born with, and the yearning she has for these blue eyes, which will destroy her.The style in which Toni Morrison writes is like no one else. She pulls you in with her beautiful language and with many different stories all intertwining together it is like poetry. \\"And all of our beauty, which was hers first and which she gave to us. All of us--all who knew her felt so wholesome after we cleaned ourselves on her. We were so beautiful when we stood astride her ugliness. Her simplicity decorated us, her guilt sanctified us, her pain made us glow with health, her awkwardness made us think we had a sense of humor. Her inarticulateness made us believe we were eloquent. Her poverty kept us generous. Even in her waking dreams we used--to silence our own nightmares.\\" (Morrison 205) Those few sentences of the book describe the way the town felt about her, and used her to make themselves feel better. Remember that the rest of the characters too were black, and none of them met up to the blonde, blue eyed standards beauty was held to. The human nature of this is something that goes on in many situations, but with Morrison's words it gets brought to life. It makes you go on after the read to think about the way we see society, and why we think some things are beautiful. Toni Morrison writes about this ugliness in a way so it doesn\`t seem so ugly anymore. The yearning of the blue eyes, the love, the beauty. With this writing she spreads the message of what our society is telling these black children who don't look like this. Society is basically telling them that they are ugly. With the story of this 11 year old girl this message is delivered loudly.It is easy to tell that this is a great book, however there are many metaphors in which you may not pick up on that prove once again how well Morrison wrote this book. Two main metaphors are the way she describes marigolds and dandelions. Marigolds represent the way Pecola was thought of in society. \\"I even think now that the land of the entire country was hostile to marigolds that year. The soil is bad for certain kinds of flowers.\\" (Morrison 206) The land would not accept the flower as society would not accept Pecola. Dandelions represent how Pecola sees herself. She wonders why people think they are ugly and call them weeds. She thought they were pretty. This is how she sees herself, but if society wasn't going to like the flower, she wouldn't either.At the beginning of each new section Morrison uses a unique technique where she takes out excerpts from the Dick and Jane stories, and makes them look like a complete long lost thought that has been running through someone's mind, without any spacing or punctuation. It represents how this idea of beauty had been driven into so many peoples heads, that when you think of the word beautiful, immediately you picture a blond blue eyed child. This idea has been in Pecola's head her whole life, and she'd do anything to change the way she is, to meet the expectations of beautiful.I personally enjoyed reading this book, and learned a lot about the hardships African-Americans face every day in our society that is so quick to judge. Through the eyes of Pecola Breedlove, me and so many others who don't have first hand experience with this issue, can now express our sympathy for it and try to help stop the hate that is going on, even though many can't even see it. Beauty and love are two of the most beautiful things our world has to offer. Just because someone doesn't fit the description of one certain look, does not mean they are not beautiful, and therefore don't deserve to be loved.I strongly recommend this book to any mature reader who enjoys reading a well written, strong novel."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I read The Bluest Eye, in high school. The perfect place to read a book like this, where everyone is so caught up in the outward appearance. It's a sad tale of a young girl, named Pecola growing up in a bad neighborhood with careless parents. All Pecola wants in life is to be loved and in the society she lives in having blue eyes was concidered beautiful, so every day she wishes for blue eyes. This is a heart wrenching tale of young Pecola and the extent of her desperation to be loved in a world that conciders her &quot;ugly&quot;. I recommend this book for all mature readers, for there is content not appropriate for younger readers."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"When reading this novel, 'The Bluest Eyes' by Toni Morrison, my emotions became scattered like the structure of the book. I kept turning the pages waiting for the hope that would come, but never did. The beginning of the book sets you up for the devastation to come, but when it finally hit your outraged twice over. The tragedy comes and there is nothing you can do to stop it and you feel helpless. I think that Toni Morrison left you with no hope, because hope is something that you have to find on your own. You can not sit around and wait for it to come to you. You have to search and fight for hope or you will end up like Mr. and Mrs. Breedlove with no hope and unfulfilled dreams to hand down to your children."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Although the writing was not as strong as some of Morrison's other works; i.e, Song of Solomon and Beloved, The Bluest Eye is thematically very strong. The main character deeply suffers from extreme self-loathing and Morrison carries out the effects of racial discrimination to the ultimate degree. The book resonated in this reader's mind for days afterward."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book can show you how sensitive children are at a very young age, especially when they are different than what is considered to be beautiful and attractive. This book should teach parents to build confidence in their children and really pay attention to how they feel about themselves. It is important that all children feel beautiful because they all are, regardless of their eye color, skin color,,,etc,etc,etc. This book was precious. There WERE moments that I got angry or hurt for little Pecola, but it was worth the lessons learned from it. God Bless Toni Morrison!"},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"As a high school student from a mixed background of white and American Indian ancestry, it really made me face the meanness we all face. This wasn't just a story of a little black girl who wants to be white, and therefore only reflects black culture, but a book that moves anyone black, white, Indian, etc. who has been discriminated against. Pecola made me realize how beautiful we all are."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Though Toni Morrison kept on jumping from one sceenary to another and from time to time back and forth, the story still kept it's beauty and wonder. Reading every charachter's background, makes you understand everybody's poin of view, instead of hating Pecola's mother and cursing her drunk father for what he'd done to her!! &quot;The Bluest Eye&quot; brings all type of emotions to you while reading, and that -in my oppenion- is what makes a good book."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The book I just read was a novel by;Toni Morrison, &quot;The Bluest Eyes.&quot; It was a very interesting book. It captivated me and made me become apart of it. I often found myself putting myself in the place of the main character. The character was Pecola Bredlove. She was a black girl living in America. She was eleven years old and often felt like an outcast, because a lot of people thought she was ugly. So she wished to have the bluest eyes, which she thought would turn her pretty and white. The rest of the novel discusses in detail the problems and sufferings this little girl has to endure because of her ugliness. This book often made me mad and frustrated at her family and friends. I would recommend this book to all ages, from 14 years and up. It is a book that will keep your whole mind glued to everything that happens. It is a book all different races and backgrounds can enjoy. This book showed me to love myself and my differences."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book clearly researchs the nesscesity to reach out and help others in need.

I thought, great, another book about prejudice in our wonderful world. But the way Morrison has portrated Pecola, Claudia, Frieda, and the rest of the &quot;bunch&quot; gives the reader incredible ammounts of insight as to what it was like to be in the minority in a time of struggle. As a young Jewish teenage female, I look at this book as a way for everyone to get a bit of insight on what it was like to be an elementary aged, black girl, growing up in a time of prejudice and hate."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I read this book for a junior year term paper, and not only was it compassionate and addicting, it really made me understand the hardships that some African American families went through.

She describes graphic sex and violence to keep in line with America's obsession with this sex and violence. The book would have been wonderfully refreshing without it. Instead, it is typical and predictable. I wish her book would have given more of a window for acceptance in a world of racism. The Bluest Eye gives a very sterotypical view of white people as black haters."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I read this book and was so upset.

I didn't."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I taught it one year in my AP Lit class because the teacher before me had already chosen it. It is not literature. The only reason it received its accolades is because our society mistakes \\"shocking\\" for \\"profound\\". The two are not the same. Graphic descriptions of children being incestuously raped does not make a book profound or deep or meaningful. It can make it perverted, however -- especially when the relativistic message is that we should all come to understand and empathize with those poor rapists, hookers, and sexually perverted preachers, etc. It's all stereotype and cliche, not at all well written. Sorry, I'm interested in real literature."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I think it's terrible that Oprah Winfrey would recommend a book as anti-white as this. It's not as bad as some &quot;black&quot; literature that blames everything on white people, but it's close. It's very reactionary and unfairly critical. She doesn't promote the beauty of blacks, but only puts down whites. It's insane the way people fawn over this hack."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I feel that this book, although written before Oprah started making millionaires, is still part of the big Toni Morrison sell out story.

When I saw \\"The Bluest Eye\\" by Toni Morrison, I wanted to read it to see what it was like. It was great a story and so much more.Pecola Breedlove- a little girl that goes through so much pain. I mean I thought that when I was little that I had it bad, but...she has it ten times as worse as some children. She views herself as ugly. She hardly has friends her age. Her mother acts as a matyr, her brother runs away, and her father is a drunk. Pecola envisions that having \\"blue eyes\\" will help with herself and her daily life. She thinks that by having these eyes her parents will stop fighting, and her whole environment will change.Claudia MacTeer-Claudia is the narrator of the story. She tells about the devasting things that will happen to Pecola Breedlove. .... .... .... .... .... ....\\"The Bluest Eye\\" has open my eyes. It has made me seen what environmental factors can tear one child into pieces and drive her into insanity. I remember my childhood, and it reminds me of my name. I did not like my name because I thought it was too weird. I wanted another name. A plain name. But as I grew older, I embraced my name because it was special reason why I was name that name.But Pecola's world...her world is torn apart. Raped and pregnant by her father. Rejected by society because she is ugly. These things make her want \\"blue eyes\\" so much...she even imagines that she has them when Soaphead Church grants them to her.America needs to wake up...what are we really doing to our children. Is it possible that this has happen before?Oh, yes, it has happen. I think that it is continuing to happen. Maybe not so drastically as it happened with Pecola, but enough to destroy a child's world.Thank you Toni Morrison---it is writers like you make people think about what is happening to our society :o)."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I finished this book in about a week. It was very deep and took me to a place and time I've never been. Yes, I've been through Loraine, Ohio BUT not in the 1940's nor as a Black. Wake up, readers! For many of you, yes this is a culture shock. BUT it did happen and is still happening today in the 21st century. Racial Prejudice--not only ugly children and people.This book's main character, Pecola, was a fighter that gave up the fight. She was violated. A child violated. This angers me but in today's society, like it or not, IT HAPPENS! Doesn't matter your color, children are being hurt yet this is a wonderful book to warn you of what our children are still going through in the school yards, in the class rooms, at the lockers in school.Ms. Morrison, wonderful job and my hat is tipped to you! Thank you!"},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"After reading Toni Morrison's book Song of Solomon, I was excited to read The Bluest Eye. I wasn't so impressed by this book. It was filled with black vs. white situations, rape, and put-downs. The story was very detailed, but it jumped around quite a bit. At first it was hard to understand because the story is told with the main character looking back at her childhood, but as the story went along it was easier to read.A girl named, Claudia, who is nine years old, narrates this story. Her and her sister, Frieda, live in the small town of Lorain, Ohio with their mother, Mrs. Macteer. Pecola is the protagonist of the story who comes to stay with Claudia's family because her father has burned up their house, beaten her mother, and ended up &quot;outside.&quot; Her father, Cholly, also raped and has gotten her pregnant. This may be because of his bringing up by his aunt because his mother abandoned him, but that is no reason to molest a small child that is his own. The baby did not live in the end and Claudia and Frieda thought it was because they planted the flower seeds too deep and did not pray enough for the baby. In the middle of the story a girl named Maureen Peel moves into the town. She is a light girl, and Pecola takes to her quickly. Pecola has always wished to have blue eyes because she feels the town will accept her and think she isn't ugly if she has them. Claudia and Frieda did not like Ms. Peel, often calling her Meringue Pie behind her back. They knew she was as false fronted as they were towards Pecola, with her blond hair, blue eyes, and six fingers on each hand. (One was removed from each hand though.) The story goes on telling about the prostitutes that live above Pecola, and how Claudia and Frieda are not allowed to talk with them because they are evil. This story from the beginning to end goes through the childhood's of characters in the story, showing what people had to go through at that point in history.I wouldn't recommend this book to everyone, but it does open up your eyes to things that happened while things were still segregated. If you like Toni Morrison as an author, this book is one you may like even though it is much different than others she has written. It leaves you wondering about the actualities of life both now and many years ago."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I regret the fact that it took a reading assignment to get me to read this novel. The Bluest Eye is one of the greatest pieces of literary art I have ever read. Toni Morrison's style and diction are the foundation for this great story, while the plot develops it. By including some of the more taboo situations in our society ( i.e. sexual abuse, social acceptance, broken families) into the novel, Toni Morrison is able to not only tell a story, but make a point. I reccommend this book to any type of person who is able to grasp a novel and learn a life lesson from it."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book is well written, in that it gives an uncompromising portrait of a sad life of poverty, racism, and rape.

It's a quick read and depressing. My comment is in response to some other reviews on this page. Whether a reviewer enjoys a book or not, s/he should comment on the content as well as the feelings invoked. If I read a review from someone who didn't seem to have read the book, it isn't very useful to me. The idea that Toni Morrison targets white people in this book is wrong. Anyone who reads this book will notice the scarcity of white characters. Pecola suffers at the hands of relatives and other children, most of whom happen to be black (with one exception). Mainly she suffers from the idea that she isn't beautiful because she doesn't fit a certain image. I'm sorry to say that the concept of beauty Morrison portrays is all too real. Disbelief in that concept of beauty doesn't lessen it."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The Bluest Eye was was of the most heartfelt, 'true' books I have read in a long time.

She possesses very strong opinions which give light to here broad insight and amzazing intellect. However, some thoughts are better conveyed through an essay (or several essays), as opposed to a disorganized and unfocused novel. &quot;The Bluest Eye&quot; was a series of interesting philosophies helter-skelterly mingled with a depressing story of a girl's incestuous relationship with her father. Disappointing to say the least, I give this novel two thumbs waaaay down."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"...i just couldnt get into the book... its just so boring. But something else was naggin me, I was thinkin, is this for real, no way, i know not all white people were rasist even back then. But this book makes them all look like toenails of satan, and they are shown as the source of all the Black people's problems.every thing, even dolls and flowers remind them of there repression. Is this even an accurate description of the past, or just over exagerating. I think its the latter boys and girls, but in this world of Toni Morrison, every...white dude is a rasist. but clealy theres evidence of non-racist white people even in the times of slavery. Dont forget that some white people came to america from non-english speaking countries after slavery(polish, german, dutch, russian, french, etc.) sure there were rascist white people then, but not every dang caucasion was a freakin skin head. i dont understand this book, its like its saying, \\"hey this is the theme, every white dude is a descendent of a racist slave owners, actually, they were all racist even to the 20th century, every last one of them. they still are\\" Books like these give me a bad image, its trash, and it sturrs up old hatred.Ok, there was some good to this novel, it is after all, 2 stars instead of 1.

Lately, I have been tired of reading about poor women from ghastly homes who somehow triumph above all. Her picks are a bit depressing! Oprah was really enthused about this book, so I thought I would give it a shot. Once again, I was disappointed. The narration was choppy and disconnected--it was hard to really feel Pecola's pain, since the author uses third person narration. The main idea of Pecola wanting blue eyes doesn't come out until the very end of the book. The author was trying to illustrate the sadness of racial self loathing, but I thought Pecola to be totally self-loathing, not just racially. Finally, the author works very hard to hold every white person in the book responsible for the young girl's disintegration, when it is really all the black people in her life who destroy her. I realize that this book was written in the 1960's, when racial predjudice was abundant, and the author is merely trying to paint a picture of the times, but I think she could have done a much better job with this story."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Received in 3 days.

I felt that the book was a jumbled mess. To me, the story seemed not to be about Pecola Breedlove, but more about the other characters. I understand that each character, in relation to Pecola, had a story to tell, but I never got to KNOW her. Soaphead Church did not deserve to have a whole chapter written about him, when he ONLY had a few lines of dialog with her. I must admit, though, that Ms. Morrison's use of description is superb and it allows a reader to form the story within their head. Oh, wait, one more thing, I found the book to be a wee bit boring. The first chapter grabs you, but after a while, it's a chore to read the rest.

It's a must read."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Morrison's novel may be dramatic in the approach of this issue in recent readers' eyes because in today's society, but it is true that during the time that the novel was written that many young girls went through the issues described in this novel. The issues presented in the novel are presented both eloquently and accurately. I have noticed that some people believe that Morrrison is soley blaming white americans for the problems that the main character is experiencing, but in my opinion that is not the case. I believe she is advidly pointing out the idea that society has deemed more superior. This is a fault of both blacks and whites in society. So I do not feel that anyone should be offended by the author's words because they do not lay blame upon one race of people, but with society as a whole. On a different note I feel that the novel is very well written and the characters really reach the heart of the readers."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Well if I had started this when I was older I might have liked it.

Toni Morrison's perception of Pecola's oppression and ugliness make the reader feel sympathetic toward her. The book was unrealistic but a good read. It focused on the oppression of Pecola, her social and emotional weakness, and her brutal family life. I enjoyed the style of writing that Toni Morrison used, interchanging the seasons with telling the story of Pecola and her family, it is modern and it keeps the novel interesting. Pecola's physical ugliness and her belief in her ugliness encouraged me to look for my beauty on the inside rather than the outside. Her wanting of the bluest eyes in order to make her beautiful is an example of how her abusive past has created her denial for her inner self-beauty. Throughout the entire novel, Toni Morrison makes the reader feel sympathy for Pecola and her abusive family life, her ugliness and her non-existent social life. Her inability to comprehend her inner beauty inspires the reader to search him/herself. I believe it is a book suitable for mature age groups and levels of understanding."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"To be completely honest to Toni Morrison, I had no expectations for this book at all. The title sounded boring, the beginning was slow, and the words were a bit difficult. However, at the end I actually got a lot out of it, realizing that people view ohters many times for the wrong reasons. I never thought about the way people wished they looked like a certain person for just a few physical characteristics.The Bluest Eye, is a sad story about an ugly 11-year old black girl named Pecola Breedlove,who grows up surrounded by racism and heartbreak. The young girl and her friends go through many different hard ships and struggles because of racial descrimination. Pecola feels that by having blonde hair and blue eyes she will be noticed and accepted by society. On top of her being physically unattractive, her family is dysfunctional and poor. She feels her answer to all this is looking like Shirley Temple, or just having blonde hair blue eyes.This novel upset me because I do not view anyone by how they look. Like the saying goes, &quot;dont judge a book by its cover&quot;, I firmly believe in that. I have never, nor ever will chose a friend by how they look. A good personality is one of the greatest things in the world. When I finished reading this I was angry and depressed at the same time. I can understand how people feel when they are being stared at for their physical appearence. I was always one of ridicule because of how small I was,my red hair, and braces. But I had something that everyone should always look at first, a terrific personality. I would retaliate by lauging it off and then coming back with a nice comment myself about them. People respected me for who I was and how I made them feel, not just the way I looked.All together this book hit me emotionally, and really captured the prejudice that goes on everywhere. Morrison did an excellent job with this book and really surprised me at the end. I actually handed my mom the book and told her to read it. I don't do that very often, so she figured it must be good to keep my attention."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"After reading &quot;Beloved&quot;, I tried really hard to like this book, but just couldn't.

I'd encourage readers to try other Morrison books though, she has come a long way since this one."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I read this after hearing wonderful things about Toni Morrison's writing and knowing that she had been awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. I was very disappointed.I found very few redeeming qualities in the book and I had to consciously force myself to finish it. That is rarely the case with most books that I have read, and I only continued with it in the hopes that the book would start getting better. It never did.I did not find her story telling very compelling, I formed little interest or emotional attachments to the characters, and the crafting of words was nothing special. All in all, not a very memorable book.I do not know if this book is representative of Toni Morrison's entire body of work -- perhaps it is not. But, if it is, then I can honestly say there is little chance that I will read anything else by her again."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I am not a fan of Toni Morrison but the Bluest Eye is one of the most compelling and insightful novels of our time. Pecola's story is realistically brought to life and her struggle will resonate with even the most priveleged black woman and will open the eyes of those who have not walked in their shoes. A superb book."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Morrison's style, while easy to read, necessitates that her readers stop and think about what is really going on in the novel. It's possible to breeze through the book without giving the events much thought. But to truly grasp all the social and psychological hardships faced by the Breedlove family, the reader has to take time to analyze what he or she has just read. Reading Morrison is an experience. There's no other way to describe it."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I must admit, I truely wanted to believe Morrison's book would be a good book. Unfortunately, I was sadly disappointed. Other than Morrison's poetic nature, I didn't see anything that unique or profound. It was simply OK. This was the second chance I gave Morrison in winning me over. The first attempt at reading Jazz was a horrific undertaking. (Even Oprah doesn't try to defend it.) But still, I wanted to enjoy her work and tried The Bluest Eye. The only difference was that at least it was coherent and I could follow the plot. Personally, I find her interviews much more rich and fascinating. She should try writing a non-muddled autobiography."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I had a hard time putting this book down to get some sleep.

Sadness and pain that words cannot capture. Revealing the lie that beauty can be. Peeling back not only the layers of racism, but of society's obession with outer beauty, as some insane standard of what makes some one beautiful. And others worthless. Each page was read in silence with absolute care, absorbed in this girls search for blue eyes, so that her struggle became my own; Some were so painful that it took all energy to read on, but I did.

I felt like I was part of the little girl's life. Pecola, the protagonist,wanted something that she could never have. In this society, everyone wants to be liked and accepted. She thoughtthat if she had the bluest eyes, she would be beautiful and her life would be different. This book deals with racism andprejudice. The worst part about the situation is that the prejudice was done against a liitle black girl. The longing for blue eyes led her tobecome insane. Also, this book deals with how a little girl's life was changed by rape by her father. The book was well written.I can't even describe the impact it had on me. Every reader will be horrified by the type of life that Pecola had to live through.Toni Morrison tries to make the reader see the situation through a child's point of view.

Notice that I didn't say it was the worst; I said it was my least favorite. The difference is that I don't think it's a poorly written book, although I also don't think it's as brilliant as some people seem to think. The writing is very poetic, and if you like modern \\"literary\\" literature, you will almost certainly like this book. If you like to cut to the very soul of some deeply twisted characters, then this is the book for you.However, if, like me, you would prefer not to read poignantly vivid descriptions of incestuous rape, don't pick up this book. If you have any limits as to what degree of perversity you are willing to read in a book, this one definately crosses them. I'm not necessarily saying it's gratuitous, but it's still disgusting.If you want to read a Toni Morrison book without so much crude sexual imagery try Song of Solomon (mind you, there's still plenty in that, too, it's just not as graphic)."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"i thought that this book was pretty much ok, i liked her use of words, but i didn't like her style.

We did agree that Morrison writes vivid-- often graphic--descriptions that really give the reader a detailed mental image. The characters' dialect was also well-written and added to those vivid images. Morrison left us with a lot to think about as far as the black culture-- how blacks were treated and how they treated each other. The content of the book is very disturbing and therefore thought-provoking. After you read this book (whether you like it or not) you have to address the issues presented and how it affects you personally. Several in the group felt the organization of the book was confusing and detracted from the story. As Morrison writes in the afterword, we were touched but not moved because of this confusion. It is definitely a book that can be re-read. This book will have different meanings for everyone. If you are interested in black culture or the role and treatment of women, it's worth checking out.

Toni Morrison has no mastery over ther stream-of-consciousness technique, therfore, everything she writes sound fake and contrived. I'm not saying all books should be clean, or that they should all have clear plots and a classic narrative structure, I'm only asking that ifa writer deviates fromthe norn, they od it for a reason other than making themsleves look smart. Morrison has, to usea cliched but accurate phraser, the subtlety of a sledgehammer, whcih makes a less-than-bright reader feel smart and sophisticated when the can figure out the symbolism of an insane balck girl walking around flapping her arms.

I had the opportunity to use this novel for a class in African-American Literature. The characters are easily traced and understood. The symbols used in the book to portray actually realities of life were just striking. The development of the plot intriguing, flow of the storyline very captivating and intoxicating. Having read this novel several times, I have found it to be a dynamic story of reality based on fictional characters.The story in this novel of the Breedlove family in just simply amazing! Ironically, it is one without love, even though by virtue of the family's name one would assume love is involved. The only thing one finds there is no love.The moral of this novel brings several themes to light: First, that life is a struggle especially when one tries to maintain a quality of life in an environment that is hostile to his or her welfare. Secondly, it shows what happens to a female who lives in a family without love, while she is thirsty for love, and would love to be loved by others. Next, it shows how racial prejudice and self hatred affects a family and a person's self image.This excellent novel brings one to realize how the lack of opportunity, lack of intrinsic motivation, and feeling of inferiority affects a person's life, thus stunning the growth of the person. Toni Morrison brings these concepts of reality to life in a very interesting way in this novel.One must read this book to appreciate the story, images, conflicts, plot, and resolution. This is truly a classic example of life's situation one must avoid; however, others are unfortunately experiencing these conditions across the world as we speak.More about Toni Morrison at: [...]Submitted by \\"Epulaeryu Master.\\"Joseph S.

I came across the title of this book while reading an article in a magazine and decided to buy it. I'm really glad I did. Some of the old stereotypes and problems that existed in many black families/communities still, unfortunately, exist today. Toni Morrison awakens the critical need to build the self esteem in our youth, particularly, our young black girls, who will give birth to our future men and women.

Thus, my review is a little skewed. If I were to truly rate it, I'd probably give it three stars, but as a syllabus requirement, I enjoyed it enough to give it four stars. Reading the synopsis on the back of the book, I wasn't expecting much and I was pleasantly surprised. I do agree with other reviewers that the way the story is told is a little disjointed and aspects of the story and characters are underdeveloped. But I found the emotion was conveyed very effectively and I liked the way it was written. There's an elegant flow to Morrison's writing. Aside from some decisions with the plot and the slight disjointedness, one of the major things that bothered me about the story was the fact that I didn't believe it. Partially because I was reading it for a class, it never seemed real to me. I always felt like I was removed from the story, like Morrison was trying to make a point instead of depicting a narrative. Certain passages stick out sharply because they sound more like critical essays than part of the plot. It feels like she uses her characters to make her point instead of tell a story that's genuine to the people she's created. Still, the writing is strong enough that I think if you're also forced to read this for a class you might enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This is a very sad book, which provokes one to think about colour discrimination, mainly why is it still a problem?"},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The Bluest Eye is the first novel by American author Toni Morrison. It is set in 1941 in the small town of Lorain, Ohio, and tells the story of an 11-year-old Negro girl, Pecola Breedlove, who becomes pregnant to her father Cholly. Pecola's family and environment is such that she is certain she is ugly; so convinced of this is she, that she wishes for blue eyes, believing this is the only thing that will relieve her ugliness. Narrated in part by a 9-year-old neighbourhood girl, Claudia, the perspective of young girls in this situation is novel. Some chapters detail the history of Cholly and Mrs Breedlove, giving some clues as to how this crippled and crippling family evolved. This reissue of Morrison's first novel includes a new Forward by the author wherein she explains what she was trying to achieve. Some of the prose is quite stunning: \\"Love is never any better than the lover. Wicked people love wickedly, violent people love violently, weak people love weakly, stupid people love stupidly, but the love of a free man is never safe. There is no gift for the beloved.\\" The prose may be beautiful, but as a Dutch-born Caucasian living in Australia with a limited experience of the Negro, I found it difficult to relate to this book."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"After looking through Amazon's book selections I chose this book. I had heard of this book for a long time and when it was my turn to pick a book for our book club, it was my selection. Loved the book. I think that this book, though written in 1970, is relevant for today. Poverty, racism and how we see ourselves vs how we are seen in this world are still issues for today. It has large print and is an easy read. Much food for thought here."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Although some may question the fairness of it all, I holdwriters like Toni Morrison to a higher standard of critique thanothers. While many may become spellbound by the lyricism of her words, I read her work with the expectation of the warmth of a summer day. The power of her words has the strength of Atlas which are trained to penetrate the Achilles heel of humanity.This book tells all the secrets and opens all wounds. Morrison presents the stark naked psyche of all of the characters. There is a sense of multi-faceted simplicity. We see the rapist/child molesters, prostitutes and others beyond the scope of their actions. We see them as people who have been horribly scared and mutilated spiritually and mentally. Their transgressions places them outside the realm of good and evil because they have been denied their humanity. Excuses are not made or accepted but we are presented with the facts of their existence. This is not about material/physical vs. spiritual, yet the concept is present throughout the book.The overwhelming theme is LOVE. A lack of love, vicarious love, escapist love, etc. According to Morrison, \\"love is never better than the lover.\\" Pecola is a victim of love."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"\\"There is really nothing more to say- except why. But since why is difficult to handle one must take refuge in how.\\"The Bluest Eye is a story rooted in tragedy. Like many tragic stories, there is a great value one can learn from the painful out come. The highlight of the story is focused on a girl named Pecola Breedlove. This novel attempts to ask \\"how\\" instead of \\"why\\" to observe Pecola's life and the effect of her background on her life, and the part it played in causing her tragedy.*Spoiler Warning* Spoiler Warning*Pecola yearns for blue eyes. She prays every night for a year to get blue eyes. She believed that if her eyes were blue, she will look beautiful. As a result, she will have friends who won't hurt her, and her own family will live in peace. Her wish for blue eyes is a reflection of the nature of the society she was living in. She lives in Lorrain, Ohio, in which beauty is measured by skin color. Most people thought that white is beautiful and black is ugly. Since they considered blackness ugly, Pecola thought that she was ugly, and ugly people do not get respected by others.Morrison delivers a message to the readers that the beauty is misunderstood by many communities. Beauty is being damaged. She states that \\"Beauty was not simply something to behold; it was something one could do.\\"Pecola gets raped by her alcoholic father, becomes a victim of his violent behavior and gets pregnant. Pecola delivers a dead baby, and decides to go to Soaphead Church, a pedophilic fortune-teller, to ask him for blue eyes. Soaphead Church sends Pecola in a little mission to kill a dog that he abhors. She thinks that this task will transforms her eyes color into blue eyes. When Pecola completes the task, the dog dies in a frightening way. Pecola loses her mind as a result of the horrifying incident of the dog, and believes that she had obtained \\"the bluest eye\\".Pecola creates an imaginary friend, and spend her time talking to him. She becomes obsessed and repeatedly asks him if her eyes where the bluest of any one living. Pecola endures the rest of her life as a madwoman. Morrison connects this part of the story with the false social construction of beauty, which is created by the imaginary world of media and supermodels.Toni Morrison is truly one of the best authors, whom I learned about her work through Oprah's book club online. Her writing style does not only follow an extraordinary technique, but it is also a very inspiring and touching method. Morrison is a winner of the 1993 Noble Prize Award for Literature."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The theme of racial discrimination between Blacks and Whites in America is often issued by authors but their texts seldom contain such a violent brutality.Toni Morrison describes a young black girl named Pecola that grows up in the lowest social class in the society at that time. Her family situation underlines the clich&eacute; of dirty black people: Her father is an alcoholic that beats his wife who works for a white rich family and seems to love their blond, cute, curly haired girl more than her own children.As a consequence Pecola does not find her place in the world and feels because of her outer appearance disliked. The fact that she gets raped by his father and her wish of blue eyes to be beloved by the adults concludes a girl that goes mad in the end.Toni Morrison uses a very colloquial language that is at first for me, as my mother language is not english, difficult to understand but second I also do not like this style of writing. In my opinion, there are too many violent and even pornographic scenes for example when Pecolas father sleeps for the first time with a girl or when she gets raped. This is only disgusting and these explicit describtions are not necessary to underline the message the author wants to make.Obviously, this book is important for black literatur but for me it was not very interesting to read. It is just nearly the same as in all books containing the black/white conflict where the Whites are the bad boys and the Blacks have to suffer under them. Even Pecolas father who is so cruel to his environment behaves only like that because he is made by the Whites to the person he is.I had high expectations before I read this novel because of the Nobel Prize of Literature it won but unfortunately they did not get fulfilled."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"'The bluest eye' was Toni Morrison's debut novel, and it was first published in 1970.'The bluest eye' is a tragic, heartbreaking story. We meet the 11-year-old black girl Pecola Breedlove, and her world - filled with hatred and racism. Her story is not a happy one - her brothers have run away from home, and her drunkard father has sexually abused her. Pecola believes that if she only had blonde hair and blue eyes, all her other problems will go away'The characters are all very well developed, and one has to care deeply for them. The symbolism is easy to understand, and Morrison's prose is beautiful, subtle, and unique.This is a novel that leaves you thinking, wondering about the world we live in.Toni Morrison has quite rightfully won both the Pulitzer and the Nobel Prize. 'The bluest eye', was the third novel I read by Toni Morrison. Honestly, 'The bluest eye' is not her masterpiece (I think that the book 'Song of Solomon' is her best novel) but it is certainly worth reading!An enjoyable read!"},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"According to the Amazon review, Toni Morrison expressed unhappiness with this book. She was right. It's a depressing trip through the hell that is one girl's life and it's not the brightest girl in the world either. She is there for people to do things to and you never learn much about except that she has dreams of having the bluest eyes even though she's black.Basically she is internalizing the anger and the hatred around her.This is the kind of book you read in college classes for an example of how racism and sexism messes with people's minds. It's got nice style, but it's pretty forgettable.Read anything else by Toni Morrison. She is an amazing and brilliant author and her books just get better with repeated readings. I might not dislike this book so much if there wasn't such a consistant high standard in her other works.Buy it only if you need to complete your Toni Morrison collection. Like I said in the title of this review. It is short so you'll only spend a week or two on it at most. I think I read my copy in 2 hours."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Thirty years after it first appeared, it's a challenge to view Toni Morrison's debut through Oprah-colored lenses. Here's the brutality, the bleakness, and the domestic abuse that have become the stock-in-trade of every talk-show host in creation--and, seemingly, half the writers. Doesn't &quot;The Bluest Eye&quot; seem relatively tame? And doesn't the author hit the requisite feminist nail right on the head? The answer to both questions is no. This is much too strange and shocking a book to be stuffed into any ideological pigeonhole, and Morrison's subject--the ways in which we are deformed by pain, envy, and suffering--is, sad to say, a timeless one. &quot;The Bluest Eye&quot; is also a superb piece of small-town portraiture, which would have made fellow Ohioan Sherwood Anderson gasp with pleasure or faint with shock or perhaps both. And finally, it's a tremendous work of literary art, with Morrison hitting all the lyrical, indignant, sorrowful, scarifying notes as though this were her fifteenth and not first published work."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"In the first pages of her first novel, Morrison sets out the themes and characters she will pursue in each of her novels: mother, father, child, home ,village, love, beauty, friendship, nature, property, earth, scapegoat, pariah, history, nature, belief, magic, the act of naming. Her themes are her themes: flight, the journey, family, friendship, violence, paradoxes of good and evil, world of black society: its code, its superstitions. The ancestor. The tar-quality of women. Her main characters always have childhoods. She uses everything available to her: awesome intellect, rich imagination, liberal education, the way she was reared. She uses fable, song, myth. Masks and names. Clich&eacute;s. She gives voice to everything that might have voice. Responsibilities and choices confront the characters and us. Presences and absences. Her sentences, her stories are comprised of what is said and what is not said. Not victim literature, although there are victims; she does not come to the page to grind axes. Rather, she aims at things not being, &quot;Quiet as it's kept... .&quot; Forced to the extremes of life, her characters survive or don't survive and their stories show how they do or don't survive and do or don't find the resources to live &quot;intensely and well.&quot; She creates a world that includes rather than excludes, one where much is tolerated and &quot;The End&quot; is just a stopping point and does not close off possibility. In a sense, The Bluest Eye introduces a musical line, the melody, of a jazz composition, expressive, flexible, various, full of call and response like gospel or worksong, bluesy, vocal, replete with spaces to be filled by the instrument that is the reader. The sense of always beginning. Reading Morrison's fiction is a participatory event. From the first word of this first novel -- &quot;Here is the house&quot; -- she asks us to put our sure senses of self, our belief in what we surely know, at risk in order the enter the worlds she creates and be present in the action."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"As someone who was unfamiliar with Morrison's work before reading this book, I can't wait to read some of her other books. This story follows Pecola Breedlove through the trials she faces because of her looks. Her quest for beauty in a racially prejudiced world and the destruction it ulitmately leads her to is both sad and understandable. There are so many forces working against this child that she cannot possibly overcome all of them and while reading the book, my heart just went out to this tiny victim of a society that has such a narrow view of human worth. Morrison's prose is poetic in its description and also at times horrifyingly detailed while she brings this horrible situation to life. A must read for anyone going into teaching or professions dealing with adolescents."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"In the past, I put off reading Toni Morrison because of her style of writing. I think that during the time, I might not have been ready for her style of writing since I was fairly young. But, recently, after hearing praises of it, i decided to give The Bluest Eye a chance. I must say that it was not as difficult as I thought it would be. As a matter of fact, it was fairly easy. The message of a young, black girl's struggle for beauty in a modern society was a common one, but I agree with a reader that mentioned that Morrison failed to emphasize on plot. Most of the story involved background information that was not really relevant to the main character, Pecola. I wished that Morrison would have revealed to the reader more of Pecola's thoughts to give the novel a stronger message. Nonetheless, Morrison is a gifted writer and the powerful message at the end of the plot is evidence of her brillance."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book changed my life.

Not only that, but the ways in which we sacrifice that power we hold as individuals to use our words and the actions they inspire to do good, for ourselves and others. An excellent commentary on the ways in which the worlds we create for ourselves often resemble the hell we imagine surrounds us."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Toni Morrison's breakout novel is very straightforward regarding the horrors of racism and its results. &quot;The Bluest Eye&quot; is an informative, eye-opening novel along the lines of Ralph Ellison's &quot;Invisible Man,&quot; portraying a similar state of jaw-dropping depravity and psychological warping on the part of the victims of racial discrimination, even though the plots and characters of the two novels are drastically different. However, though Morrison's novel is not nearly as long as &quot;Invisible Man,&quot; and she deals more with the female black community rather than the male, both novels achieve a deep sense of gloom, majorly due to the heavy subject matter dealt with. In &quot;Bluest Eye,&quot; Pecola Breedlove is beaten, homeless, teased, ugly, and raped not once, but twice by her own alcoholic father. Her obsession with trying to earn blue eyes-- so that she can have the love that is lavished on blond, blue-eyed girls-- drags her down into the depths of insanity. Certainly a well-written, knowledgable, and absorbing book, but it is not for someone looking for a light read. This novel should definitely be read, but beware the side-effect of melancholy and depression that is sure to ensue."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I chose to read this novel for a feminst class that I had taken. I absolutly loved it. I enjoy how Morrison used the seasons of Pecola's life to document this story, it shows how children look at the important times in their life. I found this novel so interesting, but also sad. I think that Morrison writes in such a way that you can feel compassion for all the characters, even Cholly. I understood why he was so dysfunctional but it does not excuse his actions. The whole beauty theme is so important in our society today, the lenghs that young women go to be beautiful are both dangerous and unessasary, they can also destroy you. I also appriated the fact that Pecola did not really have a voice in this novel, everything we knew about her came from mostly Calduia. I wish for Pecola's sake the ending could have been different &amp; she could have overcome all the obstacles in her way, but I know that would have defeated the purpose of this novel."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The Bluest Eye is a realistic account of what could happen to poor black children living in the deep south in the early 20th century. Toni Morrison includes many details, which are necessary to make the reader feel like he is in the setting. The subjects the book deals with are very serious and mature. I believe the book is overall a decent book as far as plot structure, description, and basic story imaginativity. But as far as liking the book, I didn't enjoy how everything was so sad, and depressing. But I am the type of person who likes more adventurous and exciting books. I am not sorry I read it."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Review of Toni Morrison's The Bluest EyeImagine yourself a young, unattractive black girl in Ohio in 1941. Imagine that your only wish in life was to have blue eyes and for people to notice you. This is what you find in the book's main character, Pecola Breedlove. The book focuses on Pecola's unfortunate young life. She wishes for a life completely opposite than the one she is born into. I felt that Morrison's use of plot in this book helped to keep the book from being a pity-party for Pecola. Her actual rape and pregnancy by her father isn't mentioned until after it happens chronologically in the book. You do feel sorry for the poor young foster child that everyone thinks is terribly ugly, but for those reasons. She was a foster child and she was ugly. You don't learn the reason her parents are gone until the mention of the rape. Her use of plot keeps the reader interested to see what type of family life she did have and what made her become a foster child in the first place. When I first looked at The Bluest Eye, it looked like very easy reading, but I was wrong. There are many well-hidden messages throughout the pages of this book. Some of which may include that beauty is in the eye of the beholder or that if you think you are beautiful, you are. Once Pecola thinks that she does actually have blue eyes, her happiness is seen through her conversation with her imaginary friend. She feels that people stare at her now because they are jealous, not because they are gawking at her ugliness. This book contains very adult-orientated situations and probably wouldn't be suitable for younger readers. However, I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in a book that will toy with your emotions and make you realize how lucky you are to have lived the childhood that you did."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The writing in this book amazed me, I actully at points felt what each person was feeling. Some of the people in the book were written about very well.I read this book after seeing it on Oprahs lest and would recommend it to anyone.The only reason it got 4 stars was because there were a few times that I had to go back and reread a few sections to fully understand what was going."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Toni Morrison tends to get too wordy for my taste. She tends to loose me in her need to be artful in her writing. If this is her &quot;less mature&quot; writing, I prefer it. It was a really nicely written book about many sad characters. It was not a happy book in any way. It was a portrait of a time and of the people caught in that time. It was a very dark story- sober by design- and not something one would read at the beach for a little entertainment. If you are interested in issues that faced the black community then(and maybe still), it probably has some historical significance. A thought provoking, but clearly-not-for-everyone read."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I guess, after reading what the book was going to be about (an 11 year old black girl wanting blue eyes), I expected a lot more of Pecola in the book than I got. However, after reading the entire book, I feel that Toni Morrison wanted us to know all of the people around Pecola who influenced her life. The story actually starts at the end but then, through her family and friends, you get filled in on what actually happened to Pecola. I loved the way the author allows you to get inside the head of some of the people in her life (her mother and father, for instance) because it allows you to understand why they act the way they do. This was an enjoyable book that was definitely thought provoking as well."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Our newly formed book club selected &quot;The Bluest Eye&quot; as our first book and, without exception, our members gave this book 5 stars.

Comments from book club members include:&quot;The main lesson I learned from the book is to focus on people and look beyond the surface layer.&quot;&quot;The beauty of the language was the one thing that kept me most involved in the book. Morrison is a true poet.&quot;&quot;The true magic of Morrison's writing is her ability to create memorable characters.&quot;It is my sincere hope that our future selections will be as thought provoking and beautifully written as this book.

I had heard that Toni Morrison, although a brilliant author, is a little hard to understand. And there's nothing I hate more than wading through a book full of abstract poetic descriptions and thick symbolism that goes right over my head. Despite all this, I pulled up my bootstraps and dived right in. What was to follow was quite a surprise.The Bluest Eye tell the story of the Breedloves, a poor black family living in Lorain, Ohio in the early 1940s. Each chapter tells something different -- the journey of the dad, Cholly, from curious young boy to a drunk and unloving father; the history of the mother, Pauline, and her dreams of movie stars and romance; and the childhood of the children, Sammy and Pecola, and how they deal with life as they've been given. Full of hardships and unfairness, the Breedloves have been through tough times most of their lives. And young Pecola's wishes of blue eyes and blonde hair in order to be loved and respected by others is a testament to the unjust world they lived in.My fear is that this review won't do the book justice. There is so much written here that left me with feelings of sadness and horror, but also of hope -- hope that our world now has moved on from the racism of the past and will eventually surpass it. The Bluest Eye is highly moving and sensitive, and written in an addictive easy and lyrical style. I may have missed an important part of the book, any underlying symbolism or meaning that Toni Morrison was trying to convey -- I don't know. All I do know is The Bluest Eye is a darn good story, and I'm extremely glad I read it."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The Bluest Eye, the story of a young girl's tortured life, is not a story you can &quot;like&quot;. It reads like your worst nightmares, very disturbing and very graphic. It takes a strong stomach to get through this novel. But, this is just what makes the book a masterpiece, that Ms Morrison can draw such powerful feelings from readers. Toni Morrison has grown as a writer. But this book, her first, takes you to a world most didn't know existed and evokes almost unbearably strong emotions. A must read for lovers of great literature. This is not a book you read for pleasure. It's a book you read for the power of the written word."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Like all of Morrison's work, Bluest Eye is beautifully crafted. It follows a more clearly linear path than most of her more recent writings. But (as is appropriate for its subject matter) it doesn't have the sense of redemption or spiritual uplift that graces much of her other books, especially Song of Solomon. Read it, learn from it and appreciate it, but don't count on it to cheer you up."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I was assigned this book nine years ago during a women's literature class. The story moved me in ways that I can't explain. I grew up in a solidly middle class (primarily white) community, and Toni Morrison introduced me to a little girl who was simply foreign. I was haunted by The Bluest Eye. Bits and pieces of the story would come to mind at odd times over the next year or so, until finally I decided to visit the small town in Ohio where The Bluest Eye is based. So, about 7 years ago, I made that trip. Now each time that I re-read the book (probably twenty times over the past nine years) I have a very solid picture in my mind of where this story unfolds. I remember when Oprah first chose a Toni Morrison book for her club -- I believe it was Song of Solomon. I said at that time (and actually noted it in my Amazon.com review) that she should introduce America to the Bluest Eye. Thank you, Oprah."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Like many of you, I to read Toni Morrison's Song of Solomn first. After reading this one I wanted to find out more about her. So my boss gave me The Bluest Eye. I'm not an avid reader, but I read it in a couple of days.It's a very sad and hauting story of the destruction of a little black girls spirit and soul. She longed to have blue eyes or anything that would bring about love and attention that she so desperately wanted. Yet society and even her mother could not love her unless she had these &quot;Blue Eyes&quot;.The theme of this book touches on so many social issues. From self loathing and hatred of being born black in a white world to the effects of child abuse from both parents. Many people may not aggree with me that the mother also abused her child, but she did. She allowed herself to become so wrapped up with taking care of a little blue eyed child that she has nothing left for her own family when she comes home. Her words are always harsh and scolding to Pecola. Never soothing and loving. She has left her poor Pecola to fend against the world for herself. And when Pecola needs her mother's help the most it's not there.I think every mother should read this book. Step away from the characters and see the destruction of a child from lack of love and acceptance. You will remember Pecola's journey forever!"},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I so wanted to love this book. Oprah spoke of it in a way that I could not wait to read it. I started it a day that I was alone and I had the entire day to relish it. I must say I was disappointed and confused. I felt that the book told of too many characters and not all of them connected to Pecola. The character Soaphead Church disgusted me and I see no need for him in the story. I wanted to feel her desire for &quot;blue eyes&quot; but it seemed to just be grazed over. I was touched by the lives of these little girls but I was not moved by the story. I felt that there was alot of the story missing and I was yearning for it by the end of the book. I felt left hanging and sad with many questions unanswered."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"There is a problem with this book: the cover shows the portrait of a young African-American girl. Assuming this is a representation of the protagonist, the reader is immediately at a loss. The reader forms, whether he or she wants to or not, a mental picture (or, at least an outline) of the main character simply by looking at the front.One of the most important elements to this marvellous work is that we are never allowed a full glimpse of the young girl. She is described, and given a voice, from the narrator, and those that are around her -- but never afforded her own. And it is here that we begin to understand the meaning of the title, &quot;The Bluest Eye.&quot;I believe that I was fortunate to buy this book in the European market; the cover only contains the image of blue marbles -- there is no face, nor should there be. For this is the story of the loss of identity, the futile attempt to perceive from others' perspectives, the dying of a culture and heritage, and the hope that something good can be found when it's very hard to see."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This is the first book that I read by Toni Morrison and I realized instantly that she was an incredible writer who was burning with life. I have now read almost every published Morrison book, but this remains my favorite. Why? Because, like many first novels (&quot;The Bluest Eye&quot; is more novella in length) it is intensely personal and passionate. The story is sad enough to make you cry, yet not without hope. What makes it so amazing for me is its near poetry quality. There are passages that are nearly verse in their beauty and essentialness, meanwhile Morrison slowly brings them home and turns them to her poignant commentary and compassionate telling of eleven-year-old Pecola Breedlove's tragic dream. Wow! Just writing about it makes me want to go pull the book off its shelf and start reading it again. Great insight into the Southern black experience. Blanket and tissue recommended."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I was surprised to see this book on Oprah's list since I had read it a few years ago.

It is a finely written book and brings the reader insight into another way of life. Oprah made a fine choice in selecting this book; it deserves to be widely read.

I seePecola in the mirror everyday, and more importantly, I see her in myclassroom. When are we going to realize beauty is not determined byeye color or the color of our skin or hair? It is not about whatclothes we wear or the size we fit into. This story did not have a&quot;happy ending&quot;....

Beauty is still being dictated by those who are narrow minded. The story flows with lyrical grace. Miss Morrison writing style in this book shows the beginnings of the style she has so very much mastered in Beloved and Paradise. Pecola Breedlove's melancholy, and the way it is portrayed shows the situation a lot of people who feel rejected are going through today. The saddest thing about the The Bluest Eye is the idea of resigning yourself to what destiny has planned for you even though you can do something about it to make your life better. The best thing is you get to think about what happens to people if you keep on putting them down... so be kind!"},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Toni Morrison's The Bluest Eye, I can safely say, is my favorite novel of all time. It's depressing, complex, and downright tragic as an innocent little girl is destroyed by a vicious society set on convincing her that she is both ugly and worthless. Through a brutal rape by her own father, Pecola's life is ruined as her childhood is permanently destroyed and the one pathetic hope that keeps her alive is her strong desire for blue eyes.Morrison refuses to depict this story in chronological order, as the narrator explains that it is not the \\"why\\" that we are able to answer but rather the \\"how.\\" With that in mind, Morrison quickly summarizes the story and then dives in to the analysis of how this little girl's tragedy was made possible. We, as readers, are then opened up to a broader explanation of not merely this girl's tragedy on an isolated, individual level. Rather, she is the physical manifestation of the psychological problems faced by African-Americans living in a hostile society that told them they were inferior. Pecola's problems are slightly mirrored from those considered at the high ranks of black society (Geraldine), all the way to black society's most tragic victims (the Breedloves). Morrison refuses to allow the reader to simply pity Pecola's mindset. Instead, she forces us, no matter the background or race, to feel guilty. We, a society that has not yet completely embraced people from all portions of our community, are completely responsible for her downfall. Because, Morrison argues, in a world that continually controls us into believing that all minorities are inferior, we have left her to suffer.But Toni Morrison doesn't stop there, a point that would already label The Bluest Eye as an amazing novel. Morrison expands the picture from psychological racism into a rarely considered topic of psychological sexism. All of the main female characters in this story are in some shape or form sexually assaulted by the dominant male figures. Morrison brilliantly expands the picture to fearlessly explore sexism and how it has damaged the psyche of our nation's society.I won't lie, I was initially disgusted by several of the scenes in this novel, the main one being a brutal rape described in great detail. But I realized that this book was meant to horrify me and open my eyes to what Morrison was exposing. The book is incredibly complex, so it deserves your utmost attention. I can not overrate this book; you must read it."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This was the first book I've read by Toni Morrison, and it did not disappoint. The story takes place in Ohio in the early 1940s - before the Civil Rights era, before Martin Luther King, Jr., and before Rosa Parks ever stayed seated on the bus. The story is told mainly from the focus from a young black girl about another young black in the neighborhood. The other black girl, Pecola Breedlove, comes from a family that is poor with a father who is an alcoholic. Pecola is considered ugly and her greatest wish is to have blue eyes, as she firmly believes this will make her beautiful.Naturally, the story involves much more than this, and Toni Morrison weaves a story that catches the reader up from the very first words and doesn't release them until the final page is turned. Ultimately, the idea of self-loathing is plainly seen - not just within Pecola, but within an entire community, an entire race. Pecola's story is not a pleasant read, yet it is difficult not feel a tenderness for this child. She begs to be nurtured.Many people who saw me reading this book told me it was a \\"black\\" book, but I disagree. The idea of self-loathing - either within oneself or within a community - is not specific to any one group of people, to my way of thinking. However, Toni Morrison has so captured the feelings and forced the reader to face them, that this book speaks to any and all who opens the pages. No child should be made to feel they are less simply because of who they are.A very moving book, highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I read this book when I was in seventh or eighth grade, and I read it again as a senior in high school. I will never forget those feelings of wanting to be white with blonde hair and blue eyes so my teacher would not be afraid to touch my hair, or at least tell me I was pretty. The first high end black doll I had was a PJ sparkle (that's way back in 1989). I am sure others existed before that, like the cabbage patch but I can't remember what mine looked like, and besides when those hit the market, my family could not afford one. Every character in the book, I have known in my own family. I am in this book. The message is so powerful. Every African-American girl should read this book. Men should too, but particularly the women."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"For my AP English class I read \\"The Bluest Eye\\" by Toni Morrison. I really liked this book. The style of writing by Morrison was different than most books that I have read in the past. She used a language that made the reader feel sorry for all the characters in the book. The book, however, was a mixture of angst, sadness, and truth. The characters that Morrison included were so innocent and unknowing of the world. When they finally experience it they are overcome with shock. The story is based around eleven year old Pecola Breedlove who is placed in the home of Claudia and Frieda MacTeer. All Pecola wants is blue eyes so that everyone will think she is beautiful instead of ugly. The MacTeer's befriend Pecola and become her only friends because her own family hates her. When her father rapes Pecola, the two girls find out that Pecola is pregnant and have no clue as to what to think. They finally decide that they want the baby to be ok so that they are able to validate their own blackness.

However, it is not a book for the faint of heart and the ending isn't &quot;...and they all lived happily ever after.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"n her powerful novel The Bluest Eye, Toni Morrison expertly uses complex symbols, diction, and folklore combined with superstition to emphasize the necessity of taking pride in one's race. For instance, Morrison creates innumerable symbols to chronicle the spiritual deterioration of Pecola, a young and destitute black girl. Everyone in her community sees her as a pitifully ugly girl with a tarnished family history. Pecola, recognizing the other's disdain for her, prays for blue eyes. To her blue eyes represent the essence of white beauty and possess the ability to solve all of her problems. However, as the novel progresses, blue eyes come to symbolize myriad evils including jealousy, hubris, and most importantly, self-loathing. Thus, Pecola abandons her blackness and consequently herself for the unobtainable. Tragically, Pecola's hopeless obsession grows from her mother's worship of beauty. When Pecola's mother Pauline first marries she finds that she \\"had known there was so much laughter in the world\\"(116). However, when Pauline, who places a tremendous amount of respect in beauty, loses her front tooth, her life turns to shambles. The tooth mirrors Pauline, and the \\"brown speck...which sat on the enamel for months and grew...finally eating away to the root...\\" which caused the tooth to fall represents how her overwhelming fixation on appearances rot her soul. As a result of this, Pecola grows up in an environment in which her mother looks at her ugly face in disgust therefore making her wish for beauty. Profound symbols permeate the novel in such a way that nearly possesses an underlying message. Morrison's meticulous use of diction also elucidates the crucial relationship between one's self and one's ethnicity. For example, Pecola's father Cholly also plays a significant role in her loss of spirit. While still a young man, Cholly's father publicly disowns him. As Cholly's background slips through his fingers, the pain and humiliation cause him to psychologically return to the womb. Diction such as \\"like a baby\\", \\"fetal position\\", \\"no sound, no sight, only darkness and heat\\", \\"enclosed Cholly like the skin and flesh\\", \\"crawled\\" and \\"water's beginnings\\" all serve to vividly describe this journey(187-158). Because of this incident, Cholly now can simultaneously have adult and immature feelings. This weakness later leads to him paternally love his daughter while raping her at the same time. Furthermore, both folklore and superstition accentuate how one must recognize his race in order to be a complete person. One of the novel's narrators, the young Claudia, wholeheartedly believes in superstitions and old wives' tales. Bored, Claudia finds herself examining \\"the white spots on my fingernails. The total signified the number of boyfriends I would have. Seven.\\"(27). Likewise, when Claudia discovers that her older sister Frieda has been sexually assaulted she conjures up the mental image of Frieda as a \\"big and fat\\" blob, \\"her face surrounded by layers of rouged tears\\"(101). In order to prevent the weight gain that comes from being \\"ruined\\", Pecola and Frieda set out to find some whiskey(101). Their complete faith in these unsubstantiated myths portray the innocence of childhood. On the other hand, Pecola never believes in any of this nonsense because she had denounced her heritage. Thus, she never delights in the entertainment silly superstitions and communal folklore brings. Instead, Pecola chooses to steadfastly deify those blue eyes and destroy herself. Clearly, through innumerable symbols, captivating diction, and folklore paired with superstition, Morrison strengthens her purpose of causing the reader to personally analyze whether or not he takes enough pride in his ethnicity."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The Bluest Eye, Toni Morrison's first novel, is redolent with imagery and the richness of language that her later books also reveal. We discover, through the eyes of children, the heartbreaking story of Pecola Breedlove, an eleven year old Black girl whose physical ugliness shapes her place in the world. Shunned by her classmates and made fun of, she is befriended by two sisters who feel sorry for her and set about trying to change the course of her life. Pecola's lack of beauty is an extension of her family which has no unity and no core of values to lean on. Her longing for blue eyes suggests her craving for the beauty that exists for all the blond and blue-eyed children and explains her love of Shirley Temple and similar stars, but deep inside, reveals the tragic lack of self-love and the almost universal belief of her times that Black was not beautiful. When a devastating event shakes her entire world, Pecola tries to maintain her equilibrium with her belief that her eyes will really turn blue. However, the changes that occur, are far less attractive and incredibly more destructive. As with all her books, Toni Morrison has created a poetic, if tragic, view of the world. In Pecola's life we can experience the tragedy of not having a true place in life, and share the shattering of disillusionment that can only be felt in childhood."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The following is an excerpt from a paper I once wrote on this same book. It shows how Toni Morisson creates a perfect example of existing - then and now - social hierarchy with her book and also shows how women were victimized by society:&quot;Pecola...has been deemed ugly by society. Being ugly, as well as black during the early 1940's, was a sure way to lose any chance of power in the social hierarchy. Pecola, having constantly been bombarded with images of perfection in movies and in baby dolls, has been constructed to believe that the way to be loved is to have blue eyes; after all, all the prettiest girls have blue eyes. So she prays for God to give her blue eyes. This type of wish is unattainable, but in Pecola's mind, she sees it as a solution to her problems. Not only will it result in her finally becoming accepted by a society which shuns her, but it will stop the constant fighting between her parents since &quot;'[They] musn't do bad things in front of those pretty eyes.'&quot; In the end of the work, she believes that her prayer has paid off, since she believes she has blue eyes. In reality, her traumatic existence has caused her to hallucinate a self which constantly tells her how pretty her eyes are, and she begins to see blue eyes when she looks in the mirror. She thinks it his her pretty blue eyes which cause people to stare as she walks past; it does not occur to her that they stare because she is pregnant with her father's child. Those around her, even her friends begin to avoid her, and she eventually loses all contact with the world around her. Morisson shows that Pecola is a victim of the social hierarchy. Living in a world which seemingly has no place for those who do not meet the beauty standard, she is without a purpose, and is therefore devastated. Her constant struggle to survive in the hierarchy results in her eventual demise. The stereotypes of American pop culture of the period (early 1940's before America's involvement in the war), including Shirley Temple and the like, have constructed the vast majority of people, including Pecola herself, to accept only the girls with blonde hair and blue eyes as truly beautiful. The only character who fights this stereotype is the young Claudia, and even she admits to eventually learning to love the stereotype that Shirley Temple creates. Ironically, people of this time are against Hitler's crusade to create the Aryan master race, yet they are contributing to this ideal themselves by submitting to the social hierarchy the culture around them has created. The work also shows how women were treated by society as a whole. It shows us a world where women are expected to be subordinate to their husbands, are responsible for cooking, cleaning, and taking care of children, and are expected to have little social identity outside of their houses. Another interesting aspect of ideas on women of the time is that most of the women possessed little sexual identity, and shared the marital bed simply to tend to their husbands needs. In fact, the female identity as a whole is suppressed, and the only females that seem to have any true sense of identity in this work are the prostitutes whom Pecola befriends.Well, I hope someone found this interesting and/or helpful. This book is an awesome character study, and Morrison does a fantastic job of describing just how horrid a life these characteres lead. I personally think that the book is a must read for anyone interested in women's or african-american studies and should definitely be read. While I am glad that the book, as being part of Oprah's bok club, will reah more readers, it disappoints me to think that the only reason people are reading it is because Oprah tells them to. sad Really."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"When you are in a supermarket and you see a woman slap a two year old in the face, simply for wandering off, as most two year olds do, what do you do?? When you see a father in the dead of winter with a half-covered newborn in his arms, what do you do?? When you see a child eating out of a dumpster, what do you do?? When you watch a &quot;Feed the Children&quot; broadcast, what do you do?? Do you shake your head with pity?? Do you breathe a heavy sigh of frustration?? Do you change the channel, and try to forget what you saw?? What's even more shameful than what's transpiring with the neglect and abuse of our children, is the attitude of the witnesses of this neglect and abuse. Do we overlook it all, in pent-up anger,because no one helped us when we went through the same things as children?? Do we pretend that our family is the only family that we should be concerned with, even though we spend more time interacting with others on a daily basis, than we do our own family?? At first, I really couldn't grasp the concept of how and why Toni Morrison chose to talk around Pecola Breedlove the way she did, meaning, even though Pecola was the main character of the novel, she is often mentioned like a reflection that had almost been forgotten. Morrison's purpose in doing so is to express how disenfranchised the community was with the abuse of Pecola, the neglect of Pecola, and eventually, the destruction of Pecola. The community shook their heads, breathed heavy sighs of frustration, and walked away. Not once, was this child made to feel she mattered; not at home and definitely not in her community. But she grew up to see who did matter; those blue-eyed white people who looked the very opposite of herself. The community cared deeply about pleasing the people with the blue eyes. They didn't exactly live in her community, but they certainly mattered more than she did. The Bluest Eye asked many significant questions, but I feel the most essential one was, &quot;DO YOU MIND?? When you see the injustices of your community, occur day after day,DO YOU MIND?? And if you do mind, what do you do?? Do you allow the Pecola Breedlove's of the world to suffer until madness or even death transpires?? The shaking of the head is a universal sign of refusal and/or denial. The longer we refuse to help Pecola and deny that her problem is our own, our children will never cease to grow up as incomplete adults. So Morrison's message to us seems to be, &quot;Let's come together as a community and let the Pecola Breedlove's of our communities know that they do matter to us.&quot;GOD BLESS,Tamara"},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This is a wonderful novel to read and understand. The characters are outstanding. It was used for a class taken by me in African-American Literature. The storyline is easy to follow. The symbols used in the book are striking. I have read the book several times and still find it an excellent novel to read."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I have to say, I actually made myself finish this book. I am not sure why. I guess I wanted to say &quot;I actually finished THIS Toni Morrison novel&quot;. I have decided that her writing is just not the type of style I prefer (ie: Paradise). She is a deep and emotional thinker which is great, but she tends to get very wordy and overly descriptive, and I find myself skimming over stuff...not a sign of an interesting book to me.I wanted to feel compassion for the little girl with the horrible life, but Morrison never really let you hear her &quot;voice&quot;. I was bombarded with every one elses story and I found myself sitting there thinking &quot;I don't really care that much about this person&quot;...&quot;tell me more about the MAIN character&quot;!I find that many people loved this book, and it really could have had more potential for me as an interesting story about a troubled child. But all in all, the book left me flat, and wishing I could just get it over with...was it too deep or just plain boring? I am not sure.Sorry...but this was not one of my favorite &quot;Oprah Club&quot; books. I preferred White Oleander (of a similar genre: troubled child)"},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Toni Morrison has the uncanny knack for taking simple stories and making them wonderously, 'humanly' complex. What starts off as a clever incisive comment on how life is interpreted by different people quickly becomes a conversation between the characters and the reader. What we learn as the reader almost becomes a secret as the amazingly natural speech patterns leave the mouth of Pecola. She is an extraordinarily human character. A trait quite often missing from characters in literature today. From the nightmares of the life that exists around her - the cat swinging passage made me cringe - to the little bits of hope that exist in her thoughts we are taken on a journey as she becomes involved with Pauline, Cholly, Sam, Frieda, Claudia, Mrs. Breedlove and Junior. A journey far from many of our lives but a journey that shows that when it comes down to it we all strive for the same thing. We all want to be the very best we can. We want to try and show courage. We want to try and be happy. It is a true Morrison journey through and through. Human as human can be.As an aside however, what is Oprah doing? Isn't the purpose of a book club to broaden reading habits and patterns? Toni Morrison is a great author! But should another (the third) of her books be chosen? I don't know and while I loved The Bluest Eye I just get a bit disappointed when Oprah takes an opportunity to expose readers all around the world to new talent (note Sheri Reynolds and A. Manette Ansay) and lets it pass her by by selecting books that I would have thought many of her viewers would have already read."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I was expecting something a little different based on the review Oprah gave the book on her show. However, although I found myself engrossed until the end I was disappointed because I expected a brighter outcome,,,there was no sign of happiness all thoughout the book. It was indeed a powerful description of the life of an unattractive black girl. It made me try to understand what that must feel like."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book opened my eyes to a world that I did not know within the African American community. Morrison does an excellent job of letting us inside the world that is &quot;unknown.&quot; I was truly touched by the character of Pecola. She experienced a lot of struggle within her family, and her innocence and dreams made me feel for her. I highly recommend this to anyone that is a fan of Morrison's, or wants to become one. You will with this book."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This is my favorite of all books. Morrison is an amazing author who in her own way, skillfully explains American society and reveals the tragedies and hardships which so many Americans face. This novel is one of a kind, helping all peoples understand the state of race relations in the United States. I strongly recommend this novel to anyone interested in (and having a desire to understand certain aspects of) A) African American culture/literature B) White culture/society C) History in generalThis book is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The Bluest Eye touches a nerve deep inside the reader. The young heroine is one of several strong, compelling characters-but she is the person to whom my heart reached out the most. Focusing the chapters on the different members of the Breedlove family really helps us see all of them are growing as products of their own experiences and dreams. This is an important, and very intense, book."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I am so tired of people bashing (and school boards banning) this novel because of it's graphic potrayals of incest, rape, and abuse and so called \\"racial vulgarity\\" (whatever that means). This book was published in 1970, when racial uphevial and tension in America was still very much a hailstorm sweeping the nation. It's a real portrayal of some very real problems in America.This novel is supposed to make you sick to your stomach; it's supposed to incite feelings of disgust, anguish, anger, and desperration. That's the whole point of the novel: to be a slap in the face; a sort of wake up call.The social problems protrayed in this book are very real (racism is still prevelant in America; anyone who thinks differently is walking around with their eyes closed), and banning books like this will not make the problems go away. It is books like The Bluest Eye that allow for dialogue to happen between people.It is a magnificant novel."},{"Title":"Until You","review":"\\"Until You\\" is the second in the Friarsgate Inheritance Series. It continues the story of the lovely and valiant Rosamund Bolton (\\"Rosamund\\"), who at the age of 22, and thrice a widow, finds herself truly in love for the first time -- with 50-year-old Patrick Leslie, father of the long-lost Janet Leslie (\\"The Kadin\\"). The two immediately embark on a mission for King James IV of Scotland that turns out to be less exciting than one would have thought...the mission is more of a chance for the reader to be exposed to the emotions of Rosamund and Patrick as they fall in love and deal with the knowledge that their union is not fated to last forever. Patrick's continuing sorrow over the \\"unsolved\\" mystery of his only daughter's disappearance 28 years ago is touching in the extreme. The book contains the usual Small twists and turns. The strength of Small's writing is in creating believable, mutifaceted characters and putting them in a culturally accurate setting: few of the people in her works are all bad or all good..even the most wretched of her villians has his/her story. Small pays particular attention to clothing, food, the social and cultural climate, as well as the historical settings of her works; she is careful not to give her characters 21st century, politically-correct views (for example, Rosamund truly cares for her servants, but still considers that she and her children are their \\"betters\\"). She has pushed the envelope of romance fiction for over 25 years, as her heroines tend to have several love affairs and marriages, instead of one soul mate for life, which is one of the major conventions of the romance genre. This book, and the first in the series (which I rated a 4), are well worth your time. I am looking forward to the next book, due out in October 2004."},{"Title":"Until You","review":"I always loved Small's work, but this is a story that should have been a short story. Small's characters retell the same thing over and over and over again. It is really annoying. Makes me think she didn't believe I absorbed the explanation the first time or am too stupid to retain it longer than two pages. ( I am refering to Patrick Leslie's explanation every two seconds about why he was sent off to a beautiful Island as the Kings man to help prevent a war)As always, her historical accounts are really terrific, and her lusty scenes are extensive. However, the sex scenes are numerous. If you like that sort of thing, you will be thrilled with this new addition. However, if you are like me and prefer the romance and tension in a relationship, you will be disappointed to find out the first lusty scence comes as quickly as page 7! And then pops up so often I just started skimming paragraphs to get to the story plot.The lovable characters of the first book are there, as is the mean ole Uncle, but truthfully, this story just plays out way too long. It would have been tighter and more enjoyable had she put it in a collection of short stories."},{"Title":"Until You","review":"Once again, I seem to be the only one that is really loving this series. I enjoy a strong heroine that is willing to fight for what she cares about & what she feels is injustice to her because she is female.

Read for yourself & decide."},{"Title":"Until You","review":"In 1511 The Border, widowed three times and only twenty-two, Rosamund Bolton informs her cousin that she is no longer interested in having a husband. She especially wants to avoid a betrothal to anyone selected by someone but herself. Instead she plans to visit her friend Margaret Tudor married to King James IV of Scotland unencumbered by a spouse.At the court, Patrick Leslie sees Rosamund sitting near the queen and knows he has found love for the first time in his life. Rosamund shares his deep feelings, but has doubts about another marriage. When King James assigns Patrick a mission in San Lorenzo to try to stop a pending war, he brings Rosamund along not realizing at the time the danger of their adventure, but the feeling that they belong together.UNTIL YOU, the sequel to ROSAMUND, is a delightful sixteenth century Scottish romance that is a typical Bertrice Small historical tale. The story line moves rather quickly once the duo leaves Scotland (relatively early in the novel). Fans of the sub-genre, especially those of the author, will appreciate this rich story starring two charming protagonists who feel like they have been part of the Skye is the limit mythos foreverHarriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Until You","review":"Setting ? England, Scotland, Italy 1511 --- UNTIL YOU is the continuation of the Friarsgate saga which began with ROSAMUND, the intrepid heroine from the book bearing that same name. Rosamund Bolton, was the orphaned English beauty who's been married and widowed three times and now at the ripe old age of 22, will live life on her own terms. She had been dutiful, done what was expected of her, mothered three daughters and will now live her life to please herself. IF she marries again it will be for love and a man of her OWN choosing.An invitation to attend court at the side of her childhood friend, Margaret Tudor, Queen of Scotland, was exactly the excuse she needed to flee another mans marriage proposal. It would be here that she would meet an older widower (age 50) Patrick Leslie, earl of Glenkirk and an almost mystical happening of ?love at first sight? occurs from the very first moment their eyes meet. Both Rosamund and Patrick are soul mates yet they both realize that as perfect as their love for one another is, their time would be limited together ? both being firmly attached to their individual estates. They astounded the court with their instant affair and when the King of Scotland asked his old friend, Patrick to travel to San Lorenzo on a diplomatic assignment to prevent war between Scotland and England, Rosamund would travel with him to the continent. Upon their return, Rosamund realizes that she could never be separated from Patrick and decides that they would marry within six months - once Patrick apprises his son of their decision. Fate, fickle as it is, would soon render the decision moot as tragedy strikes and memories of a love so pure are all that are left to Rosamund. Heartbroken, and grieving for lost love Rosamund is soon caught up in more court intrigues and fighting to preserve Friarsgate for her heiress daughter Phillipa. Additionally, an old love waits on the sidelines for just the right moment to try and convince her of his love.I had not read the prequel to this ?which I surely do plan to remedy ? but I can say that this surely stands alone and the reader will thoroughly enjoy this tale and be as eager as myself for the next book, which surely will have Rosamund?s daughters as the lead protagonists. For those of you who like their historical romances RICH in historical detail then you surely will enjoy this book from the political intrigues, to the daily life of clothing, food, travel, etc. then find yourself a comfortable chair to enjoy the continuation of the Friarsgate saga!"},{"Title":"Until You","review":"I did enjoy the book i liked the time with Patrick Leslie but i wanted more of Logan thought he was a good character that got lost the end of the book was so hurried"},{"Title":"Until You","review":"I knew the minute Patrick Leslie showed up just how the book was going to end. but i'll not say anything. But it was a fun ride, and while this book was not the best, it wasn't the worst either. I wish the time in San Lorenzo had lasted longer, i would have liked to have seen a whole book placed there.Rosamund matured a bit in this book. while at times she still annoyed me, it wasn't too bad."},{"Title":"Until You","review":"This is the second book in the &quot;Friarsgate Series&quot; and again Rosamund Bolton is our heroine and we travel with her through all sorts of intrigue, love, and disappointment that Ms. Small is famous for penning. For the most part I enjoyed this book but as some other reviewers have stated this book was not as good as it could have been. This book basically picks up where &quot;Rosamund&quot; left off and we find ourselves at Scottish court and immediatly after just one meeting Rosamund is in love with Patrick Leslie. Of course this love does seem to be of the &quot;lasting forever&quot; variety until of course a tragedy comes out of nowhere and ends that right away. Fear not though there is a potiential lover waiting off in the wings for when Rosamund sees him as more then just a lover (he has loved her since he first saw her at a market when she was just a young girl) and of course our story ends there with Rosamund possibly falling in love with him.This book was entertaing for me because Ms. Small is such a descriptive writer and I love the time that she takes with details that draw you into the time period. Her lusty characters are also entertaining but I felt that there was just something lacking with this story that I was never fully able to pin-point and as a result was not fully able to enjoy this book as I have enjoyed past stories by Ms. Small. In any event I would not avoid this story but I would suggest that you borrow it from a friend if you are new to Ms. Small or just not fully committed to wanting to purchase the book."},{"Title":"Until You","review":"I read Rosamund and I quite enjoyed it. So, I was very excited to read this one. When I did read I was a bit disappointed. I found myself disliking Rosamund in this book whereas I liked her in the first novel. First of all, I found the first scene with Patrick and her unbelievable. Secondly, I found her behavior rather rash in comparison to the first book. I just found her too bold. Not that there's anything wrong with that it's just not the way I imagined her to be after the first book. Then she took up and left her three daughters for months so she could cohabitate with Patrick in the warm weather. I guess that was accepted in those days but I don't agree with it. In a way Rosamund was selfish. Also, the ending was quite predictable as to who she would be with. Nothing new here!"},{"Title":"Until You","review":"This book opens well enough, but approximately two thirds of the story is sex and repetative explinations of why Rosamond and her lover cannot marry and why they are in San Lorenzo. Which in and of itself was of no real purpose whatsoever. To be honest, when the two are separated, I felt no anguish, as the relationship and characters during their love affair did nothing but have sex. I will say, that the last few chapters of the book picked up in intrigue and historical detail. These are the two things setting Small apart from other historical romance writers. Unfortunatly, this book for the most part lacks those elements. I am an avid reader of Small, and hope she returns to her earlier heights of historical romance writing."},{"Title":"Until You","review":"No one can say Small isn't a good writer, but...how does she manage to keep breaking point of view rules? I'd love for her to answer this, as I can't believe that she doesn't know differently. Flying into all the minds of the character in one scene is dizzy. As a result, I find the characterization weakened and I'm vaguely disappointed. I also didn't buy the whole first meeting scene...sorry, not real enough. Contrived. Cliched. But please, this is just one opinion, and no one can deny her talent. Maybe she DOES know she's breaking basic writer rules and doesn't care because she is who she is??"},{"Title":"Until You","review":"I love Beatrice Small's books but I can honestly say that this book is an exception. I felt that the heroine Rosemunde was a shallow character. She supposedly had this heart stopping love for Patrick Leslie and as soon as an osbstacle comes between the two, like loss of memory, she splits. Whatever, happened to that love that was going to last forever for Rosemunde, obviously she wasn't in love with Patrick Leslie that much. The guy she winds up finally marrying is a narcotic stalker. Definitely,not one of her better books."},{"Title":"Until You","review":"Unfotunately, reading about Rosamund was like reading about Skye O'Malley all over again. Although I thoroughly enjoyed the O'Malley saga, I'm experiencing a certain ennui in having it repeated all over again. The descriptions of clothing and food in the &quot;Friarsgate&quot; series are practically verbatim those of the previous novels. I was looking forward to a refreshing new story line, but I've been disappointed by the obvious predictability. Perhaps Ms.Small will surprise me and excite with future sequels."},{"Title":"Until You","review":"I loved &quot;Rosamund&quot; but thought this book came up a bit short.

(I will save the ending for those of you that did not spend $14 on this book.) She also is being chased by a man that needs to realize that it is not romantic to chase a woman that prefers anyone over you, that it just seems kind of desperate.

I love the author but that part of the book just didn't jive for me!!!"},{"Title":"Until You","review":"Sorry for the long review, but I feel I owe a thorough review to readers looking for non-formulaic, out of the ordinary and non-standardized romances as much detail as possible in order to make their own personal judgment as to whether or not to invest in a particular book. Having said this, I must state that my experience with the very first book I read from Bertrice Small was totally the opposite to the one I had with this book. Having read her much later work (The Border Lord and the Lady), and having liked it so much, I guess I was spoiled into thinking that Small's earlier works, such as this one would have been of the same quality and caliber. Bertrice Small does not stick to the standardized formula of a \\"Happily Ever After,\\" nor are her heroes and heroines usually who you think they are or are lead to believe via the book's back cover because with a great twist of events, the couples end up apart and matched up with others after dealing with great ordeal and tragedy. Bertrice Small's romantic formulas are not ordinary, never dull and quite suspenseful. However, due to the fact that this book was the contrary, I can only appreciate having purchased it at an excellent \\"Clearance Price!\\"Plot Summary: The Female Protagonist is the very same one from Bertrice Small's former book \\"Rosamund,\\" but I never read Rosamund and due to Ms. Small's continuously trite and repetitive writing \\"word for word\\" style, you get the entire character history in this book without having to read its predecessor. And unfortunately for this book, the repetition is EXCESSIVELY BORING & TRITE. In summary, our female protagonist was married three times before meeting \\"soul mate\\" Patrick Leslie aged 50. Her marriages were always a match made by her family members and all for the good of the family and never considering Rosamund's actual thirst for real and true love. When she visits Scotland's Royal Court, she meets this middle aged man across the hall (Scottish Laird Patrick Leslie) and feels as if lightning struck, signaling that although their fateful meeting was indeed for the very first time, such feelings of love obviously means that they had lived a romance in a previous life, and hence why they should immediately commence their love affair and on the very first day of them meeting. From then on, the romance is completely erotic and the two claim their undying passion and love for one another. WHAT GIVES HERE? I mean you just met the man and here you are going to his Royal guest room at night and declare your undying love, disrobing yourself and engage in earth shattering sobbing sex?--REALLY? Both understand their responsibilities to their estates and know that one day their love affair will come to an end (We are literally reminded of this eventual separation in EACH and EVERY chapter end). They go to all kinds of extremes (even lying to the Queen) to be with one another that Patrick agrees to go on a secret Royal mission on behalf of Jamie Stewart to San Lorenzo with Rosamund at his side. The erotica continues all the way to and in San Lorenzo. And then, the story takes off on even more crazy and unrealistic tangents that only Bertrice Small could conjure up from this point on for this book.My GREAT disappointments are attributed to the following listed reasons:* Indeed marriage at such early ages is understandable being that the mortality rate was so low back in the day, but marrying children off first at the age of three, then at 5 and then before 15 is downright disturbingly sick. I appreciate another reviewer's comment that the nobility were married off when they were children as well for strategic alliances between nations, but come on here - give us a break romance writer Bertrice Small, because our lead heroine was not nobility and she was merely a childhood companion to the Queen of Scotland and Henry VIII; an English nobody of a country girl with good fortune due to sheepherding and strategic wool sales with an estate of her very own needs to be contractually matched? Our heroine even mocks her status by joking with the Queen stating that she can never have a self-portrait because simple country girls do not engage in such activities, but that only the nobility are to hang self-portraits in their homes. COME ON-Which way is it characters?* Our heroine is so beautifully fascinating with her auburn eyes that EVERY man, including King Henry VIII has to lust over and sexually possess. Not only did she already have three husbands by the time she was 16, but she was also one of Henry VIII's ardent lovers while Katherine of Aragon was recently married to the King. Furthermore, her laird neighbor (Logan Hepburn) is insanely in love with her since she was a twelve year old and he was a young lad of 16-before she was married off to husband number 2. I don't know about twelve year olds back in the 1500's, but without all the hormones in their food, I can assure you that a twelve year old back then did not look so overly developed as the twelve year olds of today's society. This obsessive love claim did not come across as truly genuine. It was so over the top that when Logan Hepburn realizes that Rosamund has a special magic between her and Patrick Leslie, he bitterly accepts a betrothal to a distant cousin in order to sire children and attempt to move on with his life, while never forgetting his one true love of a \\"slutt.\\" The CRAP is flying to the roof here, but wait it doesn't stop!--NO--Upon arriving at San Lorenzo, its Ambassador and renowned Venetian Artist must possess her as well. The Ambassador flirts with her at no end, and so does the Venetian painter-and all disrespectfully in front of Rosamund's middle aged lover and companion. SPOILER ALERT-> Our Venetian painter ends up being the spy her middle aged Patrick is supposed to exchange information with regarding his visit to San Lorenzo, but even though the information is not detrimental to Royal interests and proves to be an unsuccessful trip, her said beauty is so above normal, he has to paint her in various portraits but most importantly one in subliminal nudity. He not only gets his wish, but he sells all the paintings to the men that wanted to possess her as well. None of these surrounding characters respected our middle aged lover because not only did they lust after Rosamund, but when confronted with their intentions, they simply stated that she is just too beautiful and to downright consider himself truly loved by Rosamund because she will not stray. - AH WHAT!--- Is this female character even for real?* Rosamund did not come across as a heroine that I could respect and admire. She came across as extremely selfish because she still needed to be with her middle aged true love Patrick, even though she knows that it will come to an end one day and despite the fact that her little daughters anxiously awaited her return from Court back at Friarsgate. What kind of mother leaves her 9 year old, 7 year old and 5 year old daughters to go off on her \\"erotica honeymoon\\" with her middle aged lover; a romance that she knows will come to an end one day? Also, time and time again, she kept stating that her middle aged lover was built like a stallion if not better than men of her age because he had ripped muscles and a fine buttock, and above all, their passion was so extreme to the point that she sobs hysterically after her sexual climax? Our author doesn't end the madness there, No Way!--She then goes on to have our heroine come to terms that even though she didn't want any more husbands because she will never give up her estate responsibilities (practically mentioned in every chapter), suddenly has an epiphany as if she smashed her head on the floor to then state that she will marry said middle aged laird if he asked and that they will make matters work even if they have to live half the year in England and the other half in Scotland? This character was emotionally gyrating all over the place that I just couldn't get to see any good qualities about her. I mean, what did she really have to offer another man, other than her financial stability and erotica expertise? She is simply not a figure that I would entrust any guardianship or morality standards with.* Rosamund totally adores her cousin (Tom Bolton) and cannot live without his opinions and meddling to the point that whatever he says goes and at times he doesn't even count on her directions and opinions. SPOILER ALERT Said cousin has been working behind Rosamund's back by assisting the Scottish Laird of a neighbor (Logan Hepburn) into finally getting his wish of having Rosamund accept his marriage proposal (it must have been his 1000+ proposal by the last chapters), since poor old Patrick Leslie had suffered a brain hemorrhage that nearly killed him, but eliminated his memories of the past two years; memories that included said deep and un-abiding erotic romance?--\\"ah, ok Rosamund, you really should go and marry someone your own age here and your neighbor Logan Hepburn is very good looking with blue-blue eyes and deeply mad in love with you. I understand you had such an amazing magical romance with your old fart, but you must move on because you are only 25 and could really have more children and one day grow to love another. I mean, Patrick will always be in your heart, but you can make room for someone else too because you are a creature that lives for DEEP LOVE... ah, ok this makes sense and bring it on Lord Hepburn, but wait, why aren't you into me anymore, I mean you have been dying for me throughout this entire book? Oh, it's because I am following the advice of your very strange of a popinjay cousin Tom Bolton because he makes SO much sense and I should never have approached you with words of bearing children and marriage as opposed to how I truly felt?\\" I am so drowning in CRR_A_P here, that I don't know which end is up - LITERALLY and I have gone over the same words over and over again! (not to mention that characters catch up with one another and when they ask how one has been, a complete reiteration of word for word of events are simply spelled out over and over and over and over... SERIOUSLY - it was pages upon endless 100 pages of complete verbatim paraphrasing that I would simply skip to the new storyline), but getting back to Logan's change of heart, oh Rosamund simply sees it as his new strategy to possess her because he told her he is working under Tom's advice and that he WILL have her because he is madly in love with her and let's end the madness so come here and let's make love to seal the bargain because I will marry you!--oh, ok Rosamund gives in and he makes deep, passionate and slow love to seal the betrothal. OMG... I have drowned in so much stinky CRAP that I cannot go on with other examples, so reviewers please forgive me here, but you get the picture.In conclusion, I am under the impression that since this book was published in 2003 and the Border Lord and the Lady was published in 2009, that Bertrice Small's writing style had dramatically improved to the point that I should still give her the opportunity to redeem herself in being a shelf keeper of a writer for me. But, I am a bit nervously skeptical as I also did not have a good review for Small's 2011 book, The Border Lord's Bride. In a nutshell, Bertrice Small is your erotic romance writer that does not follow the standard formulaic romances of a \\"Happily Ever After,\\" due to heart-pounding trauma and tragedies that shape the standard meaning of protagonists. Hopefully her upcoming book, Bianca- The Silk Merchant's Daughters soon to be out next week will be WORTHY of shelf keeping, upping the \\"anti\\" as expected in in Bertrice Small, but characters remain realistically genuine."},{"Title":"Until You","review":"This was a great sequel to the firt book (Rosamund). The book was in good shape and I did not have to wait long for it to arrive. Maybe later I might get the next book in this sequel."},{"Title":"Until You","review":"I was not disappointed in this 2nd book of the series. I was afraid that I would be from what most of the other reviews had to say. This series is far from the Skye O'Mally series but it is still good so far. I like Bertrice Smalls characters. Usually her woman are very strong and intelligent. Her stories always have a little twist to them whcih keeps things interesting. Good history involved. It actually made me curious enough to look some facts up. Anyway, so far so good. 2 more in the series to go. I would recommend this book if you like historical romance."},{"Title":"Until You","review":"This short series was very enjoyable and memorable. Great beach reads - easy reading, likable characters and strong women characters. I'm glad I read these books. I have read other Bertrice Small books and of all the ones I've read, this series was the best for me."},{"Title":"Until You","review":"Having enjoyed Rosamund, I was looking forward to this sequel. However when the male love interest in the book turned out to be the oversexed Patrick Leslie, I threw the damn thing against the wall. Is it too much to hope for a fresh male character in a new book? Must characters like the Earls of Glenkirk be recycled ad nauseam? If you haven't read other books by Small, this might be fresh and fun. But if you've read about the Leslies as much as an avid fam would, you might very well throw the book against your own wall."},{"Title":"Until You","review":"I enjoyed this book very much,am looking forward to the next in the series.I am a fan of Bertrice Small and I enjoy the many different places that she takes you in one of her novels."},{"Title":"Until You","review":"Very enjoyable book to read and alot of historical facts are included. I have read the whole series, Friarsgate Inheritance by Bertice Small. There are 3 books in the series, Rosamund, Until You and Philippa."},{"Title":"Until You","review":"I don't buy the love/lust story between Rosamund and Patrick. Why do they love each other again? And what do they have in common? The author should have given us reasons why they love each other at first sight (like Patrick saving Rosamond from speeding carriage,etc) not just for physical appearance, which I also don't get esp. on Rosamond part. Ms. Small, do you know how a 52 yr. old man looks like during those times? Absolutely not as hot as Pierce Brosnan or John Travolta but your Patrick Leslie would rather look like a 70 yr old.man of today(they age faster back then and their life span shorter). I find the 30 years gap of the characters (Patrick-52 and Rosamond-22) not stimulating to the imagination in reading romance novel. And how selfish is the heroine leaving her three young children behind so she could be with her lover in a foreign country for many months. The San Lorenzo story was boring. Just an excuse to write about sex after sex of these mis match characters. And about his memory lapse, so what if he could not remember the past 2 years (10 months of which were their lust affair). Was it impossible for him to love/lust her again (it was the same face/body so for sure he'll get attracted to her again)and start anew? Or if she loves him that much, then why did she left without winning back his lust once again. Anyway, I was actually glad of what happened to Patrick(at least he didn't die like the others). Sorry I do not like them together and their shallow lust affair. But then the love story of Rosamund and Logan is so short(which I think has more potential). The author should have made Rosamond-Patrick story shorter and Rosamond-Logan longer. Maybe I just like Logan's character. I think he's cool and you could really believe that he really loved Rosamond. He waited for her, protected her and her family and dependable each time she needed him(I actually don't think she deserved him). Should have explored their courtship and I actually like their sexual tension because it was funny sometimes. The good thing is I like the ending that she ended up with the right man."},{"Title":"Until You","review":"This book made me cry a couple of times. When I got to the part about Rosamund and Patrick's trip to San Lorenzo I really wanted them to stay together. I loved their story - I thought it was beautifully written. I felt really sad when their romance ended.This is the first Bertrice Small book I've read where I liked both of the herione's love interests. I liked Patrick and Logan and thought both of them were perfect for Rosamund. I wanted to read more about Rosamund and Logan's romance - I thought Ms. Small could have spent more time writing about their love story (instead of writing about another trip to court). This book was very entertaining."},{"Title":"Until You","review":"This is one of the best of her books!"},{"Title":"Until You","review":"Until You is my first Bertrice Small book, and I was introduced to her talent for blending history and romance together. Although I love both elements, I felt that Until You had too many steamy sex scenes and not enough actual romance.The beautiful Rosamund Bolton, widowed many times already at twenty-two and the handsome aging Lord Patrick Leslie instantly fall in love at the Scottish court in the early 1500s. The first of many sex scenes appears on page seven - too early for me! I did not buy the \\"love at first sight\\" explanation because it was more fancy talk with \\"lust\\" than actual love. Later on in the book, Lord Leslie embarks on a journey to the Mediterranean San Lorenzo to deliver a message for King James IV of Scotland, and Rosamund travels with him. More passion erupts between the two lovers, and although Ms. Small writes descriptive scenes - perfect for the readers who love this kind of stuff - once again, I still found it hard to believe there was actual \\"love\\" going on between Lord Leslie and Rosamund.Despite the book's flaws, the historical background is wonderful as King Henry VIII begins to flex his power in Europe and the fragile peace with Scotland is threatened. The characters of the monarchs came to life for me - the just King James IV and his wife Queen Margaret Tudor, Spanish Kate (Queen Katherine of Aragon), and the lusty Henry VIII all have many pages of the book dedicated to them.Yes, Until You blends history and romance, but in this case, it was more history and repetitive lust...hence the three stars."},{"Title":"Until You","review":"This was the only Bertrice Small book I could find in the gift shop of an airport. That should have been warning enough not to buy it.Rosamund was an unlikeable character. She left her 3 young daughters so she could \\"make love\\" constantly and then was oh-so-superior with her maid when Annie did the same! I guess being a rich, snotty noblewoman means you're not held to the same standards of behavior as the mere household help.I found the love at first sight meeting to be flimsy and contrived. Small's readers are smarter than most, so I'm surprised she expected us to swallow it. Like some other reviewers here, I thought it was more lust than love. It was clearly a mid-life crisis hook up for Patrick. And if Rosamund truly loved Patrick, she never would have left him when he was ill, memory loss or not!Not planning to read either \\"Rosamund\\" or \\"Phillipa\\", the other books in this series. It was hard enough getting through this book, let alone another one with her uppity daughter.The good stuff? Getting to meet Patrick Leslie again. But it was heartbreaking to witness his grief over losing his daughter Janet decades ago. If you've read \\"The Kadin\\", you know that Janet eventually returns to her home, but only after Patrick has died."},{"Title":"Until You","review":"I have never enjoyed reading the novels of one historical romance author so much. But this was a dissapointment Ms. Small! Altough she always has bored me a trifle with her details, the plots are usually well thought out and intriguing. But in this novel, after finding the love of her life, Patrick has dementia and they cancel their wedding plans. After two years she lets Logan who pursues her constantly throughout the novel take her body and her hand in matrimony after she refuses him so long! When it says: \\"Rosamund sat up. What was she doing? She jumped from her bed, lokking to gather up her other garments. \\"You shall not have me you monster!\\" I thought she was coming to her senses and would finally wait on her true love to regain his memory , but alas twas not to be. She should not have married again. It was tantamount to a betrayal! I am so mad atMs. Small for ending this book this way! I give the book two stars for the romance of a lifetime she allowed us to see between Rosamund and Patrick."},{"Title":"Statistical Inference","review":"I found this short, 182-page book to be dense, demanding, extraordinarily insightful, and extremely rewarding. It prodded me to learn more about many subjects related to the scientific method, inference in research, and statistical methods. I consider it one of the 15 or 20 most important books I have ever read, and one of the 5 most important about quantitative research (which is how I make my living). Certainly I think of it as essential for any teacher of statistics.Prerequisites for reading this book would be about 3 courses in statistics, deep curiosity about statistics, and strong motivation to understand the concepts behind statistical inference. Oakes uses very little math; instead he uses rigorous, clever, incisive logic to delve into what statistical findings such as p-values really mean, how we should interpret statistical results, and what value significance tests might hold relative to statements about confidence intervals or effect sizes. In the process, he touches insightfully on a number of developments in the history of the field. (His sense of humor isn't bad, either.)Oakes does an excellent job when, in the tradition of Amos Tversky, Daniel Kahneman, and Gerd Gigerenzer (as well as, in a more technical statistical way, Elazar Pedhazur), he exposes misconceptions about statistical inference that plague the work of so many, including, it seems, the vast majority of social scientists. You may find yourself doing double takes at his treatment of some of these misconceptions.Oakes also gives a short, fascinating treatment of the polemics surrounding competing schools of statistical inference, including the methods termed Fisherian, Neyman-Pearson, Bayesian, and Likelihood. A dynamite finish. This book has no weak spots."},{"Title":"Statistical Inference","review":"What a shame that this wonderful book is now out of print. Frankly it ought to be compulsory reading for anyone who ever ventures near a statistical test. Anyone who understands the assumptions behind a t-test should be able to grasp (and enjoy?) the arguments."},{"Title":"More Tish","review":"While Mary Roberts Rinehart is best known for her mystery novels, she wrote a series of short stories about three aging spinsters. Tish is the ringleader of this trio and she guides them through one reckless adventure after another. While not every story is a perfect gem, most of them are funny. They are worth reading and re-reading. The stubborn and iron-willed Tish is a delight to read about."},{"Title":"Ghost Points: A Novel","review":"\\"Ghost Points\\" is one man's nostalgic re-entry into his past, in search of meaning. Though Randolph Mayer had his grandest moments in the years gone by, his is the quintessential dilemma of aging -- as looks, vigor, and livelihood slip away, what did it all mean?Geffrey von Gerlach has written a mythic journey into one man's remarkable past, with a poignant revelation the ancient storytellers knew quite well -- it is the observation of a life that reveals the cycles and patterns, the passions and the meaning.Revolution and romance, art and artifice, humour and hubris -- acclaimed photographer Randolph Mayer's life spanned the globe and some of the most fascinating times of the 20th century in China, Paris, New York, and LA.At the end of his life, with nothing to show for the adventures and the accomplishments, Randolph struggles for meaning. Now aging, alone, and alienated from a too-fast techno-world, the once-great artist struggles to find a reason to go on living.Lying in a coma from a failed suicide, through the mystical \\"Ghost Points\\" of Chinese acupuncture, Randolph relives his times of greatest intensity, be they tragedy or celebration, and finds a surprising answer to the question we must all, eventually, ask ourselves.Poignant and passionate, mythic in import, personal in impact, Ghost Points is the journey of a man who discovers himself to have been a hero after all.Reading this engrossing book makes you start thinking about your own life -- what will be those moments that, like photographs, will remain with you forever."},{"Title":"The Unyielding Clamor of the Night: A Novel","review":"A well written novel. It is engaging. It is not fast paced, but it also does not plod. As a previous reviewer stated, if you are looking for someone to cheer for, this is not the book. Initially, the ending of the novel was frustrating too me. However, as I have thought since about the book, I have been fascinated by the open-endedness and the ambiguity. Sometimes life doesn't have heroes. Sometimes individuals feel like they are forced to choose one side or another, with both sides being unsatisfying. This book captures this dilemma."},{"Title":"The Unyielding Clamor of the Night: A Novel","review":"Arun has left his privileged home on a Southeast Asian island to teach in an area where a civil war is tearing apart daily village life. Motivated by idealism, Arun adopts a life of poverty and dedicates himself to improving the lives of others, but even his optimism and hopes are shattered by problems trying to educate the village's children, and when the war hits too close to home he must confront long-buried secrets and assess his life anew. A stark, evocative novel of goodwill and war evolves.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"},{"Title":"The Unyielding Clamor of the Night: A Novel","review":"This is the first novel by Neil Bissoondath that I've read. \\"The Unyielding Clamor of the Night\\" is a difficult story to embrace. It is an eye-opener to what the experience must be like for many who live in third-world countries with oppressive dictatorships and age-old racial rivalries. Loosely based on Sri Lanka, Bissoondath follows a young man named Arun whose family runs a wealthy printing business in the capital. Arun announces to his family that he does not wish to take over the family business, leaving it for his sister Joy & brother-in-law Surein. Both Arun's father and mother become fatalities of a bomb on a small airplane. This leads Arun to follow his dream to become a teacher. He travels to the southern poorer part of the country to a town called Omeara. As the new teacher, he finds an uphill battle to acceptance. Few students show up for school. The ones who come have arms missing or are learning disabled. Arun makes friends with the mayor of the town who hired him, the butcher and his family. Mr. Jaisaram has a wife who has vowed to remain silent. His daughter Anjani is a beautiful free spirit who has education but does not like to conform. Arun and Anjani become good friends, with Anjani warning him of the limits of her attraction. We learn that Anjani has had an affair with another female student that caused her to be expelled from the school in the capital and sent home to the South. Still, one night Anjani comes to Arun who loses his virginity. Arun has a plastic prosthesis for a congenital withered leg that was eventually amputated. He overcomes his doubts about his self-image and gives in to the lovely Anjani. Meanwhile political events swirl about the story. The army has a camp outside of town and runs maneuvers in the mountains for a group of rebels called \\"the Boys.\\" An unknown bomb maker blows up a bus on market day, raining hands and legs over the small village. One morning dead dogs are discovered killed and mutilated along with one man executed by the Boys. The army storms into town looking for rebels. For a novel that is often cerebral inside Arun's mind, there are a number of exciting events that occur. Arun begins to teach the soldiers at the camp and develops a friendship with a young officer named Seth. There are a number of secrets within this small town that peel off like layers of an onion.However Bissoondath takes a major risk because it is very hard to understand or like characters who resort to terrorism. With Anjani's death, we learn who the bombmaker is just as Arun learns the true causes of his parents' death. We are presented with a third-world society where no one's hands are clean. Education and social stratification vie with the notion that in war the end must justify the means. As Arun's good friend Seth sits on the platform waiting for the train that will soon take him home to meet his new son, the book ends with a bang. After spending so much time with these characters and getting a glimpse into a hard existence, it is sad that Bissoondath leaves no one for whom we can cheer. Neil's prose at first struck me as overly wordy, but eventually I came to enjoy his lyrical descriptions of the beach, town & life of people in Omeara. When both the government and those who oppose them are ruthless, does \\"terrorist\\" simply become a title one gives to an opponent? I appreciated my journey through this world, but found the ending as disturbing as the novel was enjoyable. If you're the kind of reader who needs a good guy for whom to cheer, this will not be your cup of tea. However, if you enjoy gritty adventure about characters for whom violence may be the only voice of protest available, this may help us understand why much of our world today is rocked by explosions."},{"Title":"EDUCATION AND COMMUNITY","review":"Dr Dianne Gereluk has written one of the clearest and most scholarly books on the topic ofEducation and Community.

I bought this as my first step towards considering adoption and after the first 10 pages or so, began scanning in attempt to find any information I would find useful.After wading through chapter upon chapter of misty-eyed recounting of the author's own experiences,(complete with a fully explained morality lesson on each...for those who didn't &quot;get it&quot; ) I finally located one solid page about what to expect from a home inspection and, further in, another about the pros and cons of international versus domestic adoption (with a thinly-veiled sales pitch for the services &quot;an agency like ours&quot; can provide) .

Before I started reading this book, our desire to adopt was pure selfishness, we wanted a little girl. After I got done reading this book, our perspective changed. We wanted to help save a childs life. All of us in the U.S. have no idea what it is like to be without, but the children over in other countries do. We need to be a more thankful people because God has blessed us with so much. Next time you are contemplating over adopting, just think &quot;you are saving a childs life&quot;.

For example, the book advises you go to 2 Corintians 3:4-5 to learn about self-esteem in children: &quot;Such confidence is ours through Christ before God. Not that we are competent in ourselves to claim anything for ourselves, but our competence comes from God&quot;. What? Besides making very little sense, is this useful information about how to acquire or raise or child? Each chapter is preceded by a quote from the Bible.Overall, I would categorize this book as long on biblical rhetoric but short on logic.

As a concerned citizen and as an American, our current choices appear dismally lacking and I fear that in the coming years will lead to the continued downfall of our country to a condition that would be extremely hard to rectify or reverse.We elect our president based on the strength of the advertising firm thus representing him or her, our choice is not left to the content of character or loyalty to the principles set forth by the fathers of the republic.Accomplishments that are seen and palpated through acts and success should decide, not merely fancy slogans,balloons and devices that amuse.One candidate will inevitably have more devices to amuse.Unfortunately, they usually get our vote.Then comes the hard part,running the country for four years.And what of it?Good or bad we tolerate this like children and do nothing to better the situation,our country and ultimately ourselves. We as a people need to familiarize ourselves with what constitutes greatness in a leader.The requisite traits needed to lead.We need to look beyond our elementary school contacts and acquaint ourselves with a man who unfortunately we view today as just another excuse for a day off.That man was George Washington. Jared Sparks, a past Harvard president, educator and historian who is credited with starting the study of American history as a subject put together a concise history of Washington that when read to its conclusion leaves one in awe.It is considered his best work and he had Washingtons actual papers for years as references.George Washington is what we should all aspire to be. His life, written in a manner of the times, merely thirty to forty years after his death in 1799, is astounding.His principles and firm convictions,his trials and constant pursuit of his means to an end are clearly evident.He was 'the man' of the and for the people of his newly forming country.His leadership skills are what is needed now more than ever.We need to find,secure and elect a man like this. The book is beautifully written for a history of the United States and of the man and should be read by everyone interested in the future of our nation.Washington is the model,the template by which our leaders should be chosen. Sparks has written a classic narrative of our beginnings as a nation and of his as a leader.It evolves and enmeshes both into a wonderful study of American history from its first seedling to the beginings of the runaway train it has become and a government that has lost sight of its original purpose, that is, to serve the people and function for their and their countries benefit.I fear that this is now past into history as well. Read the book slowly,injest it.See the man for who he was and then say that this is who you wouldn't want running things today.He was one of a kind and perhaps there will never be another George Washington but at least you will come away with a better conception of what kind of leader America needs presently.The United States of America needs a George Washington type of person to lead us.His traits as presented in the book evidenced over and over should be a prerequisite to the office of president. This book will be all you need as a citizen to make an informed decision as to the character of our next and future leaders. To quote Washingtons dying words, \\"Tis Well\\".Tis well you read this book at least once in your American life. It will be time well spent.Trust me.Just stick with it and you will see the man grow with both triumphs and defeats which only made him stronger with more resolve to finish what he started at the request of his countrymen. A task he really did not want at all but felt compelled to do because of his love for his country and its people.If you have any doubts, just compare our current George to the old George.You'll see what I mean."},{"Title":"Born to be Together","review":"I read this book with care because I've read some good reviews about it.

I can recommend this book to anybody who is interested in relationships."},{"Title":"Born to be Together","review":"After reading so many astrology books that give lofty and confusing advice,I found this book, Born to be Together, very helpful in dealing with my love life.It gave me a practical foundation for many of the things I was \\"feeling\\" about myrelationship and some good tools for how to bring a better balance into play. Ifound that understanding each of us a bit better, and having a better idea of whywe are the way we are, took out the \\"blame\\" and brought in a much smarter approachto getting a better connection between us.This would also be especially helpful if you were at the just dating stage and wanted toknow if you were compatible.

This event was the most important in Oe's life. Born with a herniated brain, Hikari has needed almost constant care since birth. &quot;A Healing Family&quot; is Oe's first non-fiction attempt to make sense of Hikari's life and the effect it has had on the people around him, most importantly his family.This beautiful book shows the profound love, affection and pride the Oe family take in Hikari's accomplishments and happiness. From the age of five, Hikari has been obsessed with classical music, and eventually began to compose pieces for piano and violin. Much of &quot;A Healing Family&quot; concerns Oe's attempts to understand his son through music.&quot;A Healing Family&quot; is a book everyone should read. Finely crafted, perceptive, intelligent and moving, it shows us again that compassion and empathy can make all the difference in the world."},{"Title":"A Healing Family","review":"My first book by Kenzaburo was Silent Cry. Recently I read A Healing Family and found that I really liked it a lot. Yukari's illustrations were beautiful. This book made me feel closer to Oe's family. It is very heart-warming.At the time I read it, I was in the process of deciding whether to get my wisdom teeth extracted by a dentist or an oral surgeon. I heard that my face would be bruised and swollen, my jaws unhinged, etc. after the surgery. It was quite unnerving just to think about it. Then I read that Hikari has to make weekly visits to the dentist, and that his epileptic pills make his gum terribly swollen. I felt that I am in a much much better situation than some people. It was a consolation to read this book.One thing I don't quite like about most of Kenzaburo's books is that he refers to a lot of other European writers and their works, which I find hard to understand. Well, that's just my ignorance."},{"Title":"A Healing Family","review":"\\"A Healing Family\\" is a healing book. The spirit that pervades this book brings peace and calm, as it models acceptance of life when it does not go along with our well-made plans.In this slender book, Kenzaburo Oe, the Nobel prize winner in literature, shares how his family is living a fine life, despite, or perhaps because of the fact that one member of the family, his son Hikari, has a somewhat severe mental handicap.Kenzaburo's first reaction to the revelation that his son would always require a lot of care had been to run away. He was a young, ambitious, writer who had definite dreams and plans about his future, and those dreams and plans didn't include a mentally challenged son. He did not want this problem.His attitude changed after some conversations with a Hiroshima survivor, a physician, who had lived through that horror and had cared for the wounded, for many years still. Somehow, through the friendship and conversations with this physician and others, Oe was able to realize that the only way to survive the terrible hand he was dealt was to accept what he had been given and deal with it as graciously and serenely as he could.As he has gone about doing that, Oe has been the father that his son needed. His son Hikari has been able to enjoy life in the bosom of a loving family, and has developed his talent for composing music, and is enjoying life. In return, his son has become a creative focus of his life and writing. Kenzaburo Oe himself has been able to reach the highest peaks of recognition for a writer, winning the Nobel prize. But this book shows he has achieved even greater heights than that. He has become a very fine person, who shines through the writing. His book has a very healing effect on the human spirit. His writing here is smooth and polished, very easy to read, and a perfect vehicle for the beautiful spirit he displays. There are simple but beautiful drawings by the author's wife strewn throughout that add to the feeling of the book.This is not a preachy book, but does show through the telling of their ordinary life how a life that can be a disaster in less capable hands, can be lived serenely and successfully. A quiet, meditative, book, like a Japanese Zen garden, this book depicts a life where forces of chaos have been tamed. A certain serenity and order has settled over their lives, and it is a wonderful thing to behold. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"I Know What You Did Last Summer","review":"Usually when reading a novel that is made into a movie the novel is better. I enjoyed this novel but it began slow.

Without this book, my first training sessions would have been lackluster meanderings into unfamiliar (and dangerous) territory. Mr Eitington's suggestions, guidelines and examples served to help me structure and flesh-out my seminar to be a strong success. The book is clearly organized with both a Table of Contents and an Index, and every chapter is broken down into relevant, digestible chunks. This guide focuses only a little on actually setting up and starting a training, in favor of creating a great deal of detail on training techniques, scenarios, and tools. The copiable sheets (for everything from pre-work to team games to feedback) 1included at the end of the book also provide much creative fodder, as well as saving a great deal of time. Of the five training guides I have, this is the one I use more than 80% of the time."},{"Title":"The Winning Trainer: Winning Ways to Involve People in Learning","review":"No one in the training field or doing anything even close (teachers take note!) should be without this book.

Outside: impenetrable beige fog and the sound of one lone voice [not that of the rescue worker] crying out: &quot;Fall on your knees and cry out to the Lord!&quot; This book is the instruction manual for all lost,disoriented, confused and frightened persons.This is the only truth that matters and the only real hope. Seek Jesus while there is still time.

Read it; it will change your life!"},{"Title":"Jesus' Final Warning","review":"I really, really liked this book. Not only does Dr. Jeremiah again lead you through his prophetic eyes to the fast approaching 'end times', he also shows us how to live, study and worship as we wait.One thing that specifically stood out for me is the fact that it was written over 12 years ago and is so relevant today. Many of his thoughts and predictions of this time period were spelled out clearly, and have indeed actually taken place.This work goes way beyond prophesy and shows us what great rewards are waiting for us if we live to serve the Lord on this earth."},{"Title":"Domesticity Isn't Pretty","review":"This book is a must. Not just for gay men, but for members of your family. I have given so many copies of \\"Domesticity Isn't Pretty\\" to friends and family members that I have lost count. It deals with the reality of gay couples, with humor and a realistic touch, so lacking in many gay author's work. Besides, once you give them \\"Domesticity Isn't Pretty,\\" you can bet they'll seek out Tim Barela's three other Leonard and Larry books, as well!Leonard Goldman is an architect. Larry Evans runs a Leather Store on Santa Monica Boulevard. Together, they deal with marriage, divorce, children, childbirth of grandchildren, the fact that a son may be gay, and who stole the cookies. Well, maybe the cookies aren't the most typical dilemma in anyone's family, but these men feel real, like neighbors.When Larry's son David makes a very public coming out at his local high school prom, it completely unsettles his fatherhood expectations. Given that Larry, a gay man, is as rattled by the discovery that his offspring is gay makes him just like the rest of us. He's not a Super Human, he's just an Every Dad. Larry must suddenly face a reality that he takes for granted in his everyday life, and it's revelatory to come from a gay book.One of the other fun things about this volume is that you get to watch the evolution of Leonard and Larry from being side characters in Barela's other strips to the heroes of their own. The introduction by Andy Mangles chronicles Tim's early strips for biker magazines, and how Tim came to terms then eventually came out through his art. Reading about Barela's growth and self realization parallels the growths of Leonard and Larry, making the stories all the more essential and commonplace to gays and lesbians everywhere. Maybe \\"Domesticity Isn't Pretty,\\" but it sure is realistic. Funny, too. Get this! Get two. Spread the Leonard and Larry world."},{"Title":"Domesticity Isn't Pretty","review":"Leonard is a timeless comic strip that is as fresh today as when it was written. If you would like to see what we are really like and how similar we are to the straight couples in this great land of our BUY THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"Domesticity Isn't Pretty","review":"This book was one of the best I have read in a long time. Leonard and Larry are the more realistic couple I have seen in a comic in years. Their shenanigans are awesome and their relationship is truly touching as well. Nice to see two &quot;normal&quot; men with &quot;normal&quot; lives who are so much in love."},{"Title":"Domesticity Isn't Pretty","review":"I was introduced to Tim Barela's first L&amp;L collection a few years ago, and had a hard time putting it down! Tim has created a cast of characters that seem very realistic. Instead of being &quot;perfect&quot; like, say, the characters from &quot;Leave It To Beaver,&quot; they have normal, everyday problems just like the rest of us.Larry runs an erotic leather shop. He's a chocoholic, and is emotionally off-the-wall. He has two boys from his previous relationship with a woman who constantly nags him to get the child support check out on time (or else!). He has a mid-life crisis, and always complains about getting old and fat.Leonard is the more down-to-earth of the pair, but he has his share of problems too. He's a professional photographer who gets stressed when he has deadlines, throws a fit when his car's paint is scratched, is totally clueless about car engines, and doesn't look so hot in the morning (I know the feeling!). He's more of a romantic than Larry, and occasionally gets hurt when Larry does something insensitive and dumb.Tim's character development is second-to-none. Over the course of the books &quot;Domesticity Isn't Pretty&quot; and its sequel &quot;Kurt Cobain And Mozart Are Both Dead,&quot; his characters have real-life experiences, and are changed by them. Hair gets grayer, facial hair is shaved and regrown, babies are born, and new friendships are forged.Whether you're gay or straight, I highly recommend these books. They give a great insite into the type of life that many gays wish for, and at the same time show what gays have to deal with - from losing beloved friends to AIDS to being discriminated against by those who wrongly condemn them. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll scream for more - I know I am. TIM, PLEASE WRITE MORE!!!"},{"Title":"Domesticity Isn't Pretty","review":"this book is a fantastic insight into the mind of the gay male in society. when i bought it, the woman who sold it to me said I would be surprised how much it mimics straight married people's relationships, and, as a straight, married female, I can sympathize with Leonard's mother controlling his every move!Bravo Tim!!!!"},{"Title":"Domesticity Isn't Pretty","review":"It will be difficult indeed for any gay man not to see himself somewhere in the pages of Tim's book. Leonard and Larry are role models of a sort for a generation of gay men who are not &quot;club kids&quot; and just want to share their lives together. This is a great book and very funny. I can't wait for the next one (that's a hint-Tim) If you want to see a 'wholesome gay couple&quot; buym this BOOK!"},{"Title":"Domesticity Isn't Pretty","review":"This book is, arguably, the funniest thing I have ever read in my life. Seeing these &quot;normal&quot; gay guys (and girls, too) has helped me face my own homosexuality. This book can (and should) be enjoyed by mature, open-minded readers of any and all persuasions."},{"Title":"Domesticity Isn't Pretty","review":"I love this book, but my opinion is suspect because Tim Barela is a friend of mine. I just wanted to point out that Leonard is a professional photographer, not musician... that would be L&amp;L's friend Bob Mendez."},{"Title":"Domesticity Isn't Pretty","review":"Finally, the L&amp;L strip from &quot;Frontiers&quot; in one book. A delightfully funny, true-to-life cartoon strip involved a married gay couple (the Leonard and Larry of the Title).Set in 'real time', the cast of characters is almost better than the main characters. Wry, sexy, &quot;woofy&quot;. Leonard is a prof. musician, Larry is a fomerly married owner of a leather shop with a a gay son, straight daughter, ex-wife and a cast of other wonderful characters. Keep your eye on 'Merle' and the composer ghosts are a hoot"},{"Title":"Mystic Vol. 4: Out All Night (Crossgen)","review":"CrossGen Comics continues to impress me with each of their books that I read. \\"Mystic: Out All Night\\" is no different, but it is rather dependent on the previous three volumes. This is clearly a part of a series, not a work intended to stand alone, and should be treated as such.First, the general premise: On the world of Ciress, people are governed by various mystical Guilds. Each Guild has a patron spirit, which inhabits the body of the Guild leader to provide council and enhance his or her power. On the day a new leader is going to be appointed to the Nouveau Guild, her sister is branded with a mysterious sigil. Not only is the sister, Giselle, suddenly charged with power, but all of the patron spirits are drawn into her body.That's your basic premise -- for a more in-depth version, read \\"Mystic Volume One.\\" In this volume Gislle has had time to adapt and has just won a major victory over a powerful enemy. She begins behaving oddly, though, like the spoiled party girl she was before given her power, and with her irresponsible attitude, the whole world could be in jeopardy.It speaks well for writer Tony Bedard and former writer Ron Marz that when Giselle becomes the sort of character she was at the beginning of the series the reader experiences a tremendous jolt. That means she's changed, grown, and become a better character along the way. Naturally there's a reason for all of this, but you'll have to read the book to find out what it is. It's well worth it, too. Check out the first three \\"Mystic\\" volumes, then come back for this one."},{"Title":"Mystic Vol. 4: Out All Night (Crossgen)","review":"This is a reprint of issues 21-26 of Crossgen's Mystic series bound as a paperback (a TPB - Trade Paper Back). The art is excellent and the story good but I rated it only 4 stars because the combination of issues in this volume don't quite hang together.#21 is the defeat of the demon queen left over from the previous TPB, which has some repercussions covered in 22-23, 24 involves a fight with a very powerful Ingra. #25 and 26 are the beginning of an arc where main protagonist, Giselle, must prove herself to the 7 guilds and truly learn her craft. This is a great seperate arc which will unfortunately now be split between 2 TPBs (this one and the successor). I really like the arc that begins in #25 and should continue through #31 (7 issues, one for each guild, or style of magic); this arc is going to be a really well done and I'm looking forward to it.The art is excellent (the beautiful women are beautiful, the monsters are monstrous). Good productions values - the colors are really vibrant. Good story except for the arc problem described above. A fun read. I bought this TPB even though I own the original comics for the convenience of having them bound together."},{"Title":"Political Ideologies: An Introduction","review":"It was my Political Studies teacher at school who first showed me that life is about ideas. Different views of human nature, ways in which we believe society and the state should be organised, these are eternal debates that have enslaved and emancipated countless numbers over the centuries. Andrew Heywood's \`Political Ideologies' served me well then at school and continues to do so - I recently went and bought a copy to read over again. The author manages to combine complexity of thought with simplicity of presentation that opens your eyes to why politicians can't ever seem to agree, even when the answer seems obvious to us. The new edition contains new sections that reflect the collapse of communism, the emergence of a global capitalist system, the rise of ethnic nationalism, religious fundamentalism and the advent of postmodernism. The only criticism that I can level at this textbook is that it isn't really designed for an international audience. The author is a British academic and so it isn't that surprising that, for example, the section on conservatism is more relevant to the UK Conservative Party than the GOP. But still, for anyone who cares about life and the way that people should be treated by the state, this is a great introduction that will open up a new world of political possibilities."},{"Title":"Political Ideologies: An Introduction","review":"for an introduction to political ideologies this book is well done and the price is even better. there is a newer version but i would recommend this version for price reasons only, the next edition does include more ideologies towards the end of the book but not terribly important especially for an introduction. there are some criticisms that nationalism and anarchism are not ideologies but they are included and in my opinion are certainly ideologies. the best part of this book is, certainly not the writing, but certain issues are compared by all ideologies, like perspectives on democracy,religion, environment. the book starts with a brief introduction chapter and then proceeds to cover the old ideologies first; liberalism, conservatism, socialism, nationalism, anarchism, fascism is covered and then post material ideologies feminism, ecologism, religious fundamentalism etc. the book is straight forward and easy to understand but many people, probally younger people, will find the read incredibly boring. if you need this book for a class i would recommend this edition instead of the new one, if you want to learn ideologies and are not really interested in personality in writing buy this book for the price. if you do not read too much this book wont be too advanced to understand but just plain boring for reading pleasure but if you don't want a skewed view of ideologies this book is the way to go there is no agenda setting or propaganda in the book."},{"Title":"Political Ideologies: An Introduction","review":"This book makes a nice introduction or review text to the world of political ideologies. The author gives a wealth of information on the history, key themes, and current status of each ideology discussed. Sidebars presenting brief biographical sketches of important names within each ideology are also helpful in providing a more complete picture of where ideas come from. My only complaint is that this book seems to have skipped past the editing process and has made it into print filled with glaring grammatical errors and typos. You can find at least two on any page (I've made a game out of it). Although the information is still valid, it is nevertheless annoying."},{"Title":"Visiting the Art Museum (Reading Rainbow Book)","review":"This is an EXCELLENT book for children as well as parents. It covers artwork from New Guinea to Mexico, artists such as Renoir, Cassatt, Rousseau, Van Gogh, Cezanne, Pollack, Picasso and Warhol, silver items by Paul Revere and various sculptures. Works from Primitive to Twentieth Century. A must-have book for parents who wish to share their enthusiasm, and prepare their children for a visit to the art museum."},{"Title":"Visiting the Art Museum (Reading Rainbow Book)","review":"The idea for this book is cute. In the story a family decides to visit the art museum (presumably for the first time) and the book follows their visit through the museum with complaints and good times. Even though there are complaints in the beginning, everyone is glad they visited the museum in the end. The book is very low on actual content. The writing is done through the bubbles of each person speaking. There is no real information about the art or a museum and how to visit one. Since I have worked for art museums most of my life, I would have like to see something with more helpful information or some educational content along with the fun conversation between the family members otherwise when you have read it once, there is no reason to ever pick it up again."},{"Title":"Visiting the Art Museum (Reading Rainbow Book)","review":"I grew up looking at the pictures in (and later reading) this book. I loved it so much, and I still think about it at age 20! Definitely got me very interested in art and I'm still an artist today!"},{"Title":"Visiting the Art Museum (Reading Rainbow Book)","review":"Following a family on their first trip to the art museum (Son: \\"I can't go. \\"Dinosaurs and Dragons\\" is on! Dad: \\"You're going.\\" Sound familiar?) this book takes the reader on a relatable, humorous field trip. The art is introduced by degrees, and in the end, everyone is nearly ecstatic that they went. Beginning with primitive art, the reader follow the family through Egyptian artifacts, Greek statues (\\"Wow! A nude Frisbee player.), European Arms and Armor, the Renaissance, Impressionism, up through Andy Warhol. Of particular interest to parents and educators, the \\"More About the Art\\" section in the back gives descriptions and brief explanations of each of the specific pieces of art depicted in the book, and offers tips for enjoying an art museum.Marc Brown's soft, colored-pencil and watercolor illustrations are carefully, thoughtfully drawn. Each page features at least one real, specific piece of art which has either been rendered in illustration with careful attention to detail, or, if the publisher was able to acquire printing rights (a sticky wicket in the case of famous art), they have been printed as photographs within the illustration. For example, in the Renaissance Gallery, a photograph of the actual painting \\"The Battle of San Romano\\" by Paolo di Dono is shown, but a rendering based on the painting \\"Saint George and the Dragon\\" by Raphael is used.This book is in no way a comprehensive art study, nor was it intended to be: thirty-two pages is not a lot of space to cover an entire art museum, but if the goal is to educate children and (hopefully) inspire them to go to a real art museum, then Visiting the Museum succeeds admirably on both counts."},{"Title":"Holy Bible: New International Version","review":"I am a portuguese and I do not use the English as a spoken language. I listened to the almost all the 12 cassetes and I found it very comprehensible and easy, because of the vivid style and a smart background sound that put the life of Jesus in the correct ambient (place). The word of God takes the first place. There are 12 cassettes of about 90 minutes each. It is packet in a Nylon Zipper Burgundy bag and the quality of the sound recorded is excellent. The way how the Bible is read is also very, very good, even to persons that have only a few years of English and do not use it everyday as a spoken language. Who can do better for such a price?"},{"Title":"Holy Bible: New International Version","review":"This product (ISBN #052910700-7) refers to the 48 cassette version of the NIV Bible (word-for-word recording), and comes in a nylon zipper pack. The cassettes are &quot;loose&quot; inside the zipper pack, but fit rather snugly inside the pack.

Unfortunately, Shinji saw him. Ever since then, Shini could never trust Keita.Yutaka wants Keita to join them, but Shinji doesn't trust him. This little quarrel may actually turn deadly and threaten Shinji's plan to blow up the school.in conclusion, this was a pretty satisflying volume. Some moments may be dragged out, but it only adds to the suspense. Not my favorite volume, but an exciting action-packed installment nonetheless."},{"Title":"Battle Royale Vol. 7","review":"Well, this has got to be worst volume of Battle Royale that I have read so far. Except for a degraded and so pornographic that it became comedy Mitsuko spotlight tale a few volumes back, this series has prided itself on realistic human reactions to a horrible situation. But Volume 7 has one of the funniest and longest death scenes this side of Monty Python and the Holy Grail when Arthur and the Black Knight battle in an absurd dismemberment dance of comedic bloodsport. Some of the characters in this volume are hit with upwards of 20 bullets and yet still manage to gasp a \\"Win one for the Gipper\\" speech, even as their entrails are falling out. It's pretty pathetic. This entire volume consists of Shinji and Yutaka coming across a cowardly classmate and the repercussions that occur because Shinji does not want to let him join their plan because of an old grudge. This volume was terrible. Battle Royale needs to go back to characterization and a little more realism before it implodes with camp."},{"Title":"Caring for Your Wife in Sickness and in Health: A Husband's Guide to Understanding the Special Health Needs of a Woman","review":"The title seems too obvious - of course you will love your wife in sickness and in health, right?? But as understated as the idea is - many wives or women in general feel a guilt that comes along with being sickly. Many husbands feel a resentment that they would never admit out loud, or they may be trying to help in every way they can, but are floundering with their tactics or knowlegde of how to best handle the situation for your marraige and every day life. This book openly speaks about what many of us sick women are trying to say or need to learn - and it guides a husband on how to care for your wife and understand her when illness' of all sorts invade your life.Regardless of the fact that it was written in 1995, this book still provides practical and healthy ways of looking at the touchy subject of having or being a sick wife. I have never even heard of another book willing to tackle the subject at all. Having a sick wife involves a lot of guilt, or indifference, or misunderstanding for too many couples and families.I myself bought it for my husband, and decided to read it first (being a 24 year old sickly wife). It does have it's religious undertones (written by a minister) but it is not overzealous at all, and actually relies more on the facts of life, moreso than religious applications. But it is written with a very tender tone, so husband and wife can feel openminded to the contents.It applies to women of all ages with all kinds of illness' or emotional concerns. The author is not afraid to address how having or being a sick wife will affect your job, your home life, your finances, your sex life, and your ability to TALK about what bothers/ails you. I found it very insightful to discuss the fact that many husbands are in the dark about how to react and treat your wife when she experiences things the husband doesn't have. I love the fact that this doctor is willing to admit things that us as wives do in our health challenged situations, and how a husband might or should be reacting. He helps a wife look at things also from a more positive perspective, so that we can take control of our lives, instead of letting our illness' define us.This book discusses plenty of case examples and situations, covering subjects of PMS, menopause, depression,injuries, chronic illness, fatal illness, a propensity to be sickly, etc. It is rich in practical ways to COMMUNICATE about how the various sickness affect your husband, your kids, and your life in general.I have shed a lot of personal guilt for being a sickly wife while reading this book. I now know ways that I can communicate with my husband, and tips for ways he can communicate, empathize, and better help me and our marriage. It really does open your eyes to knowing that wives - you are not alone in whatever you are experiencing....and that husbands - you are not alone either, and it's ok to talk about it, be honest, and delve into whatever helps the both of you.I will be giving this book to my mother when my husband and I are through with it, and I recommend any wife that's reads the title and might be interested to please, BUY the book and give it to your husband or read it yourself and discuss the applicable things you find. Husbands, be proactive and buy the book for yourself - it's so much more than an 'understanding your wife' book.....because when your wife's health isn't the best, your whole life will change."},{"Title":"Caring for Your Wife in Sickness and in Health: A Husband's Guide to Understanding the Special Health Needs of a Woman","review":"It will be helpful to see the chapter titles:1.

Is It Worth It?Most of the information in the book I had previously been exposed to from other marriage/relations sources, but there was enough new material to probably make it worth my time. Of course, for some people (maybe younger ones), much of this may be new. The author is a physician, and as such seems overly ready to medicate, in my opinion. I am biased against behavior altering drugs, but am not a physician, so take that as you will. The book is written from a Christian perspective and has frequent biblical references. It is obviously titled and written for men (as am I), but I believe that women might also find it interesting . . . perhaps more so than men in some instances. A useful read for anyone coping with a spouse with chronic illness."},{"Title":"The Far Away Man (The Faraway Man)","review":"This is an unusual murder mystery set, as are most of William Marshall's books, in the fictional Hong Bay section of Hong Kong in the last several decades of British rule in Hong Kong. This time, Chief Inspector Fieffer, O'Yee, Spencer,and Auden are looking for a seemingly cold-blooded killer who is murdering Hong Kong residents who apparently have no connection to each other. As in other Yellowthread Street mysteries, it is up to Fieffer and company to figure out the connection between the crimes they are investigating. In this book, the connection is filled with irony, sadness, and greed, making this book far more than just a murder mystery. Marshall deserves to be much better known, and read, in this country than he apparently is. I hope, with Amazon.com's help, that he finds additional readers."},{"Title":"The Far Away Man (The Faraway Man)","review":"I like the way William Marshall writes so of course I liked the book. It is funny, imaginative and well written, it holds your attention to the very end. The characters are well drawn and interesting.

With such fine teachers and role models at her service Ruth Gilmore brings the word of Christ to the minds and hearts of little people and big people.It is true that &quot;Faith comes from hearing the word of Christ&quot; and what better way to have it grow and blossom in our lives than through images inspired by the Bible connected to the real wonder of life as this collection of sermons so aptly does.The core message of each sermon is faithfully grounded in the scriptures and theological excellence. The core message in each sermon is gracious and enlightning and to the point.I wholeheartedly recommend this book to pastors and youth workers entrusted with the proclamation of the good news of Jesus Christ to children. I even recommend this to parents who would find this a great tool to help them pass on the gift of faith to their kids."},{"Title":"Saving the Ants: And 58 Other Kid's Sermons from the Gospel of Matthew (Children's Sermons)","review":"I was a little disappointed in that the cover says 58 Kids Sermons from the Gospel of Matthew.

I have some knowledge of the language, and a good amount of vocab already. But I needed help with sentence structure and how to form sentences. I just got the CD's (I've owned the book for a while) and they are extremely helpful! I have traveled to Latvija 4 times, so I have heard it before but the CD is extremely helpful to have on my iPod to listen to all the time. I highly recommend this book/CD set to anyone learning Latvian, from very beginner to intermediate. Once you complete this book you will have a much better understanding of the Latvian Language!

I can understand this because after all, learning something requires memorization, but I think it goes too fast and you're gonna end up tripping in your Latvian test (If you even get one, I mean, I don't).

This explains why there are nearly no courses to learn it on one's own.But this one is definitely the best..if we agree with the structure and principles of this form of tuition which is not my case you'll find that it is the best existing method to learn Latvian at this date. Why do I say so? Because to my feeling ( and I speak 6 languages and continuously improve on them)the best existing method is the Pimsleur approach because it is founded on psychological grounds but Latvian not being a main language there is no Pimsleur course for Latvian learning.Pimsleur has also its drawbacks because it has to be backed up by a good grammarical manual and progressive learning method.. and there are a few as regards the main languages.From this point of view \\"Teach yourself Latvian\\" is a well designed help for the grammatical basis of the language but as all language courses it's trying to teach much too fast without any serious account for the way memory works; from this point of view Assimil is more reasonably paced.But do not hesitate to buy this course if you are SERIOUSLY motivated..you have a lot of work ahead but it's worth it.All the more that it is extremely reasonably priced"},{"Title":"\\"Honey, Let's Get a Boat \\" : A Cruising Adventure of America's Great Loop","review":"I lived every leg of the journey with them!

A good help for when my husband and I live out my dream to do this loop in our 44ft boat."},{"Title":"\\"Honey, Let's Get a Boat \\" : A Cruising Adventure of America's Great Loop","review":"This is a great book for (a) introducing the concept of the Great Loop tour to those unfamiliar with it in detail and (b) giving one couple's story with some cute stuff, mostly at the beginning about how they talked themselves into trying it. That was fine. The opening parts of the actual trip where they encountered huge and unexpected mechanical issues that cost them time and money were also a great cautionary tale for my wife and I who, if we do this someday as we plan, will NEVER do it in a used boat without much more \\"due diligence\\" about the boat AND the broker than these folks employed.Now about those attitudes. Another reviewer mentioned some of the stuff about race relations and the South which I found to be annoying as well and my wife, a native Southerner, found offensively stereotypical, but let's be clear. It isn't that they're prejudiced against minorities--no, they're presuming racism amongst southern whites and that's really crude and hardly as enlightened as these clearly \\"progressive\\" Californians probably think themselves to be. Add to that a bunch of opinions about the values of various religious groups and denominations, a few environmental screeds that show a level of political correct naivete, and you get storytellers who lose track of their story to lecture to you or make themselves feel morally superior, which isn't fun to read for long. Some of their historical \\"guidebook\\" stories about various places are endless and detailed without being interesting or unique--it is as if they said \\"Hey, we have to put some of this stuff in if we want to go for that award for guidebooks to goose sales and notoriety, so let's do it\\" without much visible passion about any of the subjects covered.So...when they're telling their interpersonal stuff, their aspirations, and cruising along, this book is quite charming, but it wears out its welcome on these other matters so often that by halfway through you find yourself \\"skipping ahead\\" to the practical stuff, or at least we did. Worth getting if you know you're getting into all that, but buyer beware. Have a thick skin and a good \\"skimming\\" sense and take out of it what is valuable without dredging through the muck that abounds in certain passages."},{"Title":"\\"Honey, Let's Get a Boat \\" : A Cruising Adventure of America's Great Loop","review":"Ron &amp; Eva have a gift for writing for boater's.

Gliding along waterways in a comfortable trawler, with everything you could possibly need on board, at your fingertips. Putting up at night in exciting or quiet venues, watching nature up close or meeting new people along the way who are making this joyous trip around The Great Loop.

I wanted to know why this journey is so popular among so many and why so many boaters tell me that doing the Great Loop is their ultimate goal as boat owners. Well, I am very impressed Mr and Mrs. Stob! Although, I have to say that you had to navigate through some bad weather, the journey really offers the variety that we are looking for in a boating adventure. I am also pretty impressed that Eva and Ron managed to squeeze almost a year of adventures and over 5500 miles in such a small book. When I finished reading I said to my husband: \\"Honey, let's save!\\" They helped me understand more of the day to day life on the Great Loop. I liked the fact that they focused on regular people that they met along the way. They are not talking about huge adventures but little fun things that make our lives so full on daily bases. Only when reading the book I realized that I could coordinate this journey with my family's and friends' vacation time and spend even more quality time with them on our boat while away from home. I also want to thank them for starting the America's Great Loop Cruisers' Association that has been incredibly helpful in getting more information about the journey."},{"Title":"\\"Honey, Let's Get a Boat \\" : A Cruising Adventure of America's Great Loop","review":"This is a delightful book if you keep in mind what it is.

The reading of your book gave me great pleasure and makes me want to do it all over again."},{"Title":"\\"Honey, Let's Get a Boat \\" : A Cruising Adventure of America's Great Loop","review":"I started out really enjoying this book as I too have dreams of completing the Great Loop when I retire. However, the more I read, the more I became annoyed by the author's writing style or storytelling. Some things that really annoyed me, noting the black people he came into contact with - the black students near Savannah State or the black boiled peanut vendor. I don't remember him writing about the white dockmaster or the fellow white boat owners. It seemed odd to me and made him somehow less credible. Also, referring to his wife as \\"toots\\" or \\"m'lady\\"? Ugh. And the part about his wife claiming she will become \\"flat chested\\" by leaning over the sink to do dishes? What was that about? I guess he tried to add a personal touch to the story with these things, but like I said, I just ended up being annoyed.I also found myself wishing he did a better job of letting the reader know what time of year it was while he was in each place. He would say things like \\"the beginning of the season\\" or \\"it is common this time of year\\", but that has drastically different meanings for different geographic regions.If you can sift through that kind of stuff, I think he did a pretty good job of pointing out places of interest along the Great Loop. While some other reviewers said it was like reading a tourist pamphlet, I found myself mentally adding those places to my list of stops in a few years."},{"Title":"\\"Honey, Let's Get a Boat \\" : A Cruising Adventure of America's Great Loop","review":"Can't wait until they take the trip again and tell us what the cost are now, i.e. fuel, dockage and other expenses..."},{"Title":"\\"Honey, Let's Get a Boat \\" : A Cruising Adventure of America's Great Loop","review":"I was really prepared to like this book for a lot of reasons. The author's wife had a South Dakota connection and we live in South Dakota. We're deeply into boating and expect to do the Great Loop someday. It was generally good reading and avoided getting into a rut, which some Great Loop blogs and books can easily do. \\"Today we sailed here, locked through, then sailed there, locked through...\\" The author avoids that temptation. The author and his wife also started the Great Loop Cruisers Association (AGLCA) which is just huge to those doing or contemplating the Great Loop. I feel like I owe them some good will just for that. However, I would recommend this book except for one thing, and at least one of the other reviewers mentioned this. The author adopts this really snide and superior tone once in a while and gets downright insulting. For example, his mother in law joins the trip at one point, and he ceaselessly concentrates on her advanced age to the point where it got really irritating. He makes what he considers to be clever cracks about her age until it long stops being funny. More distracting though, he insults the United States and Americans just a few times, but so harshly that I don't know why he doesn't just renounce his citizenship. \\"Americans are strident and vulgar.\\" He even attacks the U.S. national anthem. Now maybe he's trying to be funny again -- and if this were a political commentary book by Jon Stewart it wouldn't be so jarring or distracting. It's too bad he didn't have an editor to suggest he cut out even just the first page of Chapter 13. I'm not oversensitive about criticisms of the U.S., and I don't mind writing that explores cultural differences on a trip -- but those few harsh attacks on the U.S. and Americans and that superior, snobby tone he adopts from time to time were really distracting and grating.For those preparing to do the Loop this book is pretty dated now as far as specifics go. They did their trip in the mid 1990's, before 9/11, before $4 gas (well, $6 gas at marinas), before a lot of changes, but because the Stobs are the founders of AGLCA I would read it just for that reason."},{"Title":"\\"Honey, Let's Get a Boat \\" : A Cruising Adventure of America's Great Loop","review":"I found the book very entertaining and informative.

Ron and Eva Stob do a wonderful job of recounting their year-long journey on a forty-foot trawler, which began in Florida and circled up along the intercoastal waterway to New York and then up the Hudson River to Lakes George and Champlain to the Saint Lawrence River in Canada and on to the Great Lakes and Chicago and then down the river systems to the Gulf of Mexico and back to Florida. This route, known as \\"America's Great Loop,\\" took them through waterways, locks, scenery, history, and cultures as varied as one could find anywhere.Even though the book is written in the first person by Ron as the narrator, I can assure you, on the basis of having had the good fortune of meeting this delightful couple, Eva had a big part in helping relate the experiences encountered throughout their year of traveling these waterways. The book is a great read from start to finish and includes an appendix, which is a guidebook to anyone contemplating a similar venture. From the interesting and humorous aspects of just how this couple took the leap of quitting their jobs and finding and purchasing the trawler to their final encounter with the tropical storm Gordon,( becoming Hurricane Gordon,) as they returned to Florida after their year of cruising, the reader will be fascinated by vivid descriptions of places and cultures, as well as the difficulties and near disasters. Ron's \\"tongue in cheek\\" satire and humor and his honest self-criticism enhance the imagery of the book and bring alive the characters and places.The book relates as much about the history and culture of the places visited along the way as it does the process of navigating the waterways. Even though I had been to a number of places mentioned, I was not aware of all the history and cultural aspects the narrator reveals.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in travel, by whatever means, as it is just the thing for the intellectually curious.This book is published by Raven Cove Publishing of Greenback, Tennessee, and can be ordered at Raven Cove Publishing; P.O. Box 168, Greenback, TN 37742-0168 or phone 865/856-7888. The book is also available through Amazon Books on the Internet.

The only one I know of is &quot;Honey Lets get a Boat.&quot; We first found the Stobs at a boat show in Florida, we heard of their book and bought a copy, we read through it in one night and we were hooked. We bought a boat of our own, a 46 footer and we started in Florida last summer (2000), we left it in New York on the Erie Canal for the winter. I should say here that we only can travel in the summer during school break, we're on the move with 4 kids ages 9 to 13. And this is not a race, it is an adventure of a lifetime. We bought 6 more books from the Stobs, their book explains better than we could what we are doing.

The descriptions of the travel are very well written. The experiences aboard will be appreciated by addicted boaters and non-boaters alike. This is an adventure story.

Further, I found the tale of the couple on their newly-acquired boat to be both eventful and engaging.For those thinking of getting a boat the book really shines. The information appendix in the back includes things such as alternative routes and places to stop, how to get into boating, the budgeted and actual expenses, miles, etc. of the authors.

The author could have written about what it's like to live on a boat or what it's like to cruise on the East Coast or even why he chose to cruise the Great Loop. Instead I got treated to page after page of half-baked history (copied from tourist brouchures) and tales of personal slights (real and imagined) from marina owners, fellow boaters, and any local unlucky enough to meet up with 'Grumpy' when things weren't going his way.

What I didn't like was his overuse of the simile...it just seemed flowery and excessive. Also, the book could use a bit of editing/proofreading.

It shows the builder of the bridge, his distress at the bridge's failure, and his surprise that he is still alive after the bridge is taken out by a flash flood.Kipling was like Mulder in X-Files: \\"I want to believe.\\" But his early childhood was filled with Indian mythology, and when he was taken to England and brutally abandoned in the care of a sadistic woman, he learned Christianity as a religion of fear and pain. He saw his sister lose her mind as a result of her mediumistic activity, and he had dreams that convinced him of the reality of reincarnation. So what he wanted to believe was something that even he didn't know.It's probably safe to assume, however, that he didn't really believe that the collapse of the bridge was brought about by a conspiracy of several Indian gods and goddesses. But we don't know, and will never know, what he did believe."},{"Title":"The Bridge Builders","review":"This is a very good book written by Rudyard Kipling and gives you the way life was in the olden days.

Of course the descriptions are quite brief, as they must be for this kind of quick reference. This is not a picture book so it does not contain colored photographs, but it does include useful line drawings of many deities.The major problem I find is a lack of references to more detailed information for those who want to learn more about a particular deity.

Excellent! Wiltse is truly the master of keeping the tension building"},{"Title":"Close To The Bone","review":"Author David Wiltse must be prescient. A friend loaned me his copy of this wonderful book which is out of print (why?) and I was bowled over. It's about the search for a terrorist in New York City. Talk about relevant after September 11. But for all the adventure and plot (and what a great character John Becker is) he also has a very moving portrayal of a young woman in conflict with herself and her yearning sensuality. My only regret is that I didn't read it when it first came out so I could be rereading it now."},{"Title":"Close To The Bone","review":"This book is amazing, the first thing I mention when telling people about this book is that one of the main character in it, kills/disables people by jamming objects so hard into his ear and through his skull that he causes permanent brain damage, plus it has a sexual, lusty side to it also. I loved this book and am an avid reader, I read it when I was only 14 or 15, and now, at 19, I can't wait to go back and read it again, see if my opinions have changed. It's very unlikely butit will be interesting to see if it still holds that excitement."},{"Title":"Close To The Bone","review":"David wiltse's follow-up to his magnificient A PRAYER FOR THE DYING is a dynamite entertainment which reveals more and more about its landmark hero John Becker. What was implied about Becker's demons in the first outing is explained in more detail here, exuding dramatic plausibility and disturbing undertones. And Bahoud makes for a very worthy adversary, a man who's not too behaviorally different from the man hunting him. Bogs down a little in Bahoud's scenes with the handicapped Myrtle, and maybe Becker picks up his trail a little too implausibly at times. But the overall result is a definite winner."},{"Title":"Close To The Bone","review":"Very puzzling to me that David Wiltse is not much better known in the Mystery/Crime Fiction genre. Everything I've read by him thus far has been very impressive, and this novel was no exception. I really think he belongs on the top shelf of crime fiction authors. John Becker, the FBI agent who features in this tale (and others in the series), is a fascinating, memorable character, and Wiltse weaves a mesmerizing, addictive plot into the mix. This one has plenty of political intrique, an international angle, and some horribly grisly crimes. Skillful plotting ensures that you will read this novel very quickly, caught up in both the crime angle and the endearing elements of Becker's character."},{"Title":"Close To The Bone","review":"I got this book in a couple of days and I really liked reading it.

Maybe that's why I love _The Armless Maiden_. The tales and poems here do include sex and violence, yes, but at their heart is the triumph of the human spirit.If we look carefully at fairy tales, many of them are actually about what we would now call child abuse. Cinderella was neglected. Handel and Gretel were abandoned. Donkeyskin suffered incest. And there are so many more. And in most of the stories, the protagonist rises above the situation somehow--in the old versions, usually by gaining fortune and position. In the stories in _The Armless Maiden_, the triumph is more often psychological. I read once--I think it was in a book by Marina Warner--that the essential theme of the fairy tale is transformation. In these stories, we see victims transformed into survivors.These are serious fairy tales for our times, and I recommend the book both to abuse survivors and to those who did not suffer abuse (trust me, everyone knows someone who did). My personal favorite contributions are Emma Bull's poem about Cinderella's stepsister regretting the friendship they never had, and Ellen Kushner's &quot;Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep&quot;, the story of a young girl in the custody of a cold-hearted guardian, and haunted by the ghost of the woman's unhappy daughter."},{"Title":"The Armless Maiden: And Other Tales for Childhood's Survivors","review":"This book has a myriad of short stories, poems, &amp; essays about survivors of child abuse. They are all worked around fairy-tale themes but not Disneyified: no handsome prince comes to rescue a child; instead, these children escape through their own courage &amp; perseverance. An AMAZING book. A shame it is out of print--but I've seen copies used &amp; in remainder bins at bookstores so do yourself a favor &amp; keep looking! This book will make you shudder, weep, cringe, but ultimately leaves you w/a feeling of hope. All the pieces are good, but standouts include Terri Windling's, Charles De Lint's, Ellen Steiber's, &amp; Munro Sickafoose's. Another wonderful aspect is that Windling ignores genre boundaries &amp; hence you see authors such as Sharon Olds &amp; Anne Sexton represented as well. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Armless Maiden: And Other Tales for Childhood's Survivors","review":"This book changed my life. I had always enjoyed books edited by Terri Windling, so when I saw her name, it was an automatic purchase. All the stories were excellent, though somewhat harrowing. But it was Ms. Windling's afterward at the end that reduced me to tears. The idea of her going through all that and surviving, even thriving, truly stunned me with her courage. And that is the theme to this book, surviving. When I was done, I sat back and took a long hard look at my own life. And I knew that if she could survive and live, I could too. I won't go into what happened in my childhood, but I had never dealt with it, and it was killing me inside. But after I read this, I got help. Thanks to a kind counsellor, I am happier now than I have ever been. And I have the courage to say yes to life. Read this book. Even if you have never been abused, the insights are invaluable. Also I would recommend 'Deerskin' by Robin McKinley."},{"Title":"The Armless Maiden: And Other Tales for Childhood's Survivors","review":"This anthology is one of the most emotionally wrenching and satisfying collections of stories that I've read-not just from fantasy authors, but from anyone.

Some exceptional stories are \\"The Armless Maiden\\" by Midori Snyder, \\"The Juniper Tree\\" by Peter Straub, \\"The Lion and the Lark\\" by Patricia McKillip, \\"The Lily and the Weaver's Heart\\" by Nancy Etchemendy, \\"In the House of My Enemy\\" by Charles De Lint, and \\"In the Night Country\\" by Ellen Steiber.

I read a lot, and I enjoy a lotof books - but not many actually leave me short of breath.This collection (of fiction, poetry, memoir and essays) looksat childhood and growing up through the lens of myth andespecially fairy tale. PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS IS NOTA BOOK FOR CHILDREN, HOWEVER. (It probably isn't a book formost adults.) It emcompasses a wide range of stylesand subject matter; some of the pieces turn a bright, unwav-ering light on child abuse, violence, rape and death. Whatleft me breathless wasn't the ugliness of the subject matterthough; it was the thrill of really great writing. Fearless,enobling creativity. Windling even includes statements fromthe authors about the process of writing some of the pieces;they're interesting, and also provide a respite from thepieces themselves, sort of a &quot;tension and release&quot; mechanism.Standouts are Yolen and de Lindt, neither of whose work wasfamiliar to me before this anthology. I'm thrilled that thisbook is coming out in paperback, and that it has anotherchance to find the audience it deserves. (Also that I'll beable to afford more copies for gifts.)"},{"Title":"The Armless Maiden: And Other Tales for Childhood's Survivors","review":"In 46 stories, poems, memoirs, and essays, this a collection of childhood suffering and survival as explored in and through fairy tales, from wicked stepmothers and licentious kings to magical girls and wolf-hearted boys. The Armless Maiden is desperately well-intended, and succeeds and fails on account. Its subject is already prevalent in fairy tales and their retellings, and it well deserves to be collected and fully explored--but this collection pushes thematic into the realm of didactic. Such a direct focus on this theme renders it ineffective: it strips away the magic of the fairy tale metaphor and denies the subtleties of interpretation that could make these stories meaningful and convincing; it hammers home its message with all the grace of a disease-of-the-week or Lifetime movie. Windling's brief, blatant introductions to the short stories only exaggerate this flaw--skip them if you can. The result is too often artless, shallow where it should be resonant, edging up on sensationalized and cheaply cathartic, and simply not all that it could or should be.Yet somehow, the anthology as a whole maintains a certain effective atmosphere. Perhaps it's that theme does beg collection, because it is so prevalent and so powerful--and so even a subpar collection is, in its way, rewarding. Perhaps its that not all the selections were written for The Armless Maiden--and the reprints are often the best, the least transparent, the least didactic, of the lot. Certainly it's that Windling's arrangement is fantastic--she's a practiced and polished editor, and this anthology flows beautifully: a varied pace (with a particularly superb ratio of poetry to prose) keeps it fresh, while thematic and tonal growth give it forward momentum. I prefered the poems, with Delia Sherman's Snow White to the Prince and Terri Windling's Brother and Sister among my favorites; the prose is less successful, but Peter Straub's The Juniper Tree and Joanna Russ's The Dirty Little Girl are welcome exceptions, and many of the brief memoirs are quite strong. Some of the short stories are accompanied by essays by the author, and while this theme can stand up to analysis, these analyses have an unfortunate knack for wandering from insights to truisms. The exception is Windling's remarkable afterward, which captures the balance between the metaphorical and literal, the implied and actual, of fairy tales themselves and the readers and writers who interpret them. The problem is that so little else in the anthology finds this balance--but other fairy tales and retellings, even if they have a less obvious focus on child abuse, do. The Armless Maiden has atmosphere and intent, but its content is mixed, with a few standout selections but many more which are disappointing. It's compelling and effective at the time, but leaves only a shallow final impression. I recommend it with those caveats: I applaud what Windling tries to do, and would rather read this collection than none--but I would have preferred, and the theme deserves, something that goes beyond good intentions, something more impassioned than didactic, sometime of greater art and impact."},{"Title":"The Armless Maiden: And Other Tales for Childhood's Survivors","review":"These are retold fairy tales, but not the funny ones. Still, by exploring the tragedy, warmth, and soulfulness of these tales, deeply talented authors delve into the soul and try to find comfort int hese new flavors of fairy tales."},{"Title":"The Armless Maiden: And Other Tales for Childhood's Survivors","review":"Here are a couple of fairy tales about the tangles and troubles of childhood and abuse. They were all very interesting: stories of an imaginary city that one can only be transported by the West Wind, the seventh little mermaid, a love story of a lion and a woman named Lark, etc. The most interesting story was by Jane Yolen, about a king so overcome with grief over his dead wife he refuses to let his daughter grow out of her mother's shadow. The only quibble I have about the anthology was that it felt so anti-male. Granted, the statistics show that males are the more common abusers, I would have liked to have some more depth in the women who abused (like why? instead of how?). The Snow White therapy session and the ghost dancers story, in my personal opinion, seemed to inadequately describe why some women would abuse their children, while &quot;In The House of My Enemy&quot; depict men as monsters without any true reason. Other than that, they are great stories. But none to be told to your kids in a Disney-esque manner."},{"Title":"Luther's Works Selected Psalms I/Chapters 2, 8, 19, 23, 26, 45 and 51 (Luther's Works)","review":"I had been looking to add Luther's Works to My Logos Libronix Digital Library System for some time.

This artificial language throws in some less than common sounds, and creates a somewhat unusual syntax, and attempts to sell the result as the speech of an alien race.A few minutes with this book will suggest to the reader who takes an interest in these things that Klingon is a profound failure. Here we have a record of people here on Earth who have created alternative linguistic structures that are even more unfamiliar to English speakers. This book will open your mind to the astonishing variety of ways human verbal communication can be categorised and organised. We have languages with no clear distinction between nouns and verbs, and languages that can give tense and conditionality to adjectives. We have languages that use different pronouns for a 'we' that includes the person being addressed, and a 'we' that excludes that person.For a reader with interests in these matters, this will be a fascinating, if somewhat dry, read.

Anyone who is interested in languages will find it well-done and fascinating, and all linguists should have this reference on their bookshelf."},{"Title":"The Languages of Native North America (Cambridge Language Surveys)","review":"Being a foreign languageaphile, I really enjoy this book.

Maxine Anderson provides a brief introduction to the Civil War that talks about how it all began and who were some of the important political and military leaders on both sides, but obviously a history textbook is going to give young students more details (i.e., the names, dates, and places that students will need to know on the test). But the two main sections of the book are devoted to projects that help students understand what live was like on the battlefield and on the homefront.There is some background material for these products, so this is not just a \\"How to\\" book. The first section of \\"On the Battlefield\\" looks at bands and music during the Civil War before providing a pair of projects where you get to make your own Civil War bugle and drum. In the first half of the book there are projects for making a pinhole camera; a Union Fort Sumter, South Carolina Palmetto, and/or California 100 flag; the ironclads \\"Monitor\\" and \\"Virginia\\"; a lean-to shelter; a paddlewheeler; periscope; telegraph; and signal flags. There is also the opportunity to make some battlefield food from Union hardtack (if the students have been misbehaving I suppose), Confederate Johnny Cakes (spread with butter or molasses, which, as Anderson points out, was \\"a treat Confederates didn't often get), or the cornbread popular on both sides. Anderson even explains how to make your own Union or Confederate jacket, as well as a forage cap or Zouave fez, which might be more reasonable.The \\"On the Homefront\\" section looks at how civilians deal with hardships and deprivations during the war. The projects consist of making your own berry ink and handmade paper; four patch quilt block, pillow or wall hanging, and/or four patch quilt; corn husk, rag, and/or hanky dolls; fan or cameo; banjo or tambourine; and Underground Railroad lantern. This time the food related projects consist of making your own fruit dehydrator, molasses taffy, and rock candy.For each project Anderson provides a list of \\"What You'll Need,\\" and step-by-step instructions on \\"What To Do.\\" The back of the book has Templates for Projects, such as circles, squares and stars to go along with some of the key elements in the flags. Throughout the book there are reminders to \\"Know Your Slang,\\" so that you will learn \\"web feet\\" is a term the cavalry had for the infantry and a \\"housewife\\" was your sewing kit. You will also find Civil War Facts & Trivia (e.g., President Lincoln had to cross the street from the White House to check telegraph messages) scattered throughout the book, along with dozens of informative sidebars where Anderson talks about everything from photographer Mathew Brady and inventor John Ericsson to the color uniforms used to different branches on the battlefield and Southern food prices.There appear to be only two other titles in the Build It Yourself series to date, \\"Great Colonial American Projects You Can Build Yourself\\" and \\"Amazing Leonardo Da Vinci Inventions You Can Build Yourself,\\" but hopefully there will be more in the future because it would be nice for history teachers to have more choices for incorporating these sort of projects into various units. Obviously you do not have to do all of them, but there are certainly enough in this volume that you could do a couple of different ones each year for a while before you started repeating yourself (unless, of course, you get really hooked on something like making your own rock candy or pinhole camera)."},{"Title":"Great Civil War Projects You Can Build Yourself (Build It Yourself series)","review":"We all know that a great way for kids--and adults--to learn new information or a new skill is to take book knowledge and apply it. This book offers readers many opportunities to sew, build, construct, and cook up items applicable to the Civil War, using ordinary objects.

Lizzie &quot;has it all&quot; -- the good-looking husband, two well-behaved children, a spacious country home, and a successful gallery/shop she runs with her husband. She worries about Frances, her single twin, who seems to lead, in Lizzie's estimation, an unfulfilled existence (since it is in complete contrast to her own life). Frances is a travel agent who travels to Spain and meets Luis, a man who will have a dramatic impact on her life. When Frances decides to pursue a relationship with Luis, Lizzie begins obsessing over Frances' life and loses sight of the events in her own life. At first read one would call this the story of Frances' awakening and growth but it is really the story of the evolution of both sisters and the impact on the other people in their lives. The characters and plot are well-developed and the book is well-written. The ending is a bit contrived but still believable. Amazingly I did not take the cynical view that these people could not possibly exist or that the events could not happen -- Trollope made me WANT to believe them! This is an excellent summer read - escapism with substance."},{"Title":"A Spanish Lover","review":"This lushly written novel presents the choices women face through the device of twins whose lives have taken different turns. Lizzie, a domestic goddess who presides over a rambling house and manages four unruly children, also (with her husband, Robert) runs a gallery/shop whose offerings are in exquisite taste. Frances, the more retiring twin, is a loner who discovers sexual passion with a dapper, middle-aged Spaniard who reciprocates her ardor. From the point of view of this novel's oh-so-English characters, this is an affair of epic proportions, and it sweeps them all up in its headlong course.Although Frances is the more interesting, risk-taking twin, this is at heart the story of how Lizzie comes to terms with her sister's liberation and achieves a hard-won freedom herself. The twins' mother, Barbara, also strikes out on her own, leaving her husband to find his own way of coping. Unlike the characters in some women's fiction, the men here are endearing but not romanticized. The ending is a bit pat (endings are difficult), but this novel contains much to enjoy, not least the Spanish vignettes, along with insights to think back upon."},{"Title":"A Spanish Lover","review":"I am a big Trolloppe fan, and enjoyed this book because it let me get to know the two main characters in enough depth so I wasn't going &quot;huh?&quot; every time someone said or did something, a minor complaint in some of her other novels, where dozens of characters are thrown at you. I savored the contrast between scenes set in chilly Bath and sunny, historic Spain. What I didn't quite believe at first was how the Spanish Lover, Luis, would go so nuts over prim Frances in the first place, but what happens at the end, which I won't give away, rings true for this kind of man operating in this kind of culture. The back story of the parents seemed labored and not entirely believable. It actually detracted from the otherwise strong believability of the twins. I always groan when a baby appears at the end of a book, making a paste-on happy ending, and as if to rectify all wrongs, but the ending here was bittersweet and mixed for both sisters. Life moves along in its real, sometimes thwarted way."},{"Title":"A Spanish Lover","review":"I think that Joanna Trollope does an excellent job of exploring the choices that we make as individuals and how those choices impact where our lives go. Her characters are normal people who make imperfect choices and have to deal with the good and bad consequences.In this book, I think that she jumped a little too much and didn't focus on character development as much as she could have. She established the main characters quite well, then had them change their behaviour too quickly, without enough of an explanation.I did enjoy that she set a good portion of the book in Spain and did try to capture a different atmosphere besides the usual English background that she uses for her other books.This is a great book to read on your first days of vacation or after a stressful week."},{"Title":"A Spanish Lover","review":"Lizzie and Frances are nearly identical twins in &quot;A Spanish Lover,&quot; by Joanna Trollope. Lizzie and her husband have a business, four children, and a beautiful home. Frances, on the other hand, is unmarried and seems to be drifting along without a sense of direction.Frances at last decides to step out of her sister's shadow and become her own person. She starts a travel business, which becomes a great success, and she begins an unconventional love affair with a married Spaniard. Meanwhile, Lizzie and Richard suffer serious financial setbacks that threaten their comfortable lifestyle. Lizzie, who has always been self-satisfied and even-tempered, cannot help but be jealous and resentful of her twin's financial and emotional independence.Joanna Trollope is a contemporary Jane Austen. With a keen eye, she examines how time, economic circumstances, and romantic entanglements can upset the delicate balance of a relationship. She also explores the theme of whether we should try to please our families or ourselves. Trollope shows how making life-altering decisions can involve some serious tradeoffs. As one character in the book aptly states, &quot;There is no change without sacrifice.&quot;The author's writing flows naturally and her language is lyrical and beautifully descriptive. The characters are vividly portrayed and the dialogue is humorous, poignant, and insightful. I highly recommend &quot;A Spanish Lover&quot; for its rich detail and its penetrating look at contemporary family life."},{"Title":"A Spanish Lover","review":"Somehow, this novel seemed a bit flat to me. It needed an injection of fizz. This was the second novel of Trollope's that I read, and I thought that the characters in &quot;The Spanish Lover&quot; were not as fleshed-out nor as believable as those in &quot;Marrying the Mistress.&quot;Or perhaps I just should not have read two of Trollope's books in a row. Maybe I expected too much of this book.The author uses the device of grownup twin sisters to compare and contrast their lives. The two women, Frances and Lizzie, are very different. When Frances takes a married Spanish lover, the book becomes not just the story of her romance, but the story of how Lizzie deals with it, and what happens to her life as a result of her twin's affair.The ending was a bit too pat and predictable, but all in all, the novel was fairly enjoyable and quickly read."},{"Title":"A Spanish Lover","review":"Can people really change their innermost selves? In this fabulous Trollope story, the answer is a resounding no, and it echoes from generation to generation.William and Barbara, staunch, middle-class, and proper, astonish themselves when they conceive twins. Barbara is not at all pleased, somehow embarrassed by this quite excessive show of pregnancy and birth. William, however, is enchanted. Imagine, he thinks, a conservative schoolteacher, nothing to recommend himself, really, and he has begotten twins! It makes him feel very important, and that's a good thing, because when Elizabeth (Lizzie) and Frances finally make their appearance, Barbara is quite disgusted and repelled by the mere thought of any further mothering.William becomes a house-husband of sorts, and Barbara, in her no-nonsense way, sees to her daughters' non-emotional needs. It works well until the girls are 10 years old, at which time comfortable, boring, predictable Barbara takes off for Marrakesh on a hippie trek (a truly hilarious plot twist). She is gone for some time, during which William begins a discreet love affair with the local artist, Juliet. Nevertheless, when Barbara comes back (not having succeeded in becoming a hippie or even a successful feminist, another hobby horse of hers), William takes her back as a natural course of events. He also keeps Juliet on the side; Barbara knows about this, and things continue, changed, but not really.Fast forward 25 years. Lizzie, having had a fling at artsy life herself, is married to a fellow student, Rob, and the two have created a very successful art/antiques/crafts boutique. They live in a large, sprawling house, and have four children. Lizzie works away at the huge mouthful of life she has endeavored to swallow--boutique, children, house, dutiful daughter, loving wife, loyal twin. As much as she thinks of herself as more successful at life than Barbara, she is more like her mother (albeit more giving) than she would ever want to be.It is only Frances, the gadfly, the unpredictable, the &quot;different,&quot; who seems to have a &quot;real&quot; life. She has remained unmarried, had a series of unsuccessful love affairs, and runs a highly successful travel agency. The rest of the family is constantly worried about her...almost like she must fit into the mold in order to be happy. She seems quite happy enough--especially when she meets her Spanish lover (he of the book's title) halfway into the book. A torrid, gorgeous, passionate, beautiful, storybook affair ensues, much to the consternation of everybody else, who are waiting for the shoe to drop. Lizzie is worried and jealous--the business has begun to fail, and she and husband Rob are beset with money worries. Barbara, who knows nothing of passion (and doesn't approve of it), is waiting for Frances to be devastated. But Frances takes her own way, does her own thing, and defies her entire family and upbringing. I don't want to be a spoiler and say exactly what she does, but it alters her life, and the life of her lover and her family, forever. Has Frances, then, become the one person to break through the chains and truly become her own woman? That's for the reader to decide. This reader, however, says no. Read &quot;A Spanish Lover&quot; and find out. It's one of Trollope's classics."},{"Title":"A Spanish Lover","review":"The plot device of writing about two very different twin sisters was Trollope's way of contrasting differing ideas of femininity. Frances and Lizzie are quite distinct. Their lives carry you along, but the plot at times borders on the unbelievable. Some of the events were a bit contrived (the near dissolution of the 'perfect' marriage) and the end of the plot was predictable. It was the kind of entertaining reading for a weekend away, or when you don't want to tax yourself too much."},{"Title":"A Spanish Lover","review":"I enjoyed this book from cover to cover. The characters,who were exceedingly well written, very realistic, and very interesting were very gracefully unfolded. I loved the relationship between the twins and the way the submissive twin (Frances) emerged into the more interesting and daring personality. I also appreciated the way in which she gently extricated herself from her sister (Lizzie) and her family influences to do what she wanted to do. It was very ironic and telling that Lizzie actually felt she possessed Frances in the same way she felt she possessed her own children, husband and business. Lizzie's evolution was also insightfully written, but the real story is with Frances, and deserves the most attention. The elders (father William, mother Barbara and mistress Juliet) were in a muddle from the sixties and seemed to float through life with no real direction or purpose. They stayed together in their mental menage-e-tois to simultaneously torture and comfort one another. Frances falls in love with a married man (Luis, the Spaniard)who is so very different from her culturally, emotionally and mentally, that it seems almost impossible that there could be any real attraction, but they share an intense passion for one another. She wishes to manifest all of her love and passion in the person of a child, which will be the living verification of their relationship. He tells her upfront that if she has a child, their relationship will end. She, thinking as a woman in love always thinks, feels that he will certainly change his mind once she becomes pregnant and he sees the child. Instead, he transfers his emotions from her to the child. She physically uproots herself to live in the hostile environment of a country and culture which is not accepting of outsiders and is very definately male oriented. She decides this is the best place for her child, who should be with his father as often as possible. She seems to feel that,even although the permutations were laid out for her as to why the situation will not work, she can change them, and if not, she can endure them. Luis comes across as a selfish, self-centered immature macho-man who lives in the past and considers only himself when things are not going his way. Despite the fact that he would not be an appealing mate to most women, he is very well written and very believable. I would love to see a sequel to this story, which I will definately reread in the summer, on the beach."},{"Title":"A Spanish Lover","review":"Lizzie and Frances are twins, and as such, have always been close although they have chosen different paths in their lives. Lizzie has four children, an art gallery, and a grand house for entertaining. Frances is single and runs a successful travel agency. When Frances announces she won't be joining the family for Christmas, instead going to Spain to look at some new hotels, Lizzie is devastated and feels like Frances is trying to escape the family.Both sisters have reached a turning point in their lives where they are re-evaluating what it means to be happy and fulfilled. Lizzie is running into financial difficulties and Frances meets a man in Spain who may lure her from her solitude.I had a bit of a hard time getting into this book and never felt strongly for either Lizzie or Frances, both who I found a little obnoxious. I enjoyed the Spanish scenery but never found myself completely wrapped up in the story or sympathizing with the characters. It picked up at the end though and would be a good airplane/beach read."},{"Title":"A Spanish Lover","review":"I have to warn you I am going to give away the end. Joanna Trollope is a good writer ...I read another book ( can't remember which one ) and liked it so picked this up at the library. So one twin is married and has 4 kids...nobody knows about zero population growth in this book. The other twin Frances is unmarried at 38 and feels some what unfulfilled. She falls in love with a married Spanish guy. Her life is transformed. And guess what she finally finds fulfilment by getting pregnant by the guy( without him agreeing to said pregnency ) Oh give me a break. Too trite...I read the end so I knew what happened and then I quit reading the book. Maybe I'm too unconventional but the idea bored me. A woman only finding fulfilment through birth of a child? So if you aren't unconventional you might like it. This is especially appalling as she goes on and on about the machismo of the Spanish men.At one point they talk about how sensibilty once ment having emotional consciousness, awareness of ones senses(interesting)....they might have sensibility but not political awareness. I will try some other books of hers though."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Emily Bronte wrote a novel that is both rough and sweet at the same time. This novel is fantastic in its voice. Mostly it is told through the eyes of Nelly Dean, housekeeper/protector of Catherine/busybody who is bold, blunt and strong. The novel is very much linear making it an easy read. Helpfully, in the front of this edition there is a family tree which will aide the reader immensely, because not only are there a lot of characters, there are many with the same name (though different ages). The novel itself is beautiful in its portrayal of everything; from the moors to even Heathcliff (though spiteful and mean as he is), Bronte created a world that truly exists for the reader. Be warned: this is not a world of balls and romantic marriage proposals as Austen, but rather base life as was most likely lived, isolated on the moors.What really I loved about this book was perhaps what came before and after the actual contents. Bronte and her two sisters originally came out with their books within a year of each other under the guise of being three male brothers Ellis, Acton and Currer Bell. In this particular edition, there is a \\"Biographical Notice of Ellis and Acton Bell\\" written by Charlotte Bronte after her sister's passing and on the commencement of new printings of their novels. This edition also includes and Editor's Preface by Charlotte. Commentary from E.M. Forster, Virginia Woolf and a review by George Henry Lewes printed in 1850 come at the end and are very interesting, just to see how two famous authors and one critic looked at the book. These \\"bonus pages\\" made Emily (Ellis) come to life for me.Read this book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I've been trying to read more classic literature recently. And Wuthering Heights was really worthwhile. Yet I find myself almost at a loss for words in describing this book. This gothic romance was a very intense read...and I felt almost in another world as I read it. It creates a \\"feeling\\" that remains with you long after bedtime!The main characters Heathcliff and Catherine are larger than life somehow. How do you describe their dark and stormy love? It is a deep love that descends into obsession, despair, and revenge. Typical of gothic literature, the brooding and haunting landscape of the moors somehow seeps into the characters. And seeps into you... My words can not do this book justice. My advice? Read it!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Emily Bronte's WUTHERING HEIGHTS is by far the best novel I have ever read. The novel's main characters--Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff--are ingeniously written, and the melodramatic scenes are not too \\"cheezy\\" for the modern audience. Bronte's superb authorship allows readers of all backgrounds and of all generations to feel the characters, experience the novel's moods and tones, and appreciate the art of literature. If you absolutely despise reading, you will learn to love it after reading this novel. The novel's themes of passion, hate, love, loss, revenge, and individuality are something we can all relate to and evoke powerful emotions from within any reader. Every educated person should read this...It truly deserves its place among the world's greatest literature."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Annotation: \\"Wuthering Heights\\" is about Heathcliff, an orphan, who is raised by Mr. Earnshaw as one of his own children. Hindley despises him, but wild Cathy becomes his constant companion, and he falls violently in love with her. When she will not marry him, Heathcliff's terrible vengeance ruins them all - but still his and Cathy's love will not die.Author Bio: Emily Bront was born in Thornton, Yorkshire, in the north of England. Her mother died in 1821. Between the years 1824 and 1825 Emily attended the school at Cowan Bridge with Charlotte, and then was educated at home. Her first novel, Wuthering Heights (1847), a story-within-a-story, did not gain immediate success, but it has acclaimed later fame as one of the most intense novels written in the English language. Emily Bront died of tuberculosis in the late 1848. She had caught cold at her brother Branwell's funeral in September. After the appearance of Wuthering Heights, some skeptics thought that the book was written by Branwell, on the grounds that no woman from such circumscribed life, could have written such passionate story. After her sisters' deaths, Charlotte edited a second edition of their novels, with prefatory commentary aimed at correcting what she saw as the reviewers' misunderstanding of Wuthering Heights. The complex time scheme of the novel had been taken as evidence by the critics, that Emily had not achieved full formal control over her narrative materials.Evaluation: Hate is proven to be weaker than love when it comes to Heathcliff. Heathcliff and Catherine are meant to be together. Since the time when they were children they loved one another. Many people tried to keep them apart and they succeeded at times, but their love for one another always shined through. Heathcliff went through a period where he felt that getting even would mend what everyone put him through, but the last part of his revenge remained undone and there was finally some sort of happiness. Love finally outweighed hate creating the happiness between Cathy and Hareton, and Heathcliff and Catherine. It is truly better to love than it is to hate.Overall, \\"Wuthering Heights\\", is extremely enjoyable. I recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys gothic elements incorporated with romance and drama. There are so many themes explored. One thing happens after another, making you want to keep reading and find out what happens next. I liked the fact that love overpowered hate at the end. Jealousy, love, hatred, and tragedy are all mixed together in \\"Wuthering Heights\\", leaving you with a novel that's hard to put down."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I must admit I did the unthinkable. I watched the epic 1939 version of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; before reading the book. The book portrays Heathcliff as a brash, violent man unlike the movie, where he is brash, but his heart is still carrying a torch for Cathy. I never knew that the two main characters had children, and reading about the deep contempt Heathcliff had for Linton, his son, I was appalled. Nevertheless, I loved reading the book. The tragic love borders many other great novels written for the period, and I would suggest anyone who loves two lovers trying to deny the feelings between one another, read it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Wuthering Heights has very real, lively and more animated characters contrary to Austen and the like; and is told in a distinctive narrative form. I think the particular narrative style has been chosen because she wrote the book under a male pen-name.The story is very realistic, perhaps livelier than real life stories, but is very disturbing; mainly because of the seemingly morbid presence of Heathclif. Though his character can be attributed to his disappointing childhood experiences, there is still a hint of that 'savage' instinct (as is often stated) which provokes him to be brutal to the core.Catherine represents a typical girl caught in between 'real love' and 'wealthy love', finally chosing the latter since she fears she'd have to live an extremely poverty-stricken life if she chooses the former.A question that arose in my mind while reading it is the unnatural importance given to a servant like Nelly, who seems to have witnessed each and every scene in the novel.Reading the novel is an experience in its own; and,the novel, I'm sure is one of the best novels of its kind."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I am indeed lost for words...a book of unprecedented power and imaginative scope."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Wuthering Heights is the story of two families in the Yorkshire Moors and how they are all but destroyed by the evil Heathcliff, who was brought to Wuthering Heights as an orphan by old Mr. Earnshaw.It is in many ways a paradox: It is set in a rustic and tranquil environment and in many parts dwells on a picturesque domestic environment, which I believe, would do the hearts of the best of us good.And yet, that is in itself scarred by a regime of hideous terror and cruelty brought on by Heathcliff.From the beginning of the book, we see in the dream of the city fop, Lockwood, how the latter violently rubs the wrist of the phantom Cathy through a broken windowpane. This sets the mood for deed after deed of cruelty and violence.Hence the key word of the novel is paradox. Between the blissful and violent, the homely and the horrific, between the evil of Heathcliff and the goodness of Nelly Dean who muses of the former: \\"\\"Is he a ghoul or a vampire. I had read of such hideous, incarnate demons'.His cruel treatment of Isabella and the second Catherine, is something that would revolt all descent human beings, and cause us to hate Heathcliff.Even Shakespeare's Macbeth shows some conscience, some guilt about his evil actions, as does Lady Macbeth, but Heathcliff never. No plea, nothing at all, can cause him to show the mildest mercy.If he had, but a shred of decency, he would have at least treated the younger Catherine with compassion as this was the daughter of the great love of his life.Heathcliff is a usurper, who mistreats the rightful heirs to Wuthering heights and Thrushcross Grange, Hareton Earnshaw and Cathy Linton II.The other evil folk in the novel, Heathcliff's son, the degenerate Linton Heathcliff and the spiteful manservant Joseph, are but pale shadows of the demonic Heathcliff.The novel focuses on the intense passionate connection (for one could not call such a thing love) between Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw, and the rage of Heathcliff before and after her death, that he could not be untied with her.Wuthering Heights was written in 1847, at a time when the rustic tranquility and wellbeing of the England where Emily Bronte lived, was being shattered by the twin forces of the Industrial Revolution and mercenary profit, and the radical and amoral revolutionary ideologies which would be chartered in The Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx. Perhaps one can see a parallel between the way in which the peaceful routine was being destroyed by both mercantile capitalism and by violent revolutionary socialism , and the way in which the peaceful and tranquil houses of Thrushcross Grange and Wuthering Heights where marred by the diabolical monstrosity of Heathcliff.A key character in the novel is the nurse Nelly Dean, a wonderful woman who shows strength and goodness, throughout in the face of all the evil and cruelty in the saga.She is not much older than Hindley and the first Catherine and I would imagine she is about 16 years old when old Mr. Earnshaw brings Heathcliff to Wuthering Heights, and about 46 therefore, at the time of Heathcliff's death and the redemption of Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange.The second Cathy, while showing a fierce spirit, is a fundamentally better person than her mother, both beautiful and good.Heathcliff and Catherine I are the anti-heroes of the story and Hareton Earnshaw and Cathy II, the heroes."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This book is really fascinating.

One of my faves, everybody who's interested in a little bit confusing family stories should read it.BYE, Flowerpowertati"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"A frame story that reveals the lives of a small cast of characters living on the English moors. Catherine Earnshaw is the wildly passionate offspring of the master of Wuthering Heights and his wife. Her father brings home a gypsy looking boy from a trip to Liverpool and this little \\"silent heathen\\" is integrated into the family. Catherine and Heathcliff, as the gypsy comes to be named, become inseperable and untamable. However there is another family in this picture who lives in the much friendlier and luxurious house of Thrushcross Grange. Catherine is wounded while sneaking about the Grange with Heathcliff and his welcomed into Thrushcross Grange to be cared for until she heals. Edgar Linton who is Catherines age and will inherit the Grange upon his parents death takes to Cathy and she to him. But Edgar does not feed Catherine's wild nature and is for all intensive purposes a milksop. Catherine returns to the Heights far more mannered and tamed than when she left and Heathcliff is furious that she no longer cares to share in his savageness. Some time passes and Edgar asks Cathy to marry him, she cries to the lady keeper of the house that she wants to marry Heathcliff but she will lose all of her status as upper class if she does. Heathcliff overhears and in a rage of pain leaves and we do not see him again for three years. When he returns Catherine is married and living at the Grange. Heathcliff has become wealthy but is still the cruel savage from his youth and is bent on revenging himself upon all those who wronged him when he was the title-less gypsy boy. (I'm leaving out some important bits and pieces but for the most part the storyline is intact) The ending is a secret known only by those who choose to take the journey across the moors to Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange to hear Ellen tell the story. I will tell this: Both Catherine and Heathcliff beget children and death figures big in the plot. This novel contains unbridled passion, heinous revenges, festering anger, unfathomable pain, and the intensity of a storm on the moors. Read the whole book before passing ANY judgement. Bravo Bronte."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Oh, where to begin? Yes, some people complain about the melodramatic (some even say soap-operatic) quality of this book, but it is simply wonderful. It's hard to find a book about the dark side of love, and this book (which offered, perhaps, the first \\"modern\\" character in Heathcliff) has the dark side of love in spades. The story is centered around the Earnshaw and Linton families, who occupy the Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange estates, respectively. While it would give away many important and poignant moments to go more in-depth, rest assured that there is betrayal, violence, and passion. The character of Heathcliff may very well be the best character in literature (in my opinion, at least). His inner conflict between vengeance and love is tragically human, and the fact that he knows that he is doing the wrong thing but cannot stop his drive for vengeance makes him that much more human. This book is excellent. Maybe the best book I've ever read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"but I did not really enjoy it. I understand why it is a classic: Miss Bronte delves into the depths of the human psyche and recounts the agonies of lost love and the despair and cruelty it drives Heathcliff to. She describes the deep bond of love between Cathy and Heathcliff, a bond which is stronger than death and causes as much pain as it does pleasure, and as much agony as comfort. What I cannot understand is how people actually enjoy reading it. I do not mind a lack of action in a book: Pride and Prejudice is one of my favorites and contains far less action than this book. However, Pride and Prejudice was a pleasant read because it had pleasant overtones and a pleasant ending and pleasant characters. This book, however, has nasty overtones, an ending barely passable as neutral, and nasty characters. Most of the main characters were self-centered fiends: Cathy loved her friend more than her husband and made it known to all, Joesph was a foul hypocrite, Linton was a wretched weakling, Hindley a abusive father, Heathcliff an evil fiend, etc. The story itself was an awful tale of lost love leading to a collapse of characer and it's resulting consequences (all bad) on the people in contact with Heathcliff. Why people celebrate this of all love stories is beyond me. Why on earth would people hold up as an example of true love the story of Cathy and Heathcliff? A story which runs as follows: Cathy and Heathcliff are in love. Cathy marries someone else because Heathcliff has a low rank. Heathcliff causes jealousy for Cathy's husband. Cathy dies, and Heathcliff nearly goes insane and spends the rest of his life mercilessly torturing those around him. Someone explain to me why this is held up as a great example of love? Give me Miss Bronte's sister (Charlotte Bronte)'s Jane Eyre any day over this. Jane Eyre is just such a story as should be held up and shown to the world as an example of true love, not Wuthering Heights. Wuthering Heights is an example of love gone horribly wrong, not perfect love. I do not think that it was the author's intent at all to have this lifted up as an example of what love should be like, as many have mistaken her to have done. She was simply showing the power of love: that it has both the power to do both great good and great evil. That is the strength of this book.Overall grade: A"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"If the craft of writing appeals to you, this is a gem. There is only one word out of place (one pronoun with an ambiguous antecedent). The story is told from multiple points of view and includes a variety of sad and sordid relationships but ends with a vision of love nearly unequaled in literature.One overarching theme is the relationship between love and control. As we know today, control is often manfested in anger but also in eating disorders. Yes, two of the main characters would be called anorexic today. Emily Bronte herself probably died of anorexia--her coffin was less than 20 inches wide.This is romantic in the traditional sense: Wuthering Heights emphasizes emotion. And when emotional people are thwarted, they turn angry. Add love, jealousy, class conflict, sibling rivalry, supernatural dreams, and the wild moors of Yorkshire, you've got a gothic novel that has been often imitated but seldom duplicated.Because of the multiple narrators, there is one warning. Many of the episodes are told more than once from different points of view. In each case, though, the perspectives are so different that you might not even realize at first that you are reading about the same event.If you want to read a fascinating story and want a sense of how a great story should be told, read Wuthering Heights."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"A TRULY EXCELLENT EDITION of this strangest and strongest of English novels,hauntingly beautiful in its impassionate poetry,a novel that reads us instead of the other way round,more about important questions than about too trivial answers.The text is roughly the same than Clarendon's reference one, without correcting the error at the beginning of Chapter 16 (we get \\"inhabitants\\" for \\"inhabitant\\", and the reason for NOT emending both 1847 and 1850 readings, although duly explained in a note, is most incredible). The punctuation is even a bit heavier than Clarendon's(I fear a bit too heavy for American habits) and the implied two-volume division with independent chapter numbering looks as funny and cumbersome as in Oxford's.The Introduction, although shorter than Stoneman's for Oxford, is excellent nonetheless. So are the notes, that more often than not give full quotation of the references involved, while Oxford gives only the references. Material production is as bad as you fear and then some, as regards paper quality and binding: pages will get brown in only five years (and Oxford's don't fare much better). Printing quality, on the other hand, is fair-to-good.Don't miss the very first page (the one about Emily Bront life),then read Lucasta Miller's preface,skip both the excellent Pauline Nestor Introduction and the controversial\\"Charlotte's materials\\" (the Biographical Notice and the Preface to the New),and -giving an attentive glance to the Genealogical Tree- go to the TEXT (perusing the notes).Afterwards you will do well to read the previously skipped material, and, perhaps some months later, to peruse the excellent Bibliography.IN SUMMARY: as far as text, Introduction and notes are concerned, no other edition is better. Material production and durability, on the other side, are even a little worse than Oxford World's Classics.Have a haunting, unforgettable read!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This is one book I've read over and over again, to understand how it appears to other people. Whomsoever have I met consider it to be rude and strange at first. What this book means to me is unsurpassed literature. It depicts rough love- a love that is as wild as the moors of England. Wuthering Heights breeds initself a &quot;horror of darkness&quot;, we sometimes breathe in our lives. The love existing between Heathcliff- the most loved villians of all time and Catherine stands strong. This book is about a stranger entering a household where he is rejected, and during this course betrays the one solitary feling in his heart- not being his love for Catherine, but compassion. The other half of the story reaches a point where Heathcliff takes his sweet revenge. There are no answers to questions like: Should a character like Heathcliff exist or not? I do not know. This is a masterpiece in literature depicting love, innocence lost, friendship, forgiveness and above all acceptance. Unfortunately, this was the first and last book of Emily Bronte. Wish there were more novels like this one!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights is a novel that creates a love story between Heathcliff and Catherine. This is not however a regular love story. Bronte's ability to create real emotions puts Wuthering Heights in a category far from a &quot;Cinderella&quot; story. Bronte's remarkable ability to conceive almost twisted stories can be seen not to far into the story. It can be seen once Mr. Earnshaw brings home Heathcliff, basically treats Heathcliff as his son and neglects his birth son, and Catherine begins to love Heathcliff that the story will be far from regular. Bronte uses these unique ironies to create detailed stories.In this book Bronte uses her ability to mimic real human reactions in her characters come about. Such as when Mr. and Mrs. Earnshaw die Hindley, their birth son, forces Heathcliff to leave because of his hatred towards him. Hindley knew his father loved Heathcliff more than him and he couldn't stand it. Heathcliff leaving causes problems between. It's Ironic that when Heathciff comes home after three years because of his love for Catherine, she has already married another, Edgar Linton.Emily Bronte's story obviously wasn't that of a regular love story. Not too long after Heathcliff comes home Catherine dies. Heathcliff becomes filled with anger and seeks revenge. He causes pain to all that have hurt him or are related to those that hurt them. Although Bronte didn't create a storybook love story she does end it, in a way, like a love story should end. The lovers are of course united in death. I liked this story by Emily Bronte because it wasn't just a regular love story with a happy ending. Although it did end with the lovers together, it is hardly a &quot;Cinderella&quot; story and the plat twist and intricacies make it a memorable story."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Reading Wuthering Heights is like a journey into a dream abound with entangled relationships, bitter vengeance, and how the innocent heirs from feuded families struggle to escape the macabre legacy of the past. The person who unraveled the history behind Wuthering Heights was Lockwood, a new tenant of the Thrushcross Grange who was forced to seek shelter one night at Wuthering Heights, the home of his landlord Heathcliff.Heathcliff was kidnapped and shipped to England, grew up under the roof of the Earnshaws. Old Earnshaw took a liking of the young Heathcliff while his son Hindley persistently and insidiously grumbled long string of tales against him and treated him like a house servant after the old Earnshaw passed away. At Wuthering Heights the young Heathcliff cultivated a consummate bonding with Catherine Earnshaw who later on betrayed him and married Edgar Linton.LoveThe novel's pivot tends to focus on the power of the central relationship between Catherine Earnshaw-Linton and Heathcliff. However dark and vindictive the novel might have turned out, the work's attraction, as a love story is not difficult to extract. Catherine loved Heathcliff because he was more herself than she was. Their souls were made of the same materials. Her soul, her heart, and her conscience reproved and convinced her that it was wrong to marry Linton, though Heathcliff might appear to be an unreclaimed, uncultivated creature, which would degrade her. In her final words to Heathcliff, the embittered Catherine Earnshaw writhed in torment. Here the novel has attained to the fullness the celebration of such transcendent love, which has surpassed the bounds of mundanity and death, despite the fact that their reunion was marked by dejection, regret, and bitterness. To Heathcliff the entire world was such a dreadful conviction of memoranda that he had lost his beloved Catherine Earnshaw, even though her daughter Cathy asserted that nobody would love him nor cry for him when he died.VengeanceHeathcliff's eye-for-an-eye vengeance visited upon the next generation. To revenge on Hindley Earnshaw's being acrimonious to him, Heathcliff determined to make Hindley's son Hareton a brute. He never taught him how to read or write, never rebuked him for any bad habit and never led him a single step toward virtue. When Heathcliff later became master of Wuthering Heights, he reduced Hareton to a mere house servant and deprived him of any wages. Edgar's daughter Cathy was forced to marry Heathcliff's sickly son Linton who braced the brawl of the previous generation by reviving how Cathy's mother had betrayed the man she loved for her father Edgar Linton. Through his son Heathcliff meant to usurp Edgar Linton's property at Thrushcross Grange and confiscated Cathy's fortune. The heirs (Cathy Linton, Hareton Earnshaw, and Linton) strived to escape from the bitter rift of the previous generation. The second half of the novel (volume ii) somewhat signifies such restoration of order and balance in this second generation.Dream/Stream-of-ConsciousnessThe appearance of Catherine Earnshaw's ghost in the early part of the novel proves to be such an appropriate notion to set the tone of Wuthering Height. The house servant only proved the house was haunted at the expense of the new tenant Lockhood, the ghost also challenged the limits of life. Wuthering Heights as a whole conveys a sense of vagueness and ambiguous plausibility. The notion of dream proved to be a significant source of understanding as both Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff envisaged their happiness in dreams, and Catherine articulated the dreams' informing power to Ellen Dean, who narrated the story to Lockwood over the span of a night at Heathcliff's abode. The warped sense of time, the geographical remoteness, and social aloofness contribute to a dreamlike, stream-of-conscious setting. Such dreamlike setting offers an uncensored realm, free of logic and boundaries, to the transgression of identity, sexuality, violence, and vengeance.\\"May you not rest, as long as I am living. You said I killed you - haunt me, then.\\" The book obviates a transcendent love that surpasses grief and death. It is meant to be haunting. 4.5 stars.2004 (1)"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Several years ago, tired of reading the latest novels, I decided after a few forays into classic literature that maybe I should devote more time to them. After all, anything hailed as a \\"great literary work\\" by millions of people has to be good, right?I'm glad this wasn't the first classic I picked up, because I never would have continued reading them. The book itself isn't all that thick, which while I prefer thick, I was grateful it wasn't in this case. It is a book about torment. Everyone in it is in a perpetual state of plain, downright torment. And the kicker is they bring it on themselves. Reading it I felt bad for Heathcliff as a child and sympathised with his plight. The fireworks begin after Heathcliff returns from some unnamed place or places with millions in the bank. The apple of his eye is the wishy-washy (I just can't come up with a more fitting term for so wretched a woman) Catherine, who can't make up her mind what to do throughout the book until her dying breath. Thank God that happened.When I read a book I generally try to find a connection with one of the characters, someone who might share the same views as I would or who might take the same action as I would in certain circumstances, but I'm sorry to say I couldn't find a single one. I found myself more or less taking the side of Edgar, although he wasn't very enjoyable either. As for Heathcliff I felt like reaching into the book, smacking him around a few good hours while screaming \\"Get over it!\\" Wuthering Heights is filled to bursting with detestable people doing deplorable things for no other reason than greed, selfishness, and what must be some kind of masochistic desire for misery. And Heathcliff is the King of Pain in this one. I felt actual relief at his passing as I would that of a rabid dog.This would be a one star review, but for the last 40 pages where at least some semblence of hope and happiness comes to this stupid book, something it was completely devoid of throughout the rest of it. It's a wonder half of England didn't commit suicide out of severe depression after reading it when it was first released. Even more troubling is that the up and coming youth who read this tend to really believe it's a classic \\"love story\\".

The reason there are \\"1,000\\" reviews of the Norton Critical Fourth Edition of Wuthering Heights is that Amazon is dumping all the reviews of any edition of Wuthering Heights into one worthless jumble. Note that the initial description of \\"the book\\" is actually a detailed review of an Audio CD version referred to as an adequate abridgement. If you click on the book image in hopes of at least looking at the table of contents, you are taken to \\"another edition,\\" which turns out to be some high school class knockoff lacking even an introduction.

Too bad.It is routine at Amazon to not bother with copyright dates, so if you sort an author's work \\"by publication\\" you get the most recent printing, not the order of publication. Try finding a chronologically ordered list of a mystery series here. Would it be hard to create one? Of course not. But who cares? Not Amazon.Where this database slovenliness get criminal is when Amazon piles together British and U.S. editions of an author's work with no indication that a \\"new title\\" is actually the U.K. title of a book already available in the U.S. (Carol O'Connell's Magic Men is Shell Game, Find Me is Shark Music, etc.). The luckless shopper ends up with a duplicate title and shipping charges up the wazoo.

The tone of the romantic movie is nothing like the book, and the series is much closer only if you've read the book and can fill in the blanks in your mind. That said, the book is much more dense and dark than either and would appeal to modern audiences much more than the rather frilly movie and disjointed series. In the book, Catherine Earnshaw is self-centered and could easily be termed as mentally deranged and Heathcliff is a sadist. They mentally torture each other and are cruel and thoughtless of everyone around them. Bronte's book isn't the grand love story it's made out to be in the movie. Catherine and Heathcliff are more obsessed than romantic, and there's really not much of anyone to like. The setting is grimy, not grand. The characters are hardscrabble in a bleak, brutal world.

Long Live Heathcliff!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This story was a bit hard to follow. It skips around a bit and if not followed closely, can become confusing. Wuthering Heights is set in the late 1700's to early 1800's. It is centered around two people madly in love. Catherine puts her love for Heathcliff aside to marry the wealthy Edgar Linton. Heathcliff cannot deal with this rejection and runs away. A few years pass and he returns. Upon his return their lives are turned upside down because of their unyielding love. Heathcliff brings revenge upon anyone that had wronged him prior to his leaving. This story shows the destruction that can come from uncontrollable love. Revenge, jealousy, and death are all results of a love that was never given the chance to fully grow.There are some similarities between the author's life and the story as well. One that is immediately recognizable is that the female characters all die after giving birth, as Bronte's mother did. Another similarity is the drug addictions. Bronte's brother was addicted to opium and had a drinking problem. Hindley, Catherine's brother, takes to drinking after his wife dies."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I thought this book was tragic in that two people who obviously love each other very much and have so much in common that they actually refer to themselves as the other person, end up spending most of their lives in other relationships trying to make the other lover jealous or hating their choices. Ultimately, Heathcliff's desire for revenge was hard for me to understand because I suppose I have never loved anyone enough to go that far. And the end was especially tragic because he actually begged Cathy's ghost to haunt him for the rest of his life: &quot;...drive me mad! Only do not leave me in this dark alone where I cannot find you.&quot;"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Wuthering Heights tells the story of the impossible love between Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff, a foundling adopted by Catherine's father. Wuthering Heights is the name of the spacious dwelling of the family, located on the desolate moorlands of England. After the death of Mr. Earnshaw, Heathcliff finds himself constantly humiliated by Catherine's brother Hindley. When Heathcliff assumes wrongfully that his ever growing love for Catherine is unanswered he sees no reason to stay and leaves the moorlands in search of better luck. Returning years later as a wealthy man he sees an opportunity to get revenge on his stepbrother, but neglects the intolerable pain he causes to his one an only love. Caught in a spiral of vengeance Heathcliff ruins everything once dear to him.The sole novel Emily Bront (1818-1848) has written in her short life will undoubtedly continue to stand the test of time. Although I myself am not a big fan of novels that write Romance with a capital, this story has touched me in a way that very few have succeeded in before. The powerful description of the unrecognized energy between the two main characters is simply overwhelming. Although Emily was -in the true spirit of Victorian novelists- clearly not afraid of adding an enormous list of extremities to the character of Heathcliff, this embodiment of boundless revenge and pure fatherly despotism is one of the strongest characters ever created in English literature. The fact that not a lot of people will classify this novel as \\"the greatest love story ever told\\" is most likely due to the never ending grimness of the tale. This darkness is nicely illustrated by the high number of deaths weaved into this family epos. But then again, love is not always as nice as in the movies... or is it?For a real romantic this is truly a book to be treasured forever."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I had avoided Wuthering Heights because I thought it was purely a love story and a corny one at that. Pleasantly surprised is a tremendous understatement. This was fantastic. There is no scene - in the book at least - with Heathcliff and Catherine running into each other's arms across the moors. That must have been from a sappy movie version. In fact, there are no scenes like that - no mindless romantic drivel at all. The preface of my copy actually said that the book was not that successful during Bronte's time because the characters were altogether \\"too odiously and abominably pagan to suit the tastes of even the most shameless class of English readers\\" (as stated by the Quarterly Review).It is certainly dark. Wuthering Heights is the story of Heathcliff who, spurned by Catherine, wreaks havoc on the lives of everyone who has ever had anything to do with him, covering three generations. Is it a love story? Well, yes ... sort of. Catherine did passionately love Heathcliff (as he did her) but nothing ever comes of that, at least in the traditional sense. The extent of Wuthering Heights being a love story to me is the inevitable question of \\"If Catherine had married Heathcliff would things have been different?\\" Given the almost demoniacal personality Heathcliff bears throughout the book, I hardly think so.If you have only ever seen the movie, you have only heard half of the story - literally - and that is extremely \\"brightened\\" from the novel's intrinsic dark and spooky overtones. This is one of those books when finished, I found myself wandering around saying, \\"Wow, that was a good book\\". I even waited a few days before starting another."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Emily Bronte's literary masterpiece proves a Gothic novel of classic proportions, with characters whose twisted passions etch themselves upon the reader's mind over successive readings. Set in the rugged Yorkshire of her childhood, WUTHERING HEIGHTS depicts a literary canvas of desolate landscape, where Nature ranges from fury in winter storms to indifference to human endeavor. Over the course of three decades we gradually learn the strange personal history between the Earnshaws of WH and the Lintons of Thrushcross Grange. This grimly violent tale of human passion and supernatural revenge reveals the devastating effect of a dark-skinned foundling lad who is adopted into the family of a kind country squire. With this charitable act Mr. Earnshaw unwittingly introduces restless energy and unbridled emotions into the placid neighborhood--ultimately destroying the decaying dynamics of relations between neighbors. Genealogies are rewritten as unleashed jealousy threatens the flow of lives yet unborn.Recounted in extensive flashback sequences by a faithful servant, Nelly Dean, to a recuperating new tenant at the Grange, this twisted story is also taken up by subsequent narrators--since no single character witnesses very event at both houses. Two gentlemen chose to reside in a remote region, to escape wordly distractions, but the arrival of a young, gypsy-like orphan, Heathcliff, proves the catalyst to disrupt their comfortable social decadence. His passion for Cathy, the wild daughter in his new family, would rule him for life--ruining himfor Life itself. Neither teen could live without the other, although she defied her heart; in so doing she destroyed the lives and peace of mind of innocent relatives and neighbors.Pursued by his private demons of despair Heathcliff knows no peace or valid existence apart from her, tormenting everyone in his intense, constricted social sphere. From foundling to Master, his morose moods and vindictive nature throw a pall upon both houses, as he conspires to control that which is not rightuflly his. All because he was denied sanctioned union with Cathy, his soul mate. Sowing a legacy of vice and despair, Heathcliff privately strives for reunion--not closure--with the shade of his other half. Chasing shadows he morbidly controls the destiny of those involved at Wuthering Heights, threatening to engulf even the detached outsider. A Gothic Classic for all ages."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Having had this book as an assignment in college.... I must say the years have given me a deeper appreciation of it. I really tripped my way through it as a freshman.

We see Emily Bronte's excellent rendering of the corruptness of human nature... and in Heathcliff we can see a human going to the depths of depravity and hatred. The scarey thing is that we can... if we look hard enough see a little of ourselves in him too.The novel is dark and foreboding, just like the windswept moors it takes place on. The mood is expertly rendered by this genius author.When you read it allow yourself to be swept away by it's darkness and get caught up in the atmosphere.That was the draw for me and I'm sure you'll will feel it too.Excellent Book!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Wuthering Heights is the classical novel dealing with undying love and loss. Set on the moors of mid-nineteenth century England it tells the story of a love between the orphan boy Heathcliffe and Katherine. Katherine and Heathcliffe fall madly in love with each other, but there love is not to be as both end up marrying other people. However, their love for each other continues even after their marriages and after their deaths. This is a love that cannot be stopped by death and endures forever.In Wuthering Heights, Emily Bronte wrote of one the classic novels of the nineteenth century. Her characters are well done and the story moves along at a pace that draws in the reader and won't let go. The story is told through the eyes of Katherine and Heathcliffe's nanny, Mrs. Dean, as she tells the story to man who has rented out part of Heathcliffe's property. Mrs. Dean's perspective is always humorous and one almost wonders how much of it has been changed to cover over her own role in the events. It is a testimony to her characters that by the end of the book you will end up hating some of the characters. I personally could not stand, Isabell's son Linton - he was whiny, selfish, pain in the a*s and I was routing for Hareton to beat up him up.The only slight problem with this book is it was written in the old style popular during the nineteenth century - at times this makes the reading some what ponderous. In particular, Joseph's dialogue is a labor and in order to understand it I had to almost read it out loud.Wuthering Heights is a wonderful story about two people who love each other so much that nothing can stop their passion. It is a story as old as time and that will endure until the end of time."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Not to be hyperbolic, but Wuthering Heights is one of the most well known and critically acclaimed novels in the English language, and there is precious little that I can add to the volumes already written on it. It is the story of two British households inhabiting the wilds of the Yorkshire moors, and illuminates the destructive undercurrents that come to uproot and ultimately destroy both clans. At the center of the tale stand the headstrong Catherine Earnshaw and the brooding Heathcliff, one of the most celebrated romantic pairings in world literature. Treated abominably in his youth at the hands of both households and having lost his love to another man, Heathcliff descends into a horrifying abyss of brutality and revenge still harrowing to encounter nearly two centuries after publication. Although the novel progresses at a leisurely pace compared to modern works, it presents the most complete and thrilling portrait of passion ever set forth in the English language. Passion is not a synonym for love in Wuthering Heights-it is an unbridled conflagration consuming all rationality and rendering its victims ravenous beasts, terrifying and magnificent in their hunger. When Catherine declares that her soul will roam the moors forever after her death, even the most confirmed atheist will find himself believing her- passion is such a billowing force in Wuthering Heights that the human body is convincingly rendered a prison of something altogether greater. At the same time, the primordial forces the book presents never become exhausting, contained as they are within a highly unique narrative framework channeling them through characters secondary to the main line of action. For those patient and courageous enough to immerse themselves in its richly textured reality, Wuthering Heights presents a world boarding on the mythic, and it comes highly recommended to the imaginative reader."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Perhaps it's the winsome imagery, perhaps the profoundly real characters one switches between loving and hating, or maybe even the dry humor that is the style of the British, but Wuthering Heights is my all time favorite book.

Never before have I been so moved by a story; it might be Heathcliff's overflowing love for Catherine that drives him mad yet, ingenious in his revenge, or Cathy's shallow duty to society that denies her the power to be true to herself (I believe the main point of this novel is to not deny your feelings; go with what you feel rather than what should be), but I always find myself reading it on days I need to be cheered up or am really lusting after a good book. If one's not paying attention, you know, one of those days where you just read to take your mind off of something, it can get rather dull and confusing (the diction isn't as simple as say...Ethan Frome), but if you're concentrating, Bronte's words are so amazingly beautiful, it's hard to put it down. When read aloud it sounds like Shakespeare, and I like Emily's work a lot more than Charlotte's, for some reason. Gothic literature is so peculiar and wonderful: a class of it's own, and she really masters it. At the same time she avoids stereotypes and entertaining happenings (the spectre that appears to the somewhat insecure Lockwood early on foretells the chilling story, while at the same time hinting there is something deeply wrong about Wuthering Heights that needs to be corrected), actually writing the book with a purpose behind it. All the characters have very cool qualities about them; all have the potential to be irritating, but hey, we're all human. By imperfecting her people she has perfected the novel, and I'm so thankful I've had the privilege to read such a piece of art. This book forever remains with me; it's a part of me."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I believe Wuthering Heights to be just an average book hardly capable of any noteriety. The book seems to be the same old story of a vengeful man who takes his anger and hate out on other people in a useless effort to please himself. This deep inner hatred results from the untimely death of Heathcliff's lifetime love, Catherine. The reason I gave this book a three was because it was so difficult to follow. Bronte used the same names and the same situations over and over and I could never understand who she was talking about. The theme of Man vs Man was overly developed with the continuing acts of hatred from Heathcliff. I reccomend you read this book if you want to avenge something or you withold a deep hatred for someone. EMILY SMITH"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Wuthering Heights is a strange ,but powerful book. Revenge is most likely the dominent theme in the second half of the book. Even though Heathcliff abandons his plan for vengence. There is no traditional happy ending for the principal characters in the book. It was also brought out that it was a spiritual love rather than a physical one the binds Heathcliff and Cahterine together. There is also a theory of crime and punishment. All the characters sin in some way and are punished, with the exception of cathy and Hareton. Another would be conflict between good and evil. The difference between the feeling that Catherine has for Heathcliff andthe one she has for Edgar is that she responds to Edgar only on the more superficial and shallow level. She seems aware that this love is far more important than the civilized and wordly advantages that Edgar offers. Despite this she goes against her natural instinct and marries him anyways. This action turns the good in Heathcliff to evil, taking revenge on everyone except Cahterine. This tears her up and her only option that she looks for is death. After many years he finds his revenge dying away and prepares himself for death and reuniting with the spirit of Catherine soon after. Love is the only element that remains constant. Everything else withers away. It boils down to nothing on earth matters ,but when we are dead and merge with the Almighty Being then shall we see our greatest satisfaction. The power of good is stronger than the power of evil and will eventually prevail."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I had to read Wuthering Heights in my 8th Grade English Class last year, and I thought that the book was brilliant! It is filled with love, passion, deceit, greed, and everything in between. A word to the wise. Be willing to spend some time with this book. You will thank me. Wuthering Heights isn't something that you just read over the weekend, you really have to put some time into it. This has to be one of the most complex books I've read in a while, and its complexities is what makes it brilliant"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Very often Wuthering Heights is represented as being purely a great love story between Catherine and Heathcliff. This, in my opinion, is far from the truth. It is a classic book and there is certainly a great deal of passion in it, but it is about a great deal more than just the love of these two charachters. It is also about the wild moors and the people they produces, about how evil propagates itself and how ultimately a little bit of compassion can overcome years of hatred and mistrust. Read this book, but not just because you think it's going to be a beautiful love story. Read it because it provides an insigth into love, life and the whole human condition."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This is a man's romance novel. Heathcliff gets to carry out the role that almost every guy wants to play when he's really in love but it doesn't work. Katherine can't wait for him even though she loves him so she marries some anemic loser. But, instead of whining about it Heathcliff does something about it, thereby makeing life miserable for everyone (including himself) but by doing so keeps his love alive, instead of just moving on. An excellent example of perseverence no matter what the cost and despite the fact that the outcome cannot be successful"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"There's no redeemable quality in either Heathcliff or Catherine. The more I read the more I despised them, the more I didn't really care what kind of havoc they wrecked on each other or their relationship. Their relationship is the epitome of codependency and somehow this is supposed to be regarded as one of the great love stories of our time. How masochistic are we?"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"The achievement of Charlotte, Emily, and Anne is an unprecedented phenomenon in English literature. I've always thought of what lessons could modern parents learn from the raising of the Bronte sisters, in years when education was not a recognized priority in women's life, and yet no girls of the Bronte family was left behind. Amazing, wasn't it?It is unnatural to review this book without comparing it to Jane Eyre, another masterpiece of the Bronte sisters. I tend to put both of the two book in high rank, regardless of critiques from different directions. Jane Eyre is admirable for the ambition that is high but not wild, the emotion that is heated but not burned, the action that is courageous but not aggressive, and the totality of natural elegance and inner nobality. While Wuthering Heights is the opposite to the extreme. In WH, the ambition is wild but not high, the emotion is burned before it get's comfortably heated, and the action is often violently aggressive yet not courageous. The boundaries of humanity is ignored, the nobality is not admired or even hated, and the anger is allowed to vent at any cost.Said that, it is a great worth to read for the craftsman of the storyline and the superior language skills. It depicts deviated, obsessive, violent, and destructive personalities that need psychiatric help in my opinion. If it is just for the sake of reading a good novel, I would give WH and JE the same score. However, due to the fact one can not realistically seperate the entertaining effect from educating effect of any literal work, I would like to save the highest score for the truely and entirely best."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Nowadays, if we want a good edition of this strangest and strongest of British novels, deeply haunting and intensely poetical in its rather dark and eerie otherness, we have a variety of options, both text-oriented editions or context-oriented (\\"study\\") ones.To name them all (see my overall review on the Norton Critical Fourth Edition (Dunn)): Oxford World's Classics (Patsy Stoneman), Penguin Classics (Pauline Nestor), Oneworld Classics, among the text-oriented ones;Longman Cultural (Alison Booth), Broadview Press (Beth Newman), Norton Critical Third or Fourth ((Sale)/Dunn) among the context-oriented ones.But when it comes to choose a good-looking hardcover volume, it turns out to be an impossible task to get the right text with an adequate annotation (it seems as if nobody cared for it!).Oxford's World's Classics Special Centennial pocket hardcover issue, now very hard to come by, is a most lovable volume and features the Clarendon reference text, but we add a rather unperceptive and dull Introduction to an absolute absence of notes to get as a result a perfectly useless edition.Barnes & Noble is a really nice hardcover, together with a good Introduction (Daphne Merkin) and a very good annotation (Tatiana Holway), but theirs, while a reliable and well-known text (Haworth Edition, 1900), is a 1850 second edition text, that is to say, Charlotte's highly tampered-with posthumous edition, further disfigured at the hands of the Publisher. Many people think -as I do- that thistext-form is a no-go.Now we come to the Franklin Mint 1979 edition (and its version for Oxford University). It's a very beautiful hardcover volume, leatherette on boards that really looks at least like bonded leather, with all edges gold-gilt, with an excellent125 gram per square meter almost opaque paper (without mineral loading);an excellent quality two-color printing with 11/14 pt Linotype Garamond type and ornate chapter initials. It features the beautiful if not daring Alan Reingold five double-page lithographs with its photographic-like impact...And then what? The text -forgetting for a moment Clarendon and its derivatives-is a very good 1847 first edition text (in the line of SCHORER's, Moser's and Daiches's editions), and it features -for the first time in the novel history- a full and right footnote glossing of the dialectal tirades.Any misgivings? O...yes! Two little ones:a) the Charlotte prefaces should come at the end of the novel rather than at the beginning, not to condition our reading, andb) there is no modern good introduction to the novel (and there were by then a great deal many very good to excellent ones from where to choose); and a very big one:c) the absence of any note whatsoever other than the dialect glosses.Now, it's up to you to choose (and, should you go for this, do a little looking around to get the best preserved copy within your budget).Within its constraints, it's a very nice book and an interesting buy!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"How odd that Amazon does not consolidate the comments on the various editions of this book from different publishers.I read this book out of a certain sense of obligation -- I'd been reading other 19th century English literature and, with some trepidation, picked up Wuthering Heights to complete the set. The book was wonderful, with fully developed if sometimes quixotic characters, and rapid and often unexpected plot twists. The prose is denser than, say, Jane Austen, but not as bad as the stereotypical gothic novel. The main character, Heathcliff, is famously attractive to women but, as a male reader, I thought he was a thoroughly bad egg. Worthy of discussion, though, especially with women who have read it and are likely to have a different opinion."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Though this story overall had a dark essence to it, I believe that an unrelenting passion was shared between Catherine and Heathcliff. Of course, in my view, both characters are selfish and share a fury in great magnitudes. But then again, these similar characteristics are what make them such a match made in heaven...or more accurately, a match made in hell. Even with the hatred, I still believe this is a great love story. Love can be shrouded in varying shades, from happy gay tones to the more darkening hues.The greatest burst of sunshine in this dreary novel would probably come fron Nelly Dean, who was practically the only character with a head on her shoulders. Just the fact that she was able to serve with such a crazed family for so long and come out sane in the end is and indication of her strong, noble personality.In this story, the line between hatred and love is precariously thin."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"There was Linton sucking on his candy as a weak teenager with confused alliances. It is moments of surreal force like these that make people love or hate Wuthering Heights.With so many reviews, I'll add a little. This is fiction to the extreme so WARNING reading W.H is like stepping into a giant colorful painting with abstract and realistic elements.Heathcliff (contrary to popular belief) is not the star of the show. Every character is allowed to bloom to the extreme and make you wonder if they lived to the full.Even with five stars over this review...I have an issue with the book it was and is still unsettling. In fact almost everyone except the two narrators...a tenant at the Grange and the housekeeper Ellen Dean...have either horrid language and seemingly do not care about their lives or anyone else's or they have other huge irksome problems.Also...the free Kindle ed. does not include translations of phrases or any special introductions or additional information."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"In Wuthering Heights, two families are caught in a destructive cycle of love, hate, and retribution. At the center of it is Catherine, a proud, headstrong girl, and Heathcliff, an orphan adopted into Catherine's family. Catherine and Heathcliff are both romantic iconoclasts who defy convention. They prefer roaming the wild moors over the life of high society. They enjoy mischief and detest christian morality. Their love is one of passion and rebellion. Even though they are very immature, they are admirable in that they are true to their own natures and want to live lives of joy and ecstasy. In one insightful passage that illuminates the theme of the whole book, Catherine says that she dreamed that she was in Heaven, and she was so unhappy there that she begged to come back to earth. The angels kicked her out and she wept with joy to come back to Wuthering Heights, her home on the wild Yorshire moor. Even though these characters behave despicably, we can't help sympathize with their humanity.Wuthering Heights is a criticism of Christian ideology. Catherine and Heathcliff are full bodied, complex, emotional characters. They are both repeatedly referred to as wicked, devilish, heathen, selfish, coldhearted. But they are also genuine people with the courage to live in accordance with their convictions. It is this quality that makes the two \\"good\\" characters, Edgar and Isabella Linton, fall in love with them. Edgar and Isabella, raised as gentry, live as they have been dictated to. They are irrisistably attracted to these two individuals who don't care what society thinks of them. Heathcliff and Catherine glow with pride, passion, strength and health. While Edgar and Isabella are hollow and anemic. The other Christian character, Joseph, is hypocritical and debased.The landscape of Yorkshire is a character in itself described with immense appeal. In the winter, it is bleak and wild and hauntingly beautiful; with wind that moans with the voices of the past and moonlight that sparkles on the snow. In the spring and summer it is halcyon and exuberant, bursting with flowers, birds, breezes and green growth. We understand why Catherine and Heathcliff love it so much. The name Heathcliff itself references the heath of the moor and the cliffs that the two children were so attracted to. Heathcliff is the embodiment of the moor, the earth, and all that is real and sensible, all that Catherine loves and dies to be separated from. Wuthering Heights exalts the earthly realm over the heavenly realm that conventional ideology would have everyone aspire to.As sensitive as Wuthering Heights is towards these flawed characters, it is also a cautionary tale. The love that sustained so much joy and passion in Catherine and Heathcliff is also a love that destroys them. Catherine marries a wealthy, kind man who loves her, but she cannot look past his dull exterior to love him. She is consumed with her obsession with Heathcliff, wastes away pining, and breaks the heart of those who love her. Heathcliff, embittered by Catherine's choice, wrecks havoc by plotting an elaborate revenge on the second generation. His love for her fuels his hatred of everyone else who has a claim to her. While the story could be interpreted as the tragedy of thwarted love, it could also be said that had that love been consummated, it would have been just as destructive, just as dysfunctional. While Catherine and Heathcliff believe themselves to be deeply in love, it can hardly be called love when all they do is hurt each other and make everyone around them miserable and wretched.Wuthering Heights is an incredible novel. The language is resonant and fluid, the characters are complex and vividly brought to life, the atmosphere is masterfully invoked. It is discomfiting, moving, and challenging. It is really an ingenious piece of social commentary revealed through a love story. It is not to be missed."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"The old classic that I had never read but have seen the movie many times.

It's quite slow-paced, as you might expect from such an old novel, but it's never boring.[SPOILER ALERT]It seems like pretty much everyone dies in it, it's natural death after natural death; the story would have been very different with modern medecine!

Bronte tells the story of a man who is renting a room and learns the story of the man who owns the house and the neighboring property, Mr. Heathcliff. This may be the only novel that I've ever read in which every single main character is utterly unlikable: from Heathcliff who is cruel and sadistic to everyone except Catherine, who is shallow to her husband Edgar, who is proud and weak, to his sister Isabella, who is naive and immature, to Hindley, who is nothing more than a vengeful little boy who grows into a vengeful man. His son, Hareton is tolerable though he is depicted as stupid. Then we come to Cathy who is a spoiled little brat. Even the man original narrator, Lockwood, comes across as pretentious. The only redeeming character in my eyes was Nelly, who is flawed but loving. That being said, the novel is so well written and presents it's characters in such a light that you feel like you know them. The prevailing message seems to be that no matter how fall someone has fallen, they can redeem themselves with love. Not sure that I believe this but I can't deny that Bronte work prevails as a masterpiece of literature."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I read this book as a teenager and felt so accomplished for making it through, what I considered to be, a very archaic book.After having just finished reading the book again, I was very torn about how \\"good\\" I thought this books was. It is indeed a very dark and brooding tale with mostly unredeemable characters leaving one to question why a person could be so vindictive.However I realized that while I didn't care for the dark and abusive topic, I absolutely loved the writing style, the grammar and the point of view that the story was told from. I also realized that as a teenager I saw this as a fictional tale and probably thought, naively, that people as cruel as Heathcliff just don't exist in this world... Why ever would a person spend all their energy and machinations on making everyone around them miserable? Indeed, why.I gave this book a four star rating, not because the tale was enjoyable, but because it offered so many epiphanies on how I regarding the experience of reading it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This is a fabulous book for a fabulous price. cant go wrong!

Although I love Bronte's extreme detail of setting the scene or describing the garb that her characters wear -- the old English writing is definitely something that took me a bit of getting used to. I re-read several parts til I absorbed what what being said or who was saying it.The story of Heathcliff and Catherine is definitely an amazing one, and was the reason I chose to do this re-read. With so many references in 'Fifty Shades of Grey', and that character's love for old English writing I chose to re-read this classic & keep it on my main page of my Amazon Kindle for easy access to read it, refer to it & mull over.It is a classic re-read, but if you are not used to the old English you may want to use the dictionary on the Kindle and look up some of the 'lingo' that the Brontes were so famous for using.All in all, it is a great book with deep rooted characters, unrequited love, anger, and jealousy -- and much more that I do not want to give away.

And written by a parson's daughter living in the barren Yorkshire moors.How much of this novel is sexual fantasy and how much is experience? It's impossible to tell. There's no explicit sex in the novel, but we can say it's nothing but implicit sex. It's not about love or hate, it's about two people who've made themselves into a single being. Catherine Earnshaw of Wuthering Heights can neither love or hate her adopted brother Heathcliff: he and she have become part of each other, in their soul and in their flesh.If Wuthering Heights has a tragic element, it's not a conventional one: the moral of the tale isn't that one should resist one's animal impulses. Quite the reverse: Catherine and Heathcliff are one and the tragedy unfolds because of Catherine's decision to disregard her irrational but unbreakable bond with Heathcliff. Just as Catherine should have embraced a life with Heathcliff, maybe we should embrace our animal nature.Emily Bront is a woman of her time and her prose reflects this, yet there are scenes of intense physical violence. Where could a sheltered young Victorian woman have gotten the experience to write of these feelings and actions with such authencity?One of my very favourite novels.

Far from being the romanticized feminine icon she is portrayed to be today, the real Emily Bronte was a very lonely and timid young woman who lived 39 years on this planet and accomplished nothing- leaving behind no friends or family to mourn her short time on this earth. She WAS however a precursor to the modern liberal movement in that she too lived in a fantasy world, the only difference being Ms. Bronte actually named her's. She called it \\"Gondal\\"- and described it as a magical place where everything worked out just the way Emily liked and no one could say or do anything she didn't agree with. Yes, this the hero of feminism... If ONLY there had been a literary critic in Gondal, we might have been spared the Wuthering Heights! I usually enjoy \\"classics,\\" those books that, as Clements so astutely pointed out, everyone wants to have read but no one wants to read. But Wuthering Heights? Ach- I hate this book with a passion. The characters are almost all either pathetic, melodramatic, overly hateful, stupid, incredibly annoying, or some combination thereof. Women have a strange tendency to have babies with no prior warning. Live dogs are randomly hung from hooks, apparently to die. And the plot becomes ridiculously predictable once the simple premise is accepted that the hero has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. It was an awful, hateful book- I spent almost the whole time hoping the characters would die of syphilis so I wouldn't have to read about them whining all the time. On the plus side- Wuthering Heights could make a good movie...if they totally changed the dialogue...and reworked the characters completely. Basically, they would have to film an entirely different movie and just keep the setting (and the name) the same. By the time I finished the book I wanted to take my soldering torch and burn it. My only fear was that if I did, Catherine might be resurrected and proclaim her love for Heathcliff profusely as the book burns away. Actually, that would have been a better ending to the story. Alas I suppose I'll just end up using the book as a clay pigeon."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I found this book very depressing and gloomy.

It's the kind of book romance writers wish they could write nowadays. It's full of love and hatred, passion and madness, devotion and revenge. For anyone who loves the classics and has not experienced the sheer magnificence of this book, pick up a copy and feel all the strong emotions that come with loving until the brink of insanity.For those of you who have read it again and again, pick up this copy and meet Heathcliff and Catherine for the first time.

A MUST!!!(I had the advantage of having the dialect explained at the end but even if you don't it is still extremely enjoyable) even though most of the characters are cruel some despite of that have an inner remorse. the book delves deep within the characters minds and presents them so well.

Catherine Earnshaw wasn't a very good person in my opinion, but on the other hand, her love for Heathcliff was really touching.

From many covers, it appears a feminine novel. Not so! Not so! The novel encompasses a broad range of subjects amongst which the most profound is the effects of prejedice on humanity. Throughout the book, which basically, once started, takes three addictive days, themes of love and hate protrude from the pages. Though a first-person narrative, the novel becomes for the majority, a recollection of events in the past as dictated to the narrator. I assure you, once you read this book, you will relate to these words: pity Heathcliffe!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This novel brought me to tears...It proves that love for some people, is never meant to be.

It will get re-read by me more than anything else except maybe Shakespeare's &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;.I wish I could have had the privilege of having the friendship of the author, who was an accomplished pianist, famous in her neighborhood for her bread, and once beat a dog senseless with her bare hands."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"The writing is not half bad, the language flows well. I'll agree with other readers, it's hard to tell who's leading the narrative. It's also hard to tell the relations of the characters until quite a ways into the book.

I chose this novel for my 12th grade students to read and I decided that I would never again read it. It takes too long for everyone to realize Heathcliff is a jerk. I think that if anyone is interested in reading the Brontes to read Charlotte. If anyone is interested in reading literature from that era, read Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Emily Bronte, one of the Bronte sisters, (the most famous being Charlotte, who wrote Jane Eyre) wrote a classic Gothic romance, chalk-full of the emotions and pathos that a tragic romance encompasses. As a literary work, it is well written and at paar with Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre. This audio book, narrated finely, with a delightful box cover, makes a striking Valentines day gift for women. The story is set in the lush, dark moors of northern England, and centers around a wealthy family and the doomed romance of Catherine and Heathcliff. Catherine comes from a well-to-do family, set in their ways, and all of her societal expectations are heavy on her shoulders. She falls in love with Heathcliff, a deep, spiritual, soulful love, but unfortunately one that could not be consummated. Heathcliff was taken into Catherine's family as an orphan. Heathcliff and Catherine's love, described in the most romantic of terms, is so strong that there is one scene in which Catherine calls out to him in despair, when she is married to another man for his status and convenient position as a powerful family friend, and Heathcliff is able to hear her from his distant stance.The novel is Gothic, although there is no supernatural going-ons and the usual horror that can be associated with Gothic novels. It is a novel full of the dark despair and tragedy of two lovers who can not be together. The character of Heathcliff, in particular, cannot be considered heroic. He is brooding, he is dark, he vows revenge against those who have taken Catherine from him. Likewise, Catherine cannot fulfill the profile of an innocent, hopelessly romantic girl. She is instead, a vain, egotistical and bourgeois materialist, marrying a man for his money and not for his love. But although the immediate situation that occurs with Heathcliff and Catherine, Heathcliff's subsequent vendetta and extraction of revenge are the darkest aspects, the promising and more idealistic love transpires between their children (eventhough they are children of other parents). With stunning narration and a classic feel to the whole thing, this makes a perfect gift on the day that celebrates romance and true love- Valentine's Day."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Haven't read it yet -- downloaded for future reading. . . . . . . . . . . . ."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Downboaded to read on a trip.

Thank goodness for the Kindle dictionary because we don't use most of those words anymore."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Charlotte, Emily Bront's elder sister, wrote that \\"Wuthering Heights was hewn in a wild workshop, with simple tools, out of homely materials\\". This makes sense when we learn that Emily Bront did not care for social life (perhaps due to her extreme shyness) and seemed to scorn the outer world, living contentedly in the bleak scenario of the Yorkshire moors where her clergyman father's parsonage was located. Thus, it was with these \\"homely materials\\" - the wild Yorkshire landscape and its dour inhabitants - that she fashioned her only novel, which is, however, anything but homely.... The book is at the same time beautifully passionate and completely spare in its imagery and the depiction of its characters. The narrative is multifaceted and skilfully employs the technique of using several narrators: Lockwood, the naive Londoner who rents a Yorkshire farm in his search for picturesque landscapes; the commonplace and down-to-earth witness to the novel's amazing events, Nelly Dean; Isabella, the scorned and unloved wife; and so on. Each of these characters lends his or her particular voice to the story, thus making it a sort of patchwork where there seems to be no \\"official\\" version - but which is at the same time seamlessly cohesive.One reviewer, surprisingly, goes so far as to say that Cathy married Edgar for the money (she belongs to the same social class as he does - it is Heathcliff, the slum waif, who is the outsider) and that Heathcliff takes the kid Hindley and teaches him to hate his father (incidentally, the boy that Heathcliff takes under his \\"care\\" is not Hindley but Hindley's son, Hareton). In order to be qualified for writing a review, readers should make at least a honest effort at reading and understanding the book.I believe that the biggest mistake that readers tend to make on approaching \\"Wuthering Heights\\", a mistake perhaps fueled by Hollywood, is to think of it as a romance or love story - which it only secondarily is. This is, above all, a family saga, spanning some three decades and concerned with one individual's revenge on the families he considers to have wronged him. It is also a portrait of human passions - love, hatred, anguish and grief - in a wild, desolate setting where the forces of nature cannot be kept at bay.All in all, a work of great strength and beauty. It would have done Emily Bront a lot of good to know that her masterpiece has at last received the recognition it deserves."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"this book has haunted me from the day i've read it. however i'd read it again because it is written so well.

However, as much as I enjoyed &lt;i>Jane Eyre&lt;/i>, I liked Emily's writing and story telling much better.It is tragic story about passion, hatred, romance and a love that reaches beyond the grave. If you haven't already, READ IT!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I have read many classics, I am an avid reader of them. I collect them all, and analyze which ones are truly classic. I got this book when I was younger than 10, which is pretty heavy stuff for a child. Yet I focused mainly on the actual misery of Heathcliff and Catherine, I think it is the most engrossing and provocative story ever. I also got nauseous from the constant &quot;happy&quot; storie that other kids were reading. I thought this book suits my deep, &quot;tortured soul&quot; kind of reader. I will always have this book on my top list, it actually is timeless. This book will make you yearn for the open moors and the old manor where Heathcliff falls in love with Catherine. It is the best love story I have ever read. If someone is overwhelmed by it, then I suggest to move to something a little bit more shallow. I know I follow this great example of literature in my own writings, which I hope to have published soon. Not for the impatient reader, that's for sure."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Wuthering Heights met my expectations as well as exceeded them. I will admit i was tempted to give the novel four stars because of the difficulty in grasping the intricate intertwining of the characters. BUT I came to realize that the genius in the novel lies within the geniusly thought out symmetrical family plots. Many describe the novel as being very dark, but i , on the other hand, describe Wuthering Heights as being raw and original. Emily Bronte can only be marveled apon. How could someone with a secluded life, much as her characters lived, have such a great insight into these wild, but true characters? Its almost unbelievable, but I now give her respect, just as much as I have for her other remarkable sister Charlotte. Although Jane Eyre is still my favorite novel, Wuthering Heights is not far behind that coveted spot. READ WUTHERING HEIGHTS!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I'm fond of that novel because it tells you something about the dark side of man and besides that it's also a very profound love story. To be sure it is a really unusual love story because the two main characters never have a relationship like normal lovers have, they only become united after death. I very much liked that Catherine is close to us as readers. She is always present even though she is already dead at the beginning of the novel. But Nelly tells the story of her life and so it seems to the most natural thing in the world to talk about supernatural events and experiences. While reading the novel my feelings changed a lot, once I was very angry at Heathcliff, then I only felt contempt for Linton and his weakness. The novel is written in very thrilling way, you never know how Heathcliff will react next, he is so erratic. Even though Catherine is not an innocent person at all, you can feel with her and you can sympathise with her throughout the story. And although the character of Heathcliff is so mysterious and dark he attracts our attention in a special manner: He descends from a gypsy family and thus he represents the hidden and often violently suppressed sides of man."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Wuthering Heights tells the tale of the passionate and jealousy ridden love of Cathy and Heathclif. Fate, social class, and family separates them. The tale has amazing descriptions, themes, and characters. Violence, passion, and envy are all themes in the book. It is inspiring and wonderful, truly intriuging."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"The novel, Wuthering Heights, by Emily Bronte was a good story about the love two people have for each other, and how that love is never lost. From the time that they were young children, Catherine and Heathcliff always had a certain liking for each other, that turned into a deep love. When Heathcliff found out that Catherine may have changed her mind, he was crushed and he vowed to get her back. He used other characters to avenge his love for Catherine and to make her jealous enough to come back to him, one example of that is Isabella. The character of Heathcliff is a somewhat of a selfish and savage character, because he does anything to get back to Catherine and to avenge the hate that is shown to him by Edgar and Hindley. The character of Catherine seems somewhat of an innocent character, who is caught up in what to do, and whether money and status is more important or true love is more important to her. Heathcliff's return to his true love causes problems with her and shows that love can be painful and cause agony sometimes. The characters in this novel were well developed and characterized, which is important to me when I read a novel. I think that the novel Wuthering Heights shows the ideas and opionins that Emily Bronte had about love and how it can effect the lives of people. I found this to be a pretty good novel, a little confusing at the beginning though. I, however, in comparison liked the novel, Jane Eyre, by her sister Charlotte, better."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This novel has touched me deeply since first reading and I have enjoyed it many times over, again becoming engrossed in the characters with each new read, yet each time finding something new. A true classic. It is a little sad, though, that this great book averages four stars, the same rating as many of the comparatively poorly written, more contemporary but soon-to-be-forgotten fiction reviewed on this site. Not that one should confine oneself to reading classics, but at least recognize them for what they are."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights is an excellent story of love and hate. Both love and hate are powerful forces, but Bronte shows that loves conquers all in her book. I enjoyed this book and gave it a ten because Bronte shows that two people can be brought together in life and death. This book never has a dull moment once you really understand it, and from that point on, you fall in love with all of the outgoing characters. One woman is torn between love of a man and his money and love of a soulmate. Just because the soulmate is not rich, she will not marry him, and then starts the hate and jealousy. Even though the girl could not be with her soulmate in life, they are together after death. Bronte overall shows how revenge can drive a person to their graves, and how love always overcomes hate. -G.

I feel that it had a good story line, but failed to grab my attention through the whole book. Even though I didn't fall head over heals for the book, there are some aspects of it that I happened to like. As on page 230, where Heathcliif put Liton and Cathy out of the room and Linton feels the full affect of his rage and illness as &quot;his cries were choked by a dreadful fit of coughing; blood gushing from his mouth, and he fell on the ground&quot;. The fact there was blood in the excert didn't make it an eye catcher, but the fact that it was so well described. The way she wrote it made me close my eyes and visualize Liton at a door have an attack. I said the book was interesting as well as dull. The dullness happened to come at the very begining when Mr.Lockwood was the narrarator. The issue I had at the start of the book was the fact that the long and drawn out details of the kitchen. On page three, Emily Bronte took all my energy out of finishing the book. It seems as if she spent years reasearching design, and decided to put it in the book. She describes the floor &quot;of smooth, white stone&quot; the chairs as being &quot;high backed, primitive structures, painted green&quot;. Just to give you a taste, I only chose to write a few descriptions. but the book is filled with what seemed to me endless dribble of description."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Dear Readers, I found Wuthering Heights to be both depressing and uplifting in different ways. This book took very sharp turns in the charactor's lives. I found that this was what made this book so interesting. It is hard to explain my feelings on this book without giving away the ending, but I would recomend this book to every young adult. This book is about personal choices and in a way about moral values. The way that one person can learn from their elders. I feel that every young adult should read this book before going on their own."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Though Wuthering Heights was well-written and captivating, the plot line left a bit to be desired. The love, lust, revenge, and hatred all added up to a story resembling a soap opera. While the novel did present a powerful love story, it was one that fueled manipulative plots of revenge. Even so, the book was enjoyable. But eventually, the positive aspects of the novel were overshadowed and it became difficult to continue reading because of the layered plot. Bronte was a great writer, but her characters were merely two-dimensional entities whose goals in life were the direct result of love or hate. The story seemed somewhat unrealistic, simply because the characters seemed to represent extremes. So, while Wuthering Heights was very well-written, it didn't keep my interest. So I give it a rating a little above average."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Bronte's _Wuthering Heights_ is a decent book about a man named Heathcliff who did not get to marry the girl he loved, therefore he dedicated his life to making everyone else as miserable as he was. This book had a few unrealistic parts and was not always practical, but it did have a pretty good plot line. I did not like the way Bronte made her characters so naive and how she made them have no common sense. I am glad I read this book and would recommend it to other people if they like confusing love stories about people who don't like each other.

Like the idea of marrying your own cousin was something i thought of as nasty, and would never happen. But after reading this book my views chang, but I still find it wrong. The book starts off slow and boring, but the middle of the book gets alot better. The love that Catherine and Heathcliff have for each other is something almost magical. But then the book has a cruel plot in which they never get a chance to get married, or really a chance at love. Like when Catherine quotes &quot;I am Heathcliff! He's always, always in my mind: not as a pleasure, any more than I am always a pleasure to myself, but as my own being. So don't talk of our separation again:&quot; (Bronte 74-75). This love story ends in a cruel twist of fate for them, but Heathcliff plans revenge after he can't get his love. So for the rest of the book you get a chance to witness Heathcliff's evil heart at work, and his revenge on the Earnshaw's and Linton's."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte contains a complex, confusing and unreal story. Bronte begins with the end of the book, thus making readers think backwards in sequence. Also, Catherine and young Catherine become harder to tell apart as the story progresses. Bronte refers to both girls as &quot;Catherine&quot; and &quot;Cathy.&quot; Another baffling subject, the coincidence that the second generation coincides with the first. Catherine, Heathcliff and Edgar's relationship corresponds to Cathy, Hareton and Linton's relationship. Also, was it per chance that young Cathy's birth and Catherine's death lie on the same day? Bronte utilizes the first generation to model the second, making the story predictable and not interesting. Carrie Chandler"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Wuthering Heights, to me, portrays a sorrowful story that shows the thin line between love and hate. Throughout the book the characters would reveal their love for one another; then all of a sudden, they would betray their loved ones. Like when Linton would express his love and gratitude for Cathy, and then quickly despise her when Heathcliff tells him she only wants him for his money. Heathcliff's attitude also changes. His impressions and appearance seemed very nice to young Cathy at first when they met at Wurthering Heights (199). Heathcliff also kidnaps her and Nelly, and strikes her (247). I also believe that Heathcliff did not start all of the problems. Cathy brought her woeful death upon own herself. She did not follow her heart; she should have married Heathcliff instead of Edgar. Isabella shouldn't have been so dumbfounded about marrying Heathcliff so quickly without really getting to know his true personality. For a while the book seemed kind of dull, and did not make any sense at first, but once I reached the apex of the story it seemed to get pretty interesting.

However the hate and darkness in the book pretty much drowns out the love story. Most of Heathcliff's hate is derived from Catherine's love but most of his actions are very severe. I believe the reason he acts like he does after Catherine's death is because he is without his &quot;soul.&quot; Death pretty much occupied the whole book. Almost everyone died and it caused people to act in strange ways. As strong as Cathy and Heathcliff's love was, I believe that Bronte's obsession with death and revenge drowned out this love. Again I pose the question, Why on earth is this book a &quot;classic&quot;?"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Upon reading Wuthering Heights, I rate the book a 3 from 1 to 10. Such a low score relates to the long, drawn out wordiness on insignificant parts to the story. Over exaggeration of minor details really confused me in this book. The book made me think that a long, drawn out explanation of a minor detail such as Mr. Lockwood's description of Catherine's library as &quot;... select book choices,..&quot; delapidated &quot; (16) was important but as I completed the book, I realized it was just another attempt to go on and on. I feel if this book became a play people would say it is melodramatic and boring. The plot did grab my attention ( I must admit), and for that reason I gave the book a 3 instead of a 1. However, I think Bronte really &quot;messed up&quot; a developed, intringuing story line with insignificant details that gave readers the idea that the point contained a hidden point that one might find later in the book or one people needed to know. I mean, Who cares how Catherine kept her book collection.

Dear Bronte, if you're going to write a book, add more to the characters and don't just state the obvious.

True, the violent love between Heathcliff and Catherine is heartwrenching; however, the most difficult part of this novel for me was that there was no character that was lovable, or sympathetic. Just when I started to think that Heathcliff was not so bad after all, he would commit another shocking deed of horrific cruelty. Catherine was just annoying. I also found the plot hard to follow, what with a third person telling the story, and then swinging back to first person narrative.

The overly dramatic love scenes and long drawn out sections provide the periods of ennui. The characters are poorly developed, and the lack of minor characters leaves the reader wandering. The novel seems to start off sluggishly, and then it picks up, only to be followed by the slowness again. If anything, Wuthering Heights shows the destructiveness of love and revenge through the character Heathcliff. The novel seemed to be one long drawn out soap opera, where the characters rarely changed and new characters were rarely added. Overall, this novel does not meet the adoration that it is constantly given."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"And just why would Ms. Bronte write a book with not a single likeable character? In fact, everyone in the novel would be rejected by Jerry Springer as being too degenerate for his show. No doubt the writing is facile enough, but by page 5, the story itself descends into what has to be the most turgid potboiler imagineable.

It's style is unique alright, if by unique you mean a brand new alternative form of euthanasia. Nevermind the fact that Bronte's \\"paragraphs\\", which are actually composed of one or two extremely long sentences, have superfluous clauses slapped on top of each other repeatedly. The syntax of these sentences is not stiff or constipated, but in fact, it is just the opposite. It is more like the imbibement of heavy laxatives, and the resulting inducement of loose and watery diarrhea that runs across the pages, unpredictable in its rampant tides that sends everyone over the hills. When do the prepositional phrases stop Emily? When? Unfortunately, this was a book that I was required to read for school, and I managed to read a grand total of half of the book before I shut it, never to bother it again. However, what do I know, I'm just a high school student that is just following his personal intuitions about Wuthering Heights. For a more thought-provoking and relevant book in modern-day society, go read George Orwell's 1984. You'd be surprised at how its content trumps the romantic trainwreck that is the brainchild of Emily Bronte."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"When it was first published, \\"Wuthering Heights\\" elicited strong criticism. Although Charlotte Bronte's \\"Jane Eyre\\" also received its share of negative criticism, it was not as markedly disliked as her sister's book. As time went by, the pendulum swung in the opposite direction, and it was Emily's book that eventually came to be hailed as superior to Charlotte's, particularly as the 20th century got under way.I have read the book three times. It was part of a high school English Lit assignment. To be quite honest, I could barely stomach the book back then. It was too strange, wild, and terrifying to me. The second time I read it, several years ago, I was much older. Thus, I was able to appreciate its masterful prose style and brilliant characterizations. In fact, it was these two factors that kept me reading until the very end. The same thing happened a few months ago. Once more I was hypnotized by this horrible tale of people whose lives went so very wrong. It was one character in particular who exerted a rather puzzling pull on me - Heathcliff. I read almost against my will, hoping against hope that I would be able to find some good quality in him. Of course, I vaguely remembered the plot from the second reading, so I knew that I would not find any such thing.This book, in its entirety, is about Heathclif. It's about how the abuse he suffered at the hands of his benefactor's son, Hindley Earnshaw, twisted him into a demonic caricature of a human being. As such , it is definitely not a pleasant read. However, it does serve as a testament to Emily Bronte's genius. That such a hideous creature sprang from this young woman's imagination is nearly unbelievable, considering her background. Something dark and cruel stirred in the nether recesses of her mind. M. L. Von Franz, a Jungian analyst writing in \\"Man and His Symbols\\", edited by Carl Jung, mentions Heathcliff, describing him as Emily Bronte's animus, the masculine part of a woman's psyche. The animus can be evil or good. Heathcliff is demonic indeed. Bronte brings him to life with great vividness, and this undeniably displays her great talent for making a character truly live in a reader's mind.Therein lies the rub. Heathcliff is so repulsive, so utterly demonic, and so overpowering, that he makes the book sheer torture to read. His influence is seen on every page. The one redeeming quality he might have possessed, his love for Cathy, turns into a monstrous, sick obsession toward the end of the book.While I can admire the powerful way the author delineates character, as well as her obvious command of writing style, I simply cannot say that this book is one of my favorites. I find it especially strange to see it referred to as a love story, and tagged as \\"romance\\" on Amazon. There is little to none of that in this novel. The supposed love story between Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw is sketchy at best. They are separated for three years, due to her stubbornness, as well as his pride. When he suddenly reappears, determined to see her, she is already married to another man, one whom Heathcliff despises as a weakling, due to his passionless nature. Yet it is that very man who treats Catherine with kindness, catering to her every whim. Had she, instead, chosen Heathcliff, things might have been very different. Such a tumultuous relationship could very well have ended in tragedy. Had Bronte taken the story in this direction, the book could, indeed, be classified as \\"a dark romance\\". As it stands, however, it certainly cannot, nor should it be.Catherine Earnshaw herself is not a wholly pleasant character, either, although she never descends to the depths of depravity Heathcliff does. She is, however, a very self-centered creature; her sole reason for marrying Linton is so that she won't be brought below her station by marrying Heathcliff. She attempts to rationalize her decision by claiming that she can use Linton's money to \\"help\\" Heathcliff, but this is a rather flimsy excuse.Through Heathcliff, this also becomes a tale of family dysfunction, and of how that dysfunction poisons anyone who comes into contact with that family, whose most disturbed representative, Heathcliff, engages in a very elaborate plan of revenge throughout the latter part of the book.Allthough, again, the writing is brilliant, the book does have one major flaw, and that is the plotting. Characters are killed off when they are no longer necessary. Now, I do agree that a writer has to include sad and unhappy events in a novel, even if he or she is writing within the parameters of the modern romance genre. However, having characters die every few pages or so is just too contrived. Even Cathy's death is contrived. It's designed to make Heathcliff even more of a monster than he already is. Besides, there is no clear explanation for her death. True, she had gotten herself into a state of near hysteria due to auto-suggestion, but this is hardly enough to cause anyone's death; at least, not as suddenly as hers comes about. It's just not believable. Furthermore, the reader finds out, after her demise, that she was pregnant! She very conveniently gives birth, too, before she inexplicably departs from this world. This seems to be a rather forced way of increasing the pathos.Other reviewers have objected to the narration-within-a-narration technique Bronte uses. Actually, I found this quite intriguing. This is one of the elements about the book that actually maintained my interest. Nelly Dean turns out to be a very shrewd, highly perceptive observer, with an especially keen eye for nuanced detail.I was glad that poor Hareton got a chance at love with Catherine Linton. That was another element about the book that I liked. Still, their union is also a bit too contrived, since they happen to be cousins.All in all, although I do recognize the greatness of Emily Bronte as a writer, I have to say that I consider her sister's novel, \\"Jane Eyre\\", far superior, with a more polished plot structure"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"If I were to go back and read a Bronte book, I would readJane Eyre. For 85% of Wuthering Heights I thought, This is just a book full of miserable people. I can't sympathize with any of them. I almost stopped listening (it was an audiobook) a few times. But...1. It has a lovely ending.2. It has an interesting narrative structure: The whole story is narrated by Mr Lockwood, who observes very little of the action firsthand, instead hearing most of it from Nelly (the story within a story) who hears key parts of it from other minor characters (the story within a story within a story!).3. The best of the characters love to read.

Amazon--please fix."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This book is without question one of the darkest and most enigmatic classics in English Literature, you will find a miriad of opinion on the book. I for one think it's a great character study, and Bronte's prose are singular. At its heart this is of course a love story, but a brutal one. Heathcliff, is one of the most famous or infamous characters in English Literature, he is truly an enigma. His relationship with Catherine, and its consequences are of course the crux of the novel. Heathcliffs love for her is all consuming, you keep waiting for him to say, I wish I could quit you. Their love is at once beautiful and at second glance toxic. Everybody should read this book, whether you love it or not, I assure you it will stay with you..forever."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This story is very well written and told. It arrived in great time and shape."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Would you like to become acquainted with one of the greatest love stories of all time? Did you know there is an occidental answer to Dream of the Red Chamber, with that same kind of passion so intense it borders on hatred and madness? Would you like to hear a live performance of a really FUNNY novel, with slyly ironic or blackly comical vignettes every few pages? Or perhaps you're in the mood for a quintessentially gothic tale, an epic ghost story spanning generations? Wuthering Heights is all of these things and more. (For instance, one of its most remarkable features, instantly lost in any so-called \\"film version,\\" is its wonderfully intricate narrative structure, quite on a par with that of a Joseph Conrad novel such as Lord Jim or Victory.)Now, who on earth could read WH properly so that all those nuances and overtones might be brought together in a single performance? Michael Page and Laural Merlington, that's who! These two are perfectly attuned to all the qualities that make WH a masterpiece.(And no, there is no technical flaw to worry about. That reviewer was confused by the exotic settings required for playing back the audio cassette version, I suspect, although ostensibly she was reviewing the CD version, and that made the negative remark doubly weird, a true non sequitur. I've owned the audio cassette version for several years, and I just recently bought the CD version too. Either way, the recording is a treasure. If you love literature, buy it! If you're not sure what literature is all about, buy it! Then you'll see.)"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This is the only novel by Emily Bronte, one of the three English Bronte sisters. Emily lived for just 30 years: 1818 to 1848.I bought and read this Penguin Classic version of Wuthering Heights. It has a good preface by Lucasta Miller, author of \\"The Bronte Myth,\\" and it has an introduction by Pauline Nestor, who has written two books on the Bronte sisters including \\"Charlotte Bronte' in 1987, and a related book \\"George Eliot\\" in 2002. I read the analysis after reading the book and I recommend that you not read too much about the details of the story until you have read the book. I read the book after reading \\"Jane Eyre\\" and \\"Shirley.\\" I read the three books one after the other.\\"Jane Eyre\\" by Charlotte Bronte has touches of Dickens and Jane Austen in a fictional biopgraphy of a young English woman. That novel is more conventional in plot and structure and it is a compelling read. It was a big hit in 1847 and was a much bigger and more popular novel than \\"Wuthering Heights\\" - published the same year in 1847. Both sisters used male pseudonyms. The present novel has become more popular and better accepted with the passage of time. Even today, \\"Jane Eyre\\" remains as the more popular novel, but now there is a strong appreciation of what Emily Bronte has created: it is an unusual piece of literature. Some think that it shows much more originality than the popular work of Charlotte.In short, Emily Bronte has created a horror book which is mostly grounded in reality. The characters have the problems within themselves. There is nothing unusual or super-natural in the book. The novel is short and concise. It is a well written and entertaining novel. But unlike most novels, it is hard to have sympathy with any characters. One likes certain people in the book because they are not as bad or as outrageous as some of the others. I guess we could say the protagonists are Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw. The latter is somewhat sympathetic while Heathcliff is a man with serious problems. All in all it is very convincing.Also, Emily Bronte uses the story within a story technique: it is a narrative told by a housekeeper with the beginning and closing chapters used to form the story and bring closure.The novel is slow to start but most who can get through the first 100 pages will be well rewarded.I highly recommend this Penguin Classic."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"i wrote my full review on my test mr matta im just lazy because i dont want to type it allWuthering heights is a good book.

Here's why:Confusing -- Several characters all share the same/similar names which sometimes makes it confusing.Unsympathetic characters -- I felt that Heathcliff was such a total jerk that he didn't deserve any sympathy whatsoever. So that made it hard for me to sympathize with the woman who loved him, which in turn forced me to reject the concept of this being a love story. Even the most vile villans of all time usually exhibit one small redeeming quality. I felt that Healthcliff didn't and thus I didn't care what happened to him or his love interest.Boring -- Nothing good happens.If you like Emily Bronte nothing I say here will change your mind, but if you don't or are reluctant, then stay away from this one."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Well as if the Nineteenth Century weren't bad enough we now have Penguin shoving it down our maws every other day with another re-issue of some tepid &quot;classic.&quot; Miss Bronte has done it again and wielded her magic pen as a wand and cast her net of sleep on the unsuspecting reading public of America. The only consolation the non-preteen girl reader can get form this sack of slumber is the final realisation that &quot;wuthering&quot; is British slang for &quot;your eyelids are getting heavy, why don't you just nod off?&quot; I really have to say to Miss Bronte that I did not find Garfield's antics convincing in the least."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I know this is a classic loved by many. I, however, did not enjoy reading it. I read it through to the end, but it was tough. I did not like any of the characters except for Nelly, & Cathy (the daughter). When the dialogue was of Joseph, it was extremely difficult to read. I had to force myself to read it aloud just to figure out what he was saying. I don't like to work that hard when reading a book. For its time, I know it was a grand book. The writing was fine, but it was depressing and almost all the characters too flawed for my taste."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Brilliantly written; I'll give the novel that much. The plot masterfully contrived, characters well developed, settings enigmatically constructed, the novel as a whole was from a literary standpoint a success. However, the language is consistently dark throughout. The wording carries heavy negative overtones and a depressed, pessimistic and even evil mood pervades from the first to the end. Relief from the darkness finally breaks through only in the end when one character steps beyond herself and assists another in elevating himself. Otherwise, bitterness and selfish ambition drive the story. The depravity runs rampant from bad to worse as characters systematically use, degrade, and abuse one another to work out their bitterness stemming from one father's mistakes and failed parenting.If you love unique, dark characters, twisted plots, and the study of the effects of family dysfunction on a multigenerational level than the novel will not only be worthwhile, but also enjoyable as few would disagree with Emily Bronte's genius as a writer. However, I would caution that the book might not best be read in the dead of winter or over a prolonged rainy spell as it is rather depressing. But on a sunny, warm day, with ample positive diversions, the novel may not only be a challenging companion, it will likely make you very thankful for the companions you personally have that are altogether so unlike the characters in the story."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"'Wuthering Heights' by Emily Bronte is a dark, brooding novel of unfulfilled love. Most everyone dies young and unhappy. Everyone seems to fall in love with first cousins, which has me believe their strange behavior is in part due to in-breeding. And there is our lead male character, Heathcliff, who leads a vindictive and sadistic life after losing his honey, Catherine (..she was also a bit loopy, and died young). This book is whole-heartedly depressing, and not at all romantic ... unlike the famous film adaptation with Merle Oberon and Lawrence Olivier.So I really cannot see why this book is so highly rated. Oh, the prose itself is okay. The dialogue is fine. But the story is so narrowly focused (the romantic failings of two intermingled families in rural Yorkshire circa 1800) and the characters morose. Healthy amounts of anti-depressants and a Majorca vacation are needed for these fools.Bottom line: almost laughably dark and twisted. Emily Bronte must of been one very unhappy woman."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"&quot;It is as if Emily Bronte could tear up all that we know human beings by, and fill these unrecognizable transparencies with such a gust of life that they transcend reality.&quot; -Virginia WoolfDamn straight, sister!

Do not, I repeat, DO NOT, read this in the gloom of winter, as I stupidly did.The epic story of Catherine and Heathcliff plays out against the dramatic backdrop of the wild English moors, and presents an astonishing vision of fate and obsession, passion and REVENGE.This classic book is a bummer. Not that it's bad writing, but my oh my.. it makes you so sad! Your heart just goes out for Heathcliff and the depression he faces.

All characters have flaws: Cathy's haughtiness, Edgar's wimpiness, Linton's peevishness, Heathcliff's evilness, but these flaws only make the characters more interesting.Take Hareton and Heathcliff for instance; both posses a strong and profound character instilled with a certain degree of pride, and both posses the potential for becoming good or evil. Heathcliff becomes revenge-driven because he once had been loved and his love is taken away by Edgar, who is not even, according to Heathcliff, capable of being loved: &quot;I was a fool to fancy for a moment that she valued Edgar Linton's attachment more than mine. If he loved her with all the powers of his puny being, he couldn't love as much in eighty years as I could in a day...It is not in him to be loved like me; how can she love in him what he has not?&quot; Heathcliff is angered because he knows Cathy still loves him but is wasting her love on Edgar, who doesn't even deserve her love and is making her worse by trying to care for her: &quot;He might as well plant an oak in a flowerpot and expect it to thrive as imagine he can restore her to vigour in the soil of his shallow cares.&quot; When Heathcliff was loved by Cathy, he had the potential to become good, but when he is deprived of her love, he becomes evil.Very engrossing book!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This book is perfect in every way.

I enjoyed it greatly."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"\\"Wuthering Heights\\" is one of the true classic romantic novels for all time. Emily Bronte's novel was controversial at the time because of the lovers who defied social mores,and that Heathcliff was an anti-hero. It's the original gothic novel. Stephenie Meyer claims to be an heiress to Bronte,even having her heroine Bella read \\"Wuthering Heights\\",but can't hold a candle to the classic.\\"Wuthering Heights\\" has a simple premise. Catherine's father adopts a gypsy boy,Heathcliff. The two have a bond like brother and sister,but as they grow older it becomes more romantic. Catherine marries the gentle,kind,aristocratic Edgar despite the fact Heathcliff passionately desires her. Their love remains ambiguous. Did they have a mutual longing for death? Heathcliff is abusive to Catherine,avoiding her when she pines for him,wishes she were in Hell after she dies,and abuses his children. Did their love have a sexual element,making the lovers at the end unknowing half-siblings,the children of the same mother but different fathers? Some have argued that Cathy&Heathcliff;'s love is so metaphysical they never shared the bed,and that Cathy despises sex anyhow.

One of my favourite part was when catherine was deciding whether or not to marry linton and had explained what heathcliff meant to her to her housekeeper. My favourite quotes from that part: \\"my great miseries in life has been heathcliff's\\", \\"he is more than myself than i am\\" and my favourite which was mentioned in eclipse, \\"if all else perished and he remains, i should still continue to be. but if all else remained and he were anihilated, the universe would turn into a mighty stranger\\"Another favourite part was when both of them were reunited before catherine died. there was a speck of humanity in them when they were reunited and you somehow forget how horrible they were.Another favourite part was when heathcliff learned that catherine died and the way he handled the news, it was devastating and for that moment, i feel sad for him and again, forget for a moment of how rude and vicious his character is. that one small paragraph was a mix of love and grieve all together which was written with so much power that I had to stop reading for a minute to digest it.the story is mostly about the consequences of the love between catherine and heathcliff..their love affected a lot of people and i guess it shows the dark side of love and obsession."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I've tried to read a number of Classics, and usually think people must have been awfully bored before the electronic age to slog through them and enjoy it.

Classic novels primarily about love and romance can be offered but should not be assigned to 15-year-old boys since, generally speaking, they are not interested in this type novel and tend to avoid reading it at all cost. There are so many wonderful novels (Of Mice and Men, Lord of the Flies, for example) that will engage even the most reluctant readers, and can be offered as a choice to the more girl-oriented classics. Teachers, please be conscious of assigning these books without offering an option. Otherwise they do the opposite of that which you hope to instill in them . . . deterrents to reading!

The tone is dark, but en-capturing and exiting on a social psychological level. It can teach you a thing or two about the effects society and upbringing have on people."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"It is easy to understand why Emily Bront's first (and only) novel was ill-received upon its first publication. Perhaps the ultimate Gothic novel, Wuthering Heights is a far cry from the simple tale of ill-starred lovers one might expect from the pen of a Bront. Dark, sordid, even vulgar at times, the story of anti-hero Heathcliff - a gypsy child adopted, but never accepted, by the Earnshaw family of Wuthering Heights - teems with all the basest passions of mankind.Befriended only by the younger Earnshaw child, a girl named Catherine, Heathcliff grows to hate all those who dare tread upon him because of his low birth. He grows obsessively attached to the beautiful, wild-spirited Catherine, and when her pride forces her to marry another rather than stoop to Heathcliff's own station in life, he begins plotting the grand revenge that will send all of them to their graves.Few - if any - likable characters populate this book. It is a tale of love, but it is not an uplifting tale. It is a story of cruelty, selfish passion, vengeance, and finally madness. Despite its depressing theme, however, Bront's exceptional writing raises it to the deservedly lofty height of a classic.Told mostly through the first-person narration of housekeeper Ellen Dean, the story progresses through Heathcliff's tormented childhood, Catherine's marriage to Edgar Linton, Heathcliff's elaborate revenge against the child of Catherine and Edgar's marriage, and finally his strange departure from the world of the Heights."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Seriously hated every page of this book. Not that it matters, but I read a lot of classic literature, and this is by far the worst book I have ever read. The characters were mean, vile and had no redeeming qualities.

I know it's supposed to be a classic, but there are hundreds of really good books in this world, and this just isn't one of them.We always try to compare the Bronte girls to Jane Austen, but each of the Bronte sisters published her first book in 1847, and Jane Austen's books were published between 1811 and 1817, so they aren't really contemporaries. Austen's books really describe everyday family concerns, mostly relating to marriage. Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights both described families and their connections, but the stories were more out of the ordinary; these are almost more like soap operas than like Austen novels. This book contains some references to a ghost and lots of cruelty and intrigue, none of which exist in Austen's books.Another huge difference between this book and Austen's is that none of the main characters are likeable: Hindley was mean to Heathcliff, Heathcliff is a jerk to everyone, Catherine and Cathy are both a little spoiled, Hareton is proud and rude, and Joseph is just annoying. There are only three characters who aren't awful, and one dies pretty quickly.English teachers will probably still force their students to read this, but I'll stick with Austen myself."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"My only complaint with this Oxford version is that the explanatory notes are all at the very end of the book, not on the individual pages (ie, footnotes).

'Wuthering Heights' is amazing. The story is intense and passionate. It makes a bold statement on bi-racial love, class and cultural barriers, and revenge. My most favorite character is the most evil of them all - Heathcliff. His story just shows how much damage resentment, pride and revenge can do to a human being. It is a timeless lesson. The only negative of this book is that the relationship between Catherine, the younger and Hareton feels underdeveloped. It just happens too quickly. Otherwise, I think the ending is appropriate. The younger characters don't repeat the mistake of their elders. Too bad they're cousins. It gives the story a twisted, perverted edge. In the end, though, this book is most certainly worth the read. The story is captivating, suspenseful and intense. When you read it, you don't know what's going to happen next. You just want to keep reading to find out. A genuine treat.

It is no wonder that during the life of the author, she never received the satisfaction of knowing what a classic she had written - it was only after the reprinting of her novel, posthumous, that Emily Bronte received the praise that she deserved, for a book that deserves much more than a praise.I read \\"Wuthering Heights\\" often - not because I believe in I believe in the dramatics of love, but simply because I believe in it. Love, that is. Wuthering Heights is full of characters who are morally bankrupt, and despicable to the core - but you cannot help but feel for them anyway. One moment you feel sorry for Heathcliff, and with the turn of a page, are filled with such hatred for him. But that an author can create such convincing characters, that they can evoke such emotions in you, is what makes this book so special. For me it's a lesson, that when one finds love, one must look past the color, the creed, the caste and the credentials to embrace what you have found - for if you let it go, you will break your own heart, and in the process, bring pain to all hearts enjoined with yours. A classic tale, about love, friendship and betrayal - a must read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"The basic premise is about two children growing up in the same house- clever and mischievous Cathy and enigmatic Heathcliff. They soon go beyond normal sibling interaction and enter an obsessive an disturbing love affair with one another, but due to Heathcliff's status as an adopted street arab and Cathy's death, they can never be together. Gradually, Heathcliff is driven to near insanity, and the story continues from the eyes of Nellie, a maid, and Cathy, the first Cathy's daughter.*** SPOILER ALERT***A little warning to anyone who was expecting a happy story- this isn't one. Cathy and Heathcliff's \\"love\\" can best be described as creepy attatchment, and the ending gave me nightmares for a week.That being said, there are some genuinely touching moments in Wuthering Heights, such as when Cathy 2 makes peace with her cousin and tries to teach him how to read. Cathy 1's and Heathcliff's childhood interactions are also sweet.But at first glance, there is little that's likeable. The characters are fairly unpleasant and cruel to one another. What redeems them is that they're interesting; even if you were rooting for their deaths at the end (hi, Heathcliff), you still want to know what happens to them.What really makes this book soar is a gorgeous and dark writing style. Emily Bronte manages to pull off a very difficult piece with flying colors. The details make the book come alive and the sense of urgency was beautiful. It's hard to describe, but there's a dreamy lyrical quality, almost as though you're in a seductive nightmare. What makes me give her even more props is that everything about Wuthering Heights is balancing delicately- a wrong chapter or so and the story would collapse.The overall method of telling the story is also great. Told through Nellie's careful first person PoV, Heathcliff and Cathy are allowed to remain enigmatic and seem as though there's more than what meets the eye, like a veil over everything.I would recommend this, but not for most children. It's more of a psychological thriller than anything else, but wonderfully written and a compelling story with beautiful development."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"i was made to read this in high school and hated every word of it...how could i like a book where i despised every character, right?? then i read it again in my mid 20's and i still despised every character...but absolutely loved it! it's now one of my fave novels and i've read it many times over. i think the style and subject matter is a little beyond the reach of most teens and it's a shame it's offered to them as it has probably put many off trying many of the classics later in life."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Such a dark love story that started from two people but affected everyone around them.

The way Emily Bronte wrote of the unending love between Heathcliff and Catherine is captivating, especially when you read the story of Ms. Bronte and how she came to create the story. A must read for all lovers of classic novels!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"The book, Wuthering Heights is a classic love story set in the time period of the 1700s. Emily Bronte focuses on the sad and tragic unforbbiden love between Catherine Earshaw and Healthcliff as well as the even more heartbreaking story of Catherine Linton. The story of the two young women is told by Ms. Nelly Dean, who is relating the story to a character by the name of Mr. Lockwood, who lives on the propety owned by Heathcliff, the major antagonist throughout the book.The setting of the book is set during the 17-1800s, which is stated by Mr. Lockwood in the beginning of the story. He starts out by describing his \\"days as a tenant at Thrushcross grange in the year 1801\\" (chapter 1, page 1). Healthcliff is relating his adventure to Nelly Dean telling her that he and Catherine wanted to get \\"a glimpse of the grange lights,\\" (chapter 6, pg 46). This is a clue because grange lights are lanterns and it shows that electricity was not invented just yet, so it can't be anything after the 1800s. Another clue came from Heathcliff again when he states, \\"or reading sermons, and being catechized by their manservant, and set to learn a column of scripture names if they don't answer properly?\\", (chapter 6, pg 46). Religion was prominent all throughout Europe in this time era, so the setting is appearant in the beginning of the book.Conflict is a major reappearing event that is found throughout this entire novel. The first and the most significant is found in chapter 9, pg 78. \\"It would degrade me to marry Heathcliff now; and he shall never know how I love him...he's more myself than I am.\\" This is the beginning of the love triangle that develops because Catherina loves Heathcliff more than anything else in the world, but they can never be together, (while they're living). The next major conflict in the story arises from Catherine and Heathcliff's offspring. \\"And believe that your kindness has made me love you deeper than if i deserved your love...,\\" (chapter 24, pg 243). Linton's declaration of his love for the young Cathy is shown, which signifies the beginning of their love and the horrible revenge that is exacted on them by Heathcliff. The interesting and tragic conflict that occurs between Heathcliff and Catherine comes when she passes away from insanity and a broken heart. I adore the love between Heathcliff and Catherine, aside from the turmoil and havoc it brings. \\"She has disturbed me-incessantly-remorselessly-till yesternight and yesternight i was tranquil\\", (chapter 29, pg 275). This quote showed me something different. A conflict felt within Heathcliff's heart about loving Catherine and being haunted and agonized by her soul for 18 years while still loving her and withstanding the pain.Wuthering Heights was defnitely a book I'll always hold dear to my heart. Emily Bronte knows how to write an epic book that kept me raptured from beginning to the end."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"A young girl by the name of Emily Bronte delivered the world a story. Although 'love' is contained in all aspects of this book, this is not a love story. Wuthering Neights is the tragic and heartbreaking story of two lovers destroyed, and the outcomes that follow.From beginning to end, this novel was a page-turner for me. I simply did not want to put it down, and at times, I couldn't. We begin our story with Mr. Lockwood, a new tenant in the manor of Thrushcross Grange. Throughout the story, he writes in his diary, documenting the life of the inhabitants of Thrushcross Grange. Though Wuthering Heights is told through the viewpoint of more than one person, everything is documented by Mr. Lockwood himself. The setting is in England, 1801. If you are a fan of the Bronte sister's or tragic British literature, then this is the story for you! We have our resident of Wuthering Heights: grumpy Mr. Heathcliff, the landlord. The state of the manor is unacceptable to our newcomer, but he leaves determined to make a better impression than his first. His sights of the manor are atrocious as he describes it on page 9 as, \\"the walk in was uttered with closed teeth and expressed the sentiment, 'Go the to Deuce', even the gate over which leant manifested no sympathizing movement to the words.\\" As rude as the atmosphere was, he returns for more, to write a story.On our new day, we meet Joseph, our very own illiterate and unhappy servant. Following, we meet the beautiful but pale young man, Catherine Linton and a young man by the name of Hareton Earnshaw. The names confuse Lockwood and he recognizes the tension and mystery within this 'family'. After a strange and frightening encounter that you will read about, he retreats to his home.Meeting up with his servants, we are introduced to Nelly, who has great ties with the residents of Thrushcross Grange. The story unfolds into a mess of tragic love, as we are whisked away to 20 years in the past, as told by Nelly. She was a servant to the Earnshaw family, whom we meet early on. There is Catherine, Hindley, Mr. and Mrs. Earnshaw. One day, after returning from a long trip, Mr. Earnshaw brings back a boy rather than a souvenir. His name is Heathcliff and he is a gipsy boy from the streets of England who comes into their family, and leaves them changed forever. There is tension within this household, but only towards the two young boys who you will read about. Heathcliff and Catherine hit it off early and are the best of friends. However, society would have things different.As I mentioned before, this is not a love story. As we progress, we find this to be more of tragedy, failed love and revenge. So much evil doings and rebellion unfolds as you read on, that it will make your heart burst! Every harsh and cruel decision made through rude intentions causes you to be ripped apart, but it gets better! I cannot even put to words the way that Wuthering Heights will mess with your emotions, but it is definitely worth it! Catherine and Heathcliff find love, but the standards of the world would prove to be stronger than they could handle at such a young age. The bond they would create is soon left to wither away and haunt them forever. The legacy they leave is known by all. I encourage all readers to not underestimate the tragedy of these pages. It is gripping, heart-wrenching and unforgettable. It has personally moved me and I could not ask for more!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I have just finished reading Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte. It's probably safe to say that this was about the millionth time I have read this classic. Forget the Twilight Series and Edgar!

With that in mind, I was curious to reread Wuthering Heights now as a middle-aged mom. The verdict?

The novel, Wuthering Heights by Emile Bronte, is along the lines of most romance/drama novels out there. It has a very familiar story and plot twits that will not keep the reader occupied. When I tried to invision the settings and characters all that I could invision is a grey bloob with generic settings and overly used characters. The same generic plots may suit some people fine but it seems to me that the average reader may want to move onto something alittle bit more innovative and interesting.Now, onto the characters. The three main characters in the beginning of the book are Heathcliff, Catherine, and Edgar. Heathcliff is a poor waif that has been friends with Catherine seince they were little children about the age of 6 and is now madly in love with Catherine. Secondly, Catherine has always loved heathcliff but her greed gets in the way of thier love often. Edgar, who is ALSO in love with Catherine, is a very rich and well educated individual. As the plot continues Catherine marries Edgar for his money, not doing what her heat deisred by marrying Heathcliff, which turns out to be her biggest mistake.Although this book has its \\"up's\\", it also has a large share of \\"down's\\". And the lacklust enviorments dont help one bit. The lack of plausable discription takes its toll on this could be great story. At one point in the book while discribing a trellus of flowers it was depicted as follows: \\"I noticed that there were flowers surrounding the barn.\\". Not to be rude... but... What kind of barn was it? was it old, or new, or red, or green? Flowers? What kind? What color? This very bland discription of what MAY be a older barn that MAY have help horses, and that MAY have had flowers the MAY have been yellow creats no mental image of the area that MAY exist. Wuthering Heights was once descibed as a gloomy building. I mean, excuse me? A gloomy building? Is it 2 stories high, or maby 3? What color is it? Surroundings?Over all the only thing that this book did for me is show me how NOT to write a book. I would not recommend this book for anyone unless you have read EVERY OTHER BOOK in the world. The only reason that this book did not get 1 star is because it is not a total loss of reading. It does have its good points. I would like to talk more about this book but I am pressured for time at the moment. In conclusion I wouldn't reccomend this book and think that it is almost a waste of time. If you are extreemly into classic liturature then go pick this novel up. But besides that then no."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This review is on the \\"other\\" Wuthering Heights Penguin Classics edition (Corot's \\"Gust of Wind\\" on the cover), 1995, reprinted with a new Introduction, Chronology and Further Reading 2000, Reissued with revisions and a new Preface 2003.Forgive me as I have read only 38 pages. But I find it necessary to say now it has been an extremely frustrating experience. The novel is oddly laid out, with tricks of the flashback filling in details that should have been straightforwardly presented at the beginning, such as WHO IS MRS HEATHCLIFF? Honestly, I went back and scanned over the first 38 pages several times and just could not figure out who she was, despite consulting other helps. Was she (is she) Heathcliff's wife, his son's wife, some other wife? Heathcliff says she is my daughter-in-law but then it is stated later his only son died. WHAT? Maybe the \\"Harleton Earnshaw\\" is an adopted son. Some of the characters have the same name or nickname such as CATHERINE versus CATHY. There's another Cathy (Linton) that is different from CATHERINE EARNSHAW but CATHERINE is also called Cathy, which just causes unnecessary confusion and is indicative of slipshod writing.And then there's the ghost story and the dreamscape which is a cheap trick (many movies include the nightmare scene you think is real but the oh so clever movie scriptwriters cause the malignant balloon to pop, the protagonist waking up! and you are tricked once again). At least I am thankful the local Yorkshire \\"Wuthering\\" dialect is not overused, but thankfully there ARE frequent footnotes you'll have to look up to make any sense out of some of the text and dialogue.

One can read this novel over and over, and still not be sure of Emily Bronte's intentions (btw, she had a wonderful, witty style). She seems to have been portraying the detrimental effects of social class rigidity (the mal-treatment of the waif Heathcliff, ideas of what constituted \\"proper behavior\\" for girls/women, among many other things), of violence on children, and of poor parenting.One problem with the book is the all-too-convenient (and nearly perfect) character of Nelly the Narrator.

I swear, some people would write a review that says, &quot;drinking water makes my mouth wet&quot; and then give water one star. The Victorian novel typically isn't your light hearted, Erma Bombeck-ish literature. Yes...it is dark, brooding, mysterious, and long. It is supposed to be that way! I think it is sad that Emily Bronte died at such a young age, leaving only this one novel. In my opinion, the Victorian novel is the pinnacle of great literature and Wuthering Heights is among the best.The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that the language of Joseph was too difficult to understand. It took great patience for me to &quot;translate&quot; those passages. Bronte obviously wanted to describe that character by his speech and it was very effective, but it was too much."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This is a good book and another one I had to read for senior english in high school..It had a good plot and a captivating love story between Cathy and Heathcliff....The action went at a good pace and WH was a page turner for me...good job Bronte!

A delight to the eyes and hands!Let's face it: Clarendon edition wasn't nice-looking, with a price tag of one third of the US Gross National Product. The Franklin Mint Editions (say the 1979 one) is a very fine item, but it has no introduction and the only notes are the well-done glossings of the dialect tirades. Barnes&Noble; hardcover comes near to parfection at a slightly more popular level, but their text is 1900 Haworth Edition, with its uncredible paragraphing and quaint distorted dialect, with some C.K. Shorter idiosyncracies for good measure.SO, LONG LIVE THE PENGUIN CLASSICS HARDCOVER EDITIONS, AND LET'S SEE IF OXFORD FOLLOWS SUIT (I fear not).

The animated, wild mental scenery, the perplex love/hate relationships, and the extended tale of two generations. Its story is so dramatic and wrenching it almost borders a soap opera, but luckily Emily Bronte's writing skills and character dynamics protect it from ever being comparable. IThe plot revolves around a possessive, yet unconsummated relationship between the two main characters, a gypsy boy named Heathcliff and the daughter of a respected family, Catherine Earnshaw, and branches off into the consequences of a love too wild and profound to be controlled. A love triangle ensues involving a wealthy neighbor who wishes for Catherine's love and her hand in marriage as opposed to Heathcliff's instability. Her choice influences all the events to come and lives are ruined in the midst of the storm created by a passion too deep to renounce. With its dark themes and violent characters it is considered by many to be the original Gothic Romance novel.Upon its first publishing, the story was considered too harsh and the characters vile, and was rejected by many readers in the early 19th Century. Emily Bronte, having been born and raised amongst the moors and the people bred of it knew no other way of life at the age of seventeen when she wrote this novel.Ultimately, it is the wild and uncontrollable nature that makes the novel so affecting and believable, capturing your heart and your emotions. It drives you into feeling what the characters experience with it's descriptive writing and you then know what is the essence of the story. The book is a work of art made from minimal environmental resources, with the mind and the soul sculpting it into a true representation of love's ability to conquer hate."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This is an absolute masterpiece, and I feel confident in saying that it is the best book I have ever read. I'm stunned that the average rateing is not five stars. This book is an amazing work. It was written by a woman who never married and yet her description of the vivid passion that exists between the hero and heroine in this book is so passionate and moving that you almost feel as though you can't understand the raw, almost jealous need they have for one another. It reverts to basic animal instinct. She creates characters that you love one momment and hate the next. These are real humans, not representations. They are flawed in every way that they should be and yet they are the ones you sympathize with. They truly are three dimensional, with all the motivations of love, greed, lust, jealousy, and anger that every human being must deal with. If the characters are not enough to convince you of this novel's superiority, all you have to do is look at the actual construction of it. It's like an onion, starting with Mr. Lockewood as the narrator, then Nellie, and eventually even Heathcliff and Cathy speaking to one another in the white hot core, the climax of the story. The two love triangles, emulating each other through generations, the first a tragedy, and the second resolving the fault of the parents with true love succeeding. It is absolutly fascinating how intricatly and beautifully the story is constructed to tell every aspect of the characters. This novel is so moving. It faces every aspect of ourselves as human beings, at the best and the worst of our capabilitys. It may have been written long ago, but it still holds true to problems we face every day. What emotions do we allow to motivate our deeds? That is the real question that this book asks. The images, and the lasting feelings continue long after you have finished the final haunting paragraph. That is why this is the best book I have ever read. If you think I'm simply babbling, all I have to say is read the book yourself. It will be like nothing you have ever read before."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"There is a thin line between love and hate, and once Heathcliff crosses it, we see a grand, passionate and absorbingly interesting man turn into a fearsome thug. Thwarted in his love for his childhood soulmate, Catherine Earnshaw, Heathcliff turns his devastation outward, becoming a hateful -- and hated -- person all across the bleak moors that surround his Yorkshire village.Heathcliff courts and marries the sister of the man whom Catherine chose over Heathcliff, only to torture her emotionally as a way of getting even with her brother. Meanwhile, Catherine slowly wastes away pining for Heathcliff, for although she once rejected him, she eventually realizes that she has made an irredeemable error and can never be happy. Heathcliff sums up the tragedy of their lives in a single question near the end of the novel when he asks, \\"Why did you betray your heart, Cathy?\\"Sound depressing? It's not. Wuthering Heights is a grand and glorious novel that dramatically illustrates the power of love, for good and ill. But more importantly, it teaches us that the only path to happiness is to be true to one's heart, rather than one's head. Had Catherine honored her bond with Heathcliff and refused to bow to the social mores of her day, not only would the two of them been much happier, but all of the many people whose lives they stumbled into would have been much better off.Another reviewer said that those of us who love this novel probably have a strong identification with one of the characters, and for me that is quite true. That's the reason for reading a classic like Wuthering Heights, because when it speaks to you in the clear and true way that Bronte does, you know that you are not alone, and that some things transcend time and place.Think about it -- a prim, Victorian preacher's daughter living on the moors of England before there was electricity can reach across 150 years of time and speak to the heart of a wired American in the 21st century. Pretty amazing, and highly recommended"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Often held up as the standard of the classic gothic novel, Wuthering Heights is, for the most part, a showcase of emotional savagery and a dismal portrayal of the human heart. Not well received when first published under the pseudonym Ellis Bell, Emily Bronte went to her grave believing that her one and only novel was a complete failure. A subsequent edition, edited by sister Charlotte, was released after Emily's death and became a worldwide success.Everyone has heard the name Heathcliff, and that must be due to his being surely one of the vilest, most hateful literary characters to ever exist on a page. An unidentified foundling who is brought to the Earnshaw home as a young boy, Heathcliff is forever painfully aware of his lack of identity and culture and lashes out at everyone with whom he comes into contact. For awhile, his dearest childhood ally, Catherine, is his one sanctuary, but in time he begins to hate her almost as much as he loves her. From that hatred is born several generations of misery and pain, as Heathcliff devotes his entire existence to ruining Catherine, her family, and everything she ever held dear, and no one is immune from Heathcliff's wrath - not even his own children.Most of the story is told as a look-back by aging housekeeper Nelly Dean as she relates the whole sordid tale to Mr. Lockwood, a tenant who comes to Wuthering Heights to rent for a short time and becomes curious about his angry, tormented landlord. The past soon fuses into the present, as Heathcliff's revenge continues to plague both his and Catherine's hapless descendants.As dark and depressing a story as it appears on the surface, Bronte's unfettered examination of the twin emotions of intense love and equally intense hatred is powerful, and stays with the reader long after the last page has been turned. It's nothing if not a poignant and eerie lesson in the damage one person's tortured soul can wreak on everyone around him. I found myself much more affected by it than I thought I would be. Recommended for any fan of classic literature, particularly the gothic era of the 19th century."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Love sometimes encompasses the dark component of obesession and this obsession is beautifully and hauntingly explored in Wuthering Heights, perhaps the most intensely original novel to emerge from 19th century England. This is the story of the passionate love between the wild Heathcliff and the reckless Catherine Earnshaw, both inhabitants of the Yorkshire moors. So passionate, in fact, are Catherine and Heathcliff that their love is doomed to tragedy rather than to fulfillment. When that does, indeed happen, Heathcliff, one of the most original and fascinating characters I have ever encountered, spirals ever downward into a morass of self-destruction and obsession. The symbolism in this novel is rich and complex and not so easily recognizable as one might first suppose. The presentation of the duality of human and non-human existence are deftly explored. Catherine and Heathcliff are violent figures striving in vain to identify themselves as ordinary human beings while disrupting all around them with the voraciousness of their appetites. Both ultimately disintegrate from within due to the passion out of which they are made. These two wildly intense characters stand out all the more sharply when contrasted with the simple ordinariness of Nelly Dean and Lockwood. The novel's central question, of course, concerns the meaning of Heathhcliff, who is both diabolical and yet, at the same time, irresistible. The power of the novel, does not, however, reside solely in the interpretaion of its theme. The setting, the relentless elements of the fire, wind and water of the moors only serves to deeepen and reinforce the intensity of the story. The language, although archaic, is poetic, reflecting Bronte's brooding personal vision. Extraordinary effects have been achieved with a remarkable power of formal organization and a brilliant handling of the time scheme. While encompassing the most domestic of scenes, this novel still achieves the depth of an ancient tragedy. Unforgettably haunting and beautiful in every way."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Having read a number of books in my life, I must say I was not convinced this was one I could enjoy when it popped up on my mandatory reading list for my first year in university.How wrong one can be.Ever since Catherine visited MR Lockwood on that stormy night at the Heights, I have been completely spellbound by this novel. I have tried to rationalize my affection and utter amazment over this book, but I have so far not succeeded. To give a reweiv with any kind of substance when it comes to the theme of this book would be pointless. After having read the book over and over again,and having watched the movies made about it, I still cannot tell you what this novel is really all about. Don\`t get me wrong, the plot is easy enough to follow, but the underlying drama is something that keeps haunting me. Maybe that was what Emily Bronte wanted. For the reader to put down the book and forever be spellbound by what he or she had read. I know I am.Maybe, in our sedated worlds, we long for this kind of emotion, this kind of passion. Not just in our love lives, but in our lives in general. The story touches timeless subjects, it erases the line between heaven, hell and the world we know. It might even suggest that heaven and hell are right here on earth among us all.It is utterly compelling and I would recomend it to anybody. Give it a couple of chapters before you judge it, and I asure you it will be the reading experince of a lifetime.This publishment is even more rewarding because you can read the different analysis of the book in the Critical Edition part of the book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I read what the self-proclaimed &quot;immature&quot; reader wrote, and I beg to differ. I love this book not because I'm supposed to, but because I just do. The austerity of the language, which you term &quot;dull&quot;, is what sets the whole tone for such a troubling work. I doubt that Bronte set out to write a classic romance; I believe she was denouncing the sins of her characters. This novel is multi-faceted with its never-ending parallels: two houses (Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange), two love stories, two heroes, two heroines, two narrators, etc. The inexplicable love that two heartless people like Heathcliff and Catherine share is fascinating to say the least. When Catherine cries out, &quot;Nelly, I AM Heathcliff,&quot; I'm sure many a girl's heart has thudded in her chest. This book sweeps you away to a place and time far removed from us and gives us a view into a harsh and distant world. You don't have to like the book. But don't be so dumb or immature as to assume that no else does either. The longer you study literature, the more you'll see that some books have passed the test of time, because, well, they're just that damn good."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I picked up a copy of Emily Bront's classic after being very much impressed with her sister Charlotte Bront's novel Jane Eyre. However, while I did find much to be meritted in Wuthering Heights, I also feel that it fell short of my hopes. The story initially focuses on the lives of Catherine and Heathcliff, childhood sweethearts forced apart by their families. Catherine marries another man, vainly thinking she can love and be loved by both Heathcliff and her husband Edgar at the same time. As an act of revenge, Heathcliff married Edgar's sister Isabella. What ensues is a dark and stormy emotional battle between many very troubled people.Catherine dies halfway through the novel, starving herself to insanity and death when she realizes that the two men in her life will not share her and instead demand that she make a choice. She leaves behind her a daughter of the same name, young Catherine. Heathcliff and Isabella in turn produce a son, the weak and sickly Linton. The remainder of the novel concerns the love affair that develops between Linton and young Catherine, and Heathcliff's violent, vengeful manipulation of their lives.I thought the book was very well written (as it ought to be, to have achieved a rank among classic literature), and I was able to read it with no trouble. Some of the words and terms are a bit antiquated, but someone familiar with works of the time should not find these too daunting. Though keeping a dictionary close at hand is a surefire way to avoid trouble. Bront has excellent word choice and creates very vivid imagery. My one criticism of the writing itself regards the manner in which Bront has chosen to express dialects. The Yorkshire accent of Heathcliff's servant Joseph (and later of young Catherine's cousin Hareton) is nearly impossible to read, with phrases like \\"ut's soa up uh going\\" intended to mean \\"who is set on going\\". My copy of the book has an appendix that \\"translates\\" the most incomprehensible of his words, but it is a great irritation to constantly flip to the back (sometimes several times per paragraph) for explanation, and even the notes there do not decipher everything.The found the story itself to be profoundly disturbing. Wuthering Heights undoubtedly contains one of the largest collections of mentally unbalanced characters I've ever come across in any novel. It is choc full of sadists, masochists, and otherwise troubled and violent personalities. The whole book has a very dark, opressive feel about it, and there were times I found it downright unsettling. I must tip my figurative hat to Bront for her skill in creating atmosphere and invoking feeling in her readers.However, the storyline is a bit weak in my estimation, as the characters' feelings about and behavior toward each other is often quite illogical. The different culture of the time can explain some of this, but there remains, I believe, a general unrealistic quality about the plot. Why, for instance, would Catherine and Heathcliff have ever fallen in love in the first place? Their childhood attraction is easy to explain as the passing fancies of the very young, but their relationship as adults is more troubling. Heathcliff is moody, egocentric, obsessive, and extremely violent; Catherine is vain and naive, narcissistic, and given to wild emotional tantrums when she does not get her way. What would posses anyone to fall for either of the two? Even harder to understand is the timid Edgar's proposal to Catherine. She abuses him repeatedly, mentally and physically, and yet he claims to love her. Why?The next generation of characters is equally unbalanced and ill-matched. I think young Catherine is probably the only main character with some claim on a sound mind, though even she is not without issues. Though she is intelligent and generally strong-minded, she is for some reason a complete pushover when it comes to the frail, sniveling Linton's outbursts of self-pity. Even when Catherine herself recognizes Linton's problems and appears to have lost her romantic interest in him, she still obeys his every whining command when there is no incentive whatsoever for her to do so. Heathcliff is even more violent in the second part of the novel than the first. He physically abuses nearly all who cross his path, including his own son, taking his only pleasure from the misery of others. Another relationship that raises questions in my mind is Catherine's attraction to young Hareton following Linton's death. Catherine has been brought up as a proper young lady with manners and education, and Hareton is a slovenly, shadowy figure whose speech is as difficult to comprehend as the servant Joseph's. The two young people seem to have absolutely nothing in common.On the whole, I recognize the literary merits of Wuthering Heights - as I said it is very well written and invokes strong reactions in the reader. The character development is excellent, even if those characters are mentally and emotionally unbalanced in the extreme. The book explores the themes of love, jealousy, and obsession, and provokes thought. However, it is by no means a feel-good book and I can't say I'd recommend it for recreational reading. This one is probably best left in the academic discussion circles and not brought home to read before bedtime."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Of all of the audio books of Wuthering Heights, this is my favorite. Janet McTeer brings the characters of Cathy and Heathcliff to life and fully captures the wild passion and pain of the novel. The Patricia Routledge audio play is quite good, as well, but if you are looking for a reading of the complete text of the novel, this is by far the best."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I finally read this classic after many years of intending to. My only exposure to the story was the film starring Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon. About halfway through I'm thinking....was the movie this dark? Why do I not remember Heathcliff being so ruthless? Well, turns out the movie version I saw only covers the first half of the book (as I learned through Wikipedia). I imagine the filmakers found second-half Heathcliff to be so unlikeable that even the dashing Olivier could not redeem him.The book was immensely compelling literature, and frankly I tore through it, but I had a hard time sympathizing with Heathcliff's unsatiable appetite for revenge. The second half of the book is like \\"My Name is Earl\\" in reverse. \\"Hmm, who wronged me and how can I avenge them? Hindley? Check. Edgar? Check.\\" It overshadowed whatever love there was between he and Catherine. Not to mention that Catherine was by all accounts a spoiled, unlikeable brat.So 4 stars because it is a fine piece of literature, but wow....not what I was expecting. Dark, dark, dark. Not that dark is inherently bad (Anna Karenina and House of Mirth end shall we say, darkly, and they are two of the best books on earth), but I think I'll stick with Darcy and Elizabeth for my romantic leads."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"As someone who is long out of high school, I thoroughly enjoyed reading Wuthering Heights (and properly this time!)One literary critic I read somewhere said that the sheer number of characters is deliberately confusing. Certainly, it doesn't make it any easier that there are two Catherines. Nor the frequent use of surnames, rather than first names and vice versa, quite interchangably.Like many reviewers before me I found many of the characters thoroughly odious and of moral outrage. Why Nelly Dean doesn't just leave them all is a mystery to me.One thing I found of great help to my understanding of the book was to paste a clearer copy of the family tree to the inside-front cover of the book. I found this on page 308 of The Scribner Companion to the Bronts by Barbara and Gareth Lloyd Evans. The marriages and births are clearer and far more readable.I also felt the need to take notes from a number of other literary critical works on the book to get my head around the whole plot, the characters, themes, imagery and Haworth landscape.Perhaps for the most serious among us there is a concordance to Wuthering Heights! This is great for those doing a paper on some certain theme found in the book, who want to find all the references to that topic all in one place. If you are wanting to find it: A Concordance to Bront's Wuthering Heights by C. Ruth Sabol and Todd K. Bender, Garland Publishing, Inc. New York/London, 1984, Garland Reference Library of the Humanities Vol. 428.Thoroughly recommended. It only loses a star because I would have enjoyed something slightly less complex, which is really just a reflection on this poor reviewer, rather than Emily Bront."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I had to study this book a few years ago and i think it was the novel that opened my eyes to all classics. The Bronte sisters are among my most well loved authors and Emily's Wuthering Heights top the list. In fact, my book was so often read I had to glue the cover back on when it fell apart.Wuthering Heights is a deep dark novel full of revenge, passion, love and hatred. I have once heard this book called 'dry' by someone who clearly hadn't read it as Wuthering Heights is so far from it. Heathcliff spends his whole life seeking revenge on other characters right from when Mr Earnshaw brings him home from London. However, it cannot be said that he is the only character seeking revenge. In all of the subplots one character is avenging his/herself on another.Lockwood is among the silliest men ever written about, he is right up there with the bumbling Mr Collins of Pride and Prejudice (another favourite). Lockwood is the only character to whom anything of humour happens to, providing the reader with some light comic relief. Having said that, the violence which taints all characters has not passed over Lockwood who tries slitting the wrists of the ghost of Cathy .The numerous allusions to the devil and supernatural were still a controversial subject, especially for a woman, to be writing about at the turn of the century and Emily Bronte was berated by many for writing such a book. However, without the references the book would lose so much of its full force. Heathcliff would not exist except as the evil man he is.Somehow I love the people in this book but I could not tell you why. The only characters who I find myself disliking are Linton and Isabella, however they are the only ones with any sense of goodness surrounding them. I suppose the reason I love the others is for their passion and love for another.This is the greatest of all the great classics and if you find it hard to catch onto do yourself a favour and persevere. I found it difficult the first time I tried to read it and now it's a favourite"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I read this book aloud to my wife 23 years ago. At the time, I was working as an apprentice at a winery on the Rhine River. There was an old medeival castle across the river from our room. It was the perfect setting, as we two were the only English speaking people in the town. I think now is the right time to review the book, because I can only recall the feelings left behind by this powerful work of literature. Most of the plot and many of the characters have been long forgotten, leaving only the residue of strong emotion. I have read many works of powerful fiction by the world's great authors since then. But not one of them affected me emotionally the way this extraordinary tale did. I remember one gray German morning finishing the chapter where Heathcliff digs up the body of his beloved Catherine because he has gone mad in his desire to hold her close once more. And then off to the Altenkirch Schwanenkellerei I went. I spent the rest of the day working quietly in the cellars of the winery, deep inside the mountain with mold hanging all about, and brooding over the maniacal behavior of these highly romantic, insane characters. I've never been able to completely shake the feeling. There is something so entirely timeless about this work, as though it were a piece of ancient literature, old far beyond the 1840s setting, something so utterly classical and piercingly primordial, it's as though you already had the genesis of this material in your DNA and it only required this story to bring it back to life within you. You recognize the spell it weaves because it speaks to the humanity in you so clearly. It is as though you have been secretly drugged. The English language has rarely been utilized as well as it has here, and I dare say you would need to go back to Shakespeare to find its parallel. Romanticism reached its high water mark with this novel. Ms. Bronte has now become immortal because of her creation, and in the Pantheon of world literaure, she stands among the Titans. If you are a native speaker of the English language, you can hardly consider yourself educated if you have not read this astounding novel of romantic love and uncontrollable passion."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I have had Wuthering Heights in my possesion for 2 years and could at first only get past the first few pages.I bought it after reading Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte. As soon as I got into it and got to know the characters of Heathcliff and Catherine I couldnt put it down! I found myself staying up till late at night just to see what would happen next and trying to study for a test but ending up opening it and getting totally absorbed in the plot and characters. I guess it is a curse to love books sometimes, and weird to make bad grades because of them at points. Get the book it is great for men and women! My dad loves it! Heathcliff is a very strong male character that boys will enjoy. And Catherine is a very real woman character and that girls will enjoy because she is far from perfect and has a nasty temper but the men in her life adore her anyway."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Wuthering Heights is a very disturbing \\"what goes around comes around\\" type of story. I personally think that you can have a negative look at the story or a positive look. While reading this book I felt bad for poor Heithcliff, who was treated terribly as a child and fought his whole life to get his revenge. However, at the same time I hated Heithcliff for the pain that he caused everyone while getting his revenge. The setting is a very important part of the story. I think the reader is made aware of the darkness and evil mood of both Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange. As I was reading the story I could easily see what the author intended me to picture in my head. All I could see was darkness simply because everyone is just sad and depressed as though they hated their life and wanted to die, which just laid the way for all the tragedies, heartaches and most importantly, betrayal. They all sat around all day and had nothing to do but engage in silly drama.Even though the plot was clear I would have to say that it was rather hard to keep track of all the characters. If anyone has read this book they know exactly what I am talking about. In physics when they talked about how \\"every action has an equal and opposite reaction\\", they definitely must have had this book on their mind! In the beginning we meet a character named Earnshaw who adopts a child named Heathcliff. Heathcliff unintentionally makes Earnshaw's true son, Hindley, jealous. The trouble starts when Earnshaw seems to have more of a connection with his adopted child than his own. Sadly, after Earnshaw dies Hindley takes his revenge out on Heathcliff. For years Heathcliff has to live under his older brother's thumb, which makes the plot thicken. Heathcliff then devotes his whole life toward seeing that he gets his revenge for the way that he has been treated. Wuthering Heights is indeed a classic. However, this book goes too deep into description about certain things and the wording is a bit hard to understand. After I read the book I needed the cliffs notes so that I could fully understand specific things. This book is full of pure evil, which is why I do not recommend it for any lighthearted reader. It is more for anyone who likes a tale about wicked love and sweet revenge."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"In such situations, it is customary to start out with a &quot;good and the bad&quot; scenario. So here goes.The good: This book has a complex plot that keeps you interested for the most part. The characters are believable (if somewhat twisted), and the setting is appropriate: a creepy old house in the Moors of England. Heathcliff is a maniac with a likeable streak (mostly it's just sympathy). Catherine is unbridled, wild and cruel. But it seems the narrator (Nelly) is a bit too perfect.The bad: The plot can be a little too complex at times, and it's hard to follow. And the first four chapters... don't even get me started.I'm still giving it five stars because, in the end, it was worth the sometimes boring reading and slow pace. This book is definitely a classic that everyone should read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"The story is narrated mostly by Nelly Dean who used to be a servant at Wuthering Heights but now has a job at Thrushcross Grange, another estate. The main character of the novel is a boy named Heathcliff who is an orphan brought to Wuthering Heights by its owner, Mr. Earnshaw. He has two children of his own named Catherine and Hindley. Heathcliff is soon favored over Hindley by Mr. Earnshaw. A bitter rivalry develops between the two boys which is only intensified later by the death of Mr. Earnshaw. Meanwhile Catherine and Heathcliff fall in love and it is this relationship which dominates the book.Catherine and Heathcliff meet the Lintons who own Thrushcross Grange. Catherine is welcomed by the Lintons but Heathcliff is excluded. Heathcliff disappears for three years because of a misunderstanding. During his absence Edgar Linton and Catherine marry. After his return Heathcliff's obsessive love for Catherine and his desire for revenge against Edgar provide all the necessary ingredients for a real tragedy.WUTHERING HEIGHTS can be looked at as a story about love and hate or good and evil. The characters are complicated and interesting. The literary quality of the novel is very high and it is easy to see why Emily is considered by many to be the best writer among the Bronte sisters."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Wuthering Heights is a timeless classic, which will be enjoyed by generations to come. The dark Heathcliff and wild Cathy's characters are reflected by the dark and wild moors on which the book is set.

He brought me this one, and I could not put it down. I cried and wondered and thought about everything in it for days afterward. I still think about it. It was a whole experience, the reading of it, and taking it all in. i can understand why some high school people wouldn't just love it, but i think that has something to do with being &quot;made&quot; to read it. I read it before anyone made me, so reading it again was easier. I seriously think that it is one of the best books ever written..."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I love this book. The \\"Penguin Classic\\" is the best one to get because of the hardback girly cover. The book shipped to me so fast and I have already read it. It is so great I couldn't put it down. Well worth the price, this is a great buy!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This book is not a love story. It is about all consuming passion. Anyone who says otherwise fails to understand the true meaning of the novel. I'm not going to waste time stating the general plot premise. This story is a classic and the relationship between Catherine and Heathcliff is well known.Wuthering Heights is about classicism, torture and religion. Heathcliff is a representation of the devil. The entire story focuses on getting into Heaven or Hell and being smiled upon by providence. The love between Cathy and Heathcliff is the quintessential abusive relationship. The main characters are not likable; they are repulsive and cruel. The estate of Wuthering Heights (and by virtue of its name) is the focal point of the ever changing social dynamics (from Heathcliff and Catherine to their respective children).It sounds like I hated this book but in fact I loved it! It shows the raw and sadistic elements of human beings and the need for kindness and compassion. The writing is exceptionally eloquent, although it takes the reader forty pages to get caught up in the characters. Wuthering Heights is a moving masterpiece. Please read this book. You will not regret it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I accept that it is one of the great books of all time but I find it too dark, too depressing, too bleak... I cannot rejoice in a love that is so destructive that it cares not for what happens to those around it, it merely obsesses about its own gain. Yes, beautifully written and constructed and I've had to read it a couple of times for various studies over the years, but I find life has enough problems so I turn to romance novels for a feeling of warmth and a brief feeling that somewhere love could be beautiful, not something you get from Wuthering Heights. The hopelessness of so many of the characters makes me uneasy and I'm left feeling as though those cold winds from those hills are blowing through me."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Wuthering Heights is a well-structured, inspiring literary classic that is very deserving of its place. I found it to be a little slow to begin, and a bit hard to follow, but it picks up fairly quickly. The story is partly love story and partly tragedy. All the tragedy that occurs in the novel makes the reader feel a little depressed at times, but it is well worth it for the ending. Heathcliff is an unlikeable character initially, but as the story unfolds I can almost be sympathetic towards him. In the beginning Heathcliff appears selfish and greedy without cause, but his behavior is not unjust. True, he is still vengeful and unlikeable, but at least he had a reason. The characters portray the downside of humanity, the not-so-good aspect of ourselves, but also explains the why not just the what. Emily Bront did a wonderful job of pointing out humanity's imperfections while still providing readers with a good story. Given the era she lived during, it seems to me that she was far ahead of her time when she wrote this. The novel holds great power over the reader, and once I started reading it, I didn't want to put it down until I had finished it.I didn't particularly like the fact that almost all the characters were self-destructive, but I was pleased with how Hareton Earnshaw turned out. Of all of the characters, my least favorite was Joseph, who just seemed like a bitter old croak to me. Indeed, Lockwood says this of him, \\"Joseph was an elderly, nay, an old man: very old, perhaps, though hale and sinewy [...] vinegar-faced.\\"To me, a good story has emotion. Wuthering Heights left me feeling appalled at some of the actions the characters did, and saddened at times, and angry at others. The story is filled with vivid details and depth, making it an awesome read. It is a dark novel, but absolutely stunning. If you're looking for a fairy tale ending, you won't find it here, but that doesn't mean this isn't a good book. I highly recommend this, even if you only read it once."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Emily Bronte is one of those authors who has an extreme grip on the English language, and I just loved having this on my Kindle to read at my leisure. This was a great buy for the price, and the fact is that Bronte is always good to read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This book was hard to read. It is just amazing to think that a woman that died at 30 (just 2 years after this book was written) could come up with something like this. It makes you wonder what kind of life she had.I enjoyed the book but it took me several tries and quite a while to get through it.A classic worth reading but not easy."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"this book is my favorite novel of all time, even though I have read virtually thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of novels of all types. I have several printings of this book, and have re-read it no less than 5 times, and I am never disappointed in the novel itself, although sometimes the edition might not be that great. I prefer a book as close to the original (unedited) as I can find, but don't mind extras included (articles, thoughts, essays, poems, etc), as long as the story itself is untampered with. this novel is about love, in all of its many forms, and about the vital importance of truly knowing yourself, and living your life accordingly. Not by other people's standards, nor how others might wish you to be, or even by who you may wish you were (instead of who you really are). If you do not do this, your life will always be a misery for you, and probably for everyone else around you as well. I have never found another novel to take it's place in my heart or my soul. I \\"am\\" this book, and it is me."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I've been reading and re-reading Wuthering Heights for 45 years, and each time I open this novel I find something new. From my first reading at the age of 12, I was and remain intrigued by the format of the novel: told by a rather dim-witted tenant intrigued by his decidedly odd neighbor/landlord named Heathcliff after he hears the tale from his housekeeper of Thrushcross Grange in remote Yorkshire during two lengthy stays. It's a complicated and elegant structure that serves the reader very well. As a 'tween I was captivated by the romance of Wuthering Heights. In my 20s and 30s it was Catherine Earnshaw Linton, who chose respectability over passion, who interested me. In my 40s, I looked again at Heathcliff, who is just about the most diabolical and evil man in literature. And now in my 50s I find myself especially interested in Catherine Linton Heathcliff, Heathcliff's chosen victim for his revenge of the supposed sins committed against him by her parents. She is the daughter of two weak parents: Catherine Earnshaw, whose mind and body broke before she reached the age of 20, and Edgar Linton, who lacked the physical vigor to fight Heathcliff or protect his daughter. Yet though Heathcliff chooses Catherine Linton Heathcliff for his revenge, she is no victim, and it is Heathcliff's inability to destroy her that leads to his ultimate despair and death. To many readers, the story of the second Catherine feels tacked on (and many movie versions leave it out altogether), but in it resides Emily Bronte's message. The second Catherine and second Hareton offer a new start for Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange with a new kind of masters -- not a pampered and privileged pair who've been protected from the harshness of the world, but a couple who've survived the worst treatment that Heathcliff could devise for them and have emerged with their humanity intact."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"All time favorite classic.

But I was finally required to read this for a class so I was left with no choice.I am incredibly grateful I took that class. Once I got through chapter 1, I could not put this book down. Bront has a way of making your emotions go to war over even the most wicked characters. Wuthering Heights is daring, disturbing, and captivating. The psychology in this book is extraordinary and the plot will have you hooked.It is rare for a book to wrap up so flawlessly that you're left 100% satisfied, but Wuthering Heights was that book for me. Even my most cherished stories left me disappointed in some way or another. I couldn't describe the feeling I had when I finished reading Wuthering Heights.

If I could have fiercly stabbed his character to death I believe I wouldn't hesistate in doing so. The person he loved more than any thing and his only reason for living died yet I can feel no pity at all for him.This book was to me horrifing. I gave it 4 stars because I will NEVER forget it. Such a sequence of terrible, cruel events inflicted by one person in a life long pursuit of vengence goes beyond words. The depth of the sorrow of the characters and pain in this book amazes me. I can barely believe that this was publised in 1847, it does not startle me at all to learn that it did not do well at first.As you read this book you feel as if every decent thing is being obliviated and sucked off the face of the earth and you're left only with cruelty, pain and a longing for revenge.This is by no means a light read.

I swear I was so angry at Heathcliff I couldn't even fall asleep. I cannot believe how cruel he was. Actually, everyone was cruel and self-serving in their own way.

It is set ing the moors of old England. Cathy and Heathcliff are two lovers, but when Cathy marries Heathcliff's rival, Edgar Linton, he vows revenge on both of them. The protagonist of the book is without a doubt, the narrator of the story, Nelly Dean. The antagonist is the vial, Heathcliff. She write the characters with such description, it is like they are right in the room with you. The plot is so well writing, it keeps you guessing at every turn.This book is written in the perspective of Nelly (Ellen) Dean. She is the care taker to Cathy through out the book, and one of Heathcliff's close friends. The theme has many interpretation, but I think the most noticeable is of the jealousy Heathcliff feels towards Edgar. It warns you of the dangers of jealousy and that i can drive anyone to the very brink of insanity. This book was one of the most intriguing, well written, passion filled, exciting, living you on the edge of your seat wanting more, creative books I have ever had the pleasure of reading. I would recommend this book to everyone, 5 out of 5"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"When I first read Wuthering Heights, I was completely absorbed into the phantasmic world. While I have read gothic works like Edgar Allan Poe and Mary Shelly's \\"Frankenstein,\\" Wuthering Heights tramples them with it's intense passion of the central characters, Heathcliff and Catherine. Not everyone's going to love this book, most, if not all the characters, are amoral and cruel people isolated from society. Heathcliff is the classic Byronic Hero; brooding, passionate and driven by vengeance, definitley better than today's wannabe gothic characters(cough...Edward Cullen). Other than that it is poetically written, an open field of meadows and lonely households, snowy storms, etc. If gothic stories are your thing, then pick this up, be warned that despite being hyped as the archetypal story of forbidden romance, that is only half the tale which is filled with bitter revenge; buy this."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"haven't read it yet , its in good shape and it came in a timely fasion! thanx."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Depressing, obsessive, tormenting and heartwrenching.

Heathcliff is unforgettable. It's as if part of me is on the moors with Heathcliff and Catherine. There is something so haunting about their childhood romance that never went the way it should have. In fact, I think that this is one of the books that influenced me to write about children. It has a certain Edgar Allen Poe feel to it. It kind of reminds me of Annabelle Lee. The ghostly images of the loss of love by the sea.

Sure it is written in a lovely matter, but there are 15000 people with various English majors who can write beautifully as well. It's hailed as a love story, but at the core of it there isn't any love at all. Just an assortment of angry childish people all who are developed as a still birthed child.Heathcliff and (old) Catherine love each other. But WHY, they love each other is never granted in any regard. They are in love simply for the sake of having a story a write about. That's it. Then the characters themselves aren't just underdeveloped, but they're TERRIBLE people to add on top of that. I am not one of those people who feels the need to love each and every single character, or any of them actually, but this must at least backed up with something to frame the character.Heathcliff is a horrible person simply because, based on what was given of his character in the book, he was abused. Now this aspect of course warrants some sympathy for him. And even though he is vengeful while he is a child, this is completely understandable given how he is treated. However, as a man he does not grow at all. He degenerates to a sadist simply because he didn't get what he wants, why he wants Catherine is anybody's guest.I'll just stop here because I honestly can't go on. The book is far too terrible for me to even go through breaking down each miserable character paragraph by paragraph. To put this book simply; it's basically like an emo's version of a Tyler Perry story. The conflicts exist simply because the characters will it to."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This was a terrible cut up version of the original which had little of the beauty of the real story.

If this is a love story then it is definitely is not my kind of love story. I felt that overall it was a very dark novel about horrible things happening to a variety of people. It was very difficult to get into any of the characters and overall I was fighting to get through it to the end. I love classic novels and Pride & Prejudice is my favorite but this one is not even in the same category...too dark for me."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I read this book on the recommendation that it was the finest English language novel ever written. Well, I can assure you, it is long and boring and I could care less if Katherine and Heathcliffe get together in the end anyway, if they are dead. It's pretentious and long winded and just awful. I must give Miss Bronte credit for writing a long love story that holds its continuity until the end and doesn't take you on ridiculous tangents and sub plots. But the main plot is boring and it hurt me to read it all the way through."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I realize many would contest my opinion in this feverently, and I've argued first hand with many a Wuthering Heights fan, but I have to say with all honesty, this is the worst book I have ever read.The dryness of the plot is second only to the dryness of Emily Bronte's style. For a story attempting to establish themes of love and hatred, passion and apathy, the book is sure dull as hell.I simply can't see any saving quality in this book whatsoever, save the fact that nothing at all happens so you can skim through it without missing a single element of the non-existant plot. The climax of all action within the book is a scene one third of the way in the book where young Heathcliff hurls applesauce at his effeminate and whiny rival, and it just goes even further downhill from there.It is very obvious in her writing that Emily Bronte has never left her home, as her characters are all pallid one-dimensional reflections of her own disgusting parasitic victorian life. Never in a book, even with the most despisable of villans, have I let out such a cheer as a character died, because with the dying of each character in Wuthering Heights there is a feeling of, &quot;FINALLY.&quot; Every character is dying from page 1, in one way or another, and Wuthering Heights is the &quot;journey&quot; of seeing them to their graves, and breathing a sigh of relief, interlaced with mindless whining from one character or another about how the tea and scones are too cold today.If the use of the adjective &quot;Wuthering&quot; is not a warning enough, then read the first five pages. THe only thing I can thank Emily Bronte for is the knowledge that I'll never face pain as great as she has given me in trying to force my way through her book, and I am probably now able to withstand any sort of torture or physical torment by looking back and rememebering, &quot;It could be worse... I could have to listen to Joseph speak again, or Catherine whine.&quot;I realize there's going to be multiple posts debating this, in an &quot;Emperor's New Clothing&quot; sort of fashion of only those who are smart can see the meaning in this book, but the only meaning this book has is what literary critics and English Professors try to stuff it with, no different than the stuffing forcefully injected into a long-dead thanksgiving bird. For a moment, put away your pride, cast down your defensiveness at the view that you're supposed to enjoy this book, and ask yourself: Is there really anything of value in this entire novel? The critical mind will find the answer. The coward will continue to uphold the sanctity of victorian cow-dung. Enjoy your reading :)"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Gah! This book is the most horrible thing I've read! Heathcliff is a horrible character! I didn't know I was ever suppose to root for him. He borders on crazy and even crazier.

I had to basically force myself to read to the end. I have no problem with despicable, morally corrupt characters. The Fountainhead is one of my favorite novels. The problem is that the treatment of them by Bronte just lacks depth. I found the book to be tediously slow, dry, and repetitive.

The story crashes along with melodrama and emotional episodes galore; and when you set all that against the impossibly lonely and picturesque backdrop of the English moors, it's enough to snare any romantic heart. I won't give you the particulars of the plot... it is at its core a love story, but also a great deal more complicated than that. The relationship between Heathcliff and Catherine is all at once pure, spiritual, sexy, intensely stormy and destructive, in a way I've never seen done before in fiction.This is one novel that I feel like I could read over and over, submerge myself in the minds of each of the characters multiple times, and still not plumb the depth of its meaning. The writing is gorgeous, of course, with complexly-constructed but damn near-perfect sentences. This is an emotional, overwhelming, entirely un-sedate book -- a remarkable thing to emerge from Victorian times, from the impenetrable mind of a reclusive female poet. We'll never know what Emily Bronte was truly like, but she was clearly an incredible artist who deserved vastly more recognition than she ever got in her lifetime. The words positively thrum with passion. Truly incredible."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I received the incorrect copy. The image presented is not what I received.

And to be honest, it would not normally have made my reading list. But having read the Twilight novels three times, and Wuthering Heights being featured and quoted so many times, after a while I got curious and thought the only way to better understand the comparisons made by Stephenie Meyer, I just had to read it. At first, the old fashioned language took some getting used to, but once I'd gotten over that, the first third of the book started to really interest me. The characters created by Emily Bronte are certainly very unique, and the depths of their evil surpassed any characters I have come across to date. I was intrigued and started to really enjoy the novel, to the point where I was quite unable to put it down. In the end, I have to admit I was totally disappointed. What promised to be quite an exciting tale of unusual characters and a touch of haunting, left me completely unsatisfied, and questioning why this has become such a classic. I thought it was extremely well written, very interesting characters and well thought out, but in the end it was just someone's life story, that never really \\"got going\\". Given when this was written, I can certainly understand the waves such a novel would have made in the world of literature, but it just does not measure up to the modern day offering. I would say it is a good novel to read to have a better understanding of how this has shaped authors over the years, and perhaps us as readers too.

Heatcliffe is vindictive and cruel and Catherine is a weak and cruel character herself. Not only that, they're both selfish and angry narrowminded. It's difficult to not be moved.And being moved is what this story does to you. If you cannot separate yourself from the Characters, and see the book just as a book, you're going to hate it. You WILL hate the characters and wish they would all just burn in methaphorical hell...But if you do manage to just enjoy the story as a story, which is difficult, then it's a thrilling book with many interesting characters, who submit themselves and each other to odd desputes and whatnot due to their odd character traits. Forgiveness is not really a word in this book and most of the story is about the frustrations from their social places.You might even enjoy the... erm... the social... Oh whatever.

Should not have taken that long."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"The REAL Housewives of Victorian EnglandMr. Lockwood comes to Wuthering Heights in order to rent Thrushcross Grange. He gets stuck there, with Mr. Heathcliff, a rude gentleman, a young woman, and several other strange people. While there, he stumbles upon the diaries of Catherine Earnshaw. After a strange dream, he runs back to town, where Ellen Dean \\"Nelly\\" tells him the story of Wuthering Heights.I'm sure most of you are familiar with a TV phenomenon called \\"reality TV shows\\", particularly ones like \\"Jersey Shore\\" and \\"The Real Housewives of OC/Atlanta/wherever\\". I think it would be a compliment to say these shows cater to the lowest common denominator. They are primarily packed with drunken escapades, unbridled fights, and lots and lots of sex. And you know what? People like these things because of the sheer stupidity. Hell, I'll admit to watching a few episodes of Jersey Shore, and not just because it was the only thing on my hotel TV (although the latter is true too).I've heard copious things about \\"Wuthering Heights\\": it is a classic, it is a love story, it is wonderful literature, it has great imagery/themes. They may be true, but for me, \\"Wuthering Heights\\" is a freakin' riot book--the Victorian equivalent of the reality TV shows we enjoy today.The characters are vicious, back-biting dogs, continuously making life miserable for each other just for the hell of it. Catherine marries a man she sorta loves just for the title; Heathcliff has an insatiable thirst for revenge; Hindley is weak; Hareton is an evil child; Cathy a ditz; Linton a wuss; Edgar powerless; and Nelly a meddle-some gossip. Probably about the only character not painted in such a poor limelight is our narrator, Mr. Lockwood, who is boring beyond belief. Lock these characters up in a room, and expect them to rail and complain and slap the hell out of each other within moments. They are all sadists and masochists, and I'm not just talking about the obvious Heathcliff. They would make PERFECT fodder for a low-brow reality TV series--I can just see Isabella (post-marriage) b!tch-slapping Heathcliff, Heathcliff and Edgar tearing off each other's shirts and brawling on the living room floor, and Linton and Cathy slipping off to nail each other in one of their rooms.For those that say this is a great love story: Huh? I mean, I get that Heathcliff and Catherine \\"love\\" each other, but it almost feels like more \\"obsessively lusting\\". As for Isbella loving Heathcliff, he doesn't turn around, love her and marry her; instead, she lives in abuse until she finally grows a pair and runs off. Linton and Cathy are constantly being thwarted in their relationship, and it is Heathcliff who forces them to marry. And on...and on... It's more of a \\"How NOT to Love\\" story than a pure romantic love story, like \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". NOTE: If you love A so much, marry A. Do NOT marry B and then excuse it by saying you \\"love\\" A so much that you want to *fill*in*the*blank* for A.Also, I found myself wondering several times: how much of this story is Nelly warping? Is she purposefully making these people look bad (even her own mistress, Catherine, she insults regularly)? What parts did she not hear? How would things have been different had she kept her big nose out of the drama?All the complaints I've read are 100% true. The characters are vile and overdramatic; their actions are drastically mean and seem bent for the sole purpose of causing more drama; the framing device threatens to fall apart (particularly when Cathy is narrating through Nelly who is narrating through Mr. Lockwood--can't tell you how many times I forgot who the \\"I\\" was).All the compliments I've read are also 100% true. The writing is very well-done, the story is interesting, the characters are different and not stereotypical, the outcome isn't predictable, and the imagery is vivid and dark.In short: No wonder this was such a controversial book when it first came out!I think this book is definitely more interesting in audiobook format, because the author can differentiate voices, give inflections, and bring to life the arguments and vicious remarks that fly back and forth. Maybe I'm a sadist or masochist like the cast, but I rather enjoyed being a fly on the wall, listening to Nelly's gossip about these sad people and their self-induced miserable lives. It's not a book for everyone, but it's definitely one of a kind.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This is a great classic read. It is a dark book with a good ending. If you look at the background of each character, you'll understand how they have come to act the way they do in the book. Maybe to the extreme in their actions and hatred, but you can see cause and effect to the situations that occur. Also, if you read about Bronte, you can see why the book is so dark. She had not such a happy life. I wish Bronte would have written more books.

She does this gladly, and so we get the tragic story of Heathcliff and Catherine.I often find the classics to be tedious and boring. Wuthering Heights is neither and I found that to be a nice surprise. From the beginning, the book oozes drama and it stays that way until the very end. For some reason, I've been under the impression that this is a love story. I guess in a dark, twisted way it is, but it focuses more on cruelty and revenge. None of the characters are very likeable. As a matter of fact, a majority of them are quite appalling. Instead of this making me dislike the book, I think it made me like it more. Strange, I know, but it did. Wuthering Heights kept me captivated and has earned it's spot as one of my favorite classics."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I'm a man in his fifties and managed to avoid reading \\"Wuthering Heights\\" for all these years. I don't like romance or gothic novels and I had seen the 1939 film version with Lawrence Olivier and thought it ridiculous. I only read the book now because it was an assignment for my adult school novel-reading course.The story needs little summarization as it so well known but suffice it say that the principal draw of the book is the romance between Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff, a story that is over at the time the novel begins but nevertheless haunts the entire book. To call Catherine a heroine and Heathcliff a hero is stretching those definitions more than should be allowed. Catherine a tempestuous narcissist who dies for spite and because of childbirth. Heathcliff is worse, torturing his wife because she isn't Catherine and children because they remind him of her. Yes they aren't quite villains as they have tremendous courage, honesty and energy which make them powerful figures despite their many flaws.In our class discussion, people took Heathcliff's evil nature for granted. To me, it wasn't that clear. He was cruel and vengeful. Heatlhcliff was stubborn and difficult but is that evil? If evil is to have no regard for human life then clearly Heathcliff doesn't fall that low, he does appear to value human life. This debate over human evil is one of the fundamental values of Wuthering Heights as literature. The book creates wildly extreme qualities that inhabit the same person. This allows us a prism to view into the psyche and get clear for ourselves how we evaluate good and evil."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This is a wonderful classic -- so much going on in the novel on every page that it is a pleasure to read and experience."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Though the performances are very good, I am very frustrated with this purchase, as Amazon describes this set as unabridged. It is, in fact, substantially abridged, so buyer beware."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"When Wuthering Heights first came out, readers were shocked by the violence and the passion of its story, that is the strange romance between the mysterious Heathcliff and Catherine Earnchaw, the daughter of Mr. Earnshaw who adopted Heathcliff. The scandal was so much that Emily Bronte, when she died, thought that her book was a failure. Fortunately for her, and for its first readers, the story's reputation grew among literary circles, became an important reading for people like Virginia Wolf, and even became a movie in 1939, starring the great Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon. As such, the book's reputation has now become an important piece of art around the world, influencing important artists in their works (ex:Jane Campion's The Piano, J K Rowling's Harry Potter, etc.)Most people tend to focus solely on the romance between Heathcliff and Catherine and they tend to think that the story is simply a love story, which is what they did with the Laurence Olivier movie. However, Wuthering Heights must be considered, at least that's what I think, as a tragedy which shows how a simple act of kindness from a good man brought forth discord, jealousy and a story of revenge whose victims, the Earnshaw and the Linton families, soon suffer the wrath of someone who never received the most decent sense of love. Not only that, Wuthering Heights shows how certain families, in distant regions positioned far from big cities, act between themselves as they bring upon each other their own laws. Having had grandparents who lived in regions resembling as much as the moors surrounding Wuthering Heights, I wasn't that much surprised by the cruelty that some of the Earnshaw and the Linton brought forth on Heathcliff.So for me, that book, was a pleasure to read again and again.One thing that surprised me with this book is how Emily Bronte managed to transcript the dialects of the countrymen of that region. Indeed, certain character's dialects are written according to how the characters pronounce them. Though reading it straight on for the first time, might be difficult, I suggest to those that may be rebuked by this type of dialogue transcription to read the dialogs aloud. To me it felt much more easier to understand certain conversations and have more pleasure reading that book.As such, I recommend this book to everyone who would be interested to read a great piece of literature or to discover the original material that brought forth the movie adaptations that they love to watch and rewatch."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I must admit that I went into this book completely unprepared for what hit me.

He and Catherine, the daughter of the Earnshaw patriarch, form an immediate, permanent bond, one that will bring years of sadness into their lives when Catherine decides that she cannot abandon her station for Heathcliff, instead choosing to marry Edgar Linton, a privileged child from the neighboring Thrushcross Grange.The interesting thing is that this basic love story, for which the novel is best-known, is only the first half of the book. The second half follows the ramifications for all of the characters, as Heathcliff's cruelty reaches a fever pitch and he destroys everything with any connection to Catherine. This part, for me, was the real meat of the story. It's incredibly dark and occasionally terrifying, written in excruciating detail... but also full of a savage beauty. Heathcliff's chasing after a ghost will simultaneously make you cringe and break your heart, and that is the ultimate measure of success; Bronte created a character that manages to be sympathetic, even when you wish for nothing more but his death.It is not without flaws (I found Catherine and Heathcliff's relationship underdeveloped) but the sheer force of the story is almost dizzying, heightened by the interesting (if occasionally limiting) structure, and I would easily recommend Wuthering Heights."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"As with most people interested in classic literature, I had known of \\"Wuthering Heights\\" for years and years, but for some reason, I had never made the effort to read it. That situation has been corrected; What can I possibly add to the critical reviews of this great work of literature? This is an amazing novel, with characters that manage to live and breathe. Not many writers can paint characters with this same level of depth. Some you will love, and others you will love to hate. While the book is not what I would label \\"an easy read,\\" it is quite readable considering when it was written. Give it a try and you will not be disappointed. I would have loved to have read this book with a club, so that I may have had an opportunity to discuss the many themes it involves."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"WOW! I had a hard time at first adjusting to the difference in 1800 language and todays, but man I am sure glad I stuck with it. What a wonderful book. No surprise that it is in the \\"classics\\" catagory. Beautifully written love, hate, passion, and lonely darkness novel. Think I will be reading it again."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I don't know what really needs to be said about Emily Bronte's 1847 novel, the brilliantly plotted, superbly structured, & extremely engrossing WUTHERING HEIGHTS, 'cept maybe, \\"if you haven't read it, you really ought to becuz you're in for an amazing treat\\". Quite frankly, I'm jealous of the \\"uninitiated\\" who are about to embark on such a fantastic \\"journey\\", given the great road that lies ahead.For the sake of prospective first time readers who need a bit more info to tempt them into taking the plunge, I'll just say that THIS is the book that made famous the idea of rambling about on a moor with someone whom you fancied. Need more? Well, the protagonist is named Heathcliff (you've probably heard that named tossed about somewhere) and it is he who dominates both halves of this two generational story. Still not enuf? Okay; while it has been viewed by many as a great love story, WH is actually - in the words of Bronte biographer Lucasta Miller - \\"more Romantic (as in the literary style) than romantic\\". Furthermore, while new readers may have already experienced - perhaps, in reading other novels and certainly in watching tv shows and movies - the particular \\"twist\\" on the traditional method of narration that Bronte employs, it must be noted that SHE was the FIRST great writer to use it and, all these decades later, WUTHERING is still unsurpassed in its use. That's about all I dare say so as not to spoil it for new readers.In any event, the primary reason that I am writing this review is to note on the wonderful - albeit relatively short - introduction that is included in this Penguin Classics edition, one that was written by Monash University (in Melbourne) prof Pauline Nestor. If you're like me and enjoy reading intros and other critical pieces about this impressionistic romance AND don't like \\"spoilers\\", I will, as in the case of the novel, keep my comments about the content (of the intro) to a minimum. Indeed, it will be enuf to say that those WUTHERING fans who are tired of seeing Marxist, feminist, revisionist, or any other \\"ist\\"-type reading on this novel will be delighted by Nestor's take on this masterpiece, one that largely focuses on its \\"transgressive power\\". She also briefly critiques many of the various \\"popular\\" interpretations of WH that have been embraced over the years.So, while first time readers will delight in this novel's power - in regard to both its craftsmanship and its ability to rouse the emotions - those who have already read it will enjoy the intro's study as to WHY it has such power, including the power to maintain such a hold over those who have experienced it.Also, like other Penguin Classics editions, this one is annotated, which is particularly helpful in the case of WUTHERING HEIGHTS becuz, as newcomers will quickly discover, the Yorkshire dialect of a certain character is - to put it mildly - difficult for most modern readers to understand.Enjoy"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"The first time I read this book, I was 11.

Going into it, of course I knew of its reputation. But I also knew of its size. And at the same time, one can't help but think how a Victorian Era woman could cross time and gender conflict to get in touch with a 17 year old guy.Boy, was I wrong.Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte is a book to get lost in. The multi-layered, time jumping story absorbs the reader quickly and effortlessly, and doesn't let go until long after one's stay in the English countryside. A lot of the characters in this book are bad people, but none of them are bad characters. From powerful, crystal clear motives to mystery and revenge, Wuthering Heights has it all. And it's not going anywhere, so you might as well hop on the bandwagon and read it.For those of you not in the know, Wuthering Heights is centered around a man named Heathcliff, who rents a house to a certain Mr. Lockwood early on in the book. Lockwood, our narrator, is shocked by some of the conditions Heathcliff is living in, and then asks his maid, Nelly, about it. Lockwood transcribes Nelly's words, creating two narrators.At one point in the novel, Lockwood is writing down Nelly's words about Isabella reading Heathcliff's letter. That's four narrator's at once. Oh. My. Gosh. But don't you worry. Emily Bronte is no lightweight, and she can manage each and every character and story thread. I've touched upon this once and will continue with it for a while: there's a reason this book is a classic and so widely read.On top of the plot, which is all consuming and entertaining (It's almost likeHarry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Book 1),A Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 1), or some other fantasy novel the way it creates its own world), there is this fierce underlying theme of love. But what's so great about this books theme is that its not a thesis statement. This book is a discussion of love, what it can do to man, what it creates, what it destroys. You'll find more academic truth in this novel about man's condition than you ever will in ay bare bones medical text book.The strongest point in this book is the characters. Isabella, Linton, Heathcliff, Catherine ( A woman after my own heart), and many, many more stick with you for a long time. Nelly, especially, who isn't just a lame narrator. She truly brings some stuff to the table, and I've known a lot of people like her, so I have a soft spot for her in my heart.It's hard to write a review of this novel because it's literally just so good. And that sounds cheesy, because its a classic and if you're here, you know its supposed to be good. But I cannot stress enough how this one not only lives up to, but it exceeds expectations for how good its supposed ot be. Don't pass this up."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I've read this several times. It is a good read, but it's more of a story about how NOT to treat people. It at least makes you appreciate your own life after reading it, but it is very depressing.

The characters took me by surprise and despite their rotten personalities I couldn't help but love them and wish their sorrow to end."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"When Wuthering Heights was originally published in 1847, it was not well received. The depictions of passionate love affairs on the moors, cruelty and hatred were considered to vulgar and too shocking for audiences of the day. Wuthering Heights is now considered a classic of English literature and one of the best novels by a woman writer of the nineteenth century.There is something outright haunting about the characters of Wuthering Heights. They complement the eerie moor setting entirely. None of the characters is likable really, but there is something about them that hypnotizes the reader. Heathcliff's passionate love, rage, hatred and unbelievable cruelty, Catherine's puerile and fickle nature just to name a few.Wuthering Heights is not a happy love story by any stretch of the imagination. It is dark, yet passionate. It explores both sides of human nature. The characters can love passionately, then hate completely and cruelly.It is a bit difficult to get into. The opening chapters are very dark and Bront takes a while to set up the characters, especially with the frame story involving Mr. Lockwood, but if the reader sticks with it, the characters are great, the plot is twisted and the raw emotional language Bront uses are worth waiting for.See more of my reviews @ [...]Bottom Line: Wuthering Heights is a must read for English literature lovers and dark romance lovers alike.

Is a great story if you like stories with depth."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"'A masterpiece' probably sounds like a clich&eacute; for this novel, but that is exactly what it is. From the start, one is captivated by the story; at times shocking, disturbing, but above all, amazing. After I finished reading it, I came to realize that it was a tragedy that Emily Bront died at such a young age, leaving behind her poems and this one, magnificent novel. Yet, even if she had lived long enough to write other books, this one would still have outstripped them all.The language used in the novel is lyrical and beautiful. Once you start reading it, you can understand why 'Wuthering Heights' is often regarded as the most successful poetic novel ever written. Emily was, after all, a poet, and I can't imagine how difficult it must be to write poetic prose and manage to do it right, yet this is what she has done. Her settings and characters are well described, and the plot is masterfully executed.As to the characters themselves, they are remarkably believable. We can identify with them in their struggles, their hopes and fears, and we feel the same emotions that they feel. Heathcliff is an outstanding literary figure, whilst Catherine, despite her faults, is and remains a classical heroine.Although there are many film and television adaptations of 'Wuthering Heights' (and a new one will soon be coming out), I am proud to say that I haven't seen any, and that I never will. The last thing I would like to do is spoil one of my favourite books with some trashy, messed-up Hollywood movie or television serial. I have a unique image of how I see the story and characters, and that's how it's going to stay.Simply put, everyone should give this book a try, even if they don't like classic novels. It has a thrilling plot, remarkable characters and beautiful language. Condemed when it was first published in 1847, 'Wuthering Heights' stands out today as one of the greatest novels in the English language.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I read this (like many of the other classics that I got) because I had never read it before.

But after you get used to the way they speak the book is INCREDIBLE! My absolute most favorite book ever! I love this book!

Pride and Prejudice was my favorite book; I've read it so many times that I can quote Elizabeth Bennet in my sleep. I know every single word of the movie Emma by heart. So, naturally, I felt compelled to read it. I love the flowery language, how Emma and Mr. Knightly converse so eloquently. However, still being a student, I am subjected to the whims of my teachers. When Mr. Sneeringer told us to have Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights read in a week, I groaned. How it pained me to set aside my precious Emma! I was especially greived because I recognized the author's name. About a year and a half ago, another honors English teacher commanded us to read Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre. That book is definetly not reader-friendly. The vernacular of the Victorian era that completes the whole effect of reading a Jane Austen novel worked completely against Charlotte Bronte. It made reading a difficult novel all the more tedious. I feared that I was in for another dose of the awful stuff when I received Wuthering Heights. I want to say that I was pleasantly surprised, but that doesn't even come close to my feelings. The mystery was too much for me; I couldn't put it down. Wherever I went, Wuthering Heights came with me. I took it to class, to my meals and to bed. I literally fell asleep reading the two nights my book lasted. I found it to be extremely powerful and compelling. I aspire to become a great writer someday, so I have studied many things necessary to a great novel, including plot and character development. Emily Bronte is a master at these. Her characters are so complex, and, yet, I can still identify with them. They are so well developed that it makes an intriguing story impossibly compelling. She is truly a master of the Gothic novel. I am still in awe of the graphic description of all the dark forces surrounding the Heights. I became part of the whole story when I read this book. Yes, I still love Jane Austen, but now I readily admit that there is definetly room for Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"And it must be a fine something indeed, for it kept me, a fairly discerning reader, going all the way through despite the dated language, occasional impenetrable dialect, and characters who as grown adults behaved precisely the way I remember behaving when I was about 16.Part of the 'something', I think, is the surprisingly modern psychological insight underlying the book. Today we all know the people who cry 'I'm in love' while inflicting only pain on the loved one, or who destroy children and families because of some perceived wrong. But at the time this book was written, it was not common to focus a novel on a pair of lovers with the understanding that those lovers were, in fact, jerks. The way Bronte alternately panders to 'romance' conventions with craggy Heathcliff and wayward Catherine and then spits in the face of those conventions by showing the effeminate, willowy Edgar to be the closest thing to a decent adult character in the book is refreshing for those of us who are tired of the dominance of the alpha male.In passing, I must also mention that between the stormy moors, the borderline necrophilia, and the grandiose tooth-gnashing spurned-lover angst, this is a very goth book, which never hurts from my point of view.The other part of the equation is that (despite the protestations of certain reviewers) Bronte keeps the suspense high throughout the book. Between worrying about the fate of young Cathy, waiting for the ghost to make another appearance, and eagerly anticipating the moment when Heathcliff gets his, there's hardly a slack moment.I must say that the ending was not, in my opinion, as strong as it could have been, but I'll speak of it no more so as not to spoil it. Hence, only four stars."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Although I read Wuthering Heights years ago, I enjoyed rereading it. When I was younger I thought Heathcliff was just plain mean. Now that I am older, I understand loss, and frustration a little better and the book took on new meaning for me.

I recommend this book as a gift and I recommend you read it!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"The only novel of Emily Bronte, published a year before her tragically early death, was met with considerable critical scorn upon its publication in 1847, but became successful in the following years, and it remains a masterpiece of literature to this day. The novel's central characters, Cathy and Heathcliff, are the ones that stick foremost in readers' minds, but the book spans two generations, opening with an embittered Heathcliff having wrecked havoc on the offspring of himself and his wife,the now deceased Linton, Cathy's daughter, and her brother Hindley's son, Hareton. The first narrator, Lockwood, arrives at the Heights, witnessing the strange, dark dynamics of his master's home. He falls asleep reading the papers of the late Catherine Earnshaw, and then encounters her childlike wraith, frightening him, and he overhears Heathcliff crying out for her. Lockwood makes the aquaintence of Nelly Dean, the Earnshaw's original housekeeper, and implores her to fill in the blanks of the bizarre oasis that he has found himself in. It then flashes back to what set it all in motion. Heathcliff is a gypsy boy found abandoned on the streets of Liverpool and is taken in by the Earnshaw family. The daughter Cathy is immediately taken with the mysterious lad, while her brother Hindley openly resents him. Cathy and Heathcliff are inseparable, roaming the moors, seeking adventure in everyday occurances, living their isolated lives in relative tranquility. Their bond, while not incestuous techincally because they are not blood relations, is disapproved of :\\"She was much too fond of Heathcliff. The greatest punishment we could invent for her was to keep her separate from him, yet, she got chided more than any of us on his account.\\"When the elder Mr. Earnshaw (who favored Heathcliff) dies, Hindley takes full advantage of this and relagates this \\"filthy, swearing boy\\" into a servant and goes out of his way to make Heathcliff's life hell. Cathy meets the weathly Edgar quite by chance after she and Heathcliff stray onto the Linton property: she is attacked by the family dog and they take her in until she heals; she contracts a fever which kills Edgar's parents. When she returns to the Heights, she has been transformed into a lady, upsetting the volatile soulmate that she so dearly loves but does not feel that she can marry. The rejected young man disappears from his beloved's life for some years, returning a very (inexplicabily) wealthy man, returning to wreck havoc on all who have wronged him. Cathy has married Edgar; Hindley has become a gambling drunk. He torments his former love with his courtship and marriage to Edgar's sister Isabella, his dark motives that ultimately drive everyone to misery, Cathy to an obsession that will cost her dearly. Their tender reunion at her deathbed (she is weak, soon to give birth to her namesake daughter), heartbreaklingly expresses their longing for one another and the negative choices they have made. \\"Catherine Earnshaw, may you not rest, as long as I am living! You said I killed you - haunt me then! The murdered do haunt their murderers, I believe - I know that ghosts have wandered on earth. Be with me always - take any form - drive me mad! Only do not leave me in this abyss, where I cannot find you! Oh God! It is unttuerable! I cannot live without my life! I cannot live without my soul!\\" After her death, Heathcliff becomes even more embittered, despising his effeminate son, Linton, nuturing Hindley's son Hareton in hatred with cruelty and abuse - both young men court young Catherine's affections. Despite his efforts, Heathcliff is unable to put a stop to Hareton's obvious love for young Catherine after the death of Linton, and so there is hope for the next generation when Catherine realizes that her heart lies with Hareton. The significance of that is unmistakable, even to Heathcliff, who sees in the budding relationship before him the parallels of what he once had with Cathy. Heathcliff remains obsessed with his lost love, hearing her voice calling to him, seeing her apparition out on the moors - the taboo subject of necrophilia is hinted when he digs her up the day after her funeral, and some years later longs to crawl in the coffin with her. When he finally meets his maker, and his ghost joins Cathy's, he has left a very unpleasant memory in the ones who remain; he endeared no one to him with his selfish, cruel and dissolute ways.Heathcliff is appropriately named; although it is acknowledged in the novel that he is named after an Earnshaw son who died, it serves as both a first and last name - his lack of a personal history, mysterious reserve - he is wild, just like the moors and the heath that grows there; he is unpredictable and volatile, like the wind that rips through the countryside, he drives others often to desperation - both Cathy and Isabella are extreme examples of this - leaving them devastated and inclined to self-destruction, as a cliff overlooking the sea can symbolize. He is almost unknowable in a way, making him almost a blank slate that others can project their own views and desires on. Cathy is self-absorbed in the way of an infant, and her love for him is both mature and childlike - the bond the formed from those early days is in her mind, always:\\"My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath . . . . I am Heathcliff - he's always , always in my mind - not as a pleasure, any more than I am always a pleasure to myself - but as my own being.\\"The shifting of narrators can be mildly confusing at times, but the story is powerful and probes into the depths of human psychology, very daring for a novel of its time. Emily Bronte's poetry is also in a class by itself - some of her poems, which she wrote while composing the stories of her imaginary world of Gondal, seem to foreshadow the theme of Wuthering Heights. I recommend strongly the poems, \\"Remembrance\\" and \\"The Prisoner\\" in particular.A classic on every level, as long as you can handle dark human depths and romantic tragedy."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Every month my teacher makes us write a book report. I had a 300 and something page book that I was going to read but of course I put it off because I HATE READING!

Once I started reading, I read a quarter of the book and the only reason I put it down was because by the time I looked up it was two in the morning! I think everyone needs to read this book.

Emily was the most sheltered and out of her came Wuthering Heights which is an intense story of love, hate, and passion. The book criticizes society at the time and really holds nothing back. There is no real happy ending here but the book does take you along an interesting path that deals with race, class, and religious issues."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"As you begin to read this novel you will almost certainly feel a sense of confusion. I have heard many people complain that the first four chapters are among the most confusing and boring chapters they have ever read. Do not, I repeat, do not stop reading this book in the first four chapters. Although the story does not make sense at first and especially because the names of the characters sometimes appear more than once, continue to read the book because it is worth it in the end.The story focuses around Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff. The main theme of the story focuses around the mysterious powers of love and hatred and how this played into the lives of two families, the Earnshaws and the Lintons. The reason why this novel has been considered such a masterpiece is that it encompasses every human emotion from love to hate, forgiveness to revenge and everything else in the realm of human understanding. As one reads the novel it becomes apparent that Emily Bronte is very skilled in her ability to weave everything into this tight-knit story with countless parallels and subtle symbolism. There is incredible symbolism within this book that I would encourage readers to try to pick out. On the surface the book is a treasure in itself, containing the most memorable love story in all of literature as well as managing to encompass so many universal themes, but understanding the symbolism gives this novel so much more depth. Understanding the symbols is the only way to truly appreciate the genius of Wuthering Heights and Emily Bronte herself. If you do decide to read this book, it becomes too irresistable not to read again, and absolutely impossible to forget."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Wuthering Heights is a disturbingly dark book about love, obsession and revenge. It is a romantic novel full of twists and turns that nearly requires the reader to keep a running dictionary of characters, especially since names have a tendency to pop up in different places and on different people throughout the novel. I read this novel for a class assignment in Victorian Literature but it is helpful to know that the book employs many themes of the Romantic literary genre as well. Victorian ideas of social class are brought up as well as the fantasies of adolescence. Some of the Romantic ideas found in the novels include the idea of the tragic landscape. The landscape of the novel is foreboding and isolated, borrowed most likely from the gothic novel. The characters are extreme in their varying passions and the concept of the dream is used in a type of ghostly communication. One of the story's narrators has a dream of being visited by the ghost of Catherine, which causes a startling and dramatic reaction in Heathcliff. The belief that the reader cannot fully hate Heathcliff because of how he was mistreated as a child is also a Romantic ideal.The story contains a great deal of darkness and some cruelty, which may turn readers away. Love is often extreme to the point of violence in the novel while the romances themselves are nearly incestuous in tone. Cousins marry and adopted siblings hold lifelong affections and obsessions for each other. The novel also illustrates an element of cruelty that can be slightly disturbing at times. Heathcliff, the novel's antagonist, goes as far as to string up the beloved dog of the young woman he courts after Catherine rejects him.The main focus of the story is the rather twisted love story element that develops between Catherine and Heathcliff. Heathcliff is adopted into Catherine's family at a young age and the pair become close, though Catherine rejects him because he is poor and instead marries a rich neighbor. Though throughout the novel, other romances develop between the two highly inbred families, they are side stories in comparison to the main romance.The love of Catherine and Heathcliff eventually develops into an obsession that lasts, and in fact becomes even stronger with the eventual death of Catherine. Her spirit seems to haunt Heathcliff and further fire his obsession. Even before Catherine's death this obsessive love broadens to include an equally obsessive drive to ruin the lives of all the people who mistreated him and stood between him and Catherine, including her husband and older brother.These obsessions eventually lead to the last of the major themes of the novel, revenge. A good part of the book is spent upon Heathcliff's attempts to destroy the lives of anyone and everyone who mistreated him or got in the way of his relationship with Catherine. His need for revenge does not lessen as the book moves on and Heathcliff continues to take his revenge even upon the next generation, including Catherine's daughter and his own son. Whether or not Heathcliff succeeds in his attempts I leave to the reader.Personally, I enjoyed this book a great deal, if for no other reason than the simple fact that it was quite different from the usual school assigned reading. I was pleasantly surprised by how well woven and engaging the book was. The calculating lengths that Heathcliff goes to in order fulfill his quest for revenge are nearly reason enough to read the book. The old style language of the book, which I expected to be a hindrance, was hardly noticeable. In short, if you can handle (or enjoy) the book's darker aspects, then I highly recommend this classic to you. (And I'm not just saying that because I have to! ;))Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"WARNING: reading this review will spoil some of the plot of WH.I grinned when Sis, back in high school, told me I reminded her of Heathcliff. I remembered from the (old, old) movie that he was some evil fellow. Then I read the book. And stopped grinning. I'm amazed this book would ever be assigned to high school 'kids.' It's humorless and ultra-realistic. Every page reeks of evil and has selfishly evil (meaning normal) characters. Heathcliff was a tortured being but hardly innocent. Cathy was a solipsistic, driven fool. Even the Cliff Notes booklet for WH is surprisingly short (I read The Notes after burning through the book in a week) as if Cliff's was horrified to study this book! Cliff's good observation about Heathcliff is that his sole emotion is actually pity/affection for Hareton and that his 'love' for Cathy is, in fact, an animal possessive jealous rage. I changed after reading this book. For the better, I don't know. There is a point in the book where Heathcliff's every action evokes disgust and hatred, and then...as a man...I began to feel what he felt. For whatver his faults, I began to connect fully with his insane rage, and that his ideal of 'love' for Catherine--however warped--had been stolen from him forever. I understood his ruthlessness and love for no person or thing after Catherine's death. By the way, not to parrot the critics, but it is true that the marriage of Cathy and Hareton is NOT some kind of full circle, happier ending. It's more like holding hands in Hell. I left this book sadder than when I started it. After reading it, I doubt anyone anywhere is getting 'wiser.'"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This classic has a reputation as being a grand \\"love\\" story. It is more about dark obession than \\"love\\". The characters are all psychologically damaged people (nuts) who seem to thrive on making each other miserable. I cannot figure out what Catherine had that made two men fall madly in love with her--she is spoiled, selfish, and extremely stupid. Edgar is a spineless wimp who certainly knew he had a rival--but refused to deal with it. Heathcliff is a sadist who is obessed with (not in love with) Catherine; he is willing to harm even himself to cause suffering to other people. Who could love a man that nasty? Isabella is another silly woman who could not see what was going on around her and falls in \\"love\\" with her imagined version of Heathcliff. And on and on...Nelly Dean is the only sane person in this novel, and she was crazy to stay around these looney families as long as she did.The atmosphere saves the book from complete ruin--it is as dark ,moody, and brooding as the characters. Even the houses seem to snarl and brood and take on the personalities of characters. One is compelled to continue in the book just to see how much more crazy things will get with every body being so dysfunctional and obssessed with having their way. The writing is poetic, and the final scene between Catherine and Heathcliff could be touching--if you can forget how absurd it is.Maybe I am too much of a realist to get carried away with this type of novel. I would not touch Heathcliff with a ten foot pole and can't imagine what women see in the character, other than dark good looks. I cannot imagine what a man would see in Catherine. Or how any of these crazy characters' actions spell l-o-v-e."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"If I were a contributor to a dictionary and was asked for a definition of the word passion, I would simply write....\\"See Wuthering Heights\\". All the basic human emotions- love, hate, jealously, pride, are on display in this novel but at their penultimate height. Cathy just doesn't love Heathcliff- he is part of her very being. Heathcliff just doesn't hate his son Linton- he must fully destroy him. In real life, no one would want to meet, let alone spend any time with any of these people (except perhaps for Ellen Deane, a housekeeper who recounts the story to her new employer-good eye for detail as she spins her tale). But to live with them through the pages of a novel-pure heaven. No other book I have read from this time period even comes close to the modernity of this novel. Heathcliff and Cathy are not destined to be together, because Cathy is unable to forgo the warm pleasures that money can bring. She marries Edgar Linton, a good man devoted to Cathy and for a time Cathy settles in to this life. But as soon as Heathcliff re-enters her life, she is determined to possess him as she did before and Edgar must just understand. Why should he be jealous? Cathy asks. There is not hint of a sexual relationship between Cathy and Heathcliff but something deeper, deeper than even love. Edgar, like most human beings, feels unable to share his spouse in this kind of relationship and being thwarted in her desires, Cathy pines and eventually dies. But this happens in the first half of the book-what are the remaining 150 pages about? Since Heathcliff can never be happy since Cathy is gone, then he decides that no one will be happy and he takes his revenge. And what revenge! Just from general knowledge, I knew what to expect in the first half of the book but the second half was a revelation. Emily Bronte has created a character in Heathcliff that breaks almost every moral code of the time and yet the reader sympathizes with him, no matter how monstrous his actions. I can't think of another writer alive or dead who could have pulled off this feat so well. The writing is beautiful and the dialogues between Cathy and Heathcliff are richly poetic.If you haven't read Wuthering Heights, do yourself a favor and run to find a copy. Reading experiences such as this are rare- a perfectly written novel with characters you will remember forever. The world lost a great novelist with the death of Emily Bronte after only one novel. It makes the reader wonder what else she could have produced."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This edition is just the last aesthetic overhauling of Oxford World's Classics ones with just the same picture (by the Pre-Raphaelite master John Everett Millais) on the cover (see my reviews on them or the global vision I offer in the Norton Critical Fourth Edition review).The cover has been the main object of redesign and looks good, even showy. The only complaint I have, with this as well as with previous editions, and Penguin and some worse ones (like Wordsworth Classics), is the very bad paper quality and the outrageous mass-market paperback with glue-only binding. The book looks like it were to be destroyed BEFORE reading. This just can't be the only format in which to get this absolute classical masterpiece of world-over novel writing, in one edition in which the best scholarly efforts have been spent to get a pure text with adequate annotation. At the very least it should be offered as a quality paperback, with flaps, acceptable paper and, of course, signature-sewn.As far as the contents and not the vessel is concerned, and summarizing: the best 1847 reliable and authoritative Clarendon critical text (due to Hilda Marsden), even with over-conservative details for a mass-market edition, like a rather heavy and outdated punctuation and the unbelievable two-volume implied structure, with its clumsy independent chapter numbering.Ian Jack's annotation is yet one of the very best, even if its Yorkshire dialect support is scanty and a bit difficult to follow (most good editions offer by now fullfoot-of-page glosses of the dialect tirades -glosses that are sometimes wrong and misleading-). The Bibliography is very good, selected, sorted and annotated (I don't know if updated, suppose not). The long Introduction by Patsy Stoneman (30 pp) is excellent, even if a little scholarly (and, as with most of other Introductions, please don't read it BEFORE the novel but after it, just as the \\"Charlotte's materials\\" of 1850 provided at the end of the volume).This edition is a really good buy, that should be compared to the best text-oriented editions:A) Penguin (Pauline Nestor),B) Routledge (Heather Glen, very hard to come by, try Amazon Canada).You may also consider the good context-oriented editions (that is, \\"study\\" ones, rich in contextual materials and/or critical essays), namely,C) Norton Critical Fourth Edition (Dunn), with rather scanty if good annotation and a bit eclectic and even idiosyncratic text (but with very good punctuation);D) the NEW Broadview Press edition by Beth Newman, with scanty notes (very good as they are) and full dialectal glosses like Norton Fourth (both sets of glosses neither wrong nor misleading). Some textual foibles or little blunders are not worrisome (with the best punctuation in town). The overall selection of contextual materials is, arguably, the BEST EVER, with a very interesting document on \\"brain fever\\". The brief and original Introduction (21 pp) is excellent and thought-provoking.Not to be forgotten in this class isE) Longman Cultural Edition (Alison Booth), featuring good if more conventional Introduction and good annotation that includes a little blunder about Miloin Chapter 9, with the authoritative Clarendon text (I will inform you if there is any hidden foible with this), and a too vast array of almost dis-arrayed contextual pieces (more than forty of them), interesting but too brief to be really meaningful.I stand by what I have written, but don't forget that this is one of the very best editions available!Oneworld Classics is a worse choice, in spite of his good paperback making, with good paper and printing quality and covers with flaps. With its good annotation it would challenge the top positions, were it not by the bad quality of the text itself, that was carefully edited but keeps many blunders and too many of Charlotte's 1850 \\"improvements\\". Wordsworth Classics edition is also a worse choice, with a reliable 1850 text (that of the Haworth Edition of 1900: that is, a reliable edition of the wrong text!), adequate notes (even if brief and not user-friendly) and a fair Introduction by John S. Whitley, in one of the worst material productions ever.If you are looking for a beautiful hardcover volume, your choices are much more limited. You can wait for two or three years to get an used copy of the Clarendon 1976 (or 1995) Edition, or you can get the nice volume in Barnes&Noble; Classics (that has the reliable Haworth Edition 1850 text, which is really a pity), or rush to get one nice copy of the Franklin Mint edition of 1978 (see my review) with the beautiful if not daring double-page lithographs by Alan Reingold and a very good pre-Clarendon 1847 text, but with no modern introduction and no annotation whatever, except for the well-done footnotes glossing correctly and in full the dialect tirades (the first edition ever to do so)."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I loved Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte, and I can say without a doubt that I loved Wuthering Heights just as much. The Bronte sisters are so talented! I hope to read something by Anne Bronte, the less well known sister, too. Wuthering Heights is about a destructive and consuming love between Heathcliff, an orphan who comes to the mansion of Wuthering Heights, and Cathy, the daughter of the wealthy family that takes him in. They are drawn together as soon as they meet. The novel is narrated partly by Mr. Lockwood, a tenant who meets Heathcliff many years later. His housekeeper, Mrs. Dean, tells him about the events that happened years earlier, making for a gripping, suspenseful, and sad story.Wuthering Heights is very complex, especially the character of Heathcliff. He's not \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\"; he's conflicted, a multi-layered character. At times, I sympathized with Heathcliff; at other times, I really hated him. Wuthering Heights is difficult to put into any category. It is realistic, but it also has supernatural beings, with ghosts and graves and a love that transcends time. But it also is a mystery, asking complicated questions. The writing is very old-fashioned, but it's not too overwritten, though I did have a little trouble with some of the Yorkshire dialect. But that occurs very rarely; there's just one minor character who speaks that way.You can read all of my reviews at my blog novareviews.blogspot.com."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I downloaded Emily Bronte's \\"Wuthering Heights\\" to my Kindle and read this gothic novel for the first time since I was a teenager discovering 19th Century novels. I remember liking \\"Wuthering Heights\\" as well as Charlotte Bronte's \\"Jane Eyre.\\" I'm sure as a young girl I enjoyed the lyrical, descriptive writing, the mysterious, dark setting, and the passionate but impossible love. But now, forty years later and perhaps wiser, I saw so much more in the characters and the relationships, that it was almost overwhelming to read. I now definitely prefer Charlotte's Mr. Rochester to Emily's Mr. Heathcliff. Such a conflicted, tragic character, Heathcliff only gives small glimpses of human warmth. Yet those glimpses kept me reading and wanting to hope for him. Every character in the book is tragically flawed. But like water springing in hard, rocky soil, love breaks through in unexpected places (as with Catherine and Hareton at the end)."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I love this book and have read it multiple times. To call it melodramatic is to misunderstand the period in which it was written, is to oversimplify it without critically assessing it, and is to mistakenly compare it to current novels. It's apples vs. oranges! One thing that I've always admired is Bronte's use of the letter-within-a-letter framing device; it helps establish the multiple voices of the novel and must've been quite innovative for its time. Admittedly, my appreciation for this novel has been enriched by the 1939 film starring Merle Oberon and Laurence Olivier, though I don't think any film can really do this book justice. It's a true masterpiece."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"3 out of 5, only because it's a bed book. The book itself is in good shape, and it arrived quickly. My gripe is that I didn't see it explained anywhere that it is a Bed book, which means the book reads horizontally not vertically. Not a big deal, but irritating none the less."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I honestly didn't think that I would enjoy this book as much as I did. :] It is a love and hate story. I wasn't fond of Catherine or Heathcliff, but i enjoyed the book. It took me a little while to really get into but after that i couldn't put it down! :] But if your looking for a happy story with a good fairytale ending this book is not for you. For me I really did like this book but I don't think it's for everyone.&lt;3"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I was kind of skeptical of this book in the beginning, after all, a book that has like three generations of families, half of them with the same name is really confusing. In addition, it seemed that I could find any good characters in this book. Even the main character has faults that I would look down upon. This book centers around the revenge of the main character Heathcliff. After trudging along several chapters I found this book to be quite interesting.This book incorporates a lot of gothic elements within the book. Emily Bronte conveys a deep horror and arouses our morbid curiosity with this. One will find many supernatural elements and suspenseful atmosphere within this book, and even a ghost! Because Bronte writes this book through the eyes of several characters, it is hard to judge the objectivity of the story, forcing readers to determine for themselves whether or not certain actions were justified. In the retellings through one character who used to care for Heathcliff's lover, she consistently paints him as the antagonist, emphasizing his faults and his actions against the family. This makes the book that much more interesting to read.The story of Wuthering Heights is a really complicated love story that focuses mainly on Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw. Through Bronte's appeal to pathos, she is able to convey and build up the romance between Heathcliff and Catherine. When she dies, Heathcliff, literally becomes a monster mentally, and Bronte applies this to a figurative level, describing him as a monster too. This also reveals the inner turmoil he experiences upon her death.Emily Bronte definitely writes on par with her sister Charlotte Bronte. Emily's work on Wuthering Heights, with her use of pathos and figurative language definitely makes it a classical gothic romance novel with a novel storyline.It is a beautifully written book that is full of human emotion from the seemingly cold and calculating Heathcliff. After the death of Catherine he burns for revenge. It is a great book, one just needs to get through the first couple of chapter to realize this. The conclusion is also satisfactory and provides for a good release of tension and an epiphany-like ending.I find this book to be a good read, because it has some adult themes, I would not exactly advise little kids to read it, but I am sure that anyone who appreciates literature would be \\"wowed\\" and amazed by this book. Give it a chance, and you will find that this book is worth every single penny!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Wuthering Heights is a love story. But it is not your typical, love conquers all tale. It is a dark, twisted story of obsession, greed and lust that spans beyond the grave. What really strikes me about the story still is how dark it is. And I don't mean 'given the time it was written' because the story is legitimately dark no matter what era it is set in.In the story Bronte perfectly frames two very different kinds of love. There is the healthy love that the tragic heroine of the story has for her husband. There is a fondness in that love that seems destined to grow and flourish. But, there is also an unhealthy, all consuming fiery love between the heroine and the devil of the story, our tragic hero, the scoundrel Heathcliff. So consuming and obsessive is the love between the two that it becomes dark and twisted. Their love is so unhealthy and obsessive that it consumes and devours both of them. It all sounds so amazingly romantic but what it drives the characters to: insanity, murder, captivity, and revenge makes even their proclamations of love to one another macabre.On a side note, Heathcliff, the center of the story for most intents and purposes, is so damned intriguing. I haven't really encountered a character quite like him in literature. You find yourself wanting to know more about him and can't helping thinking that a man who could love so deeply could be so damned evil! But oh, he is...Far and away, Bronte succeeds in the book in creating characters who are both sympathetic and intolerable. None of the characters are entirely loveable, save for the story teller herself. Otherwise there is a pathetic air among everyone save for Heathcliff who seems the only one in the novel who can exploit this weakness. It makes for a lot of moments of cringing as you can almost see the gears of evil genius working in Heathcliff's head.My only complaint with the book is the conveinance of pregnancy. Never is it mentioned until the child is born and never is the mother said to be or appear pregnant. It wasn't enough to entirely take me out of the story but I did roll my eyes on every instance. That is really the only hard argument I can make of Bronte taking an easy way out in her plot but given this is her first and only attempt at a novel, I can let it go as it truly is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This was a difficult read for me. For several months I would pick up this book become utterly disgusted with the characters and put it back down again. I'm really not sure why I finished it as the more I think about it the more I truly hated it. I wish I had returned it to the library unfinished.This is the story of Heathcliff a gypsy boy taken in by the Earnshaw family and Catherine Earnshaw his only childhood friend. Let's just say that as events unfold and as the characters develop we come to know the evil Heathcliff and selfish Catherine will never be together. Since they truly love each other the only alternative seems to be to make life miserable for themselves and everyone around them. At this point I was really hoping for a rabid pack of wolves to attack everyone and end their misery. Unfortunately this did not happen.On a more positive note this book was very well written and the character development superb."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I don't think there is any other novel out there like this. It's definitely a classic, but it's not pleasant and lovely like Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice or mysterious but positive like Charlotte Bront's Jane Eyre. As other reviers said, it's dark. It's unpleasant. It's full of anger and fighting and cruelty.And yet it is well written. It portrays well what it is meant to portray. I wish I understood it better (reading reviews and plot outlines on this page helped me immensely in this area). I definitely want to read it again sometime. I find it interesting that such a repulsive (but again, fascinating) book is such a well-known classic that almost everyone has at least heard of the title."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"As someone with a B.A. in English Literature, I can appreciate that this book has some fine writing and is a worthy classic. On the other, more personal side, I found it extremely disturbing. It is not a tale of love--in fact, I didn't witness any love between Cathy and Heathcliff. Instead, they engage in a sick, jealous, violent, obsessive relationship which ends in heartbreak and tragedy for all concerned. Heathcliff, though the &quot;hero&quot; of the story, is a dangerous, cruel, selfish, and mentally disturbed man and I was not able to feel anything for him but repulsion. Cathy is a spoiled, selfish brat.Nonetheless, it is interesting and sometimes intriguing to read, so I would recommend it if you like 19th century fiction and don't mind lots of violence and cruelty."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"From what I can gather, it is commonly considered that the primary theme of Wuthering Heights is a type of love that transcends all else. Great passion, transcending mortal life, consuming one's soul. Something noble in and of itself, more powerful than reason. Supposedly, this somehow partially excuses any evil stemming from it. Heathcliff is seen as having a wild, passionate, \\"bad boy\\" attraction.If one reads quickly, without really absorbing it all, some scenes do give Heathcliff this allure. But integrating all that he does, he is too evil. And in the end, nothing but deranged evil. His deranged, so-called love excuses nothing. Nor does the mistreatment he received excuse mistreating innocent bystanders. Though it does show insight that abuse tends to engender hatred of life and abuse of others.In his resentment, Heathcliff destroys all rational values in search of some personal satisfaction which is too mean and limited to ever make him happy. Such a man cannot love himself or anyone else. He may have an obsession for something of his imagination, but not appreciation for real people and the give and take of real relationships. Bad treatment may have led to him becoming a monster, but once a monster, he must be recognized as a monster.At that time Bronte was writing, in the 1840's, mystical notions of other worldly love and passions and existence were fairly common. But they are irrational nonetheless.I reject the popular view of the book's theme, whether Emily Bronte intended that theme or not. I think the story illustrates the theme of people being responsible for their own choices and suffering the unexpected consequences of their actions. In other words, the story does not glorify some superior love, but actually ridicules the delusion of it.The idea that souls of loved ones will be reunited after death is common. However, this is a spiritual thing; so, Heathcliff's desire to have the coffins opened on the side makes no sense in this light. He was simply deranged. How Bronte thought up such a thing is strange. Perhaps the idea is that Heathcliff is not spiritual enough, not properly religious, to imagine the mystic reuniting of souls? So he imagines a more physical reuniting?Bronte, as shown by her poetry, seems enamored with notions of life after death; so, it is difficult to know what she felt about life. There is evidence both that she enjoyed it and that she hated it. I wonder if she didn't simply have different moods? Anyway, she was often intelligent and insightful about the natures of different types of people, and Wuthering Heights is cleverly and inventively presented. The ending, which implies that the new generation will find lasting love and happiness, saves the book. I also liked the way religion was shown to be of no positive use for anything, which I doubt was Bronte's intention, but engenders meaness and abuse."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Yes. I agree. This book is compelling and atmospheric. I love the hints of the supernatural. Heathcliffe's lycanthropic qualities. Almost a werewolf on the moonlit moors. The ghostly hauntings and the attentions to and realisations of character's dreams are all very effective. I also like the dichotomy between the two houses. Wuthering Heights is a veritable Hell and Thrushdown Grange is Heaven. BUT... I have never encountered such an utterly repellant motley crew of characters in my life! Who on Earth could have ANY feelings for these people? Heathcliffe is a mad-dog that needs putting to sleep. Hindley is an abusive, maniacal drunkard. Joseph is an hysterical religious bigot. Catherine is a pain... But, worst of all none of the characters show any inclination to extricate themselves from their mess. Rather, they actively encourage each other's dissolution and disarray. There is no-one in the book strong enough or intelligent enough to check these processes of atrophy and attrition. How pointless, don't you think? And for all the reviewers who defend this book with the charge that real-life is similarly evil... Well, yeah, maybe real life according to Jerry Springer and his idiot dysfunctional redneck guests. I found these characters so repellant and downright sinister I couldn't stop thinking of Myra Hindley and Ian Brady."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Its a well woven story. Shows many attributes of human nature, the characters are as imperfect as humans are. Its not one of those stories with a perfect heroine or a horrible adversary, this story is realistic and shows different sides to people, it details their lives with utmost imperfect sincerity that you feel so deeply for these people, the author did a marvelous job with establishing a empathic relationship between the characters and the reader, and its ending isnt a perfect fairy tale ending, but its very filling and satisfying, it might be a accurate portrayal of what life is really like, and the ways people go to endure it"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I read this many years ago.

It has wonderful characters to love and to hate and a story line that will keep you guessing, it really is one of a kind."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Although Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre has been one of my top 5 favorite books all my life, her sister Emily's classic Wuthering Heights has never been a favorite. However, having now read it once in print and listened to it twice in audio, I will admit that it is growing on me. Wuthering Heights will never be a favorite -- its characters are too universally tormented (demented, even), the emotions are too overwrought and the feel of the book is too claustrophobic to ever suit my tastes. However, I am learning to appreciate the wild elegance of Emily Bronte's work.A note on the particular audio version I listened to, which was produced by Recorded Books: it has been my experience that Recorded Books employs the best narrators in the audio book industry. And while Flo Gibson, who narrates this one, is a highly-regarded narrator, nevertheless she is one of my least favorites. I have listened to her narrate two or three books and in each of them my opinion was the same; when she is narrating in her natural voice it is pleasing enough, but when she is doing character voices she manages to make them all sound like 80-year-old women who have been lifelong smokers. Her voice is particularly ill-suited for young female characters."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"What a great experience to finally reread this classic as an adult. Emily Bronte depicts a very gothic and depressing story of two star-crossed (but not terribly likeable) lovers, Cathy & Heathcliff, and the love between them that transcended the grave. Added to that a wonderful depiction of the dark English moors and the local characters with their strange dialects. This was also told in a very unusual style, like a tale within a tale within a tale, adding more layers and perspectives to the story.How unfortunate that one's upbringing can so affect a person that their grief and bitterness turn what could have been a fine young man into such a hateful and vengeful person as Heathcliff became. And fortunate that Cathy's daughter and Hareton could overcome their dark upbringing to bring a happier light onto the dark moors of England.I did not read this version of the book, but theSelected Works of the Bronte Sisters (Wordsworth Special Editions) (Wordsworth Special Editions), which did not have all the footnotes. I think I enjoyed that better as I wasn't constantly distracted by looking to the back for the notes and just allowed myself to become engrossed with the story. It's one book you have to read at least twice in your life -- of course in school as required reading and then again as an adult to add that perspective of age and experience in life so that one can more fully appreciate a such a classic tale."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Those who read WUTHERING HEIGHTS only because their 10th grade English teacher mandated it, often return to Emily Bronte's classic years later for a return visit to the howling moor without quite knowing why. There is a sense of place to the novel that resists ready explanation, and it is perhaps that lingering memory of the triangle that connects Heathcliff, Catherine, and the moor that demands a closer examination with a more mature perspective.Heathcliff and Catherine have a stormy love affair, but the book is not simply a reworking of the romantic potboilers so current then. Nor is it just a cataloguing of nature, though nature is present even from the opening pages. What elevates WUTHERING HEIGHTS to a level not reached before and only a very few times since is Bronte's unique ability to take a nature that is merely descriptive in the hands of a lesser and infuse its wildness and unbridled power into a man who is the walking symbol of that power.Bronte divides nature in the macrocosmic sense--birds, trees, wind, rocks--into two distinct elements. There is the low key, quiet, and peaceful image of nature so beloved by Wordsworth and locates it in the peaceful Thrushcross Grange. It is here where the cultured Linton family live. Every image that Bronte uses is pacific in scope. One wonders whether the Lintons even hear the same whoosh of wind that resounds in Heathcliff's ears. Less obvious to the careless reader is the enervating subtext that infuses the Grange. Bronte drops several hints that the Grange, for all its peaceful charm, has a charm that is incapable of propagating itself in the emerging harshness of the deterministic ruthless way of life that just then was gathering steam. Catherine is a woman with one foot in that world of culture, manners, and -lingering slow death. Even after she leaves Heathcliff for Edgar Linton, Catherine tells Nelly that she is quite aware of the differences between the worlds of the Grange and of Wuthering Heights: \\"My love for Linton is like the foliage in the woods. Time will change it...My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath.\\" Here, Bronte takes the homely images of nature and personalizes them as the metaphorical difference between that which Catherine merely finds pleasant (The Grange) and that which she finds necessary (Wuthering Heights). Then there is the twisted, stormy, and unpredictable nature of Wuthering Heights, where Heathcliff grew and it is there that he suffered untold horrors that taught him that for him to survive, he had to be as violent as the winds which surrounded him.It is less certain whether Bronte wishes the reader to excuse Heathcliff's unspeakable cruelty once he reverses economic position with the effete Edgar Linton. But perhaps it is less to the point to seek to place blame for Heathcliff's revenge than to acknowledge that it is definitely useless to blame a bolt of lighting for striking its unwary victim. Heathcliff, as the walking symbol of Wuthering Heights, is that bolt which strikes out in a manner not unlike the way that he himself had been struck many times as a boy. Once Heathcliff has his revenge in the humbling of the Lintons, a revenge which costs him his beloved Catherine, it remains for the next generation--the young Cathy and Hareton--to remind Heathcliff that revenge must not be permitted to outlive its proper time, and for the new residents of both Grange and the Heights, that time has long passed. What emerges, then, from a second reading of WUTHERING HEIGHTS is Bronte's firm commitment to recreate a clash of conflicting and very nearly mutually exclusive emotions--revenge and forgiveness--that cause each new generation to learn to temper the former with the latter and thus retain their basic humanity."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"A classic like this comes with a hell of a lot of baggage. More people know of Wuthering Heights, know the cliche of clambering about desolate moorlands shouting \\"Heathcliff!\\" and rolling about passionately in the heather, than have actually read the book.But those who do read it are often surprised to find a violent, complex tale that tells as much of hate as of love. This is no frilly romance. This is a book peopled by unapologetically nasty, even hateful characters, many of whom are totally irredeemable. This is a book of hardship, of cruel passion, of all-consuming vendettas.It is also a fantastic book that everyone should read at some point in their lives. Emily Bronte tapped into some deep, dark well of the human psyche when she penned this singular collosus of a novel. From its amazingly complex yet deftly accomplished narrative structure (consisting of narratives within narratives within narratives) through to its two-tiered plot concerning the sins and misdeeds of one generation being visited upon the second, Wuthering Heights can take your breath away. It doesn't hurt that the plot itself is of great interest, and that the characters, horrid as some of them are, are so vividly drawn that many (like Heathcliff and Cathy) have transcended the bounds of the book to enter our popular consciousness.Wuthering Heights is not to be missed."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This novel is amazing and among my favorites. From the loyal and selfless Mrs. Dean, to the narcissistic and vain Catherine (and everyone imaginable in between), the characters are portrayed with a very unique talent. They truly are unforgettable, and the story is well-packed. The literal undying love between Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff will clutch the very soul of the reader. The insanity that grips and devastates throughout the novel gives Wuthering Heights an almost sick tone. The more dominate plot of Heathcliff bringing a heavy revenge upon his foes which in turn terrorizes the next generation, is told in a brilliant, intriguing, and clever way. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"There really much to say about this wonderful book that hasn't already been said, but I want to say when I read this book, i was so upset when the book ended.

Taking place in a small town \\"Gimmerton\\" in England, it offers a lot of emotions and thoughts to the reader. This novel begins with a narrator who is mentioned only three to four times. The narrator Mr. Lockwood is lodging in at Thrushcross Grange, and is tolf the story of a very conflicting family, by Ellen Dean. Mr.Lockwood only has the oppertunity to meet fine of the characters. It seems to be that anyone that visits Wuthering Heights is faced with horiffic mightmares and will not stay in for long. Ms. Deans story begins when the main characters were very young.The novel has a lot of twist and turns and it is filled with hatred, love, envy and unhappiness. Emily ends her novel very calmly as everything falls in its place. I believe that even today, we are faced with people or families that dislike one another. Yet it is harder for revenge to be accomplished, since now we have justice from law? Emily's novel takes place before the 1800's and the rich were the ones who rules, especially in a small town . \\"wuthering Heights\\" is a must need book. The detailed events and feelings, makes you know each character deeply. You will feel attached to the characters and feel what they feel. I really enjoyed this novel."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"\\"Wurthering Heights\\" is among the greatest English novels. It is the only novel by Emily Bronte that was published in 1847, one year before the death of the author. It is a tragic romantic story of the tormented love relationship between Heathcliff and Cathy. This is a well written moving story which some readers may find too distressing.Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff were deeply in love but were destined to be apart. Catherine is a strong willed lady who was on her way up the social ladder. Heathcliff was an orphan who was a waif and was brought to the house by Cathy's father. Cathy and Heathcliff have a strong attraction for each other. However, due to Catherine's social status, she decides to marry Edgar Linton. Heathcliff feels betrayed. From then on, Emily Bronte weaves an intricate plot in a captivating story full of suspense. The story of revenge by Heathcliff is deeply disturbing, violent and shocking.Heathcliff comes out as a man with a demonic character, who is not capable of forgiving someone, is absolutely evil and seeks total destruction of the objects of his hatred. It is difficult to understand the depth of his cruelty and the extreme irrationality of his actions.The book teaches a number of lessons, one of which is the damage that resentment and pride can do to a person as it did to Heathcliff. The author also shows the negative impact of class differences as Catherine cannot embrace Heathcliff for who he is, despite their deep mutual love.This is a compelling and powerful book that left a deep impression on me. The intensity of the emotions exhibited by the main characters is captivating. This powerful and unforgettable novel is highly recommended for those studying English Literature and anyone else who wants to read an interesting and fascinating book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"That, along with many other lines, is why so many of us love Wuthering Heights. It is my all-time favorite book. I've loved it since I was about 14 years old (I'm 30 now). I love the atmospheric quality, the isolation, the rawness of human nature that this book portrays. Yes, Heathcliff and Catherine's love now seems a bit crazy, but for people who led such isolated lives, it's not hard to believe. To me, the novel IS Heathcliff. SPOILER ALERT--Once Catherine dies (midway in the novel), you would think the novel would end. But it doesn't, because Heathcliff's story continues. He's still my favorite anti-hero of any novel (sorry but Darcy or Rochester CANNOT compare)."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Emily Bronte, by far the most talented, arcane, imaginative of the Bronte sisters, wrote the most mentally-provocative love story ever told in the English language. Everything about this book is brilliant! Its setting on the \\"wuthering\\" (wind-swept) hilltops of a Yorkshire moor that seems not just ghost-ridden but somehow physically suspended in time is the most perfect marriage of location to tale I know of. The characters here, needless to say most especially the damned, tormented Heathcliff, rise so far above anything else written in the English language for the next hundred years that I only wish there was a higher rating than five stars to heave praise on this deserving masterpiece. I was given stacks of \\"classic\\" novels to read throughout high school and I grew cynical about them all, these boring, dust-choked standing ruins of books, but Wuthering Heights was a rare exception. This story of love, death, obsession and the indescribable energy of human emotion all but rises off the page with its ferocity. It's widely said Victorian women had fainting spells under the power of Bronte's prose, and I don't doubt that. It is not for me to try to detail this novel's plot, but rather to try to convey to you the force with which Bronte's great book struck me. I was shocked by its brilliance and reveled in all its suggested far down below its cacophonous words. Anyone who claims to appreciate literature and does not read Wuthering Heights is dwelling in a self-imposed exile from an experience few books can deliver. The sheltered Miss Bronte, in literature what the later Emily Dickinson was to poetry, was, in her era, without peer."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Wuthering Heights is one of the most passionate and haunting novels I have ever read. Emily Bronte's incredible understanding of human nature makes this tale of the power of both love and hate more endearing and realistic than the normal Romantic novel. Even after 150 years, it has the ability to shock and horrify a reader, as well as move them to tears of both joy and sorrow. The first half of the novel that illustrates Catherine Earnshaw's and Heathcliff's doomed affair is by far the most popular and famous section of the book. However, our culture has severely watered down their fascinating relationship to an archetypal version of two lovers. Bronte presents us with a much deeper, twisted, and complicated love that destroys their lives as well as the people around them. I personally also loved the second half of the book that deals with the effects of Catherine and Heathcliff on the next generation. It is much less intense than the first half, but is very beautiful and brings the plot to a full circle. I strongly recommend this book, but please do not believe that it will be a simple love story. It is a complex analysis on vindication, jealousy, hatred, and of couse, a love that is even stronger than death."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Its been a long time since I've fully been engrossed in a novel-for some time, I've worked my way through books, flipping a few pages forward so I could see when the chapter would end and I could find something better to entertain myself with. This particular novel, however, woke up something in me. It's a beautifully written piece about a passion that goes unchecked, leading a man to his doom. What's august about this piece is that the reader has a hard time deciding if the man (Heathcliff) did in fact deserve his fate. The novel deals with very difficult psychological subjects-when forgiveness should be blessed on those who have wronged you and what one should value in one's life. It is enraptured by violence, yet there is not mention of any violent scenes. Amorous to its very essence, but sadly disappointing for those expecting erotic moments. It deals with the very basis of man but mixes universal raisons d'etre with individual idiosyncrasies of the characters. It is, in short, an amazing novel and Emily Bronte should be admired for still being able to connect with readers years after her death."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I read Wuthering Heights for first time when i was 12 years old.Now I\`m 18 and I\`m still reading this book.And at everytime i read it, I can\`t hold myself from crying.

The strength of this story is that it is written about very flawed people. It is dark and passionate and very non-PC. It would never be written today. In short, it is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This was really a great book. I started out with a negative attitude about reading it, because many English literature classics turn out being very boring or slow; not so with this one. It was so intense and original that I honestly had to force myself to close the book at night and get some sleep. One should not expect a likeness to Shakespeare's extraordinary skill of language, but it obviously was not written by an idiot. Overall it is easy reading, with a few sophisticated, rarely used words encountered every page or two. The book should be read by anyone who can appreciate true love, and the pain caused through selfishness, cruelty, and all-encompassing sorrow. Just about every feeling of emotion is covered in this great work, actually. Don't put much truth into what some reviews say about the ending. There truly could not have been a better one. Everything comes full-circle, as I see it, and it happens in such a way as to make any sharp reader satisfied. Check this book out from the library; or better yet, buy it so you can read it again, ten years down the line, when you've forgotten what it was even about."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"For the first time I got to read this absolutely astounding masterpiece, I got thrilled and enchanted by the most beautiful language, descriptions that make you see the set and actions before your eyes, and of course this consuming crazy passion which entwines both main characters. Emily Bronte succeed not only in creating a most touching, and yet horrifying love story, which can only be compared to Phantom by Susan Kay,but also managed to make it a Gothic tale with symbolism and double meaning all around. This is a book to be read many times, and understood deeply. I was 16 when I've read it for the first time, and since then I reread it for countless number of times, and each time I discovered something new. It helped me to grow emotionally. In this story, &quot;physical&quot; true love is lifted above our world, ad turned into something more spiritual. The bond between heathcliff and Cathy was so strong that it conquered death. A greatest love story of all time. A must-read for anyone."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"The other reviews of the book already summarize the plot and lend a personal response. I only wish to bring to mind, a few points about the book which make it worth reading and worth appreciating .Written in the typical Gothic Novel style, the work is full of horror, violence, love, trauma and death. How many authors can intergrate all that into a single plot and have the novel called a &quot;classic&quot;? The fact that Heathcliff cannot be classified is crucial to the novel, he oscillates between the vicitm of abuse by Hindley, and the villain by Nelly, Cathy and Linton. Throughout the novel, the unreliability of the narrative only adds to the dire and dark tone of the novel - making it even more horrific than it already is. In the time Bronte wrote in, eroticism in literature was absent - the boldness of Bronte in writing about a man walking into a married woman's bedroom inannounced is not only shocking, but also a precursor to the modern, romantic drivel that some read. Its a great book, the theme of nature vs.nurture and of wuthered development have been taken up with severity - and as the story unravels, the plot reveals itself in repetition - highlighting the horror of violence. Read this book, knowing the time it was written in, see the harsh descriptions of the violence committed by a loveless man, whose unknown background makes him a mystery. Tell me, when you've read it, if you think Heathcliff was an illegal child of old Earnshaw...is there another explanation for the way he is brought into the house, and why catherine and him develop the diabolical friendship they have?"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This is NOT the study edition referred to in the other review. It is a poorly formatted version of the book which contains nothing but the text. No table of contents or other such fanciness, and certainly no supplemental material. Just the text.

It is better formatted and free."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"What?! Seriously? They had to put a Twilight cover on this book to get people to read it? Wuthering Heights is a million times better and more important than Twilight. Come on!I doubt any of the characters of Twilight had anything anything close to the depth required to even comprehend this novel."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"\\"Wuthering Heights\\" is a cruel,complex, unforgettable look at possessive love. The 1847 novel was the only one witten by Emily Bronte.The story tells of Heathcliff who is an orphan adopted on a Liverpool journey by Mr. Earnshaw. He brings the ragged lad back home to the wild moors of Yorkshire. Heathcliff is mistreated by the oafish Hindley Earnshaw the son of the family. He spends long dreamy hours wandering the moors with Catherine the Earnshaw daughter. After many complications Heathcliff leaves England for mysterious regions. He returns years later to discover Catherine has married the weak milquetoast Edgar Linton who gives Catherine the security and kind love of a well to do landowner.Catherine dies giving birth to daughter Cathy. Heathcliff weds the infatuated sister Isabella sister of Edgar Linton. In the second half of the novel Catherine's daughter will wed the son of Heathcliff and Isabella. Isabella has fled from the cruel Heathcliff dying at an early age.The novel is structured as a flashback to events told by Nelly Dean a nurse to Catherine who relates them to Mr. Lockwood a shallow English dandy who has rented Thrushcross Grange following a failed romantic affair.The novel switches from past to present dealing with many characters with similar names. Heathcliff is often called satanic and is a figure of Dantian and Satanic power. He is very cruel killing small animals; driving Isabella away and insulting everyone. He mistreats his son and his alcoholic nephew. Heathcliff is as rough as a crag of rock on the wild moors. He longs for a complete soul union with Catherine. He even has her dug up from the grave so he can look at her dead face! Necrophilia, sadism, overt cruelty to the weak are everday occurrences at Wuthering Heights which is ruled by the tyrant Heathcliff and his mean toady servant the repulsive Bible thumping Joseph.Catherine is petulant, violent, selfish and cruel. Neither Heathcliff or Catherine are admirable characters. They apparently love and long for one another. At one point Catherine tells Nelly \\"Heathcliff and I are one soul.\\" Following her death she will haunt Heathcliff as she roams the stark moors in neither heaven or hell.Libraries have been built dealing with the complexity of this novel. It demands several rereads. Let it be said that the novel is always fresh, suprising and modern. Wuthering Heights is not your typical love story. It is harsh, stark and cruel. Read it and ponder this tale of ghostly, obsessive, dreamliike love set against the dark brooding moors of Yorkshire. The characters will leave a permanent imprint on your mind and heart."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I'll never forget a one-on-one extended conversation I once had with the celebrated, brilliant albeit tortured poet, John Berryman (and his bottle of Jack). What remains with me from that broadly inclusive and allusive ramble about all things literary (and more) was his singling out Emily Bronte's \\"Wuthering Heights\\" as the one novel capable of exerting a hold on the reader that all but defied his analysis and description. I didn't fully grasp his drift at the time, but after at least two additional readings of this perversely powerful, heaven-denying yet time-defying testimony to indestructible passion that is neither quite \\"of\\" nor \\"out of\\" this world, I now number myself among those who, like Berryman, are in the novel's grip.The uniqueness of the story is not the subject matter (as Charlotte implied in her critical assessment of her sister's novel--though I would grant that scenes of puppy hanging and necrophilia are not common Victorian fare). The novel owes its special place to the discourse--the language as employed by Emily Bronte to express the feelings of Catherine and Heathcliff--that moreover insures familiar emotions strike the reader in unfamiliar ways, altering and destabilizing conventional understandings before taking root in consciousness. Bronte's syntax and diction literally make the reader \\"work,\\" but the difficulty is essential to her dual purpose: 1. to enable us to experience first-hand some of the same reeling and disorientation felt by the characters who ride the whirlwind of their fatal but not deadly passion; 2. to convey the supreme difficulty (impossibility, for most of us) and accomplishment of representing in words a passion that is equal parts natural and unnatural.The key to reading this novel for maximum impact and lasting appreciation is to struggle with, but not give up on, the novel's vital meanings, which are in the passages containing some combination of the following: paradox and irony, sudden reversals, antithesis, oxymoronic juxtaposition, natural images functioning as \\"objective correlatives,\\" mind-blowing similes and metaphors pushed to extravagant literary \\"conceits.\\" Above all, the reader needs to be alert to Bronte's transpositions of references and referents, her displacements of \\"signifiers\\" and the \\"signifieds\\" with which they are normally paired.The foregoing might seem to be insufficient incentive to read this remarkable novel were it not for the surprising degree of \\"precision\\" that characterizes Bronte's eros-fueled discourse about love. Just as the \\"monstrous,\\" elemental, and hate-spewing Heathcliff is at the same time an attentive, responsive observer (catching Hindley and later Catherine in mid-flight, a fractional second before either hits the floor) and a careful, even long-range planner, taking pains to stay within the \\"law,\\" Bronte's language attends to and remains true to its own laws, adhering to a meticulous and consistent logic that rewards the reader who has the patience to stay with its lurching, unpredictable course. Once you've decoded a statement such as Heathcliff's that he can \\"never forgive Catherine's murderer\\"--with Catherine herself being the \\"murderer\\" he has in mind--the logic of Bronte's lexicon along with her unfailing responsibility to the reader become more evident, making possible a relationship between reader and text rivaling that of Cathy and Heathcliff.(Concerning this Penguin edition, I could do without its return to the original published format of two volumes along with two chapter 1's, two chapter 2's, etc. The unified, organic structure of the novel is better served by an edition that avoids such a distracting bifurcation of the narrative. There's only one potential benefit that I can see: if you read the first volume only, the William Wyler-directed Hollywood classic starring Olivier and Oberon works much better.)"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"The authors of the afore time---afore the era of simplicity and profanity--- were so epic in there prose.

It is an amazing novel, capturing the reader and drawing them into Cathy and Heathcliff's world, devided between the two contrasting houses of Thrushcross Grange and Wuthering Heights. The writing style of Bronte conveys the emotion extremley well throughout the intricate and intertwining storylines. The story is told over the course of two generations, in the moors of England, creating a good backdrop for such a story. It is, in my opinion deserving of its status and leaves the reader with thoughts regarding fate and predestination. A dramatic and sadenning book, Wuthering Heights is a novel which, at the time it was published pushed back the barriers of what was considered &quot;acceptable&quot; in literature."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This book is a great mix of passion, love, betrayel, and revenge.i would recommend this book to everybody.

I found myself wanting to read on about the relationships between Heathcliff and Catherine, Catherine and Edgar, and Heathcliff and Edgar. These relationships were exciting to read about to see how everything would turn out in the end. I would put myself in the characters' shoes and think about how I would react to the various situations. For example, if I were Catherine, I would get rid of my need for wealth and marry for love. In Heathcliff's position, I would have accepted the fact that I would never be with Catherine and try to find happiness in my own life.

The narrative infuses in us a feeling of dark stormy nights. There isn't much depiction of romance in here. But I remember it as the most passionate romance I've ever read. The romance between Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff. The power of their feelings for each other is so real and forceful, I feel they might still be roaming the moors in Yorkshire together as spirits.And Emily Bronte's narrative is gripping.The only shortcoming I felt was the ending which was rather convenient and this convenience leads to a predictable happy ending."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"If Emily Bronte's intention was for us to have some feeling for her characters, because I think that is one of the marks of a good writer, then she hit the mark beautifully. Catherine and Heathcliff must be the most infuriating characters I have ever had the displeasure to read about. They are two selfish beasts continually arguing over which one is selfish! Instead of finding their relationship to be some intoxicating gothic romance, it is instead a bizarre, love/hate infatuation that brings misery to everyone around them.The gruesomness of the characters takes away nothing from the value of the work. As a matter of fact, I think it adds a vivid flavor that is hard to get from many novels. Afterall, everyone gringes at movies, but how many people gringe at books?"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"My Review:Emily Bronte's novel Wuthering Heights is a classic that all should read. It uniquely portrays the undoubtedly present fight between earnest and passionate love and vigorous hate. This novel is the epidemy of a tale that twists the reader's previous opinion on innocent love.Wuthering Heights is the home to the Earnshaw family. It lies desolate from the world upon the moors and wetlands of vast fields. This home is quiet large in size, however it is musty and gray in color and rather lonely in its outward appearance. The master is the father, Mr. Earnshaw, then there is Mrs. Earnshaw and the children, whom are Hindley and Catherine. Further into the novel a child is added into the Earnshaw family, but it is not their own. This child is later known as Heathcliff, an Irish gypsy waif found and pitied by the master during his stay at Liverpool. The master took such pain in seeing the boy on his own that he brought him home to his children to accompany. But Earnshaw's son, Hindley, from the very beginning detested Heathcliff for the reason that the master, much too obviously, favored \\"poor Heathcliff\\" than that of his own son!AS the years past, turmoil, jealousy and overall hatred consumed Hindley, leaving Heathcliff and him to be forever enemies. On the contrary, Catherine and Heathcliff were the best of friends and they grew to love each other dearly. In fact the were inseparable to the point that the greatest punishment that either could have been given was that of being away from each other.The two were quite rambunctious and always up for adventure. One day Catherine and Heathcliff met other children at the residence of Thrushcross Grange ( the Lintons, the rich and spoiled kids!!!). Catherine instantly fell in love with their classy way of life and left Heathcliff to eat her dust!! haha..Catherine still loved Heathcliff but grew to understand that she was just too high class of a women for him , resulting in her decision to love and marry her material possessor Edgar Linton ( one of the rich kids, his sister was Isabella Linton.)Stricken by grief, Heathcliff pursued till his very death his soul and body...his dear Catherine. Without her he was not complete, and each day he yearned her presence.In volume two of this novel the reader comes to know of whom marries who and who are their children. Heathcliff in this volume becomes an aggressive hateful man and his once joyful heart is turned black and cold; full of hate. Cathy, the descendant of Catherine, is portrayed by Bronte as the fulfillment of her mother's dream that was never reached ( marrying her true love). And whom Cathy marries is her cousin ( I know gross right?...well she marries 2 of her cousins!!! nastier!) who is known as Hareton. They, in a way, are the parallel of their elders, but they are more so in the sense that they are the \\"happy ending\\" to the love fest of Catherine and Heathcliff.Overall, I would have to say that this book is not only credited for its educational material, rather to me it is credited by its insightfully constructed plot. Bronte is an amazingly talented author who places her own viewpoints and morals skillfully throughout this classic. This novel is great because of its symmetrical structure of love and hate, nature and culture, and lastly the ongoing fight between Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange. At the story's finale it is truly left up to the reader to decide whom they believe won the battle. At first one believes it is Wuthering Heights due to Catherine giving in to marrying her love, yet it could be the Grange for both Catherine and Hareton beating Heathcliff's evilness in the end. What readers should come to appreciate from this novel is that Bronte really applied her inner emotions to this novel and the whole story is told from her beliefs and her viewpoint on the matter of Catherine and Heathcliff's immortal love which is too sacred to control, therefore Bronte ends this love triangle by their death for the reason that in some cases love cannot be joined for it is so strong that peace could not be kept with its overpowering presence on human kind.--ChiChi----"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"When it was first published under a pseudonym in 1847, Wuthering Heights caused a scandal. The staid and drab era of the 1840's was simply not used to such an intense and disturbing story of such raw passion and cruelty. In this tale of love and tragedy, an orphan named Heathcliff is adopted and comes to live at Wuthering Heights. He falls in love with the man's daughter, Catherine. But his life is hell because of her brother. Catherine's brother hates and humiliates him. Heathcliff can take it no more and eventually he runs away. He's gone a long time and in the meantime, Catherine marries, even though it's Heathcliff she's really in love with. Heathcliff returns dandified and rich... to take his revenge. But I won't give away the climax and ending. Heart-stopping and intense!

Such is the curse of the lion share of my sex, despite our gradual feminization in the modern era.I'm glad I overcame my aversion to read this excellent portrayal of eros defiled. Heathcliff is the focus, fulcrum and prime mover in this story. He is dragged of the streets and taken in by a wealthy gentleman from the provinces. This man showers great affection on the young street urchin and demands equal treatment from his two natural born children.The eldest, a son, resents this upstart, so when the father dies, he relegates poor Heathcliff to the status of neglected servant. Catherine, the younger, has become a close friend of Heathcliff and follows him into the relatively untethered but savage life of the servants' children. Growing up unsupervised they develop the manners of the low born, and but develop a strong bond of love that transcends the facile distinctions of filial versus romantic.Alas, when Catherine comes of age, the duties of her birth beckon and she is taken from Heathcliff and marries someone of higher station.It is this love, never fulfilled, that sours in Heathcliff makes him a despicable tyrant.This is the dark side of romance, and Romance as viewed from the man's vantage point.Worth reading."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"As a great work of literature and a novel of passion, this work is excellent. A dark novel, it is quite intreging, drawing one into the complex and whimsically dark dream world of the characters. The novel is truly able to contrast the wild depths of one's soul with the civilized, although repressed areas through the contrast of the two houses and the people who reside there. Heathcliff, although dispicable, is someone we can sympathize with...savage and unrefined, he extends beyond humanity, becoming a character of pure passion. Cathy also exists as a refined and civilized form of that same passion, which is why she can love both the dainty Edgar and the wild Heathcliff. The children carry on the parents lives, and, eventually setting their mistakes right and bringing order through their marriage. Heathcliff too has a poignant changing scene, in which we realize that he is not evil, but has just succumbed to this because of his pain and sorrow. My favorite scene is the last between Cathy and Hareton, ending with Heathcliff's death....it was simply beautiful and contrasted with the novel's darkness. The style too was mesmerizing....Bronte's poetic language is beautiful and full of meaning...fiting perfectly with the characters. All and all, it is an excellent novel, but complex, and anything but light and simple. Jane Eyre may be better, but if you like it, read this too, it's worth your while."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Wuthering Heights is a very slow book. Not much happens and you shouldn't read it if you want an interesting story. After reading it, I feel that the book could have been shortened greatly. Even though there are some excellent themes in it, I don't see WH as an example of fine literature. Authors such as Hemingway (For Whom the Bell Tolls), Dumas (The Count of Monte Cristo--Unabridged), and Frank (Alas Babylon) spin much better tales with much stronger themes and meaning. My advice: skip this book and read the unabridged version of The Count of Monte Cristo."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Hello,and welcome to my breif reveiw on Wuthering Heights.If you want to read this book you've made the right choice. Wuthering Heights is a beautiful book of passion,pain,tragedy and love. Although I am only a chid I think that this book is the most touching one I have ever read. Wuthering Heights is about the young love of Catherine and Heathcliff and their struggle to be together. I read this book and had this much admiration for it, so why shouldn't you?"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"WUTHERING HEIGHTS has always been portrayed to me as a magnificiently tragic romance between an unconventional pair of lovers. I'm glad I can finally judge it for myself. Heathcliff, rather than coming across as the quintessential brooding (yet sympathetic) hero, is a character of textbook psychopathic tendencies, right down to the needless torturing and killing of animals. Catherine is never described or portrayed sympathetically either; she is ill natured, petulant, conniving and as vengeful as Heathcliff, whom she regards as her soul mate. (But, of course, since they are both physically attractive, people must feel free to ignore these aspects of the text.)So what triggers the tragedy in their romance? Unconventional Catherine decides to take the conventional route of the times and marry for money. Heathcliff, a foundling who has been raised as Catherine's brother, slinks off with his tail between his legs, only to return in three years time with enough money to gamble with,enabling him to win the mortage to Wuthering Heights from Catherine's nasty actual brother. Meanwhile, Catherine and Heathcliff are quite dismayed when Catherine's husband finally puts his foot down and says they cannot continue their relationship. Catherine proceeds to her bedroom where she eventually bites a hole in her feather pillow and (in my favorite scene) amuses herself by naming the bird from which every feather came. Heathcliff elopes out of spite with Catherine's sister-in-law, a conventional sort who still manages to do what the wild and reckless Catherine should have done in the first place, or even later, instead of hiding out in her room for months on end. But no, that would have spoiled the plot, wouldn't it? WUTHERING HEIGHTS is definitely driven by plot, with the characters' personalities shifting to suit Miss Bronte's narrative needs.Am I glad I read this? Yes. Bronte's descriptive strengths made mucking through the characters's histrionics worthwhile. Should I have felt guilty for having put it off for so many years? Certainly not. I think even as a teenager I'd have found the characters absurd and unlikable. Do I have concern for those who think Heathcliff's continued obsession with Catherine after her death, and his compulsion to punish all those who'd thwarted his relationship with her (as well as the offspring of these people, even his own)is a shining example of a true love that transcends death? Most definitely. It saddens me to think that some girls may remain in abusive relationships because their boyfriends are the Heathcliff-type, and therefore, supposedly desirable. Heathcliff is psychopathological. Love for one person, thwarted or not, is not supposed to be used as grounds for destroying the lives of everyone else you come in contact with."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I was enraptured with this book.

Even his oldest friend and companion Catherine is not beyond reproach.Lockwood knows nothing of the scandal and unrest that surrounds Wuthering Heights when he leases Thrushcross Grange from Heathcliff for a season. Scandalized by the residents of Wuthering Heights and shocked by the blatant disregard for common courtesy and propriety, he soon endeavors to unearth the whole story from his housekeeper, Nelly Dean.The story Nelly reveals is one of unresolved passion, haunting obsession, and a connection that even death cannot deny in Wuthering Heights (1847) by Emily Bront.Wuthering Heights is Bront's only novel.Groundbreaking for its time, Wuthering Heights is a divisive novel that is more often regarded with love or hate rather than indifference.Some claim Bront's gothic novel is a sweeping romance that spans not just years but death itself. Written in the first person with a framing story around the main drama of Catherine and Heathcliff's doomed relationship, Bront creates an evocative story filled with Yorkshire dialect and harsh lanscapes.At the same time, this book is a study in human cruelty. Catherine and Heathcliff are horrible people and, even while proving their love for one another, they do unspeakable things.If you can get past the basic meanness of almost all of the characters, Wuthering Heights is an atmospheric story filled with chills and menace sure to linger after the last page is finished.Possible Pairings: Frost by Marianna Baer, Plain Kate by Erin Bow, The Wicked and the Just by J.

Not only did her writng have the power to transport you to seemingly another world, but the memorable characters and personalities make Wuthering Heights a book to remember. The charming tale takes place in windswept England on a lovely castle. Told through a narrative of an old housekeeper, the story of love and hate take place first hand. While quite unsuspecting, Mr. Lockwood, a guest of Thrushcross Grange, visits, he hears the tale of the Earnshaw family who used to live in Wuthering Heights. In a tale of backstabbing, lying, cheating, love, and hatred, he hears the tale of Hindley and Heathcliff and their sibling rivalry along with their lover Catherine who marries Hindley but is in love with Heathcliff. At the end of the book, all members of the original family are gone, and Mr. Lockwood takes note of how quiet and peaceful the grange has become. The true charm of this book are the characters. The way in which they speak is charming and brings out personality. Emily Bronte had a wit an charm about her style of writing, something that is very apparent in Wuthering Heights. While filled with quite a bit of drama, Wuthering Heights is a book that will transport you to the old English estate country and leave you with a story in which you will find entertaining as well as charmming."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This book came in as I had expected it too be as well as on time!

I haven't read the others, but it is definitely my favourite so far.\\"I lingered round them, under that benign sky: watched the moths fluttering among the heath and harebells, listened to the soft wind breathing through the grass, and wondered how any one could ever imagine unquiet slumbers for the sleepers in that quiet earth.\\""},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"It's strange how often I have the experience of reading an \\"old\\" novel like this one, expecting it to be dry and boring, and find that it's anything but. You'd think I'd learn, but no. There's a reason these are called classics: people have been thinking they're really good for a long time, and they're still really good. This is the kind of book I would have gone out of my way to not read in high school, which is probably just as well. I wouldn't have appreciated it then.One thing I noticed right off the bat is that this isn't Jane Austen, which just goes to show that female British novelists of the early 1800s can be very different. Jane Austen is very funny and satirical. Emily Bronte is very serious. There are flashes of humor now and then, but she's mining the human soul, and it's dark work.This book was written in 1845, but describes fictional events that took place from the 1770s until 1801. I don't know why she placed the events in the novel so far in the past. Maybe people of the 1840s would have thought, \\"Oh, the 1770s! Yeah, that's how people behaved then.\\" The same way we would think of the 1940s, I guess. But I don't have that perspective, so I don't know what she was going for.She does some pretty complicated stuff with the narration, too. She doesn't just tell you what happened, starting at the beginning and moving on to the end. She actually starts at the end of the story, with the main narrator meeting the surviving participants in what happened 30 years before. Then she begins introducing various other narrators who describe what happened from their point of view. This really plunges you into the story, because you're not looking at it from the outside, but from the perspective of someone actually involved with the events at the time. You're in the moment and in the place. I was impressed by such sophisticated storytelling in what I think was her first novel, and in 1845.There are only a handful of characters in the story, and each one is sharply delineated. You can just picture these people. Bronte has a knack for apt description. I was glad this wasn't one of those novels that describes every nail in the floor, but what description there is is always telling and to the point. She's not just filling up pages like some authors ::cough:: Dickens ::cough:: sometimes do.The plot is simple enough. Heathcliff is a boy of unknown origins who is brought up in the same family as the girl Catherine. They're inseparable companions. However, when they grow up, Catherine marries someone else. That's it. But the consequences and the complexity of the interactions of these two characters with each other and with everyone around them are amazing. Bronte wrings every drop out of the situation. At some times, you get the feeling, \\"Wait: you mean, if he had heard the rest of what she'd said, none of this would have happened?\\" But that's what life is like sometimes. It depends on a single word or look or gesture.I think that people of the time would have been pretty scandalized by some of the goings-on. People play pretty loose with \\"the sanctity of marriage\\", for instance. And I think it would have absolutely terrified women about getting pregnant. Everybody dies in childbirth in this book.I also think this has to be one of the first novels that has an actual sociopath as a main character. Dropping someone like Heathcliff into ordinary polite English society is like tossing a hand grenade into a cricket match. The effects are devastating, and all the more so because people don't expect it and have no idea how to deal with it.To modern audiences, there are other parts that are at least as disturbing. The idea of first cousins marrying seems to be perfectly fine with these people - in fact, one character does it twice - but probably gives readers today a Ewww feeling. And the casual way that Heathcliff can beat people, or kidnap them, or lock them in their rooms for weeks, all without even the mention of the possibility of some kind of police or legal reckoning is chilling.Bronte shows a perfection of wording that is astonishing. She always selects the right word to describe even the most commonplace of actions, such as walking or talking. It's an unobtrusive thing, but she words scenes with a precision that is admirable.Ultimately, this is a fascinating novel following events from a simple source that eventually engulf and destroy almost everyone connected with them, like a slow and remorseless tidal wave.Highly recommended"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"A must read...not because \\"Bella\\" says you should. But because this story is just so powerful. Aside from that one guy you can't ever understand, it takes you to another time with language that is so much like woven yarn."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"After reading Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte, I thought I should continue in the same vein with Wuthering Heights, written by her sister Emily Bronte. But whereas Jane Eyre is a story of love rewarded and hopes fulfilled, Wuthering Heights so far is an unremittingly grim tale of cruelty and revenge in two related families.Structurally, the book is a frame tale within a frame tale: Mr. Lockwood, the narrator who introduces the story, is soon replaced by the voice of Nelly Dean, the faithful servant who relates to Mr. Lockwood the family history that has led to the current misery. To my view, Nelly is the strongest and most believable character. Most of the rest of the characters in the story seem overdrawn. They are also hard to keep straight, partly because names are shared between generations; sometimes I think a family tree might be helpful.Considering that Wuthering Heights was written about 1845, I was expecting more difficulty with language than I actually encountered. There are few speeches in a heavy Yorkshire dialect which are daunting, and apparently even the author at one point considered revising them to make them intelligible to a broader audience. And there are some isolated words which seem to have changed their meaning over the years; but for the most part the book is quite readable.I have so far read about two-thirds of the text. I am plodding through to the end, hoping that there may be some ray of light shed before the end of the book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"A great classic read.

It is a little sad, though, that this great book averages four stars, the same rating as many of the comparatively poorly written, more contemporary but soon-to-be-forgotten fiction reviewed on this site. Not that one should confine oneself to reading classics, but at least recognize them for what they are."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Ever since I read this book, every book is easy to read. Thanks to this book, I have come to understand two things better: a bit more of human nature through Heathcliff's, and both Catherines' characters and English language through Emily Bronte's amazing style. The language changed a lot ever since the beginning of 19th century, I had trouble reading at first, it seemed boring and I couldn't really get into the characters. Then suddenly it became easy and interesting to read. Maybe I should thank my reading abilities for the improvement but I'd rather think it's the well developed characters of Ms Bronte helped me to step over that invisible reading barrier. I highly recommend this book, it is a must-read kind because it is about pure love, not passion."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Emily Bronte wrote Wuthering Heights during a time when the people of England were not ready for such an intense and passionate novel. There-for it was not given the recognition it truely diserved until many years later, long after she died of T.B. Wuthering Heights is truely a work of art. The story envelopes the reader into a mysterious world with very heartful characters. The narration is perfect, in that you are seeing and hearing everything that the narrator says and sees. Emily's writting style is perfect in that she always gives just the right amount of details in her accounts. As a matter of fact, the story is so well written that a reader who really takes the time to understand and enjoy the book will soon find himself/herself attatched to it. It is almost impossible to put down. Over all, Wuthering Heights is a book not to be missed, but reader be warned, it is a book that takes a lot of effort to read. A lot of paragraphs require heavy analyzing to make sure that you catch the hidden meanings and important foreshadowing.

I believe that she based it on that of her father. Outrageous? Unfair? After all the Rev. Bronte was a decent sort of chap whereas on one occasion Heathcliff beat a young teenager until he lost consciousness.But consider this. Emily's father, tormented by his intellectual isolation and his lonely widowhood, used to occasionally open the back door of his house and fire a gun several times into the moors for no apparent reason. You can imagine the young Emily tentatively enquiring, &quot;Is everything alright, father?&quot; and her father answering brusquely, &quot;Perfectly satisfactory, thank you, my dear.&quot; and then slamming the door as he disappeared back into his study.On other occasions, he used to stuff furniture or a rug into the living room fire. I forget where I read this. Gaskell's biography of Charlotte Bronte? Daphne du Maurier's excellent book &quot;The Infernal World of Branwell Bronte&quot;?I doubt that Emily forgot the images created by her father's behaviour. It must have seemed to her like a hint of a suppressed rage so huge as to demand the creation of a character like Heathcliff to express it.How strange this book - like a dream journey into the subconscious world! People reflected in other people. Time collapsing onto itself.

I found an old copy on my mothers bookshelf, and loved this novel before I knew it was considered a 'classic'. You often hear references made to star-crossed literary couples such as 'Romeo and Juliet' and 'Catherine and Heathcliff'. It is telling that this work is important enough to be referenced alongside ShakespeareThe only novel written by Emily (her sisters Charlotte and Anne were more prolific), the tale takes place on the moors of England. Catherine Earnshaw is surprised when her well-to-do father brings home a mysterious foundling and names him Heathcliff. A dark and brooding child, Heathcliff nonetheless becomes Catherines playmate and confedant.Their relationship changes, however, as Catherine grows into a woman. She begins to think that a lady of her station should not be dallying with a foundling such as Heathcliff, who has no family or wealth. She is wrapped in her own vain self-worth, and beings to spur the bewildered Heathcliff.A moody and potentially violet man, Heathcliff retreats further into himself the worse Catherine treats him. He never stops loving her, his passion endures even her scorn. The end of their love affair is both beautiful and tragic.A great triumph of writing by a woman of her time, Emily died shortly after her novel was published.

I enjoy watching soap operas I like to know all the complex family history or just basic background that has been happening for years. When you know all of the history, it makes the story make sense. Wuthering Heights has this charm because of its long time span and complicated family tree. Some of the bad points of soap operas are also present in Wuthering Heights.

Well, it is to a point... but mostly it is just depressing. They both die near the end and they never get married. She marries an entirely different man, and after she dies he basically goes crazy with sadness. This story is extremely confusing, as well as slightly boring at times. It is hard to understand because of the time frame it is supposed to be in.This book is probably not for young readers, because of the difficult vocabulary and small print. It was hard for me to understand, so i can imagine what it would be like for, say, a ten year old. I do not recommend this book to someone who has a short attention span, because it is hard to follow and hard to get into. If you, by chance, like older literature and are good at comprehending, go for it! But it is not the best choice for someone who is used to reading newer, easier reads. Wuthering Heights is defiantly not a thriller."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"The savings were beaucoup! This was a required reading book for school.

Catherine has a daughter named Catherine and Hindley (Catherine's brother) has a son named Hareton. Now a new love story comes out consisting those three children.You will not be sorry you read this book. It's a tragic reality love story and it's a classic. What do you have to lose?"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Heathcliff is a fierce, pitiless, wolfish man inside and out. His character makes this an interesting story. But, it was a little tedious to read.Margo, a former college professor, enlightened me with some thoughts on the book which I am quoting here. This is from her comment below dated 2/4/09. \\"Younger readers are fans of the story because they see in it the tumultuous passions of lovers obstructed by \\"outsiders.\\" I think they \\"get it.\\" My college students love it because they are mesmerized by the slow, agonizing destruction of one of the lovers as he takes his vengeance.\\" Thank you Margo.Sexual language: none. Number of sex scenes: none. (I mention sexual content solely for the purpose of providing information. Some readers may want to know this when recommending to young adults.) Setting about 1775 to 1805 England. Published about 1847. Genre: Gothic Romance (romance about obsession)."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Perhaps the author, Emily Bronte, had the need to write an anti-Jane-Austin story, because this sure qualifies. This tale of interleaved sociopaths is the antithesis of Jane Austin. The people of Quality and Breeding are all mentally disturbed, only the female servant is with sense (she declares herself so in Volume I, chapter 12, page 1). Given the continuum: Perfect Family - Normal Family - Dysfunctional Family - ?? (my vocabulary fails me), these folks rate the \\"??\\". Clearly the quality of the literary effort is superb, the writing and characterization is terrific. The story does have a useful function in illustrating the Darwinian nature of life, but don't read it for its ability to elevate. Is this book entertaining? Yes. But it raises a disturbing question about ourselves that this should become a Classic (think gawkers at a terrible car wreck). The story does conclude by throwing a contrived happy ending as one might throw a bone to a starving dog. (November 2012: I gave this two stars? One was too many. What was I thinking?)"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"After reading Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte, I was looking forward to reading this work of her sister's. I was mortally disappointed. It was like an extremely bad soap opera, with pointless obsessions and passions ruling the lives of the characters with an iron grip. With pathetic, dying lovers, doom, and desperation, it has no redeeming virtues."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I'm sorry but I just did not like this book. It feels sloppily written at times and sometimes I wonder if she wrote the book just to compete with her sister (hey you never know). The only thing that I can compliment this book on is it's character development, by the end of the book (if you can stand to read the whole thing) you feel like you know them personally."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Rants and raves for Wuthering Heights. A story of the past but applies to today's reality. A story of twisted love, passion, jealousy and loosing a loved one.I truly enjoyed reading this novel. In my eyes it was a master piece written in the past. Unlike today's novels this book holds imagery close. You really feel like you're in the story. Not only are you reading but it's like you become a character, watching from the side lines. Just a master piece written by Emily Bronte, a story that will bring event back into reading a novel.A dark and twisted love story, that isn't what most people want to read, but once you get a few chapters in your stuck; you want to know what's going to happen next. Where this love triangle and twisted story is about to go.I'm afraid to say the some of the chapters didn't make since, the twisted, dark, beginning is alittle hard to follow. But if you get past that and really read what this book is about you will find an adventure you never expected to find.I give 4 out of 5 stars. This book is close to being an all time favorite. Not quiet there yet. But close. I recommend reading this book; it's a book to read on a rainy day. Something i will never forget."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Wuthering Heights was perhaps the first book that i read which made me cry, laugh and allowed me to become more attached to characters than any other book i had read. When i read it, i knew it was going to be one of my favourite books for life.Emily Bronte's tale of incest, death, insantiy and fate never seems to grow old whilst leaving a testement to the past at the same time. Without a doubt, Wuthering Heights also contains one of the most powerful and potent settings of any book. The book's narrative is divided into two stories- the first of Cathy and Heathcliff and the second of Catherine and Hareton. Which did i prefer? Heathcliff as the hero, but i couldn't not love him as the villain too.Perhaps the main reason i adore this book so much is the obscure complexity of Heathcliff and Cathy and the undying list of themes that seem to grow in number everytime one picks up the book. Any author who succeeds in forcing the reader to like the bad and hate the good has done an amiable task and Emily Bronte does that to the fullest degree. Let's not forget the brilliant insults either. A fabulous read for anyone old enough to appreciate greatness."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Heathcliff is an orphan, adopted by the Earnshaws, where he falls madly in love with their daughter, Catherine. But Catherine denies her true love for Heathcliff, instead marrying Edgar Linton for his wealth, education and good looks. In denying herself Heathcliff, Catherine falls to madness and death, and Heathcliff's terrible vengeance ruins not only her, but everyone Heathcliff has ever associated with.The truth is this is a really well crafted novel. Many are put off by the dark and brooding themes. Also the word choice and frequent switch of narrators can be confusing. But you have to give the book time. Emily Bronte's word use is masterful, giving the characters great scope and the setting an eerie vividness. The revelations are shocking, but also very gripping. It's a love story that goes tragically wrong for the characters, and it leaves a real imprint on you when you finish it. If your into tragic love stories, it is a classic, so you should consider it. And don't worry, the ending isn't THAT tragic."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Wuthering Heights is not just about love. It is about hatred, delusion, despair. Most of all, it is about vengeance. A spiteful, remorseless and hopeless vengeance exacted for a lost and mourned love. It is indeed a dark, bitter novel which makes you feel angry and woeful. And yet amongst this blind darkness of feelings there's something more than mere despondency: there's faithfulness to a love that is able to survive beyond any parting, even in death."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This classic by Emily Bronte is a must read. The language is archaic, but the story is so compelling I just rushed through the book with no problems.The story is about the passionate love between mismatched Catherine and Heathcliff. Catherine is beautiful and refined, but underneath the ladylike exterior, she shares the same wild and free spirit as her soulmate. Heathcliff is one of the most complex characters of literature. You either love him or you hate him. Indeed, most of the characters in Wuthering Heights are complex - not all good, not all bad. This complexity in a novel published in 1847 was far ahead of its time.The setting of the lonely moors of England and the fine country mansions make the story easy to visualize. The tale is told from the first person point of view of Nelly, the maid who saw it all, and a young boarder who seeks to live with now-older Heathcliff in Heathcliff's dark and imposing estate called Wuthering Heights.The story is epic because it does not stop with Heathcliff and Catherine. It continues with Heathcliff's son and Catherine's daughter. The consuming yet doomed love of Heathcliff and Catherine has tragic repercussions for their descendants. Wuthering Heights is a study of the haunting, eternal power of love. Emily Bronte's story reminds us that sometimes love is not always beautiful and sweet. It can also be selfish and twisted."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This novel was some what ridiculous. The main characters were childish and I actually ended up liking the neighbors better - which I think was the objective. The ending was the only part that I actually enjoyed - don't worry, I won't give it away. I'll just say that it is a relief from the chaos apparent through out the novel. The mood uf the entire novel is dark and despondent...it was just too gloomy for me. I read it first when I was 17 - after reading so many other well written classics by great authors - I have to say that this one does not compare."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Wuthering Heights is a supremely compelling novel displaying the best and the worst of our own human nature. It most certainly is worthy of all the praise it has received, and I can say it was one of the most enjoyable books I have ever read. After enduring the first one or two chapters- which are incredibly droll- one is immersed into a world of the most elliquent emotions, and the deepest ties between the charecters. Within the first few chapters you begin to spot the eternal, everlasting love between the two main chareters Heathcliff and Catherine. Unfortunatly the family rivalry between Hindley(Catherines brother)and Heathcliff soon make it clear their undying love cannot be fullfilled due to the fact that before Heathcliff was adopted into the family he was a gutter waif,or one may say a vagabond. Then Catherine marries, which forces all the residences of their little world to be flung unto a world of deception, cruelty, spite, and revenge.I would say that after reading this book one really has to view humanity and love in a different light. For me it really exposed the deep emotions that are never in black and white and that one must really be introduced to before they can truly begin to know what feelings are about. Probably the best part of this book, or at least for me, is the way Bronte makes the reader feel what the charecters feel and how gradually she gives one the understanding of the conflicts between the chareters. Bronte also prestents her book in such a way that after a while you really feel you are in the room whatching the events unfold, which gives the reader the oppertunity to care about the novel. Somehow, I cannot beleve I thought I was not going to like this book when I first began reading it, but now I'm sure it will remain a classic for millenia to come."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Wuthering Heights was our newest assingest reading in my language arts class. I have to be honest I almost quit the course just looking at how difficult it seemed. I had never read classic literature before and it was something new, that looked way too difficult for me. Now that I have finished reading the book, I completely understand where all the stories I love to read came from. They take the basic story line from classics such as this one, and make it simpler. However, I honestly enjoyed the challenge of coming to understand this book. I have also struck a new passion for classic literature.Emily Bronte had a magnificiant way of finding different twists to be put all over. For instance, the book starts off at the ending and does a flashback of the beginning of the novel. Her ways of connecting things make this book so you can't skip a beat or you'll be forced to go reread it. Each chapter is jam packed with details. Even ones you think insignificant have ways of tieing in later on.The true story begins a love/hate good/evil battle. It's a lesson in life and teaches you about what certain peoples values truly were. For Catherine (a main character in the story) as much as she loved Heathcliff (a servant boy who was found on the streets of London and adopted into the Earnshaw family) her decision to marry was not followed by her heart, but by what her social status would become. She ends up marrying Edgar( a wealthy man who lived down the road from Wuthering Heights in a place called Thrushcross Grange) and not knowingly sparks Heathcliff's revenge which is the story line continued through the very end of the story.To love Heathcliff is to hate Heathcliff and visa versa. He plays almost the biggest role since he is one of the only characters who is known throughout the whole book. You first meet him as a grumpy old man whom Linton( one of the narrators) is leasing Wuhtering Heights from. As the new narrator, Nelly Dean( another servant girl who had a long past with the Earnshaw family) tells of what hardships he really had to go trough. Heathcliff was an adopted orphan and he was brought into a father who loved him, a sister who really showed no care at the time ( but who would fall madly in love with him in the end) and a brother who showed nothing but hatred towards him until his dying day. Mr. Earnshaw was very partial to Heathcliff to I think that struck the hatred from Hindley ( the brother). Throughout the late Catherines life, it was a constant battle between love and money. Although Catherine marries Edgar and Heathcliff does end up with Isabella ( Edgars younger sister), their love only grows stronger. And it continues even after Catherine dies and has her daugheter, young Cathy.Both volumes of this book are so much alike. It is almost the same story just with the heirs of the deceased living it. Cathy ( late Catherine's daughter) also is in love with two men.( Hareton- son of Catherine and Edgar, and Linton- son of Isabella and Heathcliff. Although Cathy's first husband( Linton ) does die shortly after their marriage and she gets to marry Hareton too, the similarities between Cathy and her mother are so significant.As the novel comes to an end Cathy and Hareton move back to Wuthering Heights. It is very debateable on wether or not this is truly a happy ending ( becuase so much has happened before it). I think it is because I think it is finally bringing the two different worlds together as one.I loved this book and enjoyed how well Bronte brought everything together. I have found a new love for classics and am finding myself enjoying more from that time period now more than anything else. All because I didn't give up on this one book...I encourage everyone who reads this to continue reading the book. It gets hard (believe me I know) but if I understood it anyone can!--d*"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Wuthering Heights is on of the greatest classics in literature and one I had never read until recently. I found this story of obsessive and destructive relationships very compelling and difficult to put down. It's a romance but by no means is it a happy one. Things don't go well for these people.Wuthering Heights is the story of two families the Earnshaws and Lintons, who really should never had gotten together. It's the romance between Heathcliff and Catherine that underlies the whole book. Heathcliff is defiantly the ultimate anti-hero, he's obsessive, abusive and just plain evil, but still you feel yourself drawn into his dark world and hoping that redemption comes to him. He seems beyond it however and his destructive behaviour forms the basis of this gothic tale.Emily Bronte's skills as a writer are amazing, her language is poetic and deep and the story is truly unique. My only criticism is concerning the way she wrote dialogue for the character Joseph, it's often illegible and I found it most difficult understanding what he was saying. That aside I really enjoyed this book and recommend it wholeheartedly as a study of human nature as it is without the influence of a Divine being.Thanks for reading my review and enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"At first, I griped and complained about having to read this book. My aunt practically shoved it into my hands and told me that I was to read this book and like it! Well, I read it, and I don't like it at all...I absolutely LOVE it! I'm really into romance and this one hits home.Emily Bronte died one year before its publication in 1847 and is perhaps one of the most powerfully written books in the English language. I was first 13 when I read this book and it took me three more times for me to understand what the heck Joseph was saying! .... learned in this type of speech, it's really an understanding book.Just the undying love between Heathcliff and Catherine alone is enough to put anyone in tears. And how Heathcliff is so masculine, yet so insecure and rude. How did Emily Bronte come up with this passion and this knowlegde, when she seldom left her house? You can't help but fall into sync with one or more of the characters. Tragically, yet beautifully written.This book is truly a classic, you'll never want to put it down! Get it!!!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I call this the worst book ever, but that's largely an assumption on my part. Perhaps an extrapolation. I have not read all of the books ever written. But this book is horrid.If you are a tween girl, this might be a good book for you, though. If your dream fella is one of those dark and broody types, the kind that seems mysterious but turns out to be just a basic kind of jerk. It's a shame that some people find this book romantic. The dark, disturbed guy in this book is called Garfield and he's a lousy person.If you like this time period for fiction, you should try Anne Bronte. She wrote two fantastic books. But avoid Charlotte Bronte. She, too, is a terrible writer.Full disclosure: I do not know Emily Bronte, nor would I care to."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"The story about a low class guy (Heathcliff) in love with a rich upper class girl (Catherine) is a classic theme. I could deal with that because it reminded me of a movie. but, after Catherine dies because of giving birth the book just looses interest. It is obvious that Heathcliff is a Psycho! he does so many bad things that you go from feeling bad for him for not ending up with Catherine, to hating his guts and wanting him to die. There really is no protagonist in the story to take on the antagonist of Heathcliff because there is no way that he is the antagonist. There are much better books in British Literature that I would have rather read in high school than this one. Overall it was a very dissapointing book. I was expecting to read a real classic but I was dissapointed."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I love the classics as much as anyone but I really can't get into a novel that makes me hate the main characters. Catherine is a petulant, spoiled ***** and I never wanted to lay into anyone as bad as I did Heathcliff. He is a deranged psychopath, and there is nothing remotely 'romantic' about his character. I'm not sure why the novel caught on the way it did, it was 300 pages documenting spoiled, self absorbed people and their unrelenting quest to destory any trace of happiness around them. Not my idea of a good read, but it was worth it to get to the end just to see his ass DIE. Good riddance!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I am reading Wuthering heights in preparation for and AP English course, and am finding it to be the most tedious book I have ever read. I used to think that Hemingway's Old Man and the Sea dragged, but i was sadly mistaken. This book is a drawn out and dreary affair.

I would never reccomend this book to another living person, but maybe I'm just and &quot;immature&quot; reader."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Hi there, it's me again with another 'Classic'. You probably don't know I recently made a resolution to read some of the 'Classics'. I had avoided them successfully for decades and then decided that perhaps I was missing out on some really great stories. So, I carefully selected some novels that sounded like great 'Classics' to read. 'Wuthering Heights', 'Pride and Prejudice' and 'Jane Eyre' rose to the top of the list.They all sounded like fabulous stories, everyone raves about them, the book jackets make them sound like the absolute be all end all for engaging fiction. And maybe they are for the vast majority of people, but not me. Jane Eyre being the exception of the three.I did LOVE 'Jane Eyre', love, love, loved it. However my strong feeling for both 'Pride and Prejudice' and 'Wuthering Heights' swing dramatically in the complete opposite direction.I really strongly disliked (okay, I hated) almost everything about Wuthering Heights. I thought the characters were absolutely horrid and rotten, the only exception being the innocent and unrelated tenant, Mr. Lockwood, who Ellen Dean tells this awful tale to.The relationships were completely dysfunctional, violent, abusive and destructive. I can not comprehend how this came to be called \\"one of the most romantic novels of all time\\". I have no idea who said that but in my opinion whoever it was should have their head examined. If this is what people call romantic it is no wonder that 1 in 2 of all marriages fail.Perhaps, I have some sort of completely unrealistic expectations when it comes to the classics and my expectations set me up for failure...? Perhaps. But I am going to stop searching out any more 'Classics' for the time being.One more hostile note that some of you will appreciate. I swear I wanted to cudgel the servant Joseph who spoke in a northern dialect and could only be understood by reading the notes to the text in the back of the book.I would have to place this book at the top of a list for 'Most Likely to Create Hatred of English Literature'."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"If you don't know anything about Emily Bronte or you don't like her style of literature, then I would warn you to stay away from this and look up one of the many other classics like &quot;Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;. Here's why:Confusing -- Several characters all share the same/similar names which sometimes makes it confusing.Unsympathetic characters -- I felt that Heathcliff was such a total jerk that he didn't deserve any sympathy whatsoever. So that made it hard for me to sympathize with the woman who loved him, which in turn forced me to reject the concept of this being a love story. Even the most vile villans of all time usually exhibit one small redeeming quality. I felt that Healthcliff didn't and thus I didn't care what happened to him or his love interest.Boring -- Nothing good happens.If you like Emily Bronte nothing I say here will change your mind, but if you don't or are reluctant, then stay away from this one."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I am torn on this one but mostly negative. The language and the story were both excellent (though the Yorkshire lines were tough at times) but all but one of the characters were annoying to the point of distraction and the book was not well edited for length. She could have told this story with the same impact, had she dropped scenes and words.She has a gift for darkness and moodiness though, and the book, in general is a bit of an elaborate Victorian ghost story. The opening scenes and set up of the novel is quite masterful but the story rambles and everyone and everything seems just a bit watery by the end of it.Trivia: This book ranks pretty high on the \\"books in which characters catch a chill from wet feet and die\\" list.

I still appreciate Jane Eyre a lot, but I think you can compare Emily Bronte only to Dostoyevsky.

This is-without any doubts-one of the greatest books ever written: about love, probably not the way it really exists, but more about the way it should be-fierce, almost insane, unconditional, holy; about life, the way it often is, merciless, disregarding one's true wishes and needs. But all the words I pile up here fade away in comparison with this book. It is a shame that there are so many worthless &quot;romantic fiction&quot; pulp books being published and read, when there is Wuthering Heights to teach you about love, loss and despair."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This book is excellent, but to fully appreciate it, you must be able to understand not only love but passion.

Wuthering Heights is set in a realm where ordinary morals do not apply, where love is transmitted via pain and suffering, a maelstrom of the extraordinary, which lasts for about 40 years, and then is gone. Heathcliff and Cathy must be two of the most unique figures ever created in English literature. Cathy, the spirited and vengeful heroine, who pays for her one fatal mistake with her life. Heathcliff, whose drive for revenge can only be calmed by his love for Cathy. Wuthering Heights is a microcosmos, another universe, so alien and foreign from ours. Its roughness and brutality may confuse us, but beneath the pain is love and tenderness"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Emily Bronte did an excellent job in writing Wuthering Heights. Each character plays an important part in the novel. The way she describes each setting makes you feel like you are really there. Heathcliff, the main character, begins the novel as a young, nice orphan child brought into a family. People treated Heathcliff like a slave when he was younger,but when he gets older he gets revenge on everyone. Catherine, the other main character, is supposed to love Heathcliff according to her, but then marries another man because of money. I think Heathcliff and Catherine should have gotten married. The setting was described beautifully. Emily described the feilds of land that the kinds would play on and the green grass blowing in the breeze. The way she set the mood and the setting the same was great. She descibe how the flowers in front of Wuthering Heights were dead to let you know how bad of man Heathcliff was. Overall it was a very good book, a little hard follow sometimes, but a good book. I enjoyed reading Wuthering Heights."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I did not find this to be a book that I would recommend to others. It was not really my type of book to read. There were two parts that I found of intrest. In the first part of the book I found it kind of funny. When Lockwood came to live on Heathcliffs' property. Lockwood expressed his wanting to be isolated, but he kept talking to Heathcliff. Then Heathcliff interupted Lockwood and said, &quot;I should not allow any one to inconvenience me, if I could hinder it-walk in!&quot; The other part I found it kind of weird. Cathy clams she does not make fun of Heatcliff,but she keeps making rude comments. Cathy says a one point, &quot;I did not mean to laugh at you.&quot; These were the only parts that I found intresting in the book.

It doesn't do much beyond flesh out those relationships over a span of many years.I suppose this book is interesting. It is well written and definitely has characters (although for the life of me, for some reason, keeping their names and identities straight in my mind was a tiring task that I never really fully accomplished, maybe it's just me). I went into this book hoping for more plot, more story of people's lives, with the dysfunctional family elements pervasive if not along the sidelines. That's just not what it is. It's a potential tenant learning about how twisted a family is from the reminiscent eyes of a previous inhabitant. And that is really all the book is.My review here is obviously not paying attention to the book's classic status. Or the fact that it's free and creative commons, written by a woman during a timeframe where as far as I understand, that wasn't common, lest of all to go on to be considered a classic.

I have a view that their tragically unfulfilled love was something that they could have overcome sufficiently by themselves although there were a lot of psychological and social pressures. Those external factors were merely a word 'pressure'. True obstacle was existed in Catherine itself. Even after she married to Edgar, her fluctuations of mind was psychologically abnormal and very egoistic in some point of view. For fulfillment of metaphysical areas, she was always craved the Heathcliff and for materialistic basis she wanted the Edgar. It is a typical ambivalent feeling that we should avoid. In addtion, it is pretty romantic but these excessive histronic characteristics of this prose made me tired partially. Thus, we should not only focus on sad love story affairs but also about implications that truly inculcate matters between human being throughout this long fable."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Emily Brot's \\"Wutheting Heights\\" is a two sided coin. The whole narrative is contructed over doubles and juxtapositions -- with elements arranged into pairs. From the basic conflict of love against hate, the writer brings up the most and lest noble feelings and actions -- always making pairs and putting one against the other.To begin with, the narrative is divided into two distinct poles, each representing a different generation. Structurally speaking, the first part -- the one that includes Catherine, Heathcliff, Isabella, Edgard -- is stronger and more important, while the second segment works as a sort of anticlimax dealing with the love of the second generation --young Catherine, Linton, Hareton. Another double point is that there are two Catharines, being the second one the daughter of the former. They both have many resemblances, physically and psychologically. But the young Catharine is an amalgam of her mother's and father's personality.\\"Wuthering Heights\\" is a generational drama. Two generations have to face the same problems that they parents had. But at the same time, Bront deals with the gap of one generation to another. The same dramas do not have the same conclusion. Time has passed, minds and behavior have changed. In this fashion, the book tackles life as a process that is in constant change.Places are also battling against each other. The main stage for the action is the Wuthering Heights, while the other part of the narrative happens in the Thurshcross Grange. The first, as the name gives away, exploits the wildness, the extremity, the unstoppable love. On the other hand, the Grange represents the social status and the aristocracy. At the same time, they represent Catharine inability to choose between Heathcliff (WU) and Edgard (TG).Despite not being a success when first published in 1847, Brot's \\"Wuthering Heights\\" became a cult with time. Nowadays it is considered one of the most important novels ever written. Not a bad change for a book that received much critics when published and the writer had to use a masculine pen name in order to be considered serious.As Gothic novels go, not only structurally is \\"Wuthering Heights\\" a very brave effort, but also thematically this book defied its genre. Following the gothic tradition of the late XVIII Century, the books has elements like supernatural aspects, moonless nights, valorization of the grotesque. But, despite these strong points, what remains more popular in the book is its characters and their love story, Catherine and Heathcliff.The narrative is told by many different narrators from various sources, like letters, diaries entries etc, therefore there isn't an unbiased narrator. Nelly tells most of the story to Mr. Lockwood. She watched most of events she describes, however she remains as an unreliable narrator, once she injects her own view of the facts and characters. That is why it is so important to read between the lines in this book.Thinking of more contemporary concepts, \\"Wuthering Heights\\" is like yin and yang, dealing with two basic principles of the universe: love and hate -- both inhabiting the same people. Since the novel deals with the human nature, Bront's single novel is timeless and appeals to most readers."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"In addition to the complete text of Wuthering Heights, this volume contains selected poems of Emily Bronte and articles of criticism by such noted authors as E. M Forster and Mark Shorer.

Bronte's wonderful tale of Heathcliff, mainly, is an excellent though provoking novel. It contains everything, and a reader who indulges in any genre of novels will no doubt love this story.This novel takes place on the moors in the late 1700's into 1802 England. Heathcliff is taken in by Mr. Earnshaw, owner of Wuthering Heights. Heathcliff, becomes beloved by Cathrine Earnshaw, but despised by her brother Hindley. Catherine, however falls in love with Edgar Linton, heir to Thrushcross Grange. She denies Heathcliff's proposal, for she claims it to be too much of anm embarassment to marry him and marries Edgar Linton. The novel tells of tells of the characters and their intense fellings toward one another, as time goes on and their childern grow."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Wuthering heights is remarkable. No other book was able to characterize the human behavior in such a way.a love story that shows all sorts of feelings like hatred, revange, friendship...A book that has been well received for so long and in so many places, can make you feel happy, angry and many others along the reading because you can actually see yourself in the character\`s shoes.

The Yorkshire accent could have been better but all in all the story was a turn since quite a few that told me the story is sad. Sad indeed, but it didn't trigger my emotion. A story pleasantly told, it lacks little. The characters are brilliant; they're realistic and very human if not humane.It is a story to remember and a story to remember is a story worth reading."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Though this may be a romance, it isn't one in the Nora Roberts sense of the word (thankfully). Rather, it is a romance in the Shakespearian sense that it is neither comedy nor tragedy. It does have romantic aspects sprinkled throughout, but that is not the most important aspect. Rather, it is a dark, brooding novel that focuses far more on loss, revenge, and the deterioration of the human soul than it does on love or anything else the average person might conceive of as \\"romantic.\\"In many ways, it parallels Milton's Paradise Lost, if in a metaphorical sense. We have Heathcliff as the devil (as he is often referred to throughout) and his fall from grace. We have both Catherines as Eve-type characters in slightly different ways, and as I explain below, it is their choices (often under the infernal influence of Heathcliff) that determine the future of the narrative, much as Eve's choice determines the future of humanity. We even have the loss of paradise toward the end, but with the hope of eventual salvation and a return thereto (i.e., as Paradise Regained is suggested in the last book of Milton's epic).The characters of Wuthering Heights are a generally unlikable bunch of flawed human beings provoking and being provoked by each other. Strikingly realistic for a \\"romantic\\" novel. It is the strong, independent women of the novel who are the foundational characters around which the book revolves. They are the focus of attention, and it is only through them that the male characters are able to accomplish whatever ends they set out to accomplish. In fact, one of the main struggles of the book can be seen as the attempts of the women to remain independent of the male characters' repeated attempts at subjugation and control. Interestingly, it is always the women who end up with the choice as to result will prevail in each battle of this war.In this sense, Wuthering Heights can be seen as a feminist novel, but not as a preaching one. Rather, Bronte seems to strive for the reader to understand the strength and resiliency of her women through their subtle control of the narrative and their resistence to the constant pressure that the male characters exert from attempting to take that power away. One final example of this is through the framing of the narrative itself. Though superficially told by Mr. Lockwood, he is initially relating Ellen Dean's story verbatim through the first half of the book. However, halfway through, he discards Ellen and \\"summarizes\\" the story she told him off-screen. In other words, he attempts to dominate the telling of the narrative as Heathcliff, Edgar, Hareton, and Hindley attempt to dominate the women of the novel at various points. Yet, like all the other dominations throughout the novel, this narrative domination fails as well. Ultimately, Ellen is able to reassert herself as the official storyteller over the last few chapters, but what was the effect of losing her immediate voice for the intermediate period, I'll leave up to you to interpret. I'm still working it out myself."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I have to say it: I did not like the book. I willingly admit that Emily Bronte had heaps of talent and writes beautifully, but I couldn't bring myself to like any character in the book. They all seemed, rude, selfish, and insane to me, and there were very few or no aspects in which I could relate to or sympathize with them. In short, I have nothing against the writer, and her style, but the plot and characters in this story, are in my opinion, overdone and stretched beyond believability."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Wow! I may be only twelve, but this is a wonderfull book! I enjoy reading classics, this one especialy. Despite the author growing up with an excentric father in a house far removed from the rest of humanity, she was able to create a wonderfull book of friendship, love and tragedy."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I don't know what people see in this book. I found it irritating from the start -- all the characters are thoroughly unlikeable. After slogging my way through a quarter of the book, I found I still couldn't care less what happened to these people.The writing is also painfully verbose and florid. For a better story, I would have been willing to cope with it, but here it was just another reason to put the book down and never pick it up again."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I thought I was going give this a bad rating because I hated Heathcliff and Cathy Earnshaw so much that I couldn't bear to read any more, but that's the reason why I gave it high marks! It's been awhile since a novel has brought out such feelings in me! Frankly, Cathy and Heathcliff deserved one another; I hated Cathy because she was so selfish she did not deserve to be loved by anyone with a good heart, like Edgar; I hated Heathcliff because he was such a monster with no heart towards anyone else other than Cathy. I was sick to my stomach the way he punished those around him. I don't know why Heathcliff was so fond of Cathy either. There was nothing about her to love! I loved Missus Dean though. She had the strongest spirit and I found her a refreshing character amidst the madness of all the others. This book was incredibly tragic and even hard to get through because it is such a downer. It's like when you think it couldn't get worse, it does! I didn't give the book 5 stars, however, because I found the ending weak and abrupt. Other than that, a worthwhile read!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I recommend the novel Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte. The plot is clear and simple to understand but it is charged with energy throughout the whole book. When Emily Bronte writes there are no questions as to what she means about scenes that she describes. She does this through her choice of words. She always gives a clear description of places and people. Heathcliff and Catherine are her most passionate characters in this novel. She expresses their love and devotion to each other by their actions through out the whole novel. She does not come out and tell the reader things, she makes them use their imagination and interpret scenes and characters themselves.One of the negative aspects to this novel is the ability to understand the vocabulary. Bronte uses a lot of extensive vocabulary through out the whole novel and this makes some of the sentences and scenes hard to comprehend. This is because Bronte knows exactly what she wants her readers to get or see out of Wuthering Heights.One of the main themes in this novel is love and hate. Catherine is a prime example of this theme. Her feelings for her husband, Edgar, and her feelings toward Heathcliff should be in reverse. Through out the whole novel she loves Heathcliff. The hate comes into play because Heathcliff hates Edgar because he with Catherine and he is not with Catherine. He hates anyone that tries to come in between him and Catherine.The characterization of the characters by Bronte was very excellent. She lets the reader know certain characteristics of the characters by scenes and background information. She demonstrates certain connections between different sets of characters very well. For example the scene when Heathcliff and Catherine went to see the two Linton children it compares both sets to each other.Overall this book is interesting and has many different themes and interesting topics. I recommend this book to anyone that enjoys reading and likes different characters and plots. Although the vocabulary at times is hard to understand it can be dealt with."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Of all the things committed to paper, why on Earth was it this? Having been forced to read this tripe under penalty of death in high school, and then once again in college, I must say that death is welcome. Oh poor poo-poo Heathcliff the Brooding and Catherine the ill fated strumpet. Yawn. Emily Bronte lived one of those lives like that of the other Emily, you know, Dickenson, who is another pile of rubbish altogether. Lonely days and cold nights with her father, and no hot little encounters with a horny gardener from Spain. All Emily Bronte needed was a good tango, but I fear that she was too chaste. And so the world must bear the weight of this tragedy, of its endless reprints which will mark the end of Time. Of course you can love this book and curl up with it at night as if it were your secret lover, or teddy bear, (Even if your teddy bear is your secret lover.) and listen to that song by Michael Penn, or whoever wrote that piece of yack. I don't care. I believe that this book sucks, and it is not worthy of being in the Canon.

It is undoubtedly the single worst piece of literature I have ever had to read. What is worse that I had to read it twice, take notes, answer questions, memorize quotes, and in 9 days am sitting an exam in which it will feature rather heavily. You cannot truly hate a book until you have studied it in detail. The problem with it is the fact that about half the words in the book are adjectives. E. Bronte spends so long lavishing useless and totally superfluous descriptions on every scene that I dozed off and missed any point that the events may have had. Then there is Heathcliff, who actually does very little, but merely has circumstances favour him about a dozen times - and he's supposed to be one of the most evil characters ever? The rest of the characters are not much better - they are flat and predictable, although I can't imagine why anyone would be interested enough to wonder about what's going to happen. By the end, I was wondering if I'd fallen asleep and missed the climax - which would have been possible - but I could account for every excruciating page and therefore I can only conclude that the trivial, unsurprising non-events that the narrative lurched between were supposed to be climactic. If this is a classic story, then so is an eight-page picture book that's only strength is very detailed - but not well-drawn - pictures.

Since then I have read literally thousands of books. And of them all, &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; is my least favorite. The characters are so unpleasant and cruel to each other that reading the book is a seemingly endless nightmare. It seems that almost everyone in the story eventually dies some physically or psychologically horrible death, and the two major characters other than the two first-person narrators get engaged to each other at the end in an attempt to give the book a bizarre happy ending. About the only good thing about the book is its intriguing narrative structure, in which a man sets down in his diary a long first-person narrative told him by a woman who sometimes repeats briefer stories told her in the first person by others, such as Catharine. Even this, though, is rendered irritating by the fact that the diarist is such an boring and annoying character. I would never have continued reading this book beyond the first few chapters had it not been a school assignment, and I felt a greater sense of relief when I finished it than on any other occasion in my life.

It wasn't the best book that I've ever read, but it was okay. I thought that the story was very dramatic, and tragic. I loved the language that is used throughout the book. I would recommend it only if you like drama, and romance.This book follows many stories, of basically 3 families. This story gets really complicated. It's really hard to explain without spoiling the book. The best way that I can explain, is that a rich girl falls in love with a servant, and is \\"not allowed\\" to be with him, because of the standards of the time, (the late 1700s). The story follows the lives of these two individuals and what happens to them in their lives.Like I said before, this was an interesting plot.

It's a good classic, and although it's tragic, there are glimpses of happiness here and there in the novel, and the novel ends on a peaceful, concluding note.However, the Yorkshire accent nearly killed me... it was hard to read--I skipped the Yorkshire dialogues almost completely. Also I felt like strangling Cathy and Heathcliff... it was all perfect, but then she had to go do her thing... Yes, I know this was the whole point of the story--conflict--but still, it could have been happier.

The beginning has random names coming at you, but once you get to Nelly laying out the story--I was hooked.I loved this passion and heartbreaking love story.

Their passion is so burning, yet so forbidden that you want to burst.Heathcliff is the best romantic hero of all literature. You just want him to succeed in his good or evil deeds.I think EVERYONE wants a love as strong as Catherine and Heathcliff's. A must read!If you love the book, the best movie version is the 1939 one.I don't get the people who didn't like this book--what were the words too big?But all in all, there is a reason why Wuthering Heights is called one of the greatest love stories and pieces of literature of our time!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Wuthering Heights is a book filled with many complex characters, ranging from a self-righteous servant, to a dishonest housekeeper, to a saucy young lady, to a bitter old man. Emily Bronte did an excellent job of creating interesting characters and a riveting plotline. The book starts out in the \\"present\\" which is in the early 1800's. A couple chapters in, Mr. Lockwood, the tenant at Thrushcross Grange asks his housekeeper what the deal is with his landlord, Mr. Heathcliff, and the others that Lockwood has met at Wuthering Heights. His housekeeper, Nelly, proceeds to relate the story of all that took place, going back three generations in time to begin the story. The book is filled with characters that you both like and hate at the same time, and the story is also an interesting study in betrayal, revenge, and forgiveness. The only negative comment I have about the book comes about the character Joseph. Joseph's speech is written in the dialect of the hills area of 19th century England, and is extremely difficult to read or understand. Many times, you as the reader will be able to infer from the surrounding text the general idea of what is being said, but it is often difficult. Overall, I think Wuthering Heights is an excellent book, and definitely worth a buy!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Wuthering Heights is a tale of romance, bitterness, and forgiveness. It is a story that will leaving you feeling sorry for some characters and even bitter towards others. The beginning of the story introduces Heathcliff, a young boy who has had a hard childhood and been left alone. Bront leads you to feel sorry for him. Much of the book is the story of Heathcliff's life, and how it plays into the lives of the other characters. I see through Heathcliff's life a life lesson: through our difficulties in life, we have two choices. We can let these things make us stronger people, or we can let the troubles ruin us. Let's just say that Bront doesn't choose the \\"storybook\\" path for Heathcliff's life.This novel is one I would recommend reading. On this note, don't get discouraged reading the first few chapters--they were the most difficult of the book. Once you get past these, and begin to understand the story line, Wuthering Heights is an enjoyable book. If you don't like a typical romance, read this book anyway! There's nothing typical about it. Bront filled her pages with anger, passion, romance, and various emotions.

Three generations of characters are portrayed, each having a distinct personality and story. The main character, Heathcliff's situation and position as a young child causes the reader to have sympathy. It may even leave the person with a sense of grief and sorrow for the child who seems to be the victim of the plot. Don't be fooled! Heathcliff deserves not to be seen as a victim but rather a villain for the agony, grieve, and heartache that he inflicts on so many lives. The novel picks up rather slowly and takes a number of chapters before the reader is best able to understand the major characters. The plot twists and turns and is filled with enticing details to keep the reader engaged.I would highly encourage reading this only work by Emily Bronte. While this book will cause the reader to feel a mixture of emotions it is definitely a must read. Determine for yourself whether you feel sympathy for Heathcliff or you think he is the heinous villain who causes the unease and chaos found in almost every chapter. This work left me cringing at many of the terrible details but all and all it is a tremendous piece of literature."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Wuthering Heights is a book about love and forgiveness. Emily Bronte keeps our attention through the passion of the main characters and powerful quotes such as, \\"My greatest thought in living is Heathcliff. If all else perished, and HE remained, I should still continue to be.....Nelly, I AM Heathcliff! He's always, always in mind: not as a pleasure......but as my own being.\\"Bronte's book starts out kind of slow, but as you continue reading through, the story picks up and captures your attention. The dynamic of the characters and their relationships with one another brings such enthusiasm to the story that as you read through, you find yourself becoming a part of the story- you find yourself wanting to tell Nelly Dean to speak up and stop withholding information and you want talk to Catherine and tell her to give Heathcliff a chance and you want to tell Heathcliff that he needs to forgive so many people in his life so that he can have a chance at a real and peaceful life! Bronte does an excellent job bringing her characters to life.The story also has an element of surprise woven throughout- which keeps you coming back to continue reading through each chapter. Bronte goes through three generations of this particular family in a way that is captivating and exciting. As the story unfolds you get to see how each character is related to the other while discovering why they are like they are- you realize why Heathcliff is so bitter and why Hareton is so under-educated and why young Catherine is living with her father-in-law and cousins.The ending is not as satisfying as the rest of the book, but it does end in a uniquely mysterious way.http://www.amazon.com/review/create-review?ie=UTF8&nodeID;="},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"The first time I heard of Wuthering Heights, was honestly when I was reading one of the Twilight series novels and the main character was reading it. So, I was glad to have the opportunity to read this and see what it was all about. After finishing it, I still would recommend reading this book. It is truly an interesting love story. Now, even though it is a love story, I bet you have not read about this kind of love. It is a tragic and dark story of a passionate and consuming devotion. Emily Bronte had the ability to intertwine the love between Catherine and Heathcliff in every scene and relationship the characters shared. Bronte uses great description of her characters as the narrator, Nelly, tells the of the lives at Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange. What you should know before you read this, is that some of the language of the servants is hard to understand. However, try to push through it and you will be able to get a rough understanding of what the character was trying to say. Besides this, Wuthering Heights will keep you entertained and wondering who's love is true and how the novel concludes."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Wuthering Heights by Emily BronteI wasn't sure exactly what to expect when I picked up Wuthering Heights to read from my one college course, but I was, over time, pleasantly surprised. The first five chapters proved, for me, to be the most challenging, simply because I was adapting to Bronte's writing style. Honestly, if you frequently read literature from this time period then you will have no problem settling in. It took no time to realize that Emily paid close to attention to the development of her characters. After finishing the book I felt extremely acquainted with each character, and felt almost a loss when I had to say goodbye. One of the things I struggled with was Joseph's dialogue throughout the book. He was hard to follow, and I can't help but say that it almost distracted from the plot in comparison to enhancing it. Bronte told one of the strangest love stories in relation to how each individual expressed their affections. It's a story that leaves the reader at times a little bit baffled at the outcome, but it also creates unprecedented twist in turns throughout the book. It's also a book that I believe has a huge amount to say about forgiveness, and can shed light on its importance through learning from others who make poor decisions. To be honest, there are very few books that transport you directly into the world of the writer like Wuthering Heights."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I would definitely classify Wuthering Heights as one of the best books I've read. Packed with drama and intrigue, this piece of art will keep you riveted throughout. Written in old English, it is absolutely fascinating how Emily Bronte pieced this intricate storyline together. Besides the slight difficulty in visualizing Joseph's speech, with a strong Yorkshire accent, I found it relatively easy to read. The chaos and insanity that pursues throughout this novel kept me coming back for more, with sadness when I reached the end because it was over. The characters are developed well through different circumstances, depicted through the eyes of the housekeeper, Nelly Dean - a conniving participant in the drama. Be prepared to have your emotions run away with you as you get caught up in the action. It's a great book to sit down and sift through on a cold, winter's day. I found the story very realistic in the portrayal of everyday choices made through these diverse, strange characters, and could even relate to them in some senses. This controversial book would be a great choice to use in a book club where you would have the opportunity to discuss the outcomes and potentials Bronte confronts."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Passion for the passionless: A battle of the hearts!Emily Bronte, though only in her 20's, manifested one of the most unforgettable dark love stories of all times. Though her book was not well received after it was first published, the volume and the positive feedback she has received hundreds of years later speaks in volumes for the masterful quality of Wuthering Heights! Standing in stark contrast with a fairy tale love story, Bronte embarked on a difficult quest of being realist lessons and qualities into the passion she was skillfully gifted with.Bronte developed and heighted this sensational love story through numerous characters in the story and throughout three generations. Such love unfolds with a girl named Catherine, raised in the moors of England, and a gypsy boy named Heathcliff, a homeless starving boy that was saved from death by Catherine's father. Through the years, their affection for one another turns into a wild passion that will stand through the tests and the trials they create. At the ages of 16 and 17 years old, a misunderstanding occurred between the two lovers and created a permanent wedge between them forever. Heathcliff had disappeared for three years and Catherine had married a passionless man, Edgar Linton. Tension picks back up when Heathcliff suddenly reappears on Catherine's doorstep, eager to rekindle the passion that he is so determined that they both shared. From this encounter, Catherine's heath declines and she later dies, but the last kiss she bears is Heathcliff's. Through her death comes life, as Catherine's last contribution to this world was a daughter named Cathy. During this time a young boy, Linton, was born to the wife of the miserable Heathcliff. After Catherine's death, Heathcliff becomes more revengeful and manipulating than ever. Though his aching from his heart adds fuel to his actions, Heathcliff soon masters in manipulating young Cathy to marry a sickly Linton when they get around the ages of 16 and 17. Though one can see the parallels in linking this relationship to the first, one also sees the difference of a selfless love that goes deeper than just emotions.As you read this novel, you will encounter many of the symbolic and realistic themes that are embedded throughout this novel. The forgiveness theme from this novel has impacted my life, for one can see that the revenge, bitterness, and hurt that Heathcliff lived under this whole life only put him in his grave faster and did not allow him to produce anything successful or hopeful. In addition, one can see a glimpse of what true love looks like. True love is not an emotion, an appearance, or even an action. It a selfless love that penetrates one's soul, like that of young Cathy and Hareton walking in the moors that looks beyond the faults and seeks to better the other person involved. As a fellow Christian, this love reminds me to that of the Biblical love in a marriage that we are too represent. Though I liked majority of the book, I disliked how Bronte used the old dialect for Joseph. I would highly encourage readers of this amazing book to get a published form that will have side notes at the bottom revealing what Joseph is talking about. I found that he didn't have a huge role in the book except for stability, but he does make some key statements that I felt the dialect lessened the importance of their intended impact. I would encourage anyone who is interested in this book to buy a copy and read it! It truly is a classic on every level. It gives a whole new light into the human depths of a romantic tragedy."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Wuthering Heights is the name of the house where the love story between Heathcliff and Catherine takes place.

I have read it countless times. It is ingrained in me now as part of my own personal myth. I carry Heathcliff and Cathy inside like some people carry The Virgin Mary or Allah inside of them. I read it when I was young because I had to for class and hated it, then years later, I was about eighteen and read it again, and this time Cathy and Heathcliff blew through me and knocked me down as surely as if I were a Linton. Years later it still exerts its strange force over me. People are right, it is not a 'nice' book: its emotional terrain is pitted with violence and terror, brutality and abuse. Wuthering Heights isn't about star-crossed love or the endurance of love over death, Emily Bronte was not concerned with such trivialities. It is about what happens to a person who feels intensely, about how a person who endures such intensity of feeling survives. Heathcliff and Cathy respresent two sides of one thing that Bronte was trying to tell us about. She tells us in such a way that we come back to her only novel time and time again to seek the meaning. Not to be confused with 'Jane Eyre'. Jane Eyre is the tale of an insipid who finally gets her man (big deal) despite puritannical hardship, and though its crie de coeur touches the heart, it never sets it alight. If however, you are interested in being burned, and if some teacher isn't force-feeding you this text, Wuthering Heights might just be the book for you."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"This book was a little boring at first.

I remember at the time being captivated by the star-crossed lovers Heathcliff and Catherine. I decided recently to reread the story because it had been so long and I had forgotten what had drawn me to it.If this had been my first time reading the story, I would probably give it no more than 2 stars. It is definitely a mood piece. As an angst-filled teen, I can understand my former attraction to brooding characters and missed opportunities. As an adult, with much less angst, I have grown to pity the characters I once held in admiration. To say it plainly, Heathcliff is a d*ck. He was so hell bent on his own vision of revenge that he not only wastes his own life, but ruins the lives of others. The bad boy I was so attracted to 20 years ago is in actuality a loser. So is the story of the teenage girl.I have given this book 4 stars due to sentimentality. If you're looking for a happy ending fairy tale, this is not the book for you. If you're 15 years old with a chip on your shoulder, then this will probably become your favorite classic of all time."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Gotta love this classics.

These hoary old classics such as WH or JANE EYRE or Thomas Hardy's output or Dickens along with hundreds of others have withstood the test of time for a reason, and although they may not be to everyone's taste, they won't need any help from me to keep their place on bookshelves. My problem has always been one of 'familiarity with a book's cover breeds contempt'. I've seen copies of WUTHERING HEIGHTS for about as long as I've been able to read; I've seen it so often there comes a point where I convince myself that I already know what the novel is, since I know (from dust jacket material) what it's _about_.WUTHERING HEIGHTS also suffers from the image of its film adaptations (none of which I've seen). Still, it's hard to have lived anywhere but under a rock and not have seen at least snatches of Merle Oberon and Laurence Olivier in the 1939 film, or any of the more recent remakes. Those glimpses have always made me consider WUTHERING HEIGHTS as a ghostly gothic romance, although it is really nothing of the sort. Instead it is a wildly fierce tale of obsession and revenge, implacably engineered by the monstrous Heathcliff, who seems more a force of nature than simply a human. And yet, the revenge motif - while guiding the bulk of the tale - is in itself only part of what constitutes the power in the novel. The mix of primal emotions and the veneer of civiliation together standing out in stark relief agains the unearthly backdrop of the moors suggests mythic archetypes in the mold of Tristan and Isolde. To think that this novel came from the mind of a twenty-nine-year-old 'reclusive spinster in a rural Yorkshire parsonage' (from Diane Johnson's introduction), is at once baffling and intimidating.For those readers who may have looked at this book over the years and passed by from a mistaken idea - as I did - that you already knew the contents, I would highly recommend taking a few days to actually crack the covers. While it isn't a perfect book, there's no question of its forcefulness, and even if it doesn't exactly strike your fancy, you'll know for sure why it is that you've avoided it. For other, younger readers, I would also recommend it as an excellent addition to your reading list. In my few years of reading, I don't think I've read anything quite like it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Who knew the classics could be so entertaining! I enjoyed the warring families, showing not all the old times as wonderful."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Wuthering Heights is a love story, driven by an undying love. The two main characters, Heathcliff and Catherine, are in love with each other; not in an earthly form but rather there souls are united as one. Heathcliff loves Catherine not for her body, her apperance, her money, her status but rather for her soul. He is one with her in a way every soul desires to be understood. In this novel love is shown in forms and extents that are so much of what people in our culture are deprived of it makes for a wonderful read. One often longs for a soul mate to connect with and be loved by for being them and when Heathcliff shows this affection towards Cathy I believe it draws in a person and captures his or her heart.Wuthering Heights isn't just a fantasy though. It isn't a fairy tale everyone knows will never come true. Wuthering Heights is very much now and here. Heathcliff loves Catherine with his heart but she denies this love and tries to suppress her own feelings toward him for she thinks it will receive her scorn from society to which she is right. This is so heart wrenching because it is so much of a reality. Many times we meet our soul mate yet let them slip away because we are to worried about what others will say. Wuthering Heights shows picture and makes you think about when you might have not loved someone only because the culture didn't approve of him or her.Wuthering Heights is a wonderful book because it illustrates a love people yearn for so dearly. If you have the chance to read Wuthering Heights I would definitely say take it because it will speak to your heart."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"The novel Wuthering Heights may sound like another cliche book of love and hate. The general audience would think this book would follow the same romance plot. Man falls in love with woman, woman feels the same, something terrible happens and in the end they solve the problem and live happily ever after.When in all actuality it is about a man whom driven by pure love for hatred on a path of vengece. The man known only as Heathcliff. *Don Don Don!*The novel starts out in an unusual manner of telling the end of the story in the beginning. Surprisingly all the substance plays right in tune with the style of writing. The characters of all very complex and intricate to the point of instanity. The story is all centered around a man who is rejected from society from adoption and is only loved by a one soul. Unbeknownst to his step sister Catherine, Heathcliff has fallen madly in love with her. Heathcliff ,since rejected from society, has developed deep hatred for everyone who maltreated him or loved Catherine.Heathcliff's revenge is so cold and rotten to the point were you want to rip the book apart and burn it. Later on Catherine finally confesses her love to Heathcliff whom after this was overjoyed with passion. Sadly this Catherine,Heathcliff's only true love in life, dies a most unusual death.Heathcliff plans to make Catherines daughter the puppet or weapon if you may to take revenge against Edgar the one who stole Catherine from Heathcliff's reach. To do this he tries to force Catherine's daughter to marry his own son.Although the book is very entertaining I highly suggest this for and audience of some background knowledge of the Victorian era. Another tedious thing of this book is it is not intended to those of an average vocabulary so at often found myself having to grab a dictionary.

Everything about it is bitingly real. Though most of the novel is bent on Heathcliff's revenge, it is more about how far a person would go acting on the powerful love they feel for another. Some might say his character shouldn't exist (absurd! He is more real than the pining Edgar or the dashing men of what I call 'heaving bosom' stories).Cathy, the heroine, who never acts like the typical one, does a typically human thing: she marries a man she has mild feelings for because he's rich and Heathcliff is MIA.But her death scene: all I can say is read it! Haunting.It is a little awkward because we are removed from the story, hearing it from a maid's point of view and the parts about Cathy(Jr. her daughter) and Linton and Hareton are not as moving as Cathy and Heathcliff's destructive love, it's still absolutely amazing! I've read it three times and I still get chills at the end!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I have always considered Wuthering Heights the best offering from the Bronte brood. It may be a soap opera, but WHAT a soap opera--and besides, the writing, dark and Victorian though it is, is superb and more than a little mad.The two most over-used adjectives used to describe this book are \\"dark and brooding.\\" So I won't use them, but it will be hard. Because out of the ashes, almost literally, of a dark, dreary, oppressive estate on the English moors flames the love affair of all time: the daughter of the house, Catherine, and the wild foundling brought into the family as a child--Heathcliff. Catherine and Heathcliff have a special bond, even as children, but when adulthood arrives, their bond flares into unbearable passion.Tortured Heathcliff wandering the moors calling for Cathy; married Cathy dying in her bed for love of Heathcliff; ahhhh. Nothing better. One wonders, of course, what forbidden thoughts churned beneath the genteel breast of Emily Bronte as she wrote of this unmistakeably sexual and erotic relationship. I have also wondered more than once if Heathcliff was modeled on the Bronte Sisters' wild and untameable brother Bramwell. But I am no literary historian. I am only a lover of books, and this particular one resides on my all-time top ten. If you have never read it, or if you consider it one of those dreary required assignments you fled in high school, give it another chance. There is nothing else like it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Why?

The pearl's there for you, waiting for someone to take it out and absorb it forever.It might be a hard reading, but it will move you deeply and make you pound your chest and cry out."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Wuthering Heights is a novel that oozes with romance. It is a story of unbridled love that has no boundaries and no restraints. The love that exists between Catherine and Heathcliff is an all consuming almost maddening love. The way Emily Bronte attacks your senses and emotions is both exicting and devastating. Her style of describing the surroundings and landscape is gothic in style. It is rugged, isolated and atmospheric. It gives you a sense that the Earnshaws and Lockwoods are the only two families in existence. The landscape seems to be a direct reflection of the personalities of the characters. It is a clever way to describe the families in a atypical way. Because of the unusual style of this romance novel, it may be hard to dive into at first, but it will soon capitivate your attention. It is hard to determine who you should hate and who you should pity.Healthcliff is a dark and mysterious man who you absolutely want to love, but every word he speaks and every action he makes drives you to despise him. Catherine whom you want to side with, drives you mad with her selfishness and snobbery. It leaves you with a feeling of desperateness for a happily-ever-after ending, yet a sense it may never happen. Wuthering Heights is a passionate, all consuming pyscho-romance. It made me want to jump into the pages and set things straight. I really enjoyed the use of love and hate and how it is able to bind people together in a circle that never ends. Once a wrong has been committed, it is so hard to break the cycle. Once someone has been hurt it is so hard to forgive and forget. Healthcliff's emotional side had been trampled on at such an early age that his whole life was soon consumed with revenge towards anyone that was involved in the mistreatings. I despertly wanted Catherine or at least someone to break through the shield that Heathcliff had built, but if someone does want to be loved they never will. The saying goes, you must love yourself before you can love someone else and Healthcliff was not able to accomplish this.The combination of love, love lost and love denied makes Wuthering Heights a romance that I fully recommend. It is a mixture of life and death, twists and turns and vengence that would attract all genders and all ages. It leaves you confused and frustrasted in a way that books do not do anymore. It may have you puzzled in the beginning because it does not follow the norm of a modern romance, but by the end you will feel that every romance should have this quality. I feel that everyone should sample the taste of a tragic romance."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I can't recommend Wuthering Heights enough. It tells the story of the doomed love between Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff, a foundling adopted by her father. There is an implication, which not everyone may have picked up on and in never confirmed, that their relationship is inscestuous and that Heathcliff is the illegitimate son of Catherine's father. This idea is based on the fact that it seems highly unlikely that Earnshaw would have picked up a strret child to adopt without some sort of motivation. The gothic genre was also fascinated with strange relations etc and whilst authours would not have been able to look at inscest openly they would have been able to get away with subtle undertones that many people would not pick up on.There is an immense sense of landscape within Wuthering HEights and I feel that the title and setting reflects the unbridled passions of the characters within the novel. Emily Bronte's beautiful descriptions of the rolling countryside reflect her love for her home at Haworth. The plot can be a little confusing because of the way the characters all seem to have the same names (two Cathys, Edgar Linton, Linton Heathcliff, Heathcliff etc) so if you can get hold of a family tree it'll really help you to follow the plot. Like all classics, Wuthering Heights takes a bit of time to get into but keep going and you won't regret it.:)"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"Fresh off of reading &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, I was interested in reading &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; because I had heard it was this great romantic story. Could it surpass &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, I thought? Hmmm... I went in search to find out. Well, after reading &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, I have this to say: If you think that &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; is about lovey-dovey romance, think again. If you are expecting it to be in the likes of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, think again. If you think Heathcliff will be like Mr. Rochester, think again. &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is a novel filled with a fitful, satisfying romance. It is a beautifully written novel, and Mr. Rochester will always be my favorite hero, and Jane, my favorite heroine. &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; is, on the other hand, a complete 180 from &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;. &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; is a disturbing novel filled with disturbing characters. It is a gothic tragedy which is very dark and depressing. Not one single character is likeable, although you hope that Heathcliff turns around at the end and turns good. It is about obsession and it makes you wonder if you can define love. What is love? I did like how the author is completely distanced from the novel, and that a lot of the story is left up to the reader's imagination, but there were times when I was thinking, &quot;What is the point of this novel?&quot;. Yet, at the end, I realized it was a good story-- very spooky and it sucked you into their own world. I think this is a mood-novel. It will make you go into a very dark place, and leave you kind of depressed! I suggest watching the movie adaptation of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, featuring Timothy Dalton as Heathcliff. I know that I actually gained a greater appreciation for the novel after watching this film. Then after that, go read &quot;Villette&quot;!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"A look back into another time and thus another world, but with sentiments that are still relevant in the world of love. The style of writing in this book flows wonderfully to make you feel as though you were being told the story first hand. The representation of love and the spitefulness it can create is powerful an romantic."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I read this book when I was in high school and again when I was a young adult. I purchased this to read it again. That should tell you how much I love this book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"RIVETING PLOT. HARD TO PUT DOWN AND WHEN YOU DO YOU WONDER WHAT WILL BE NEXT SO STRONGLY YOU HAVE TO START READING AGAIN. I LIKE THE THIRD PERSON STORY TELLING FORMAT."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights (Riverside editions)","review":"I found this book quite confusing at first, as you are just thrown into the situation and most of the story is disclosed through a narrative by the housemaid to a new tenant. I'm also just starting to get used to the way people were referred to back in those times. One character can wear many names: Miss Earnshaw, Miss Catherine, Missy, Cathy, Mrs. Linton; makes it appear there are five characters right there instead of just one. Although I did eventually figure out that Cathy was actually Catherine's daughter, but I still have a hard time keeping characters straight in classic books.While I probably wouldn't classify this book as a page turner, when I do set it down, I don't set it down for long. I often can't wait to pick it up and hear more of the story, hoping it will all makes sense eventually. One is told the characters at the present time of the book, the housekeeper starts her story with a completely different situation, and as the story unfolds I cannot help but wonder what could possibly transpire to get the cast of characters where they are \\"today\\".I'm torn between hatred of Heathcliff and pity. Was he heartless because he was a scoundrel or because his heart had been broken to bits?I still find it hard to understand dialogue when it is spelled phonetically based on the character's speech patterns. Mark Twain is also known for doing this. I find it easiest to read these passages aloud and pray my family doesn't think I am nuts. But still I found that I couldn't understand a word that Joseph said. The gist of what I did get from him, he probably wasn't saying anything very nice anyhow. It doesn't seem that he had ever heard the adage \\"if you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all\\". I'd have sacked his sorry butt and sent him packing if I had been lord of the manor.Is it just me or were people more apt to fall ill back then? The housekeeper/narrator had been out in the rain and gotten her feet wet. As a result she was bed ridden for THREE weeks. Jane Bennet, in Pride and Prejudice, was sick for months after getting caught in the rain. One could argue that we have better doctors today, though I'm not sure I would agree, or that they didn't have Nyquil back then. Personally, I often get caught in the rain without need of either a visit to my general quacktitioner or over the counter cold medicines. There were other illnesses where the cause of which seemed strange to me, but I don't want to go into specifics for fear of giving away too much of the book.One thing I found humorous, the main female character compares a situation in her life to a passage in another book which I just finished."}]`),A={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:W},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},S={class:"card-container"},C=["disabled"],P={key:0},L={key:1};function x(s,e,n,c,r,i){const f=y("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",S,[(t(!0),a(m,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(t(),b(f,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",L,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",P,"See more"))],8,C)):p("",!0)])}const M=u(A,[["render",x],["__scopeId","data-v-9f41b710"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/51.md","filePath":"people/51.md"}'),R={name:"people/51.md"},G=Object.assign(R,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(M)]))}});export{j as __pageData,G as default};
