While the book is a pitch perfect allegory about the Soviet Union under Stalin what makes this book so timeless is that it is ultimately about totalitarianism and the corrupting nature of power. The writing itself is brilliant - very simple and straightforward with a compelling plot, yet underneath everything is an insight and intelligence that holds everything together. On top of all that, Animal Farm contains one of the greatest closing paragraphs in the entire canon of English literature. There are small things you could nit-pick about (why is it that the animals suddenly start talking? How does a pig teach itself to read?) but they are irrelevant - Animal Farm is a quick and engaging read, a brilliant allegory, and given the current political climate of the world, it is as timely and as vital as it ever has been. Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Orwell's animal farm was written in 1946 and is still in schools today because it's a classic. I loved reading it in school, and I love it still. It's one of those books that you don't forget. It's simple, but good. The simple tale of communism, and takes place on a farm is a captivating story."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm; a book about abused, overworked farm animals that were set free after they chased their master away from their farm. The animals are now attempting to make the world a better place for them. They live just like we do in the United States; for example, they have a powerful president that sets rules for them, and they get paid (in food) for working in the farm. They attempt to slaughter all the humans that cross their farms, for humans make the world a dreadful place.I strongly recommend the book Animal Farm, because the author does an excellent job of personifying the animals. For example, the animals would rebel against the humans when the humans would attempt to harm them. The animals acted like humans would in this situation, for humans often times settle things by harming each other, not by negotiating. Also, the animals are exceedingly productive and desire to work hard to get their pay. Humans normally work hard in their jobs to get their pay as well as the animals in Animal Farm. Furthermore, the animals have a president to set examples and rules for them. The president plans meetings and gives speeches as well as President George Bush does in the United States.Another thing the author does a superior job at is giving the animals their own, unique personalities; for instance, the animals have certain names relating to their appearance and personality. For example, there is a horse named Boxer who is immense and burly, which is describes his name well. There is also a pig named Napoleon who is an exceptionally powerful leader as Napoleon Bonaparte was in the real world. Also, there are several different animals that frequently cause trouble and rebel to the \\"Seven Commandments\\" while others stay obedient to them. American Humans also break rules and rebel sometimes as well. Such as, there are humans that do drugs and break rules, while others stay obedient to their religion. What's more, some animals work harder than others and the ones that work hard get rewarded. This relates to real life because people who work long hours and have tough jobs normally get a lot of money compared to the people who work once a week at a McDonalds, who don't get paid much at all.In conclusion, I powerfully recommend the book Animal Farm by George Orwell because of his superior job of personifying the farm animals. The animals act exactly like humans would in their shenanigans. The animals also have their own unique personalities which makes the book interesting. I firmly believe this would be a fantastic book for all ages. I will be looking forward to reading this book again in the future and looking again for all of the excellent things the author put in this book."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Read this book and the whole histories of 20th century Soviet Union and China unfold before your eyes.

This starts reigns of power, espionage and murder on the farm called paradise."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"George Orwell had written many stories before he got to Animal farm, addressing a variety of topics. With Animal Farm, he deliberately wrote a story describing Russia's revolution and problems. At the time, during World War II, Russia was an ally of England and he couldn't find *anybody* to publish his book. Finally, he did track down someone willing to do it. The first publishing was 50,000 copies and sold for $1.75 each.As you might imagine, it didn't go over very well. However, as the Cold War progressed, and the Soviet Union became more and more an \\"Evil Empire\\" to the west, the book's popularity skyrocketed. Many copies were sent to Ukraine and other Soviet-controlled areas as a way to \\"help\\" the populace. The book got added to many school required reading lists. I have tried to do research to find if the book became a best seller (over 10 million copies sold) because of the required school reading or because of voluntary pleasure reading ... I can't seem to find anywhere which says one way or the other. My own personal feeling is that it's the school reading that got this onto the best selling list. For example, Orwell's other main book - 1984 (also on many school reading lists) was selling 750,000 copies a year in 1984. That's hefty sales for such a serious book.At only 139 pages, this is one of the shortest books on the top selling list. If you want to understand the \\"meaning\\" of the book, here's a quick synopsis. Old Major (Marx) has a great idea about equality and gets the farm thinking. Soon the animals (people) oust the current bad ruler (Tzar). Two main pigs lead the newly freed animals - Snowball (Trotsky, the idealistic, nice one) and Napoleon (Stalin, the greedy, mean one). Napoleon even has a bunch of cruel dogs (secret police) to keep the animals in line.The book is interesting as a very thinly veiled attack on a political system. It's important to remember it's very biased, of course! It's like reading an anti-Democrat fable written by the Republicans. In Animal Farm, the animals are all *very* stupid. The pigs are explicitly \\"naturally\\" smarter which is why they lead. The rest of the animals (with only specific exceptions) are very stupid. Are they saying that the entire Soviet populace were very stupid? I know many people in that region who would disagree.I suppose the story might not have had the same impact if it was more realistic (still with animals, of course). Just one example - in the real world, Ukrainians fought fiercely against Soviet rule. Stalin inflicted a famine on them, killing millions. Few animals in Animal Farm fight back - they merely mutter occasionally and are quickly silenced. Instead, the book makes a gigantic line between \\"very innocent / dumb\\" (all animals but the pigs) and \\"very evil / smart\\" (the pigs). It's a shame the book couldn't have smart-but-stuck characters as well. I suppose the dumb-but-evil animals would be the dogs, doing the bidding of the pigs. Still, I don't like the portrayal of the pigs as \\"all naturally clever\\". I suppose I've made that clear :)So there's two ways I look at this book. First, during it's \\"peak popularity with regular readers\\" (i.e. the Cold War, the 60s) it was a propaganda tool for the West. You can consider this a \\"really good thing\\" in helping Ukrainians and other subjugated groups get a voice. I suppose you could consider it a \\"interference\\" issue since most Western countries wouldn't be happy if other countries deliberately wrote very biased, cutesy anti-current-policy books and flooded their marketplace with them :)Outside of that very specific selling time period, the longer life of this book has been with school sales. The kids reading the book don't really need to learn \\"Russian history\\" by understanding pigs and sheep reciting messages. Instead, by reading Animal Farm they get a *very* basic, easily understandable example of how symbols work in books. When they tackle advanced books they get very subtle symbols to understand. This is a book to get them started. The dogs act like secret police. The propaganda pig works like a propaganda machine. The book isn't subtle at all, you can see the similarities very clearly. So as a teaching tool, the book works wonderfully. It's relatively entertaining, and it's short.As far as an adult reading this in the post-2000 era, I found it interesting, but its one sidedness shone through. It's a bit like watching Barney the Dinosaur. The message is fine enough, but as a book intended for adults, even in \\"fable form\\", I would have appreciated a bit more meat. Still, there are many aspects of the book which are deeply embedded into current culture, because culture assumes that every child read the book on the way towards adulthood. So from that point of view, it's a book that everyone should read at least once, to understand those references."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"&quot;Animal Farm&quot; by George Orwell was never required reading for me when I was in school, so it took me some time to finally get around to reading it. I found it to be a complete and enjoyable read that had me hooked from the very first sentence. It is an excellent exercise in symbolism and creative imagination. While the book may be a very short read, it brings a whole lot to the table by giving you an interesting take on how history can be reenacted in the most imaginative ways.The animals on Mr. Jones' farm have had enough of what they deem to be slavery. They're tired of being ordered around by humans while they see no benefits in their daily work. This is all sparked by a dream that the boar, Major, had about a unique place where animals called the shots and never had to be ordered around by humans ever again. He tells them a revolution is very much needed. When Major dies, the animals act quickly and are able to overthrow the alcoholic farmer and his thugs from his very own farm. The pigs are in charge now, as they claim that they are much smarter than the others and know how to lead. What seems to be paradise quickly transforms into another form of slavery altogether enforced by propaganda and threats from the pigs. And yet, the animals do not know any better, as they are deceived by the new system that gives them the illusion that they are better off than they were with Mr. Jones calling the shots.The book is greatly inspired by real events that went down during the era of communism in Russia, using animals as the actual people. While it helps to know about that time period, the book is written so well that it is easily understood even if you only know a little about what happened during that time. The use of animals was a very creative way to tell this story, as it gives you a big incentive to actually care for these characters. Had this just been about real people, then it would've just sounded like anything you could find in your history books. Orwell finds a much more interesting way of tackling the topic. He gives life to every one of his characters and they all elicit some kind of a feeling from you. There are times when the book is funny, and then there are times when it is just downright chilling (the last chapter will stay in your head for more than a few hours).George Orwell's &quot;Animal Farm&quot; is a genuine masterpiece that quickly hooks the reader from the very beginning. It's an extremely easy read as well as an enjoyable one--not enjoyable in the sense that this is a &quot;happy tale,&quot; but enjoyable in the sense that you really feel like you're reading something great. If you haven't had the chance to check it out, make sure you add this to your reading list. It is something that should be read by everyone at least once in their life, even if they don't end up enjoying it as much as others. I loved every single word that was written in the extremely creative read. This is an important classic in literature that shouldn't be missed for any reason. -Michael Crane"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"\\"Animal farm\\" is to this day one of the best attempts to criticize a totalitarian regime through the means that literature provides: the power of words. George Orwell (1903- 1950) wanted to help others to realize things that for him were evident, and attempted to do so by writing a fable that can easily be read as a satire of the Russian Revolution. Orwell said in an article that \\"Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for democratic Socialism, as I understand it. It seems to me nonsense, in a period like our own, to think that one can avoid writing of such subjects. It is simply a question of which side one takes and what approach one follows\\".Orwell also pointed out that \\"Animal Farm was the first book in which I tried, with full consciousness of what I was doing, to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole\\". He succeded beyond his wildest expectations, even though at first nobody wanted to publish this work because it was too controversial.The plot of this book is relatively easy to grasp, and I think that is probably one of the reasons why it is so popular. Some animals decide to take over the conduction of a farm, because they believe there is too much injustice, and that they would improve the situation if they had the power to do so. They make a revolution, and end up evicting Mr. Jones, the owner of the farm. From that moment onwards, the farm is called \\"Animal farm\\"...The animals establish seven \\"commandments\\", that they are supposed to obey at all moments in the new \\"Animal farm\\": 1- Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy, 2 - Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend, 3- No animal shall wear clothes, 4 - No animal shall sleep in a bed , 5 -No animal shall drink alcohol, 6 - No animal shall kill another animal , 7- All animals are created equal. At the same time, all commandments can be comprised in a maxim: \\"Four legs good, two legs bad\\".Everything seems all right for sometime, and all the animals work together for the success of the revolution, obeying the commandments and striving for a new order of things. However, after a while the pigs begin to think that being part of the animal revolution is not enough: they want to dominate it. After that first realization things take a quick turn for the worse, and we cease to be in the presence of a \\"wannabe utopical society\\", having instead to be unwilling witnesses to the birth of a new totalitarian society.At that moment, the pigs even change some of the commandments. For example, the fourth commandment turns into \\"No animal shall sleep in a bed with sheets\\", and the sixth commandment says \\"No animal shall kill another animal without cause\\". Now, the commandments can be reduced to \\"Four legs good, two legs better\\". Finally, all the commandments will be replaced with one: \\"All animals are created equal, but some animals are more equal than others\\".All in all, I consider \\"Animal farm\\" extremely interesting, even though it is somewhat sad and pessimistic. The language is clear, and you won't find yourself wondering what the author meant by a phrase, or needing to read a paragraph again. From my point of view, that makes the reading process even more enjoyable.Despite that, I believe that this book will be considerably more appreciated by those with some basic knowledge regarding the Russian Revolution. Only then will the reader be able to take full advantage of what this short fable can offer him, due to the fact that he will realize without too much effort that some of the fictional characters in \\"Animal Farm\\" were inspired by historical characters. For example, Napoleon (one of the pigs) was quite possibly inspired by Stalin, and Snowball (another pig) by Trosky. When you read this book, try to find the characters that represent the proletariat, the Communist Party, the intellectuals, etc... :)On the whole, I regard this book as one of those you just need to read, but that fortunately you can also enjoy. The messages implicit in \\"Animal farm\\" are many, and the questions it makes you pose yourself are even more. But then, what better than a book that makes you THINK ?.Belen Alcat"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"A quite excellent book and the best political satire I have ever read.

I first read it at 12 years of age but couldn't appreciate the author's entire message, not having the requisite knowledge of the Russian Revolution and its aftermath. Reading it again, however, I came to understand and fully appreciate the genius of George Orwell.Animal Farm is a scathing criticism of Communism, or more specifically, the Communist system of the former USSR. Himself a Socialist, Orwell detested the way in which its ideals were twisted and manipulated by those in power in the USSR, resulting in a terrible fate for the common people.The story pulls no punches; although Orwell uses the fictional setting of a farm with talking animals, his aim is to expose the reader to the hypocrisy of the Soviet regime. The figure of Josef Stalin is easily identified in the character Napoleon, one of the leaders of the animal rebellion. The leaders were first inspired by Major, an aging boar on the farm who clearly represents Karl Marx. Major had given the farm animals the idea that they should strive for a better life than their current plight . After his death, Napoleon and Snowball, another character representing Vladimir Lenin, lead the overthrow of the human-run farm and establish \\"Animal Farm.\\" But Napoleon later assumes complete control over the Rebellion, and, as Stalin did, betrays virtually all aims and maxims originally put forth by the rebellion founders. The story ends with the common farm animals in a far worse state of affairs than when the story began.Orwell used his \\"fairy story,\\" published in 1945, to remind people of the dangers of Soviet Russia, and to differentiate it from the idea of Socialism. It is also a condemnation of totalitarianism in general (one can clearly see Joseph Goebbels in the character of Squealer, the mouthpiece of the rebellion).These messages are just as powerful today as they were when Orwell first wrote them over half a century ago.To paraphrase the chilling Commandment from the last chapter: \\"All authors are equal, but some authors are more equal than others.\\"Read, and understand. Orwell achieved a perfection rarely matched in literature.Five stars."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Written as a parable, ANIMAL FARM offers the cautionary tale of Manor Farm, owned by Mr. Jones, who proves a poor manager and who treats the farm animals poorly. Emboldened by the dreams of a long-lived, much respected, and recently deceased pig named Major, the farm animals rebel, throw Mr. Jones out, and seize the property. The will run the farm to suit themselves, and none will go hungry, none will be mistreated, and all animals will live equally as brothers.It is a fine dream--indeed, it mirrors mankind's most cherished hopes for civilization. But history teaches us that where the opportunity for explotation exists there is no shortage of those to take advantage of it. Little by little the clever pigs, led by Napoleon, rise to power. And the other animals are too trusting and often too ignorant to see that they have merely exchanged one task master for another.ANIMAL FARM is often described as a satire on communist Russia. That is certainly true, and readers who have some knowledge of the history of the Russian Soviet will be quick to recognize the parodies of Karl Marx, Lenin, and Trotsky, among others. But Orwell cuts considerably deeper than this. Russia may have been the starting point, but in truth the parable of ANIMAL FARM can be applied to any culture where political leaders manipulate the public through a mixture of unreasonable hope, media \\"spin,\\" and irrational fear to remain in power.As such, ANIMAL FARM remains as disquieting today as it was more than half a century ago. And we can be sure that, in nations where power becomes centered in the hands of the few, it will continue to be among the first novels banned when that power becomes absolute.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"I have read and re-read Animal Farm since studying ithighschool, and yes it is a heart breaking allegory about the failureof organised idealogy, its also a gripping simply and sharply written story that can engage people on every level of the intellectual food chain.Many readers will start off by pinning the signs on the donkey's backside so to speak i.e. Moses the crow who tells the overworked animals that their afterlives will be bliss represents the church. Benjamin the wise, but silent donkey is the silent intellectuals who could see what was going, but did nothing to save their own skin and so on. It still shocks me how accurate Orwell is, I can recognise a Squealer (the government publiscist talking in fanciful meaningless figures), a Napeloen and sadly too many Boxers in my own country. Strange that what Orwell wrote about the Russian revolution applies to almost any third world country today.The simplicity of the prose of Animal farm is by design, he wanted his book to be accessable to the masses, afterall this is the man who changed his name from Eric Blair to Goerge Orwell just to appeal to the &quot;average Joe&quot;. I don't think he would have wanted this book to be discussed by intellectuals, he wanted it to reach you and me.Humanity has learned (in some parts of the world at least) that the only organised idealogy that works is the abscence of an organised idealogy. Utopia can never exist because 1- It can never be defined 2- It is against human nature not to strive to be better, superior, more powerful and richer then others. Unfortunate but true.The character of Snowball is in my opinion the most important of the book. He is full of good intent, he wants to start classes for the other animals to elevate their understanding of the world. He is also a careless and unrealistic character. What Orwell is saying here is that intent without action is useless. A person who cares about injustice and can't do anything about it is no better than a person who doesn't give it a moment's thought.Animal Farm is Orwell's masterwork, it is clairovoyant, the Soviet Union has indeed fallen. I believe the events of 1984 are only a few you years away, the government can already take pictures of your roof top. If you for some odd reason are among the few who haven't read Animal Farm, you must rectify that situation.

It was required reading when I was in high school and in my opinion one of the best books ever written. However, like all other books of social satire, you must know something of history to appreciate it.The setting is a farm where the animals are mistreated, so they revolt against their human owners and take control of the farm. In the initial joy of apparent liberation, the animals work together in a communal effort and manage to harvest more grain than ever before. The pigs emerge as the leaders, directing everyone else but apparently under the guise of \\"All animals are equal.\\" They pledge to never deal with the dangerous and untrustworthy humans again, except in a manner that benefits all animals on the farm. No longer will animals be slaughtered for human food or gain and they will continue to share the produce, \\"To each according to his needs.\\"The first crack in this occurs when the udders of the dairy cows are full and they need to be milked. Since their calves have been sold, the pigs manage to milk them and the milk just sits there. The pigs assure the others that they will do something with it, and later it becomes clear that they have consumed it. Boxer is the strong work horse who now works even harder.It does not take long before the pigs take total control of the farm, stomping all opposition, gently at first but it is not long before it becomes brutal and unyielding. At the end, Boxer works himself to death and he is sold off to be made into dog food and glue.The book is a satire on the Bolshevik revolution in Russia, where Lenin and his gang of revolutionaries overthrew the Tsarist regime. After that, they murdered Tsar Nicholas and all his family and then established a dictator ship far more brutal than that of the Tsar. If you are not aware of this, then the book will make very little sense to you. I have read this book at least five times in my life and it is a pleasure each time.

This &quot;Fairy Story&quot; of animals rising against their oppressive leader is symbolic of the communist movements in Europe and Russia and reflects the characteristics of a society ruled by a dictatorship. The book demonstrates how power can gradually corrupt an individual and lead to a system which may or may not be favorable to the masses. Animal Farm is a story that takes place on a farm in England. It begins with the boar, Old Major, at a meeting which includes all the animals on the farm, telling them of a dream he had about an animal rebellion against their care giver, Mr. Jones. Upon contemplation, the animals decide to rebel. Through key characters such as Snowball, Napoleon, and Boxer, Orwell intertwines their important characteristics and delivers an important message about the effects of a Totalitarian ruled society, its consequences, and the fate of this type of society. Orwell depicts many relevant scenes that contain betrayal, heroism, cowardice, loyalty, and friendship, which are all important in reflecting the nuances and characteristics attributed to a totalitarian-ruled society. Animal Farm, in my opinion, is a truly wonderful book. It deals with many complicated issues, but through the easy writing of Orwell, the reader can understand the issues of communism, capitalism, and the many aspects of a totalitarian dictatorship. The symbolism of each character in the story is clear. The reader sees, for example, that Napoleon represents Stalin, that Snowball represents Trotsky, and that Boxer represents the proletariat. The book blends humor with tragedy. Animal Farm deals with issues of inequality versus equality and the importance of education in determining whether or not one is being unfairly treated. Naivete can be a dangerous characteristic, and Orwell conveys this idea in his story. I strongly recommend this book. It is an easy read compared to other books which try to explain and discuss the same subject matter. With Animal Farm, one can grasp the concepts of Totalitarianism, due to the brilliant writing style of Orwell."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"In 1946 when Animal Farm was first published it was obvious to is readers that former Eton boy Eric Blair, or George Orwell had written a pretty savage critique of the Bolshevik revolution in Russia. But more than a decade after the final collapse of the Soviet Union, is this story still relevant? Well if it was just confined to the events of the Russian revolution, then perhaps this work could fade in to the fog of obscurity with it's purpose completed, but \\"Animal Farm\\" is about so much more, that as long as people walk on their hind legs and live together in any type of society, it's content will be of the gravest importance.Beginning with the dream of Old Major that there will come a day when animals will throw off the yoke of their oppressors and share the fruits of their labours fairly among themselves, Animal Farm follows that dream to its eventual reality, it's betrayal and it's ultimate corruption in to something darker, more cynical and even farther from Old Major's noble dream than what had been before.Although Animal Farm has implications for all past and future revolutions its meaning goes much deeper than just a blue print for what can go wrong. This novel challenges us to look around us and to see the ongoing exploitation of our neighbours, our brother man and perhaps even ourselves, to recognise the truly bewildering amount spin and slant presented to us as pure facts for what it is and to \\"cast a cold eye\\" on the society we live in and the way it treats its citizens.In his excellent teachers notes on the novel Jerome Burg stated, \\"The essential question raised by Animal Farm is NOT \\"Could it happen again?\\" The essential question is \\"Do I realize that it IS happening everyday all around me?\\" and \\"What are MY responsibilities to do something about it?\\" I couldn't have put it any better myself."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This is the kind of book to read and reread, and never forget.

The characters he depicted were a perfect resemblance to the lead players in the Russian Revolution.With there being several ingrediants to a successful revolution, ANIMAL FARM embodies most of them. The first part of this was a state of crisis. The animals of the farm were overworked, treated poorly, and not fed enough. Such was the case in Russia under the Czar's rule. They needed a leader to guide them through the overthrow. For the animals, it was Snowball and Napoleon; and for Russia, it was Stalin and Trowsky. Orwell creates a genre of the situation that is easier for people to understand.The end is incredibly compelling where the animals would look at the pigs and humans sitting together at the table, and could no longer tell the difference between the two. Stalin had reformed to what he had led a rebellion against, such as the pigs took the likeness of the humans; which they claimed to hate.This book is exceptionally written, and is recommended for everyone to read to get a better understanding of the Russian Revolution."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"The story of Animal Farm is written by George Orwell. In the story Old Major calls a meeting of the animals to discuss his dreams. Old Major wants the animals to stop being slaves. Then Major teaches them the Beasts of England song. Sadly, Old Major died, but his dreams were still alive with the animals. Old Major's dream was called Animalism. Next, the humans are run off the farm. The animals are upset because the farmer was not feeding them. Then Napoleon, the leader of the farm, gets rid of Snowball by having &quot;his dogs&quot; attack and chase Snowball off the farm. Also, Napoleon takes away the last signs of the rebellion. He changes the name of the farm back to Manor Farm. Finally, Napoleon and the other pigs turn into humans. They walk on their hind legs, wear clothes, and talk. All in all, Animal Farm is a sad story. I would suggest that adults and teenagers read Animal Farm. One thing I liked about the book was that the animals demonstrated good team work. The animals carried in the harvest and they helped rebuild the windmill that a storm destroyed. Another thing I enjoyed was Old Major's character. All the animals really looked up to him. Finally, I liked the idea of all animals or humans being &quot;comrades&quot;. We should all learn to be friends. I would definitely read this book again."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"I think that George Orwell's book is a great book. It does have some seriouos topics like war,death,freedom, etc. But overall the book brings a lighthearted mood beacuse of its useage of animals as characters. This book can be read by many levels from young teen to adult. Mainly because of its use of animals as characters. That is the key in Orwells' book. So If you are looking for a good book that is not like any other you will read i would imagine that you should pick up Orwell's book at www.amazon.com!"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"At first, this book seemed absurd-- we are reading it for my English 2 honors class and many people had questiond about the literal interpreataion of this book, ie, &quot;Animals can't talk!' but the book's message amazed me more on every page, and I almost screamed at the end. Terrifying, and a must read."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm is an imaginatively suspenseful novel based on communism and socialism. Although the characters in the story are farm animals, they represent influential figures of the Russian Revolution. In the midst of an unsettling atmosphere between farmer and animals, Old Major, a prize-winning boar, as well as a metaphor of Karl Marx, spreads the idea of a utopian society and a rebellion among the animals. The animals, never before charismatic enough to think of this vision themselves, seize the very first chance that comes up to drive the tyrant farmer Mr. Jones (Czar Nicholas II), his wife, and the farm hands out of the farm. The other pigs feed off his inspiration, and are eventually overcome with greed, using it to benefit themselves, instead of following through on the Old Major's original proposal. In the long and short of it, some pigs lead a revolt against people, act like jerks, and play poker. George Orwell creates a satire in his book Animal Farm, ridiculing the Russian government in the shadow of his words. His book warns against totalitarianism, which is displayed through the pig's slowly growing power over the animals after the riddance of the previous dictator, Mr. Jones. However, this is not the only work portraying Orwell's view of Soviet Communism. His previous novel, 1984 displays yet more depth into the author's view into the so-called idea of a utopian society. He believes \\"although socialism is good as an ideal, it can never be successfully adopted due to uncontrollable sins of human nature.\\" Orwell's fable is a must read, however, to make full sense of this novel, I would only recommend this book to mature audiences of at least thirteen or over."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This wonderful book is packed full of ideas and eyeopening concepts.

It tought me about the russian revoultion, but at times was confusing. It seemed to be a history book at times, but also trying to sound like a book only about animals.

I have read it at least four times --- each time in one sitting, because it is a very easy book to read, and once I start it, I cannot put it down. The first time I read it, I was in the 7th grade. I was an excellent student in school, but I did not like to read, because virtually all the books written for children and young adults that I had ever been assigned or offered in school I found to be insipid and boring. Imagine when I began reading Animal Farm and I suddenly discovered that not all books are like that, that books can be GREAT! What an eye opener."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"No one views a dictatorship positively except those in charge. There are a select few that enjoy the benefits of endless power, and a great many that suffer the constant oppression. The few at the top reap the benefits through the sacrifices of the many, as was demonstrated through George Orwell's novel, Animal Farm. The novel is a political satire whose events are modeled after that of the real world, as well as the animal characters representing real people. The plot and characters reveal Orwell's true genius behind his book, as it is a work of literary excellence that greatly impacted society.George Orwell wrote his political satire, Animal Farm, at a controversial time in history. It was time where he could not truly utilize his right to freedom of speech for fear of deadly repercussions. The structure of the book is completely influenced by this time period. Despite this hindrance, he was able to create animal characters to represent real political figures and a society that modeled that of the dictatorships of the real world. In Animal Farm, the animals on the Manor Farm overthrew the neglectful farmer that previously took care of them. They created their own society with commandments that all the animals had to follow. Initially, the utopian farm was very successful, but soon, there was a power struggle between two pigs: Snowball and Napoleon.Napoleon and Snowball modeled Joseph Stalin and Leon Trotsky respectively. Napoleon ends up taking control of the Manor Farm and running Snowball out. Napoleon then assumes dictatorial qualities, such as declaring that there will be no more meetings and asserting the pigs will make all the decisions. The rest of the animals become overworked and underfed whereas the pigs drink whiskey and live in luxury, which exactly modeled the conditions in the Soviet Union and other dictatorship societies.Apart from the two main characters, Orwell created many prominent characters were used to symbolize other people. The horse, Boxer, was a hard, honest laborer. His motto was, \\"I will work harder\\" yet despite this, he was betrayed by Napoleon and sent to a glue factory. He was representative of the working class. Orwell showed the working class' honesty and dedication, yet their downfall was the nave trust they put in their leaders. Additionally, the pig Squealer acted as Napoleon's buffer to the other animals. He announced and justified Napoleon's actions, just as the media does. He modeled the propaganda that those in charge feed to the working class.In the final analysis, George Orwell's novel, Animal Farm, was filled with representations in order to effectively convey his message of his disapproval of a communist society. The characters represented real-life dictators, and the animal farm subsequently turned into a dystopian society. The political satire was effective both when it was written as well as the present day in showing the fallibility of the Soviet Union and countries that lack democracy."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This is a fantastic allusion for why you should be skeptical, if not mistrusting, of those who claim to act in your best interest and infringe on your freedoms for the sake of a greater freedom.

Of the two, \\"Animal Farm\\" is the shortest but the best.The insights and perceptions from \\"Animal Farm\\" are just as applicable now- more so than before. You only have to substitute the animals for people and certain animals (e.g. pigs, horses, mices, etc.) for certain professions (e.g. politician, etc.).History always repeats. When you take away the history or even distort it slightly, you can rewrite it in such a way to leverage and control groups of people.Great book that would be a great informative yet entertaing read.JR FelisildaAuthor of the book, \\"Nanay: Lessons From a Mother\\""},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"A book I should have read in high school.

Something for them to think about before they commit to burning down a bank."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"To write a review of one of the most famous and influential 20th-Century books seems almost a waste of time. Mr. Orwell's classic is practically required reading in all American high schools. My son, who is in 8th grade, was assigned it. I haven't read \\"Animal Farm\\" in about ten years and gave it another whirl so my son and I could discuss it. The problem with kids tackling this classic at such a young age is they don't understand the times in which the book was written. I'm 51-years-old and rarely meet anyone who enjoyed reading \\"Animal Farm\\" while in school. Usually, it was after they had seasoned a little with age that they returned to Orwell's piece and found it much more insightful and enjoyable. This is sad because an early introduction to the author's book without understanding the historical context discourages kids from reading many other old, great works.Mr. Orwell, whose actual name was Eric Blair, had a heck of a time getting this baby published. Despite being a socialist, the author was highly critical of Communism at a time in which the Soviet Union was our allies in the war against Adolf Hitler. My suggestion to readers is to first do a little research about Joseph Stalin (the pig Napolean) and Leon Trotsky (the pig Snowball) as well as understand how the Soviet Union and any totalitarian regime functions. It even takes a very brief broadside at religion depicted by the raven Moses. \\"Animal Farm\\" is an important work explaining how people in power manipulate the ignorant masses and is very much relevant in even how democracies use propaganda (the sycophant pig Squealer) to sway public opinion. Mr. Orwell's two most famous books, \\"Animal Farm\\" and \\"1984\\" are not written in colorful prose but very much thought-provoking pieces that rightly make them worth reading."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"i remember being forced to read animal farm by george orwell ages and ages ago back in 7th grade and sorryto say,i did not like it because, i did not understand it,at the time. well,i have finally read this bookagain(i'm in my 40s) and i was shocked and stunned what an incredible and interesting novel this is!for those who have never read it,it is not for children. it is ok for teens and adults. the gist of animal farmis this:the animals of a farm (secretly)were able to communicate with eachother and hatched a plan to takeover the whole farm fron the humans who owned it and the animals did!... once the animals were in control theyset up ground rules for all the animals to follow-incidentally,the pigs being the smartest,were the \\"speakers\\"for the whole group. at first,things went as planned for the animals,but slowly over time,things changed.the nicer of the two pigs(snowball) was forced off of the farm thru treachery orchestrated by another pig,named napoleon. at this point,napoleon takes control using outright lies and intimidation(napoleon traineddogs to be his bodyguards). as far as the humans in the story,a group of humans tried to take back the farmbut,failed and then later,napoleon had to work with the humans to get certain things that they needed to use onthe farm. as i read each page,i thought that this reminds me alot of hitler/germany/world war two,but,reallythe author intended napoleon to represent joseph stalin. alas,hitler and stalin were cut from the same cloth,so it is logical to make the comparison between the two. there are some shocking scenes in the book aboutsome of the animals being executed(for \\"loyalty\\" to the long gone snowball),although these deaths are not described in detail,it becomes clear,this book might not have a happy ending. i do not want to reveal the end for those who have never read it but,the end is explicable in it's meaning,we should not think of ourselves as being so much better than animals,because,we are not. such as,our brutality towards one another and have we, as humans ever LEARNED anything from our past inhumanity throughout world history?"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This is one of those books that should be required reading for everyone, followed by deep intellectual conversations on how a system like this could never work.

The animals decide that the only course of action is to take the farm over and run it themselves. The remove the farmer and set up a communistic system led by the pigs (because they're the smartest). All the animals are to be given food based on their worth, but since the pigs lead the farm they are given the most and best food and live in the house. Without giving too much away, this story mimics the communist regime of the Soviet Union, Cuba and China."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Inarguably one of the best books of the past century, George Orwell's \\"Animal Farm\\" displays such amount of cleverness and sharp wit within its pages that we can allow it to look down on almost any other satire written in the last 100 years. This ingenious story about a group of farm creatures rebelling against their human masters and building a society based on the precepts of \\"Animalism\\", still maintains intact its absolute undiminished brilliance and thought-provoking qualities. Never a bunch of animals had ever been so convincingly human and moving in their attitudes and actions. That in this outstanding allegory pigs are reserved the honour to be the self-appointed leaders among all the other animals is a too much evident metaphor, but not less effective or far-fetched nevertheless.Much more than a mere political satire, \\"Animal Farm\\" reveals itself as a grim and penetrating depiction of human selfishness in which the betrayal of idealism leads to a crescendo of abuses and injustices. Corruption of power transforms an initially egalitarian society into a totalitarian state of terror where (to name just a few things) animals become slave workers, freedom of speech is brutally repressed and geese accused of espionage commit suicide \\"by swallowing deadly nightshade berries\\"...Above all, \\"Animal Farm\\" is a story about the miseries of human egotism, about the urge that we as individuals have always felt of trampling over those persons whom we consider socially or intellectually inferior (manifested in the form of classism and group prejudices). It is also a fable about a sad truth, a truth consisting in the unavoidable failure of egalitarianism, in the impossibility of everyone enjoying the same advantages at the same time. In order to privileged people to exist, there must be also unprivileged ones savouring the bitter taste of privation and servility. \\"Animal Farm\\" eloquently reminds us about the inherent cruelty permeating \\"civilized\\" social structures.Another success by the author is that it doesn't really matter with which characters you identify the most with, whether it is the hard-working but submissive horse Boxer, the apolitical and stoical donkey Benjamin, the uncommitted and materialistic mare Molly or the tyrannical and self-interested Napoleon; Orwell will invariably make the reader to reexamine his own attitudes and notions toward politics and social responsibility.Orwell has been dismissed by some as an \\"overtly political writer\\". I also personally dislike men of letters who usually dabble in politics, but the truth is that Orwell's best works are able to transcend that condition, acquiring a completely new and deeper meaning through the author's masterful understanding of human nature by means both of his unflinching portrayal of social and political injustice and the brutal repression of individual liberty shown in some of his stories.As always, this \\"Everyman's Library\\" hardback edition is of magnificent quality and strongly reinforces the myth of German efficiency. It includes a prologue, a chronology of the author's life along with related historical events and also two interesting appendixes written by Orwell at the end of the book. For the price, you cannot go wrong with this one.This is book that must be rediscovered by every single future generation. Make yourself a favour and read this \\"fairy story\\", and make another one to your friends and loved ones by giving them a copy as well."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"My Comment on Animal FarmI think animal farm is a good novel for anyone who is interested in the Russian history. The language is kept simple so its easy to read and to understand. Because of this novel, it is a lot easier to understand what happened during the time of the Russian Revolution. All in all I think that Orwell made a good job of this novel by resetting all that had happened, and transforming it to the animal world."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm is a well written and interesting political satire. Orwell has fullfilled his job to illustrate the developement of dictatorship by giving animals the characters of humans. The novel isn't just a story of some animals living on a farm, their characters refer to real existing humans who lived under the Soviet Communism. The allegory may give away information about the further process and the developement may be obvious sometimes, but the thoughts and feelings of the animals prevent the novel from getting boring. Furthermore there are still some unexpected incidents, i.e. Boxer's death. All in all, Orwell's &quot;Animal Farm&quot; is a proclamation against dictatorship and a proclamation for liberty. I think that's very topical considering that the book was published in 1945."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"&quot;Animal Farm&quot; is a book which is based on a historical background. The themes are: &quot;The Russian Revolution&quot; and &quot;Power Corrupts&quot;. The story itself contains a believable mixture of human and animal characters. All animals of this book symbolize persons they lived in reality. For example: The pig Napoleon stands for Stalin, the pig Snowball represents Trotzky etc. The end of the novel is particularly bleak. No solution is held out - the bloody and cruel way in which the animals hopes of a happy and free future are destroyed. The events are told in a chronological order. Orwell's style is straightforward and direct and we tend to take what he says at face value. We do not question his interpretation of the characters and feel that he is telling the truth. I think when you want to read this story, you have to know the history, because otherwise it would be very difficult to understand the diffrent contexts.

How about fluid writing style, a gripping plot, great social commentary, great action, superb dialogue, interesting and dynamic characters, a well presented environment? Well, most books, even my favorites, don't encompass all these qualities. I've finally found a book that does.Knowing nothing about this book, I wanted to start this small classic and finish up in a few days. Less than two hours later I wrapped this book up with my mouth wide open. I could not believe how good a book could be.Basically this book captures the flaws of communism and capitalism in a fantastic fairy tale about one farm rebellion and it's aftermath.

After the control of the farm is in the hooves and paws of the animals, they establish certain rules and rights. Throughout the book, the pigs, who are the leaders gain more and more human-like qualities. They go against all their first set rules about no human objects or habits. Towards the end of the story things start going oddly wrong and the pigs' communist cooperative turns into a dictatorship. Things then become weird and confusing for the other animals.George Orwell's depiction of the setting and plot of the story is brought out by the carefully placed imagery. This impressive imagery displays the theme of how life has a certain order and trying to change this will only bring it right back around the circle again. The imagery of the piece conveys how Orwell made the animals seem less animal-like and more like humans. &quot;A pig walking on it's hind legs,&quot; the piece states, displaying the human characteristics the pigs were obtaining. The symbolism is not so obvious, but yet simple enough for the reader to catch the idea. The imagery lets the reader knows something is going on (Russian Revolution) but that knowledge of what, wasn't key to understanding the book, for the theme is very universal."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Orwell's novel is an absolutly brilliant satire.

Orwell, himself a socialist, reveals the failure of this Soviet attempt at Communism in a fairy story of farm animals who overthrow their oppressive master for the purpose of creating a perfectly equal and self-governed society.

It took me a week to read it. I am in 7th grade and 13 years old. I have not learned one thing about the Russian Revolution, but it's not about that, so it doesnt matter.Animal Farm is about freedom, not about a certain revolution. It could have been about the French revolution, or the american revolution! It doesn't really matter which revolution he based it on, the message remains the same.I have read other reviews to this book and either call it a terrible book about the Russian Revolution or a wonderful story about it. But truly, I never thought about that revolution at all when I was reading it.The story is rather sad, especially the ending, but it was a rather appropriate ending. &quot;When they looked from pig to man and man to pig, they realized they couldn't tell the difference between the two.&quot; Or whatever. That really affected me, and I hope it does you, too.If there's something good that people (or animals) want to happen, and they start it, there's always one person (or animal) that wants to manipulate the others into thinking that what he/she/it is doing is good, even though it's really bad.I loved this book, and I would gladly read it again. I don't know why the school's make you read it in high school, but I think that they should make it earlier, because this book was wonderful.PS- I haven't read 1984 by Orwell yet, and if you've read it and enjoyed it, or not, then e-mail me.

The plot is reinforcing the quote, \\"Absolute power corrupts absolutely,\\" which is an important point to make to anyone of any age. However, I don't think anyone under the age of a very intelligent, mature 10 or preferably 11 years would be able to appreciate this book to its fullest.

The book is called Snowball's Chance, by John Reed, and has gotten some attention here in New York.

The book and the film. As you perhaps know, there are some differences between the film and the book.First there is the book, it has no real narrator. But in the film, Jessy is the narrator and tells us all the feelings of the animals. But in the book the author gives us all the feelings of the other animals. The film is different in some scenes. For example the meeting at the beginning is really different. In the book everything is explained very well. Ther e you get to know where everyone takes a seat or is standing around during the assambly. But there is an other difference. The death of Old Major is an other one than in the book. In the film Old Major is shot by Mr. Jones. The revolution in the film isn\`t a true revolution. The revolution is only because of the hunger on the farm. They walk up to the granary and are caught by the humans. There was a small fight between animals and humans and the animals defeated the humans. But Mr. Jones didn\`t flee into the city as it was told by the narrator of the book. He fled to the neighbour farm on which he has a one night stand with the wife of the owner of the farm, which is an other difference.When the farm was quonquered by the animals and the farmers weren\`t able to win it back, the farmers overheart the animals and decided to trade with the animals. Close to the end of the film the pics used a film to explain that they are good leaders. In the book they only used their mouth. The last difference between book and film is the end. First Jessy fled with other animals, stayed some years away and when they came back, the pics were dead and a new owner came to the farm. In the book there is just an open end.To put it in a nutshell, the film is much better than the book. Maybe it is because you don\`t have to think that much about the things that happen. But I think the film is more effective in expressing the feelings of the animals and delivering the allegorical background."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This is probably the best book that I have read this summer.

The animals are strugglin durning and after the defeat, but as soon as things were getting better they fell apart in a long slow manner. The pigs in this book are very controling and think that all the animals should follow in their footsteps. George Orwell wants you to feel bad for the animals even after the defeat of Mr. Jones. He wrote this book in third person so that you see what is happening all around not just from one animals mouth. When the pigs run the farm just like Mr. Jones only a few of the other animals notice just like the horses and a few of the other animals. The Metophor to this book would be, don't turn into something that you didn't like in the first place.If you like a story with a good moral, excitement and a book you can't put down that this book is for you."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"\\"Animal Farm\\" explains government in such a simple way, it is easy for teens and preteens to understand. The book remains interesting while teaching kids not to believe everything they hear from officials. It gives them something simple to start off with about government, and shows them how a government may become corrupt. I am in 7th grade and I really enjoyed this book because it helped me understand how and why government does what it does.

The story was written about the rise of Communism in Russia, however if you read it there are alot of parallel activities happening in America! Conspiracy theorist I am not, but the signs are there.

He decided to put an end to it.In this book, Orwell gives a harsh and ruthless critique to the Totalitarian Regime born from the Russian Revolution. Trough use of literary figures, Orwell writes an allegory that's hard to miss, the parallelism is extremely clear, you can basically substitute names and titles with those of the main players of the Russian Revolution.Obviously the author ran into a lot of trouble to get the book published, even his editor thought badly of his writings, but eventually he managed to have it done and thus we now have the opportunity to read this masterpiece.Animal Farm is the chronicle of a betrayed revolution, of the clash of classes that in the end turns into the same class structure which meant to be forever abolished, you will definitely enjoy more this book if you have some basic knowledge of the Russian Revolution but the allegory can be extrapolated to basically any \\"revolution\\" and means to get you thinking and never to take anything at face value, it encourages you to read between the lines.The author's use of allegory is masterful, his imagery artistic, his message a learning experience, and the book as a whole is an extremely enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This book creates a pretty accurate picture of what it would be like to live under a totalitarian government. In the book the animals are tired being opressed by the human beings! So they drive away they're master and take control of the farm. But it dosen't take long for the pigs to take over. Slowly but surely the pigs get more and more powerful.It finally get to where all the \\"Seven Commandments\\" set up just after the \\"rebellion\\", and the motto of \\"four legs good, two legs bad\\" are replace by one rule. \\"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.\\" Then things are no better that they were when the humans were still there.I would recommend this book to anyone who is even slightly interested."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Do you ever wonder what would happen if animals could fight for themselves; if they overthrew their masters? Can you imagine what terrible things could happen? Find out in the fantasy Animal Farm by George Orwell.I learned a lot from this book. I already knew that communism was a bad thing but Orwell really demonstrates illustratively what horrors could surface from such a system. This book, although plagued with symbolism, is an extremely easy read on the exterior, but there is more depth than meets the eye, like the parallels to Russian History at the time the book was published in 1946. This deeper meaning was one of the things I liked about the book; that, and how quickly the story moved along. What I didn't like was the ending, perhaps just because the ending was sad. It left me with a feeling of depression, but it was very accurate in showing how this situation would end if the story were real. However, throughout the first half of the book, when things were looking up for Animal Farm, it was a very exciting read.My favorite character in the book was the mare, Clover. This horse didn't play such a big part in the beginning, but she demonstrates courage and determination by the end.Everything was very well explained and it didn't end on a cliffhanger. I would only recommend this book to a friend who would appreciate the symbolism because otherwise everything would go right over his head. I don't think I would read any other books by George Orwell, at least not voluntarily.It's extremely interesting to see how an actual commune of animals would work. If you think your relatives or friends are pigs, you might change your mind after reading this book."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm is a book that describes communism in Russia's history. It is written with symbols, so it is easy to understand for all ages. Animal Farm is also sophisticated enough to keep all ages interested.Major, the older pig, symbolizes Karl Marx. He tells of a dream where animals prosper and they are not controlled by humans. Soon after he tells of this dream, he dies. One night, when the humans are expecially lazy, the animals overthrow the humans and chase them from the farm. Snowball and Napolean appear as leaders, who symbolize Trotsky and Stalin respectively.Snowball and Napolean usually disagree on how to run things, but Snowball presents the ideas that are better for the whole. While Snowball was the better speaker, Napolean gained support between speeches easier.On a specific day, Snowball and Napolean were giving reasons for and against building a windmill. Snowball was for it and gave an inspiring speech about how it would be hard but the luxeries that came from it would far outweigh the work. Napolean on the other hand gave a half-hearted speech on why it was a bad idea. After his speech, he makes a little yelp and dogs come in and chase Snowball off the farm, just as Trotsky was expelled from Russia.Napolean starts to go against the main rules of Animalism (communism) and his propaganda machine, Squealer, always explains how they \\"forgot\\" the rule or parts of it while he just changed it. Napolean gets richer while the farm as a whole gets poorer. Rations get cut and things are the same if not worse than before the animals took over. The only one who realizes this is the stubborn donkey named Benjamin. The only one that realizes what Napolean was doing, and for some reason does nothing.I recommend this for anyone interested in a good story, expecially if you want to learn more about how communism went down in Russia. It provides the Communist story in a easy to learn way, yet does not dumb it down so that you get left with holes in what happened."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Before reading Animal Farm, I had no idea that the history of the Soviet Union could be so fun!!!The story starts off with words of wisdom passed on by Old Major, Lenin's or Stalin's piggish counterpart and the founder of Animalism, a form of society in which all animals are equal and all have their duties to the collective. The pigs of the farm, being the most intelligent of farm animals, proceed to organize the overthrow of the current oppressive 'government' (Farmer Jones) and rename the farm Animal Farm. The duty of leadership has only two real contenders, the two predominant pigs of the farm: Napoleon (a ruthless, evil, and ultimately corrupt egoist-politico, representative of Stalin) and Snowball (a relatively selfless pig concerned mostly with reforms to the system, representative of Trotsky). Snowball is eventually driven out of Animal Farm, and thanks to Napoleon's 'propaganda minister', Squealer, the animals, dumb as they are, soon forget all that Snowball fought for and accomplished in the name of Animalism.The book is great, whether you know it is a 'brief history of twentieth-century Russia' or whether you see it simply as a fantasy tale. Orwell's use of foreshadowing in the development of the ending goes nearly so far as to ruin it, but it is surprising nonetheless. One of his tools for this was the Seven Commandments of Animalism, which provide a benchmark to refer to as we see Napoleon twist them and pervert them to One Commandement. I particularly liked the third-person point of view Orwell wrote from. It allows us to see everything that the animals don't realize is going on behind their backs as Napoleon schemes his schemes and plots his plots. And I found the contrast between Snowball and Napoleon to be very dramatic; Snowball's undying dedication to Animalism as compared to Napoleon's undying dedication to his own advancement.My opinion is that there should be more authors like George Orwell. Or maybe there should be more books like Animal Farm. Not just a striking analogy, but a really good, entertaining book. Recommended, two thumbs up, five stars, blah, blah, blah.The thing that hit me after reading this book:Wow. That really happened."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This was one of the first book I ever read. It is a great example of how writing can be sophisticated.

My class just finished reading the novel just a couple weeks ago. The book itself was a perfect representation of almost any type of government, I thought. I was surprised by how many symbols my teacher brought to my eyes like Boxer performing such laborious tasks with out question like loyal pawns, security dogs acting as a sort of military strength, and the pigs being in the place of tyrants which isn't ironic.Although the book was indeed depressing, and sad, but is was also most interesting. I do admit falling asleep through the book as class carried on, but the book is very detailed, fast paced, full of imagination, and doesn't possess an ounce of vagueness throughout the book.Through the repressed privileges and lies the pigs almost fit the description of humans, which makes perfect sense on why the pigs were perceived as tyrants.This book works perfectly to anyone who is interested in the rise of communism in Russia, in which the book revolves around.

I loved it once again, but this time seeing it in the eyes of an adult and not of a teenager who is being obliged to read it"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm, by George Orwell is a book I would give 5 stars.This book is about a group of animals that feel terrorized by their master the farmer. With a collaborated effort, they sucessfully attempt to overthrow the farm. They then become indipendant on their farm. Run entirely by animals, they rightfully name it Animal Farm. Very quickly after the farm is set up, do the pigs take over. At the beggining all the animals are treated equally, but by the end of the book the pigs become greedy and having the pigs be the smartest they eventually take over the farm as the new farmers. The story can be looked at on many different levels. You can look at the story and think it is a nice little story about animals. However, the story can also be takin into a political perspective. The farmers at the begining of the story represent human tyrrany. The pigs represent the leaders of the world all with good intentions, but as the old saying goes, power currupts. The rest of the animals on the farm represent the people of this world, oblivious mostly to the outside world and believing what their leaders tell them. That is why I give this book 5 stars out of 5, because the author did such a wonderful mixing modern day life into a kids story. It is truly a masterpiece that is enjoyable to people of all ages, and is one that would be very enjoyable to read over and over.If you enjoyed this book, I believe there are other books that will grab your attention like this one. For example there is the book The Tales Of Desperaux. It does not in fact have the same depth that animal farm contains. However, it is another tale of animals that struggle to keep themselves alive. It is a fun and wild ride that will keep you busy for hours on end. I enjoy reading it is something I like to do in my spare time. I can only read a book that I find interesting. If I am a quarter way through the book and I do not like it I will put it away. The books Animal Farm, and The Tales Of Desperaux are books that will grab your attention and hold it for the duration of the book. I go to Harris Road Middle School. I am in the seventh grade.

It is from one of the best writers in our time.I always appreciate the classics that return you to the true genius of good literature."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"The introduction of this book is especially helpful and offers a different perspective. It contrasted the release of the book with the, then soon to be dropped, atomic bomb. This leads to the conclusion that the message of the book is aimed at the problems of socialism, showing that it was not going to work. From a timing point of view it fit right in to the events of that day.The lessons of the book can be applied not just to socialism but also to a variety of abuses of power in any day. Today the book could be contrasted with the election of 2006 and the change it caused for those in power.George Orwell used the farm animals as a \\"fairy-story with political purpose\\". As he said in the book he intended to show the effects of totalitarianism. He declared that he intended it to have a message rather than just be fun or entertaining. I prefer to take him at his word rather than to say it is really about something else, even if it points to a lot of other things. Rereading it always opens up new things it seems to be about.The pigs seemed to be, in the beginning, the organizers and the ones that understood the problem. The problem in the beginning is that they were not equal. Animals were not equal to people, that was the problem. Then they solved the problem and in doing so they eventually became the problem.A more current example of the \\"farm yard\\" might be our congress. One party controls it for years and the other sees all that is wrong and rises up and finally takes over. Then they lose their vision and just add \\"pork\\". Guess it is about \\"pigs\\" after all.The book is one of the best written on power. It shows clearly why it is abused and how easy it is for those that gain a little, with the best of motives, wind up misusing it.The conclusion in the book was that \\"All animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others\\".This book is one to re and reread. It is easy to do in one sitting."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Most people have completely missed the point of this book. Animal Farm has nothing to do with communism. Animal Farm is about the age-old question: What would the world be like if animals could talk? It's pretty straight-forward.The only problem that I have with this book is that there aren't enough animals involved. Animal Farm limits itself by only including farm animals. I'd like to hear what wolves, bears, camels, and elephants have to say.Hopefully Orwell will write a sequel to Animal Farm and include more animals."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"A dark fable about what went wrong with the Russian Revolution. Brillient, has most of the themes that showed up in 1984 as well as ideas of it's own. Funny at times, sometimes tragic. Well worth reading. It's also short, so there's no excuse to pass it up."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Having missed this book when I was younger, I'm glad that I finally read it. Orwell, like many intellectuals of his day, embraced communism as the utopia of the future. Unlike many intellectuals, however, Orwell eventually saw through the lies and propaganda to recognize real communism for what it was - just another brutally totalitarian regime no better than fascism.Animal Farm is a very short, very well written satire. To those pie-in-the-sky dreamers who still think that communism has something to offer the world, Orwell depicts very graphically what really happens in any communist revolution: all men may be equal, but some are more equal than others, and once in power the primary goal of the communist leaders is to remain in power at whatever cost.Orwell draws his characters very well - well enough that I will personally take more pleasure in eating pork from now on! The pigs in Animal Farm clearly are meant to represent the fat-cat communist party leaders, and the dogs that do their bidding are analogous to the KGB and other security forces of the old Soviet Union.Summary: Animal Farm is an old book, but it's still relevant today as countries continue to be ruled by or taken over by communist parties. The point is that while communism may appear to be a utopia for workers, in a very short time, ideology fades away as the communist party gains power and becomes dedicated solely to remaining in power.A great book that lives up to its reputation."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"If anyone is looking for a creative and enjoyable book to read, they should take a look at Animal Farm by George Orwell. This book is about a group of farm animals who are mistreated and abused by their owner, Mr. Jones. One day, the animals on Mr. Jones' farm rebel and exile him and all of his workers out of the farm. The animals run the farm together and start a Marxist lifestyle, dividing the work equally, making fair rations and deciding on farm issues as a whole, with all of the animals equal.. However, the pigs, led by two named Napoleon and Snowball, begin to gain control by slowly building up support. Napoleon, due to vast disagreements with Snowball, runs him out of the farm and takes complete control in leading the animals. From this point on, the lives of the animals, especially the pigs, change forever. Napoleon becomes a dictator, and nothing is the same, or for that matter, ever will be.This book is very unique. Unlike many books where the author has you following one or a few key characters, George Orwell tells the story of the farm as one. There are still main characters, but you are not necessarily following that one character throughout the entire book. One of the main characters is the pig Napoleon. He is very much like a dictator. Much like Hitler, he works his way into power by lying to gain support. Once he has that power, he takes total control of the farm and forces the other animals to follow him and do as he says through fear. The story of the animal farm reminds me of the rise of the Soviet Union: communism turning to totalitarianism.I enjoyed greatly Animal Farm. George Orwell uses very strong language and the storyline really draws you in. I also thought that the way he made his entire book a metaphor of the Soviet government was incredibly creative. The characters are quite similar to regular people in their personalities and speech except that they have several views and reactions that you might expect an animal to have as well as hatred towards humans and the way of life. His concept of animals running a farm on their own is very unique. Because this concept is so unusual and intriguing, the book is somewhat difficult to comprehend, reminding me of my experiences with Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury. These two authors put ideas into each of these books that are so far off from the norm that it is hard to see what it would be like to live in the book. You could describe Animal Farm is a mix between the uniqueness of Fahrenheit 451 and the theme of talking animals in Babe by Dick King-Smith. I would recommend this book to people that enjoy fables, especially ones involving politics. If you like books like Fahrenheit 451, you will enjoy this Animal Farm by George Orwell."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"As a 10th grader, not many old books draw my interest.

The rebellion of the animals against Farmer Jones was the start of a communist government. Everybody was equal at first until Napoleon(the bad pig) overthrew Snowball(the good pig) and became the dictator of the farm. Soon all the lower animals were exploited and living a life worse than the one where Jones owned them. The new laws were enforced by Napolean's dogs while the poor animals were too ignornant to understand. It is a parallel to the Russian Revolution and its aftermath.

Stereotypical characters and cycles in Animal Farm illustrate how oppressive governments exert their power over the masses. Written in 1943, as an allegory to Stalin's brutal reign in the Soviet Union Animal Farm outlines how a socialist system can shift towards totalitarian. The corrupt owner of Manor Farm, Mr. Jones, is driven off his land after the wisest of the animals, old Major, has a vision. Driven to starvation and ignited by Old Major's speech, the animals launch a rebellious insurrection. In the period after Jones is driven off the farm, all animals coexist in momentary harmony. A system of government called Animalism is developed under which codes of conduct are introduced in the form of commandments. While the paint from the commandments is still wet, the pigs begin to manipulate their fellow animals. Blatant propaganda is the device used to shepherd the weaker animals into the exploitative pigs regime. Napoleon is the quintessential Stalin both in character and tactics. The very vices and ways of man, once rebelled against, are adopted by the dominating pigs emphasizing the theme: a powerful class need not censor itself, once established. The theme of ignorance runs rampant in Animal Farm. The destruction of Animalism and the behavior of the ignorant are intended to impassion the reader, as well as educate mass society. Orwell's brilliance outlines the nature of power struggles in the relationship of animal to master. Through the manipulation of these relationships Orwell is able to create a universal political message that is as relevant today as it was when it was written."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"A Unique Telling of HistoryAnimal Farm is an excellent source on Totalitarianism. Author George Orwell tells the truth of the Bolshevik revolution and what the communist Soviet Union was like in a make-believe tale. Orwell uses animals to characterize the leaders of the communist movement in Russia. He starts with Old Major who puts the thought into the minds of the animals (the proletariat) rising up against Mr. Jones who is the farm owner (the bourgeois) similar to the way Karl Marx does with the Communist Manifesto. With the thought of revolution implanted, the animals decide to take over the farm. They assume the farm and compose seven commandments to live by, with the most important being that \\"all animals are equal.\\" The animals seem to have created an animal utopia for themselves, but as the story progresses the characters Napoleon (Stalin) and Snowball (Trotsky) begin to acquire power. Eventually Napoleon takes Snowball out of the picture and gains total control of the farm. The newly equal animal farm then becomes a totalitarian farm. This story is a great way to learn about what can happen in a communist nation.

If I had my way, I would move it instantly to the &quot;Classics&quot; section of the bookstore, as this is what I consider it to be."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm is about one farm of animals that start to rebel against the humans. The animals feel that they do all the work and it shouldnt be like that, but once the animals take over they have problems of there own. What the animals were trying to stop the humans from doing occured amongst themselves. In the book I really like when the animals fought the humans. The animals are planning tactics and everything to hold off the humans. In the battle of cowshed the animals worked together to defeat the humans even though they did not have any weapons of their own. Rarely you see a point of view like this in other books so it really intriuged me. Also, the battles seemed to be upsets (underdog wins) and I always like to read or watch something like that. I would recommend this to other people around the age of 14 or above. To a little kid all the metaphors in this book would mean nothing more than animals talking and taking over. The book has a point other than just the animals taking over and if you figure out what the meaning is it makes the book mroe enjoable to read. Once you can understand this book there would be no age to old to read this because it is not a little kids book. It is different but not in a little kids way, even though the animals can talk. The point is beyond that and it relates to people so it is suitable for older people."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animalsfarm is an allegory. George Orwell hid the persionalities of importatnt people from the Russian Revolution into animals. The animals at first experience a problem when the farmer of their farm isnt giving themenough food. After they notice this they realize that they need to rebel. In the end they rebel and get the farm to them selves. Soon they make rules on how to live and everyone must follow them. SNOWBALL (a pig) who in real life was Trotskiy takes charge and starts designing a lot of good things until NEPOLIAN, Stalin, and takes his trained DOGS, the kgb, and makes them chase SNOWBALL out of the farm. Then NEPOLIAN becomes more and more like a human and treats the animals even more harsh then the farmer himself"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This is a truly unique story about how a form of government went completely haywire.

At first, &quot;animalism&quot; works out just fine, but soon it turns into a totalitarian government completely dictated by 3 pigs using propaganda to sway all of the animals thoughts. I can always tell a good book from a bad book because if its a good book than i will think about it days after i finished it. This is unlike every book i have ever read and would highly recommend it to readers of more mature ages."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Mr. Jones' farm, the Manor Farm, is a pity. His animals are malnourished and always sick, and he doesn't much care. After they die he just cooks them and eats them. Jones is always slobbering drunk. In the beginning of the story Old Major is the leader of all the animals. He is a great leader until his death one night. All the animals are shocked and they need a new leader. The pigs are the smartest animals, so they are always leaders. At first Snowball is the leader, but then Napoleon comes in and he wants to be leader. All the animals go up against humans and kill Jones' men. When Napoleon decides to trade with humans he doesn't tell any other animals because it's against the rule, \\"Whatever goes on two legs is an enemy.\\"Animal Farm is very interesting because the animals all have different points of view, such as when the hens must lay eggs for Napoleon. He wants to trade with the humans, but the hens think it's bad for their health because they have to lay about 30 a week. I like Boxer the best because he has a good attitude and he always works the hardest. Boxer always looks at the positive side of things. I was very enthusiastic about the book, and when I shared it with friends I got them interested in reading it."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This is probably the greatest short story ever written, and is an unmitigated classic of our time.

The animals well meaning idea of a Utopian farm being cruelly destroyed by a corrupt pig and his minions, is a brilliant parallel of a human desire to build a Utopian Heaven on Earth being knocked sideways by the corruptibility and sinfulness that exists in all humans. You end up feeling intensly sorry for Boxer, wishing that Snowball would come back, hoping that the animals have the guts to start a rebellion fairly early on and trying to avoid a sneaking and vindictive desire to see Napoleon and Squealer packed off to the nearest abitoir and served as rashers of bacon on a farmers breakfast plate."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm is the story of a revolution gone sour. Animalism, Orwell's take on Communism, is an illusion used by the pigs as a means of satisfying their lust for power. At the beginning of the book, Mr. Jones, the master of the farm, is irresponsible toward his animals, so old Major, a white boar, informs the other animals of the need to form a rebellion against Mr. Jones and the human race. The other animals embrace the idea of a revolution and develop a scheme to overthrow Mr. Jones. After the revolution is complete, the animals feel an immediate freedom, a set of commandments is developed for the new \\"Animal Farm,\\" and they all begin working together for a common good. However, it does not take long for the new society to begin to corrupt. The satisfaction of removing Mr. Jones from the farm prevents the animals from noticing the politics still going on within the farm. The animals are convinced by those in power that their memory of the original utopia and commandments are false. So long as the animals cannot remember the past, because it is being continually altered, they will have no control over the present and future. George Orwell is making a great political statement in Animal Farm with specific emphasis on mass rebellion. It personifies Karl Marx's ideas for communism and illustrates what can happen after a revolution with specific attention to the fact that every society is political and contains \\"pigs\\" who will always grab for power. This satirical fable leaves the reader with a better understanding of communism and the anatomy of political revolution in any culture."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"\\"Animal Farm\\" is considered today to be a great satirical novella, and is often called a fable or allegory, but perhaps the best way to describe it is to use Orwell's original title \\"Animal Farm - A Fairy Story\\". While it is considered a great and important work today, it had a difficult time being published. He wrote the story between November 1943 and February of 1944 (although he got the idea for the story in 1937), but he was turned down by four publishers before Secker and Warburg accepted the book. Even then it was not published until August of 1945. One of the publishers, Jonathan Cape, was originally going to publish the book, until he was warned against it by \\"an important official\\", who as it turned out was a Soviet spy.This story is a masterful in the way it recreates many of the historical events of the Soviet Union in the context of the farm. The Russian Revolution, the Russian Civil War, Stalin's removal of Trotsky, putting Lenin's body on display, the Great Purge, the replacement of the Soviet national anthem, the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact as well as the invasion by Nazi Germany are all portrayed in context of the story, and there are probably more examples as well. The characters as well have counterparts, in some cases they represent entire groups (e.g. the sheep represent the proletariats) and in other cases one or two individuals (e.g. Napoleon is Stalin, Snowball is Trotsky, Squealer is Molotov, Old Major is Karl Marx and Lenin, etc.). Even the humans in the story have counterparts, such as Mr. Jones (Czar Nicholas II), Mr. Frederick (Nazi Germany), Mr. Pilkington (The West).George Orwell is the pseudonym of Eric Arthur Blair, who was born on June 25th of 1903, and died on January 21st of 1950. He was a socialist for the majority of his life, and those who view \\"Animal Farm\\" or \\"1984\\" as a rejection of socialism are incorrect. He viewed totalitarianism as the opposite of true socialism, and while he probably approved of social revolutions he clearly thought that once the revolution was successful the best thing the people could do would be to take the power away from those who led the revolution. Some consider him a Trotskyist because of this story, but that too is incorrect. While Trotsky's character in the story is certainly not portrayed as badly as Stalin's, he is there for the initial corruption of the pigs.While this book may have had difficulty getting published initially, and was criticized by many because of its anti-Soviet (i.e. anti-ally) message, things have changed. Today it is a book of critical acclaim. It is still being recognized as well. For example, in 1996 in was awarded the Retro-Hugo award for best novella from the year 1945.The Everyman's Library edition of \\"Animal Farm\\" has some nice material included. There is an introduction by Julian Symons which goes into much more detail about Orwell's life as well as the history of this story. Next there is a Select Bibliography which covers Orwell's works. There is a chronology of Orwell's life, including historical and literature contexts for the most significant events in his life. There is a brief textual note by Peter Davison, discussing some of the decisions made in producing this edition. Then, following the text are the controversial preface to the book and the preface to the Ukranian edition.The preface which had been left out originally is particularly interesting, as it contains Orwell's thoughts which still have application in today's world. He wrote: \\"If one loves democracy, the argument runs, one must crush its enemies by no matter what means. And who are its enemies? It always appears that they are not only those who attack it openly and consciously, but those who \`objectively' endanger it by spreading mistaken doctrines. In other words, defending democracy involves destroying all independence of thought. This argument was used, for instance, to justify the Russian purges.\\" He also writes in the next paragraph: \\"These people don't see that if you encourage totalitarian methods, the time may come when they will be used against you instead of for you.\\""},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Orwell was passionately anti-Communist. He first drafted Animal Farm during WWII but was prohibited from publishing in case it weakened the unnatural alliance between America, Britain and Stalin's Russia. After 1945 there were no such restraints and Animal Farm became available to remind people how evil Communism really was. For the sake of clarity, the pigs are the Bolsheviks who take over the farm (Russia) seizing it from the humans (Tzars). Over time, the pigs become as corrupt as the humans had been before them.The contents of Animal Farm are known to many in the free world. But read it again because totalitarianism comes in many forms, Communism just being the most obvious one. With the current outrage following the World Towers disaster, it's interesting to note that those who follow and support the Taliban (bin Laden) have been deluded into believing that, by their submission, they're engaged in a noble cause.People like Saddam Hussein, just like the Communists of the Cold War era, disguise their crimes under the banner of acting for the 'common good'. They deceive their people with false information. They protect their political powers with force, terrorizing their dissenters into silence. All the while presenting themselves as selfless protectors of the common good.Communism is alive and well in China, North Korea, Vietnam and many other areas of the world. Totalitarianism flourishes in 50% of the rest of the world, including many countries of Latin America. The 'FREE' world, as we often refer to it, is little more than USA and Europe. We need to understand the threat, to enjoy and protect our freedoms. A good starting place to gain this understanding is Animal Farm.I first read this book when I was about 15. Now, over thirty five years later, I find that it still hasn't lost its power. There's a great deal more to it than just ' animals that run around and saying Comrade!'...."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Hmm, I don't think too much people actually interpret as I do, but then I might be wrong. But alot of people who have reviewed it have praised the book for bagging communism/socialism. I believe that it is more of a thought expanding book, Orwell encourages us to think openly because we can. He shows the possibilitys that a revolution can be 'abused'(admittidly it usually is eh) but Orwell wouldn't saying the conditions under the farmer is right either ?He also comments on how thought can rule people, and by reading some of the other reviews, especially the youngen's like zach and cluegen(or whatever), they are using this book to ensure them they are right and there is no other superior ideas to theirs. The other thing is the clever analogies he uses, people who keep saying 'this book is dumb, theres no such thing as a talking pig' etc. should look up the meaning of 'fiction' and realise what a novel is.all in all, realise what political bias will always be held in representations and keep the struggle. great book.oh yeah, it may surprise alot of ye amerikans, but orwell considered himself socialist go and check it.."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm is a provocative satiric fable which I thoroughly enjoyed. It is concisely written and vividly describes the struggle of the animals on Animal Farm. It certainly lives up to its reputation of being one of the best-selling novels of the twentieth century.On Manor Farm in England, the miserable animals decided that they had enough from the cruelty of Farmer Jones. The ideals of the Old Major, an elderly boar on the brink of death, filled the animals with noble inspirations. The animals envisioned a paradise where liberty, equality and fraternity would prevail. Working together under the guidance of the &quot;intelligent&quot; pigs, they drove away the humans. Animal Farm was established. All seemed well enough as the animals fought bravely at the Battle of Cowshed against Jones's counter-attack, as they toiled on in the fields and as they sang &quot;The Beasts of England&quot; with gusto. However, the scenic atmosphere was soon overshadowed by a veil of uncertainty and fear. The pigs, led by Napoleon, became more and more pig-headed. As these pigs milled down the fundamentals of Animalism - the 7 Commandments - life for the rest of the animals grew steadily harsher. Disagreement was never voiced and those who tried were exterminated. Others were cooed into dormancy by the brainwashing of Squealer the pig. The Old Major's principles faded into distance and when Napoleon &amp; Co. committed the ultimate crime the animals woke up only to find the catastrophe irreversible.Beneath the surface of the light hearted &quot;fairy tale&quot; lies an allegorical political satire. Orwell is highly critical of the Stalinist regime and its version of Socialism. He reveals the evils and despair of Stalinist Russia at a time (mid-1940's) when very little was know of the regime. Orwell explains the true ideals of communism and denounces Stalin for his betrayal of the Russian people, who had placed their faith and future in his hands. We are warned by Orwell the perils we dive into if we allow a tyrant to rule and our minds to drown in propaganda. He spells out the dangers that can strike our very own society.The characters in the novel are &quot;morphed&quot; famous or notorious political figures of the historical period. Napoleon, the pig leader, portrays the role of Stalin - the name gives rise to excellent connotations. Other personalities you will meet include the Czar, Churchill, Roosevelt, Frederick III and even Goebbels with his long snout. Other animals are made to represent a collective group of the population.Orwell rewrites Russian history in a &quot;reader friendly&quot; manner. He expresses his opinion with precision and clarity. It is a perfectly readable novel which at the same time delivers a strong message. Animal Farm is an intelligent book that provides insight into politics for beginners . Plenty of reading between the lines is required to capture the inner essence. It is a must for anyone who considers himself educated."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"I read this last year, and again this year as a school assignment and I love it.

I am in awe of the way Orwell can tell a tale on a simple level of literature, a satire on the russian government, and a guide to much deeper things... life's truths. Every person ought to read this book sometime in their life, preferably at an early age. In fact, they should read it the moment they become literate. Before that, they should hear it from someone else's mouth. If this isn't enough to convey my thoughts to you, let me continue. The pages of animal farm should wallpaper every reputable building. Due to time and space constraints, I must stop. If you only take one thing out of this review, let it be these 3 words. Read Animal Farm.

Then I was assigned to read it in 9th grade and got a D on the final exam. (I can still remember my teacher reading my score out loud in front of the class and saying \\"Try studying friend.\\") The problem was that our teacher wanted to present it as an allegorical account of the Russian Revolution and I didn't want to see it that way.Okay, I probably deserved the D (and maybe the public humiliation) for deciding that my take on the book was more important than my teacher's agenda, and I'm forced to concede that Orwell DID use the Russian Revolution as the basis of the novel.But I STILL feel that ANIMAL FARM shouldn't be interpreted SOLELY in reference to the Russian Revolution. Yes, it's an allegory. It isn't just a story of a group of animals who take over a farm, then find that the pigs are worse masters than the humans were. But it's not just about one particular revolution that went awry. It's about ANY attempt to overthrow tyranny that goes wrong because its leaders really want to establish their own tyranny.At a more general level, it's about ANY idealistic movement that goes wrong because some group of people within the movement really want to achieve their own self-serving goals. And it's about how ANY ideal can be twisted and corrupted. The famous statement that \\"all animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others,\\" probably sounds a lot like some type of policy that a lot of you have had to live under at some time or another.But ANIMAL FARM is also about the Russian Revolution. So, if you find yourself studying it under a teacher who feels that all students are equal, but that students who see it her way are more equal than others, try and see it her way and don't get yourself a D."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"America in 2000-2004 is living out Animal Farm at this very moment. It's all here in this classic from 1945: terrorism, a 9/11, a rebuilding of a WTC-like symbol, a war on terror, an elusive Osama/Saddam evildoer to be hunted down, a Code-Orange-like level of threat alert, an Axis-of-Evil, use of fear and deception to keep the population confused and distracted, rhetoric about freedom and patriotism that somehow never ceases to do the trick, lies and misrepresentations, government by the wealthy elite for the wealthy elite, political spin-meisters, trained political attack dogs, a hard-working but uninformed and easily-misled population, a tax-paying class that does all the work while a political-corporate elite reaps all the rewards, the wholesale selling-out of the hardest-working for the profit of the few, the re-writing of rules and regulations for the blatant benefit of the few, the unfulfilled promise of trade for the benefit of all, the unfulfilled promise of trickle-down economics, the promise of retirement robbed, the trusting, idealistic population that somehow never catches on and never tires of giving their \\"heroic\\" leader the benefit of the doubt again and again.To view Animal Farm as only being about socialism, communism, and Stalinism in Russia, and thus not applicable to America and capitalism and democracy, would be to miss its message about plutocratic leaders, in any system, blatantly exploiting a trusting, optimistic population's faith in their cherished system and ideals.The same author also has another uncanny book on today's America called Nineteen Eighty-Four. It may well have been the source of inspiration for the naming of such Bush administration programs as \\"Homeland Security Department\\", \\"Clear Skies Initiative\\", and \\"Healthy Forest Initiative\\".Highly recommended, a definite must-read for all Americans."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"From what we know about George Orwell, his politcial allegiances were complex and always subject to his own scrutiny. One thing can be said with a certain amount of scrutiny: he distrusted any form of government that claimed to be for everybody and claimed to disperse power among the masses. ANIMAL FARM is his warning.This fable, which is what it really is, condemns what Stalin had made of the Russian Revolution. Truth be told, Orwell was very much aware that anyone with power would have turned that revolution into revenue.But Capitalism is not spared either. When reading this novel closely, Orwell acknowledged that power was always seated where the money was evident. (Why else did the pigs make arrangements for trade with mankind?) This is an excoriating view of politics as power, and how no manifesto or declaration is free from the human greed that will opportunistically profit from it."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"After reading animal farm, i fel a bit dissappointed.

It has proven it is a true piece of art just based on the fact that to this day, 65 years after it was written, it is still a matter of debate as to just how significant it is! Some, and maybe understandablely dismiss this book at first glance. C'mon lets think here for a second. Here's a book about a group of animals that over-throw a group of humans. If that isn't enough, it has two pigs on the cover. But, if you give &quot;Animal Farm&quot; a chance you will find it to be a remarkable piece of literature. The ideas brought up in this book are still issues we can discuss to this very day. Orwell's wonderful use of symbolism and metaphors makes this book so interesting. There is really much more to this book than meets the eye. I honestly can not add anything really new or fresh to say that others haven't already said. &quot;Animal Farm&quot;, to me, is a major piece of literature that should be read by everyone.

Farm well that what happened in this book called Animal Farm by George Orwell. Everyone willingly try to pitch in a hand but then suddenly you have been told a to do a different job, and if don't do it the king Napolean will send the dogs after you. That's how it's been ever since the farmer Jones left the farm. Farmer Jones left big white letters on the side of a barn, and then letters became the animal's new seven commandments. And there are as follows: all animals are equal. No animal shall drink alcohol, wear clothes, sleep in a bed, or any animal with four legs or wing is a friend, an animal with two legs is an enemy. Later on, however the pigs who have styled themselves leaders of the farm. \\"We pigs are brainworkers. The whole management and organization of the farm depend on us. Day and night, we are watching over your welfare. It is for your sake that we drink milk and eat apples.\\" This was one of the many sayings that Napolean would say. There is one character that they nickname him the workhorse but his real name is Boxer, having given his all to his comrades. This book has two points of view. One person can see it as a fairy tale and another could see it as satire of a society in dictatorship. In the beginning an old pig named Major tells a story about a life without any humans, a life were animals are equal and ruled themselves. Major told them about the \\"Beast of England\\" a patriotic song that stood for animals' freedom. Later on in the book Major dies, but the words spoken at the rally remain in every animal's head and heart. As I read this Animal Farm I kept thinking about how familiar the story was and I finally figured it out.

These animals are used to portray Russian history. Seems weird doesn't it? But it makes sense! Everything in this book mirrors Russian history and the characters were created after Russian historical figures. It starts out with a pig named Old Major (who stands for Karl Marx) who sees visions of a wonderful revolution where animals will share everything and the world will be beautiful without any humans, especially Mr. Jones their master. Mr. Jones stands for Czar Nicholas II. They revolt from him and set up their own commandments, the Seven Commandments which includes things like &quot;no animals shall wear clothings&quot;, &quot;no animals shall sleep in a bed&quot;, &quot;no animals shall consume alchohol&quot;, and &quot;all animals are equal&quot;. The pigs, who are known as the smartest animals which is an actual fact, take over control of the farm. Napoleon stands for Stalin who wants a strong central government and wants to teach the young only while Snowball stands for Lenin who wants a democracy and to educate all of the people. The animals on the farm other than the pigs stand for common people. Boxer the horse stands for the physically strong people that aren't very smart. Benjamin the mule (Boxer's best friend) stands for the smart people who know what's going on, but are too stubborn to admit there is a problem. Clover stands for someone who's motherly and cares about every one else. The dogs stand for military people. The chickens stand for the smart, but weak people. The cats stand for the lazy people who don't want to do any work, but want to have rewards. Moses the Raven stands for religion with his talk of where animals go when they die (Sugar Candy Mountain). The sheep stand for the brainwashed people who can't think for themselves. Everything in this book happens for a reason. It's a weird story about how communism will never work because pigs will always be greedy pigs.It's a really great story about talking animals, but it's an even better story when you take it apart and analyze and think to yourself, &quot;but what if so and so got with so and so.... could they have stopped this from happening?&quot; The ending of this book is a really freaky ending...

It's all here in this classic from 1945: terrorism, a 9/11, a rebuilding of a WTC-like symbol, a war on terror, an elusive Osama/Saddam evildoer to be hunted down, a Code-Orange-like level of threat alert, an Axis-of-Evil, use of fear and deception to keep the population confused and distracted, rhetoric about freedom and patriotism that somehow never ceases to do the trick, lies and misrepresentations, government by the wealthy elite for the wealthy elite, political spin-meisters, trained political attack dogs, a hard-working but uninformed and easily-misled population, a tax-paying class that does all the work while a political-corporate elite reaps all the rewards, the wholesale selling-out of the hardest-working for the profit of the few, the re-writing of rules and regulations for the blatant benefit of the few, the unfulfilled promise of trade for the benefit of all, the unfulfilled promise of trickle-down economics, the promise of retirement robbed, the trusting, idealistic population that somehow never catches on and never tires of giving their &quot;heroic&quot; leader the benefit of the doubt again and again.To view Animal Farm as only being about socialism, communism, and Stalinism in Russia, and thus not applicable to America and capitalism and democracy, would be to miss its message about plutocratic leaders, in any system, blatantly exploiting a trusting, optimistic population's faith in their cherished system and ideals.The same author also has another uncanny book on today's America called Nineteen Eighty-Four. It may well have been the source of inspiration for the naming of such Bush administration programs as &quot;Homeland Security Department&quot;, &quot;Clear Skies Initiative&quot;, and &quot;Healthy Forest Initiative&quot;.Highly recommended, a definite must-read for all Americans."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"I am so angry that I didn't read Karin's review before I bought this \\"book\\".

From a glance, this book is a story of a small farm in England called Manor Farm, which tries to, and successfully throws out the humans and thrive without the pesky beings eating the fruit of their labor. The rebellion starts from Old Major's dream, which reminds the animals of their ancestors' dream, and the song, \\"Beasts of England.\\" The animals set down the laws of \\"Animalism,\\" and paint the Seven Commandments on the walls of the main barn. The humans try to re-inhabit their farm which the animals renamed, \\"Animal Farm\\" and created a green flag and a symbol representing the independence of the animals. This conflict results in the battle of the cowshed and windmill. Snowball disappears to another neighboring farm. Everyone gropes for someone to be their scapegoat and blame their misfortune on, and when Snowball leaves they find that person. The farm creatures attempt to design and build a windmill. They get it completed, but their enemies, the humans, return with dynamite and destroy it. To see if they ever get the windmill back up, and if the pigs will tyrannize the farm, and if the humans will reclaim their farm, read \\"Animal Farm,\\" by George Orwell.Do you enjoy other classics where animals struggle to overcome nature or themselves? If you said \\"yes,\\" then I would recommend you to read \\"White Fang,\\" and \\"The Call of the Wild.\\" I'm a seventh grade middle school student in North Carolina."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"The book was a quick read. It was a short book that holds much information. While reading Animal Farm, it seemed a bit boring but really I found out that it was an important book. Actually, it seemed very logical and easy enough to understand that George Orswell was using a heavy form of metaphor. The metaphor was that farm animals such as pigs/boars, cows, donkeys, and sheep were acting as though they were humans, specifically in a Communist environment. It is very quirky but interesting how Orswell uses this as an example to show the break-down of a Communist government. Furthermore, even though it is all about farm animals out in the country, it still gives a strict and formative idea about Communism among humans. Overall: it deserves to be on the classic list close towards number 1."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm is a complex book. I hate it when conservatives/republicans use it as an excuse to bash liberals. For example, the review titled \\"Liberal Pigs\\" is a ridiculous and inaccurate interpretation of this masterpiece. If whoever wrote that bothered to do a little research on Orwell (well actally Blair), they would know that he was in fact a socialist. He was not against Socialism, he was against people who take something that is supposed to be egalitarian and benificial for all into something used for their own advatage (like Stalin). To whoever wrote that: next time you start making assumptions about one of the greatest books ever written, I suggest you know what you're talking about first."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm is about animals that are mistreated so they take over the Manor Farm. The pigs were the smartest animals on the farm they were in charge. One of the pigs betrayed the farm so he was banished. The lead pig was actually a boar. His name was Napoleon. In the book there is two wars. The wars were vicious and cruel. The animals tried and succeeded at building a windmill, but then the pig that betrayed them destroyed it overnight. After two long years a bigger and better windmill was built. Then the horrible thing happened, other farmers came and destroyed the windmill with sticks of dynamite. After several months the strongest animal on the farm, his name was Boxer, died because Napoleon sent him to a glue factory. Many years later the animals were hard at work and the pigs were just like humans. To me the book was confusing and hard to figure out. I liked how the animals could talk. The number one thing I did not like about the book was how none of the animals stood up to Napoleon. I did not like the ending the author made."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm is a book about the animals of the Manor Farm and their desire to end their lives of servitude to the oppressive Mr. Jones. The animals revolt and start their own society and rename Manor Farm, Animal Farm.The animals are lead by the pigs because of their superior knowledge. Two pigs, Napoleon and Snowball, are the main leaders but they are always fighting whether they really disagree or not. Eventually Napoleon has his guraddogs chse Snowball off the farm. With Napoleon as their new leader things only go downhill as the pigs slowly change the basic rules of society in their favor. The animals are once again living in oppression as their rations are decreased and they are forced to work long hours with little rest. Near the end, the pigs start to live as if they themselves were humans.I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in communism and its history. This book reflects a communist government and shows readers what life was like for people living in this type of society. This book is very easy to visualize but has a somewhat complex vocabulary and it made me do a lot of thinking about history and what life was like in other parts of the world. This is a book that can be easy to read but hard to put down. The animals are promised lives of freedom and happiness but eventually go back to living as they had been for many years in the past."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"It starts with a dream of a better tomorrow. One of the oldest pigs living in Manor Farm dreams of an animal revolution, where the animals will rebel against their human tormentors and take control for themselves, living in a peaceful, better world. This pig, Major, dies soon afterwards, but he has given them the idea, and within a short amount of time, the animals are in control. Victory has been declared.As in all societies, the residents of the renamed Animal Farm draw up a set of rules to be followed. Their Seven Commandments are written up, and those are the rules that nobody can break. Then, with a need for some sort of leadership, Snowball, a pig (who are of higher intelligence than the other animals), steps in. They start to build, and to plan, and then trouble starts. Napoleon, another pig, also wants a sense of power, and drives Snowball out of the farm.There begins a new stage of the farm animals. Meetings to discuss the good of the animals end, and Napoleon starts to twist facts around to convince the other animals of the \\"true\\" story, and many of them believe. Slowly, slowly, every original rule in the Seven Commandments gets changed, amended, or wiped, until they're are left with one final rule:All animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others.This is the last thing remaining, years and years after the animal revolution. The ducks begin to sing a different song, the name is changed, again, and something happens to change everything once more.The book is extremely symbolic. I doubt that Orwell actually meant animals once in this story. \\"Animal Farm\\" shows what happens in \\"equal\\" societies when there is one person who is slightly more in command, and what happens to revolutions of the underdogs. After reading this, I found myself thinking very hard about revolutions, communism, dictatorship, and the circle of bad they bring.This book is a must read. It's not too long, but every word is meaningful and important. The book is easy to read (the way it's written is very simple, possibly so that it may seem like animals wrote it), and makes things much easier to understand. The ending is thoughtful, kind of hopeless, and almost sad. It's an incredible book. There is no argument whether or not you should read this, because one can learn so much. I know I did, and I'm confident others will too, even if they don't like the rather simplistic writing style used."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Everything I needed to know about politics I learned from Animal Farm. Every revolution contains the seeds of its own corruption and the next revolution; one privileged class is always replaced by another. As long as human nature is what it is, the need for revolution will not end and the manipulation of public sentiments will not end either. All the usual suspects are personified here in the gullible sheep, to the loyal \\"work horse\\" who falsely believes his work makes him valuable to the party, to the pigs who learn to take advantage of their positions for their own gain at the expense of the others. The governments tendency to use people for its own ends cannot be ignored in this all too familiar alegory. A must read before you vote."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"The book is written by Eric Arthur Blair with the pen name of George Orwell. In this novel he speaks of Communism, why it is actually more of a bane than a boon. He got the idea of writting a book from an animals perspective when one day, he saw a little boy of about 10 years of age driving a huge cart-horse along a narrow path, whipping it whenever it tried to turn. It struck him that if only such animals became aware of their strength humans should have no power over them. He felt that humans exploit animals in much the same way as the rich exploit the proletariat. He thus began to analyse Marxism from the animal's point of view. This book is for both the young and old who are interested to know why Communism is said to be bad when it actually seems to act fairly on paper. Readers will enjoy the irony of Marxism when implemented on the animals, at the same time they learn the vital weaknessess that expels Communism from being an viable alternative in anyway.

A very facinating book."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animals Gone Wild...By Lily StarbuckGeorge Orwell's fable, Animal Farm, tells the tale of frustrated animals who overthrow their master Mr. Jones, who owns the Manor Farm. Through many hard times and conflicts it comes down to who can survive the new farm life. New leaders, new problems, new jobs, everything is changing for the better. Or is it? Orwell is able to portray the idea \\"absolute power corrupts absolutely.\\" Animal Farm is a quick read and has a loud and clear message, which Orwell shows through a microcosm of the 1917 Russian revolution.The animals have one goal in mind after they defeat Mr. Jones. That goal would be change. And through this change there will be laws, the Seven Commandments that will help keep the animals equal with one another and make sure the animals don't acquire human-like habits, because the animals don't want to become like the humans who have treated them so terribly and striped them of their freewill. While reading the book you see some animals are starting to create a different status for themselves on the farm, making them more important and able to instruct as well as make decisions for the other animals. I know that while reading Animal Farm I felt angry at the animals that let a new leader control them. Only some of the characters didn't remain loyal to their new leader, and that to me showed bravery, for standing up for something they knew had to be stopped.George Orwell used farm animals to illustrate the struggle for the control of the Soviet Union. The two pigs, Snowball and Napolean, from Animal Farm resemble Leon Trotsky and Joseph Stallin who both fought over power in Russia. Both Napolean and Stallin took all the power for themselves and became greedy and selfish, therefore not fulfilling their promises to their followers. The struggle for authority, throughout history, is an ongoing process.I truly enjoyed reading Animal Farm. It wasn't a book where you couldn't put it down but one you find time to read in the oddest moments. George Orwell was an amazing writer. He made learning a life lesson and learning part of history simple and enjoyable.

Rarer still to be unforgettable and insightful and life-changing. Animal Farm, for me was all this.The allegory is powerful and the use of farm animals both clever and entertaining, and helped makes the story all the more vivid and memorable. The story is well know, a group of farm animals eventually led by the boar Napoleon, overthrow the capitalist farmer and create an idealistic worker's paradise. Little by little and bit by bit they become not only as corrupt as the former system, but even worse as exemplified by their ruthlessness and hypocrisy. The reader comes away much more cynical about utopian ideals, which sounds like a bad thing but is actually a good thing. Incredibly powerful book, with the weight of truth and some kind of native energy that makes a despairing fairy-tale into a life-changing lesson. I've read plenty of books that I've enjoyed more, but few I've been so drastically impacted by.

But it quickly ceases being entertaining, and becomes very realistic. Ride up the roller coaster of genuine hope that communism could work, and then down into the depths of war and murder. Finally, settle into a gray, hopeless dictatorship that lasted 70 years for the USSR, but repeats itself in other countries today. If you want the power of irony, this is about as powerful as it gets: these animals do kill each other (if not their own species). Pigs!

Brovo"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"The story is well described in the other reviews, especially in the first one above from the professional reviewer, but I do find it necessary to point out a few observations:First: George Orwell is a literary genius. There's a reason why he graces the cover of the book:Don't Weep for Me, America: How Democracy in America Became the Prince (While We Slept). If you liked \\"Animal Farm\\", \\"1984\\" is going to knock you into another thought paradigm.Secondly, and more important: Whether you read about \\"Animal Farm\\" from the professional reviewers, Cliff Notes, or in the introduction to the book itself, there is one self-imposed \\"limitation\\" that stays consistent throughout, and that is the sovereign state Orwell has in mind when he wrote \\"Animal Farm\\" (or \\"1984\\" for that matter)is the Soviet Union. While this may be true, the bigger and more relevant point is getting missed. This bigger and more relevant point is that for ANY sovereign nation, when there is a change of power in its governance (for its betterment), it is ALWAYS the case, I repeat, it is ALWAYS the case that the new governance will gradually become the same as the one it replaced. Look no further than the United States of America. The 1776 rebels overthrew the British tyrant, King George III, mostly due to oppressive business practices, taxes and lack of representation. And look where we are today, in 2008! Corporations rule. Taxes, which we already fought one war over, are exorbitant, and Congress is simply a millionaires club representing the wealthy.How do we know that George Orwell saw this happening? Because he worked in the BBC and the BBC was spewing the SAME propaganda that the Soviet Union was using. How do we know this? Because writer Martin Esslin worked at the BBC at the same time as Orwell and he wrote that this was the case! For further reference, see my review of the book:U.S. Television News and Cold War Propaganda, 1947-1960 (Cambridge Studies in the History of Mass Communication).So the point, as is the point with ALL my reviews is this: Become a CRITICAL THINKER!"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"The book was in great condition and was promptly delivered. I highly recommend using you guys again."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"George Orwell's classic novel, Animal Farm, is basically a book that shows the reader all of the problems with communism. Animal Farm first addresses the problem of how tempting communism sounds to the uninformed, and in some cases uneducated, ear. Doesn't it sound nice that everyone pulls their own weight and everyone reaps the benefits? It did to the animals of Manor Farm. At first it was great without those pesky humans around; the animals ate all of the food and got to keep their children. However, it quickly became very obvious that this system wasn't working. The pigs, the smartest of all the farm animals, began to take over led by Napoleon and Snowball. Soon after the establishment of Animal Farm (formerly known as Manor Farm) seven commandments were set forth such as \\"no animal shall sleep in a bed\\", \\"no animal shall kill any other animal\\", \\"all animals are equal\\", etc. After Napoleon ran Snowball off the farm with vicious dogs, Napoleon claimed full leadership of the farm and its animals. One by one, Napoleon modified each of the seven commandments to fit his liking such as \\"no animal shall drink alcohol to excess.\\" In the end of the book it is impossible for Clover, a horse of Manor Farm (formerly known as Animal Farm and more formerly known as Manor Farm), to tell the difference between the pigs and humans while they are playing a card game.I would recommend this book to the reader that loves irony. Throughout the story I kept wondering who was going to be the first animal to figure out that in order get rid a tyrant (Mr. Jones the farm owner) they acquired another (\\"Comrade\\" Napoleon). Alas I was relieved when a horse realized that Napoleon was changing the commandments for his own benefit. However, when the horse kept this knowledge to himself I was angry at him. I asked myself, \\"Why wouldn't he show the animals who Napoleon really is?\\" I never figured it out but for the reader who loves character analysis, this is the book for you! However, this book isn't written for the people who want everything spoon-fed to them. But for the reader that feels the need to read between the lines Animal Farm is full of mysteries for you to figure out."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"I read this book back in freshman year of high school and later saw the movie since I liked it so much. Orwell's idea was fresh and intriguing. What if animals decided they wanted to be dominant and overthrow mankind? The moral, under the tale, is what gives this book a five star review.It is human nature to do what we can to remove anyone who is oppressing us. People like to be free to make their own decisions and pursue their dreams. Such was the case with the animals. They got rid of the human and set up their own laws. At first, things were great. But the pigs took over and became just as corrupt, if not more so, than the human they hated. The important thing to consider in any situation is when you get rid of one bad influence, you need to replace it with a good influence or you'll end up in the same situation as before.

I had never seen anything like it, but I knew it was about how power was used and abused, how it twisted the hearts of those who held it, pursuing a logic of its own. That reading experience was the start, I think, of my love for history and politics. I enjoyed the book so much that I gave it to my children, who have also become fascinated with the many levels you can find in it.It was only much later that I realized the story was first about the USSR, with the dream of the old pig (Marx), and the fights between substitutes for Lenin, Trotsky/Zinoviev, and Stalin. Though many reviewers harp on this as a lesson against communism, I see that as only one level on which the book can be read: it goes much deeper than that, as a critique not just of totalitarianism but of the soul of man, how we can justify horrible behavior not only as naked self-interest, but under an ideological cloak.Any interpretation, I think, will fail to do justice in any definitive way to what Orwell intended: to provoke discussion on our own choices and actions, on our will to make horrible compromises in our pursuit of some idea of justice or equality.Warmly recommended.

A must read for everyone."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Written by George Orwell and published on August 17, 1945, Animal Farm is a powerful and scathing review of Communism in the former Soviet Union. Based on the story of the Russian Revolution, it grabs you from the very first sentence and is practically an addicting book to read from start to finish. The story itself is very simple and easy to follow, however, the message it gives you is one that is powerful. This book is one you definitely need to think over when you finish reading it, if even for only a brief minute.Animal Farm is the story of the animals on Mr. Jones' farm. They are abused frequently and harshly overworked, considering themselves to be slaves to him. This abusive treatment, in combination with the words of the wise old boar, Old Major, spark ideas for revenge, freedom, and revolution. The animals, after Major's death, quickly act out their plans, overthrowing the alcoholic Mr. Jones and Mrs. Jones out of the farm and claiming it is their own, \\"Animal Farm\\"Following Mr. Jones' expulsion from Animal Farm, the pigs take over, having prepared for leadership by learning how to read and write. Despite this, things seem to be great at first; freedom finally gracing the animals for the first time in their lives. Through complex propaganda and scaring tactics, the animals slowly lose all the freedom they worked to regain. This continues until the end of the novel, where they are found to be in the exact same position they started in, maybe arguably being in even a worse position.Through Orwell's use of symbolism, parallels can be made from \\"Animal Farm\\" to the Russian Revolution, teaching you, in a way, like a history book would (Of course I'm not insinuating you read this novel in place of one). The animals all relate to real life people who held significance during the time and actually tell the tale very accurately. Despite this, Orwell is able to make you become attached to some characters, and, at times, can get you angry at what they are forced to endure.Animal Farm is, to say the least, a classic read. While the story is a short one, the messages it leaves behind are huge and inspiring. This story, while sad and depressing in nature, is definitely one I would recommend to anybody. George Orwell has made a masterpiece with this story."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"I am forced to give this book 5 stars it won't allow me to give it 4.99999 stars.The only thing I didn't like was that it was too short."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"I read 1984 first and then Animal Farm.

As the Western world continues to flirt with \\"greater\\", and most definitely bigger, government; this book shows how foolhardy we are to believe in its tenets. Yes, we are foolish. History is replete with its failures, and Orwell spins a tale in \\"Animal Farm\\" that demonstrates these morals. Ultimately, the comrade leader pigs end up no better than the previous masters of the farm - even becoming like them in the way they look. \\"All are equal, but some are more equal than other\\", is a phrase that you'll definitely take away from this book. It perfectly sums up how the collective society ultimately finds itself. I highly recommend this book, not just for an image of what the Soviet Union was, but where we may indeed find ourselves if we do not learn from history."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"A book that needs no introduction: Animal Farm by George Orwell. It's a short read, maybe 2 or 3 hours, but has more substance than probably any book of that length ever written. It deals directly with the idea of civilization, what it is, and more importantly what it should be. While the story certainly deals directly with Communism and Totalitarianism, and might I add in a very entertaining way, Orwell was clever enough to point out that it is the sheep of any civilization who yield the most power; unfortunately they usually aren't smart enough to use this to their advantage. After reading Animal Farm it is not uncommon when watching the news to suddenly see every political move as an action by the pigs and every victory for the sheep as a leap over a fence into despair. Ironically, this is one of the best books on human sociology ever written and I highly recommend that you read it."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This tiny, seemingly insignificant little book is hardly what it seems. An individual can read through it in less than a few hours and not get anything but an animal cruelty message from it. Or that same individual can look deeper into the pages and can take days, even weeks, to read this story of animals in rebellion of mankind. It is metaphor central and most of it needs to be gently preened from the soil of the pages to be understood. Perhaps that is the beauty of it. Though it does not take a genius to read, it does take a critical eye to recognize the socialist, governmental metaphors scattered throughout the tiny pages.It is not a surprise that Orwell leaves us with a sense of doom and drudgery when we read his novels. His popular book \\"1984\\" gives us this same sense at its conclusion. That perhaps we have not gone anywhere at all with the story. Well, at least the characters haven't. What is left with us is a profound message about the world he lived in. It would be a mistake to say that our world is profoundly different from the metaphors of these profound novels, which suggests that, yes, we have not progressed much. Only the individual mind may do so and that is up to us. At the very least, Orwell can open our eyes."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This is the kind of book to read and reread, and never forget. No matter how old you are, you will find this brilliant book an indisposable addition to your bookshelf.

Orwell deserves credit for this literary and philosophical masterpiece!"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"The book Animal Farm by George Orwell is about the life on a farm. The animals and the farm duties are neglected and the animal are fled up with Farmer Jones. lead by a prize pig Major the animals decide to revelt. The aminals take over the farm and run the farm for thenselves when doing this they change the name to Animal Farm and then they were completely in charge. later the story of the animals break the rule and make their own rules for life on the farm. This only leads to problems with the different operation of the farm.This story is told in a simple strahtfoward style. Also this story is fictitious story that is a fable. This means that is usually has a moral and animals act like humans. Orwell did a excellent job of making these animals look like humans. An example of this is how the dogs still bite and growl and the still support Napoleon's drive for political power. Another example is how the pigs eat mash and they also drink whiskey. Also how they walk on two legs by the end of the story. For me, the moral of this story was reveled in the last lines of the story. &quot;Twelve voices were shouting in anger, and they were all alike. No question, now what had happened to the faces of the pigs. The creature outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again, but already it was imposible to say which was which&quot;(p.p,139). Also this story has great description that kept the students or readers interested. This book was very the plot of the story very well. This happened when the last commandment was written &quot;But some Animal are more equal than othes&quot;. This had been proven true when the pigs rebelled from all other farm commandments and owner. This book seemed to be very interesting and realist, for this reason I did liked. Even though these were animals, their actions were almost just like humans. This story makes you see that there isn't a perfect society anywhere. However, there is always someone who tries to prove themselves superior to others by breaking the rules. This is a excellent book, you should read it. EXCELLENT BOOK !"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This was a fun book to read.

Hey, what book by George Orwell isn't good?The book takes place on an English Farm called Manor Farm which is owned by Mr. Jones. Mr. Jones is a very bad farmer who neglects the animals. He gets drunk almost everyday and doesn't feed the animals. One day, after years of mistretament, one of the animals gives a compelling speech to rebel against Mr. Jones and to take over the farm. Inspired by the speech, all the animals on the farm make a plan and carry it out. They are successful and take over the farm.The plot of the story takes the reader through the trials and tribulations of what the animals do to keep the farm going and to stay alive.At first the farm is successful and all the anaimals are happy. But the choosen leader of the farm, a pig named Napolean, gets power hungry and does what's best for him and his fellow pigs and doesn't care for the other animals on the farm. Napolean starts acting like a communist leader and wants all the other animals to be scared of him and to be loyal to his regime.As time goes by, Napolean starts acting like a human. He starts sleeping on the bed in the farm house, starts to drink alcohol and plays poker. These are things the animals promised not to do. Eventually, Napolean becomes a leader who is even worse than Mr. Jones ever was.This is a very good book with a great plot and compelling conclusion. This is a very book which anyone can read and enjoy. The plot of the book is great with new surprising story lines rising every chapter. This book keeps the reader intrigued and the book is very suspenseful. I recommend that you read this book."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Political satire written so simply taht a child could understand.Animals revolt against the tyranny of a farm owner.

There are really two stories going on simultaneously in this book: that of the pigs taking over Animal Farm from the inside, and that of Lenin, Trotsky, and Stalin - each of whom is represented by a particular pig in the story. Every part of society, from the working class, to the bourgeoisie, to the religious people, are represented in this novel.

When my teacher described the plot, it all seemed quite interesting and clever. But when I read it, I found it to be utterly disappointing. The plot was not carried out well. The characters were made very generic. I would NOT recommend this book."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Having read this book 45 years ago I now see it is far more profound today in 2010 America than in the 1940's. Sitting securely in a free market Capitalist United States in the 60's, I merely enjoyed this book and thought to myself \\"Thank God this could NEVER happen in America\\". Back then I was glad our limited government (although growing too big) was keeping an eye out for monopolies and other sins of capitalism but they kept out of the way of free-market enterprise and the entrepreneurship of the average citizen. I trusted politicians back then to keep the peace and HELP the country's private sector and big business produce wealth for private use and distribution etc., you know, capitalism that made this country so great. Yes, I was taught the constitution in school and became very proud of the American way and her founders.Today everything has changed in America and this book describes exactly what is happening in this country just without Orwell even being alive to appreciate how right he was. The sad thing is this: Orwell (a devout democratic socialist) died believing that he had simply, and masterfully shown in his book what happened to the Soviet Union under \\"uniquely\\" corrupt leaders, Stalin, Lenin and Marx; i.e. trying to say that IF only socialism were done \\"correctly\\" it was the best system. BUT because those three men were uniquely corrupt men, then socialism lead (unnecessarily) to Totalitarianism. Orwell truly believed however that if not for \\"them\\" (they were unique, and not representative of 'all' men) everything about socialism and communism would have worked out fine.Scholars argue that Orwell's book is really a great defense of capitalism, just quite unintended to be by the author. It is a defense of capitalism in a back-handed sort of way, But Orwell clearly thought that he was just sending a warning to socialists like himself to be careful not to let this happen. The beauty of the book is that it really does describe what will happen when capitalism is replaced with socialism. Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely - however this is not \\"unique\\" to some men but all men. Unfortunately Orwell is clearly blind to the facts of historical reality. He has religous faith in his own concepts.The great lesson of this book (Capitalism is better than Socialism) is obfuscated by the (early in the book) characterization of the capitalists as \\"Alcoholics\\". This is, by the way, how we know that Orwell despised capitalism and establishes beyond doubt he hates the free market system. He in no way advocates for the American way, he is quite anti-American to be sure. He very unceremoniously dismisses all capitalists in one prejudiced swipe of the brush stroke \\"alcoholic\\". Hardly a fair treatment of such a complex system and one so historically successful. None-the-less THE ingenious question that this book will cause every reader to ask themselves is this: Do you think all men are corrupt and need policing, or only some? Orwell answers himself and says \\"only some\\". He never gave up his position on the potential ability of socialism to create Utopia. He simply believed IF the right men were in charge then Utopia would last.Since historical fact shows inevitably all socialist systems (Utopia) lead to totalitarianism (Dystopia) the book falls short of greatness. History shows it is not just some but all men will devolve into their lowest form when left unchecked. By creating a capitalist straw-man then burning it down so easily he belies his bias and shows his colors. Too bad Orwell, you shouldn't have done that, it's intellectually lazy and actually makes his book very much like the character \\"Squealer\\", the propagandist.Finally the characters in this book remind me of current politicians and organizations: Obama - \\"Old Major\\" and Harry Reid - \\"Napolean\\" and Pelosi - \\"Snowball\\" and MSNBC - \\"Squealer\\"I highly reccomend this book to both Conservatives and Progressives alike and challenge someone to write a book that treats the Capitalists fairly and displays how the U.S. Constitution was designed to police free-market capitalism. America's government worked effectively as a small police force until progressiveism infiltrated and now brings in socialism. Orwell got everything right except that. Insanity is doing the same thing again and expecting a different result."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This review is in reference to the signet paperback version.

Maybe someone else can get into this book more but I didn't like it personally."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This is one of the best books that I have ever read. Every action every character makes is carefully planned, every word deliberately placed. I heard somewhere the the author spent 10 years on the dialogue alone. The book has two major brilliant points -- taking it for it's secret meaning, allegorically representing the American Revolution, and taking it for it's straight meaning, humans are evil. Each character carefully represents a major figure in the revolution (i.e. Mollie=France, Napoleon=George Washington and Squealer=Martha Washington. Snowball is, of course, England, and we can't forget last but not least Moses, who is the later-to-be Confederate States of America, and who speaks of The Great South when he talks of Sugarcandy Mountain).On another note, though, taking the book for it's literal meaning, one can easily tell that Orwell thinks that humans are evil and twisted -- it's amazing that 65 years ago someone got it so right. Every referance to humans is a bad one. In the card game it was Plinktington that cheated, Jones treating the animals poorly, and the owner of Foxwood, a lazy bum: representing the only three types of humans you will ever encounter. I think that Orwell's writing is ingenius and unequalled, especially his many-time quoted saying &quot;All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others.&quot; Man! Just can't compare to that. His words flow like a river of tar, or something. We should start a new branch of Judaism worshipping him as the Messiah, his words are the words of God. Anyone who hasn't read this book hasn't lived -- all the other reviews I have read have it dead on correct."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"I am not one of those stupid people whose only exuse for not liking a book is that &quot;it's boring.&quot; Animal Farm is definately NOT boring.

I understand the point of the book, but I still don't like it. I suggest that you read this book, but skip the end."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This book sure sends a strong warning. When you have a political party that uses bait and switch tactics to stir up a revolution, chances are the perpeptrators of the phony revolution are no different than those already in power. The trouble, however, is that it is often difficult to detect him or her as the villian especially if their revolution that they push forth sells well. Once in power, it doesn't take long for these same villains to go against what they claimed to stand for and then make excuses for their otherwise inexcusable actions just to stay in power all the while leaving others in no better shape than they were before the revolution.\\"Animal Farm\\" is unfortunately very similar to the way conservatives from Barry Goldwater to Ronald Reagan to Newt Gingrich to George W. Bush promised smaller government, smaller taxes, morality reform, privacy rights, etc ... . However, once in power, government increased especially with wasteful spending in defense, taxes were reduced for the wealthy and business elite at the expense of increasing hidden taxes like social security and general costs to the lower and middle class, pushing for more BIG BROTHER legislation, and all the while doing nothing to clamp down on the actual cultural decline that they had promised to clean up such as abortion, murders, affirmative action, divorces, sexual escapades, etc ...The next time you meet a conservative or libertarian who promises less government and less taxes, read this book and you'll see why it's better to reform the party that's currently in power rather than try an unknown candidate who may turn out to be none more than the same or even worse."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"I was assigned to read this book for my summer reading program at school.

I did not enjoy it just like everyone had told me. It was a good portrayal of how governments and communism is but using animals to portray this was a poor choice. I actually laughed alot at this book as I read it realizing that I was reading a book about animals personified as humans but yet totally against the human race.

Supported by Squealer(Goebbles the minister for propaganda)he takes advantage of the more dump animals(the folk), who work for his luxuary.The industrial revolution is expressed by the windmill, but in the film it moves more and more to the background.

Only problem I find with this book is it some what takes on a childish form of writting, almost like one of a fairy tale or a kids story.

It may be too sophistacted for younger children but once you get into it, the book is an amazing combination of action, dialogue and politics.A farm is being over worked. The animals revolt in the beginning of the story. Their take over was surprisingly easy. Of course later in the story the humans come back which takes the form of \\"The Battle of the Cowshed,\\" and \\"The Battle of the Windmill.\\" Over all, the book has several casualties. One happens because an animal sees a traitor in a dream.This story could be too violent for young children. Toward the middle of the story the pigs start changing the commandments that they wrote before the revolt. Eventually they change the commandments from \\"all animals are equal,\\" to \\"all animals are equal but some are more equal than others.\\"Later in the story the pigs (who are smarter) learned how to walk and started carrying whips. They did it so gradually the other animals don't notice.The moral of the story is \\"power is addictive once you have it you crave more.\\" Furthermore it is almost impossible to find a good leader that cannot get addicted to control."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"I don't usually write reviews on well-known works of fiction because most have read them, and there are hundreds of reviews about these works already. But \\"Animal Farm\\" is one of the few books that say so much while being so short, and that reveals genius. This book can be quickly read. The concepts and themes are important, frightening--and real. These things did occur in recent world history ie., Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, among others. Many people in the world could benefit from reading it. It reveals the dark side of human nature. If such evil could occur so recently in our so-called modern age, what can take place now or in the not-so-distant future? It has happened before and it will happen again.

Thanks to those who have shared this insight.One thing I discovered from reading &quot;Animal Farm&quot;, however, was that a reader does not need to completely understand the Soviet Union or understand anything of the Soviet Union, for that matter, to enjoy this book. &quot;Animal Farm&quot; is about what happened in Russia, but could be a about what could happen in any totalitarian regime, where the government subordinates all aspects of its citizens' lives to the authority of the state, with a single charismatic leader as the ultimate authority.So if you think you must understand Russian History before reading this book, you don't.&quot;Animal Farm&quot; is an interesting and very well written book."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"I chose this novel to read as an outside project.

I also learned how the characters in Animal Farm related to the individuals that participated in the Russian Revolution. Most students think of the subject of history boring and unintersting, but if students could learn about history the way that George Orwell wrote it in this novel, students' interest in history would sky rocket.This particular novel was written in such a way that it was educational and interesting, which is usually very hard to find. I am still in awe on how impressed I am with this novel.The best quality of this novel is the ending.

I really enjoyed the novel. The novel really didn't have any boring chapters because in each one, something different would happen. Right from the beginning, the novel started out very exciting and fast when the animals overthrew Mr. Jones and kicked him out of the farm. In each chapter, the pigs would do something more cruel to the other animals until they had basically taken over the farm.I really enjoyed how the novel was told through an animals perspective. Eventhough the novel was written in the 3rd person view, I really enjoyed seeing what the animals went through on a day to day basis. I liked reading about how the pigs slowly to control of the animals, and turned the farm into it's original state where they were slaves and not free.I also liked to see what the pigs would do next. In every chapter, the pigs would do something cruel or mean to the other animals so they could get complete control over the farm. The pigs were completely corrupt and controlled by the power they possessed over the other animals. Throughout the novel, the pigs started doing things more and more like the humans did. Until in the end, the animals couldn't even tell the difference between the pigs and the humans. The pigs were very violent with the other animals when they would do something wrong or against the pigs. Every animal that would betray the pigs was slaughtered by Napoleon's vicious dogs that he had trained to kill.I highly recommend this book to other readers. It contains suspense, action, and drama.

The story is about how a bunch of animals took over a farm from humans, installing a government that started working perfectly as it was based on idealistic concepts, but turned corrupt with time. An excellent plot review is available in this page's editorial review. The book is short and very easy too read (almost to easy), the narrative is simple and entertaining, again, like a fable.But what is the strongest side of Animal Farm? For me, the time period when it was written. This means, that today you will enjoy this book, but not as much as somebody who read it when it was first published. For example, if you read the book thinking that it was written last year, you would probably think that it's ok, another interesting form of telling the story of Communism, but just that.

Another problem is napoleon and snowball are agents each other cause snowball wants the farm to be a democracy and napoleon wanted it to be a communism. This book shows great symbolism with animals and forms of government. It shows totalitarianism, communism, democracy, and anarchy.

This was a big mistake. In the beginning of Animal Farm it is happy. Animals overcome their master and they rule the farm. It eventually goes downhill from there. Pigs take over and eventually change the animal \\"commandments\\" that they animals had created after taking over humans. Pigs end up looking and acting the same as humans. The pigs abuse horses and other helpless animals. This is one of the most depressing and disturbing books I have ever read. I found absolutely no enjoyment or insight from this novel!

If one has read &quot;Animal Farm&quot; no doubt they have because either they read &quot;1984&quot; or vice versa. If not it is a must to read Orwell's most well known masterpiece, &quot;1984&quot;, because it strikes a very similar chord as &quot;Animal Farm&quot; does. And like &quot;1984&quot;, &quot;Animal Farm&quot; is strikingly prophetic and amazingly accurate in depicting our government today. At Animal Farm, Napoleon simply changed the rules pertaining to himself while the others still had to abide by them much the same way as government creates loopholes today for high-ranking government officials; i.e. the recent presidential impeachment trial. &quot;ALL ANIMALS ARE EQUAL, BUT SOME ANIMALS ARE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS.&quot; How true."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm begins as a tale of triumph over the human race for animals. Yet as it continues you realize the humans never really left. The pigs take over and become the one thing they swore they hated. The worst part is the other animals don't do anything about it and suffer, and whether they do in the future or not we never find out. If happy endings are your thing, forget about this book, because it only represents the cruelest and hardest parts of life, from where there is no rescue. It is disappointing in happiness, yet you cant leave the book unsatisfied, for it does contain a powerful message,we all need to learn whether we like to hear it or not. Life is not all sugar and gumdrops, it also contains Brussels sprouts and tripe, and some people only get the sprouts and tripe, when most of us have the sugar and gumdrops.

In the dream, he saw a future where animals were no longer the servants of man but enjoyed the profits of their own labor.His dream became reality much sooner then he imagined, however. Shortly after his death, the animals spontaneously revolt against the farm's owner, Jones, a mean drunk.With the humans gone, the animals start working the farm together, anxious to enjoy the rewards. They also form their own government, a complete democracy where every animal has a say. They create seven commandments that they will all live by to make the newly renamed Animal Farm an even better place to live.It isn't long, however, before the pigs begin to take a place of leadership because of their superior intelligence. Two in particular, Snowball and Napoleon, rise to the top and always take opposite sides on every issue.The first year, things go smoothly. But the second year, things begin to fall apart and a leader emerges, slowly gaining more power. Will the other animals go along with the changes?Having heard about this classic all my life, I finally decided it was time to become acquainted with it. I can see why everyone talks about it so much. It is a powerful allegory about the dangers of Socialism. And, while some of the commentary directed squarely at the USSR may be lost on today's readers, anyone familiar with the history of that country or the other communist countries in our history will certainly get the point. It's amazing how accurate George Orwell was years before things got bad in Russia.While it did take me a few minutes to truly get the ending, it was very chilling.The best part is, the book is fun, too. The story moves quickly and the animal characters are so well drawn it's hard not to get pulled in to the story. I was hooked and couldn't wait to see how it ended.Some classics are boring and hard to get through. This isn't one of them. Don't fear the classic label, but pick this up and read it today.

George Orwell (1903 - 1950) was the pen name of the British author Eric Blair, who developed an early enmity towards those in power and their abuses of power. Orwell was a socialist but came to witness the horrors of the Soviet state and the betrayal of his ideals by Stalinists. As such, Orwell came to loathe totalitarianism in general and wrote novels, including this book and _1984_, showing the degrading effects such societies (and in particular the communism of the Soviet state) had on people. Orwell's books are indeed prophetic and show us a world in which the very life-force has been sapped out of mankind by those in power. Orwell imagines a highly efficient totalitarian state, capable of enforcing political correctness at the highest levels, tampering with the memories of men (or animals as is the case in this book), and maintaining a total disregard for the truth. Orwell shows how under such regimes the very notion of truth becomes suspect and the individual can no longer distinguish between fact and state propaganda. This particularly applies to the Soviet Union under Josef Stalin, which is the primary setting for Orwell's stories. During the Second World War, when Stalin was regarded as an ally by many British, Orwell's stories came as a shock in that they showed the vile nature of the Soviet regime._Animal Farm_ begins as the Manor Farm of the human farmer Mr. Jones, who the animals believe exploit them. As such, the animals on the farm gather together and stage a rebellion against the human exploiters so that they may together own the farm to work for the benefit of all animals. The story begins as Old Major, a prize white boar near the end of his life, tells of a future society in which animals work together free from the exploitation of man. It has been suggested that Old Major very likely represents either Marx or Lenin, the precursors of the Russian revolution. Following this, all the animals join together in singing the traditional folk song \\"The Beasts of England\\", expressing their hope for a better society. Following this, the animals stage a revolt against Mr. Jones and drive him from the farm, assuming ownership of the farm themselves and re-naming it \\"Animal Farm\\". In particular, two pigs named Snowball and Napoleon come to play prominent parts as leaders; however, soon there develops rival factions surrounding each of these pigs. Together the animals create the Seven Commandments of Animalism, which maintain that all animals are equal and that those who go upon four legs or have wings are friends while those who go upon two legs are enemies. However, as the story continues, all seven of the commandments are eventually to be broken by the pig leadership. The animals then begin working together on the farm and design their own society ruled by animals. However, a rivalry develops between the pigs, Snowball and Napoleon. Snowball advocates building a windmill while Napoleon opposes it. Eventually, Napoleon and his dogs are to drive Snowball from the farm; however, the memory of Snowball is to forever come back and haunt the animals and he is systematically blamed for whatever goes wrong on the farm. It has been suggested that while Snowball represents the character Leon Trotsky from the Russian revolution, Napoleon represents the vile dictator Josef Stalin. Napoleon then begins consolidating his power and little by little takes over all aspects of the farm. Napoleon also uses propaganda and uses the pig Squealer to manipulate the animals and provide an alternate history which places Napoleon at the center of the rebellion. Other characters on the farm include the work horse Boxer (whose mottos \\"I will work harder\\" and \\"Napoleon is always right\\" serve to illustrate his persistence but whose role on the farm is cruelly exploited by the pigs and who is eventually cruelly killed by them - perhaps reminiscent of the Soviet Stakhanovite movement), the horses Clover and Mollie, the sheep (perhaps reminiscent of the proletariat), the raven Moses (who preaches of a \\"Sugarcandy mountain\\" in the sky where animals go after death - reminiscent of religion and the churches), the dogs (Napoleon's private guards), the cat, and Benjamin the donkey. As time passes, the pigs led by Napoleon begin abusing their power and breaking the Seven Commandments. They drink alcohol, they have dealings with humans on other farms, the stage a great show trial in which they slaughter animals believed to be spies for Snowball, etc. Throughout the book Napoleon continues to engage in negotiations with human owners of other farms and in particular a conflict develops between Mr. Frederick and Mr. Pilkington, reminiscent of other leaders that Stalin engaged in negotiations with. Meanwhile, life on the farm continues to grow worse and worse, with longer and harder working hours and less benefits, though the animals have forgotten whether life was better or worse under Mr. Jones. At the end, the animals see for themselves exactly what the pigs have wrought, as it is shown that the pigs are no different than the humans. This book also shows the collaboration between the big capitalists and the communist leaders, both of whom plotted against the people to consolidate power in the hands of a few. The book ends on a very disturbing note, in which we see the complete abandonment of the ideals which launched the rebellion by the pigs.Orwell's books provide classic and disturbing accounts of the horrors of Soviet totalitarianism. They show us an efficient bureaucratic apparatus capable of sapping the life from the very people it claims to represent. As such, they are classic tales of the dangers that lurk behind totalitarianism and the manner in which human idealism is exploited by evil dictators. They are to be highly recommended to each new generation who seeks to understand the world in which we live today.Postscript: In a truly disturbing fashion, this \\"Centennial Edition\\" comes with a pro-communist foreword by Ann Patchett which rails against the evils of \\"McCarthyism\\". I believe that this foreword is best ignored in light of the fact that this is an anti-communist work of fiction."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"I loved the book Animal Farm, and I bet you will too when you get around to reading it. At first I was hesitant to start reading this book when I heard that it was about politics from a teacher. Classics + politics didn't spark interest in me. And yet when I began reading Animal Farm, I was hooked from the first page. Usually, you can tell how good a book is by what page you really get into the book. For me, Animal Farm grabbed me from pratically sentence one. Mr. Orwell has created a fantastic classic with lots of wit, drama, and meaning. Despite its lack of pages, Mr. Orwell sums up the main message in a way that will never be forgotten. This book left off at a question, and the reader has to decide the ending. Only the best books can leave you thinking, and Animal Farm is one of those rare books."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"As C M Woodhouse profoundly remembered in his introduction to the Animal Farm written in 1954: Winston Churchill eavesdropped on President Truman tipping off Stalin about the great event in history that was destined to etch the triumph of Western genius in the history of the world. As Churchill observed, Stalin \\"had no idea of the significance of what he was being told... If he has the slightest idea of the revolution in world affairs which was in progress his reactions would have been obvious...\\". Animal Farm hit bookshelves on the same month as the atomic bombs hit Hiroshima and Nagasaki. As the undying impact of both events persists in modern times, the jury is still out on whether the pen is mightier than the bomb.Works of fiction are not only a million times more effective in bringing a political point of view to the mainstream. A work of fiction that does so is a million times harder to conceive and author than millions of political debates that take the form of non-fiction.Much has been written about Orwell's forewarning of the evils of communist Russia in a time when the celebration of \\"socialism\\" was in fever pitch. However, in modern times, it would be shortsighted to assume that Animal Farm's place in history is due to its criticism of communism. What makes Animal Farm an immortal classic is its criticism of totalitarianism. What applied to communism during World War II might better apply today to inward-looking nationalism, hegemonic capitalism, and organized fundamentalist religion.Power will corrupt. More power will corrupt more. Any system that reaches the state of unquestioned power to a few will deny the right to moral fairness to many. Through the eyes of the fatalist, this is the beginning of the certain and ultimate destruction of mankind. Through the eyes of the optimist, this is the crest of a system that must fall in the interest of humankind, since there is power in chaos. In either case, these are the times when we will remember George Orwell or Benjamin, the donkey, as the one who foretold it."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"I bought this for my 10 yr. old grandson to read over the summer.

If one doesn't know much about communism, then not everything will be reaped from the reading. However, someone with understanding (1st or 3rd hand) of communism, then this book will provide a great parody on the faults of communism."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"I first read Animal Farm when I was 13 years old. I thought it was an excellent novel but at 13 years of age, I was oblivious to the Russian Revolution, had never heard of Stalin, and had no idea what a totalitarian government was. To me, Animal Farm was self contained - it was a story about the animals of Manor Farm and the corrupting influence of power.I recently re-read the novel (I'm quite a bit older now) and while I still think Animal Farm is a remarkably insightful and clever novel, I couldn't help but feel that Orwell was lecturing to me. Characters that once stood on their own, now felt like props being used by the author to make his point. Napoleon isn't really an evil pig, he's Joseph Stalin (well, alright, I guess he is an evil pig).The parallels between actual human events and Orwell's fairy story made it a little more difficult for me to enjoy this novel as a work of fiction (but only a little). That said, Orwell chose such a creative way to deliver his message that I found his efforts to educate not only enlightening but entertaining as well.The real strength of Animal Farm (as with 1984) is the way that Orwell illustrates the corruption of language and how words are used by totalitarian governments to control the working class, distort reality and re-write history. The line: \\"...but some animals are more equal than others\\" is a perfect example of how language can be manipulated to justify outrageous abuses of the state. This contradictory statement and distortion of the very concept of equality is nothing short of brilliant.Animal Farm is a parable well worth reading.*As a side note; I find it ironic that Orwell had the pigs rise to power because of their superior intellect. While a certain degree of intelligence is required to assume control over any state there is no indication in the real world that the smartest members of society ever rise to power (in fact they are usually persecuted)."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This fantastically good book can be read (and enjoyed) by a young child, or an elderly economist.

It took a couple of hours. This book was so disturbing and depressing that I see now why it's assigned so often. What starts out as a CHARLOTTE'S WEB quickly turns into such a draining and taxing, well, reality for lack of a better word, that I was unable to lay the book down, hoping against hope for a happy ending, one which never came. I don't believe in spoiler alerts for a book published in 1945, but when the pigs walk out of the farmhouse on two legs my body flushed. It was as creepy as that scene in INSIDUOUS where that demon comes out from behind Patrick Wilson. I'm not going to review the book - it's been reviewed by schoolkids and scholars for over fifty years, just suffice it to say that I found it AMAZING.

I've arrived late to this party, and only because I read a study that argued that reading fiction increases cognitive capabilities.

I found his minimal use of adjectives refreshing. The book is thought-provoking and excellent commentary on Communist Russia. I've got several other books by Orwell on my reading list, and I look forward to them with great anticipation.

There were times when I did not have anything to do so I picked up Animal Farm which was lying in the cupboard for many years. Looking at the size of the book, I thought it will be a quick read as I did not want to start a big book. This was the first book I read authored by George Orwell.Orwell is without any doubt one of the best story tellers. The plot is of political nature and is delivered cleverly. And he did not even need human characters for it. It is a story of about how animals take over a farm and drive all humans out of it. They (animals) are themselves not immune to the problems brought on by power. In disguise of doing good for their subjects, the ruling class looks after its own interests. Life for many as they think was better with how things were in the past.Animal Farm is one of those books which grip you till the end.

Our politicians could learn a thing or two from it."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This is a phenomenal book with a powerful message conveyed in the simplest of story-lines. One of the best I've read in a really long time.The plot is straightforward, a group of farm animals revolt against their Master - Mr. Jones - and decide to fight for control of their home and their rights. As Mr. Jones flees his house and farm, the animals take over renaming it \\"Animal Farm\\" rather than \\"Manor Farm\\", and establish their own communist society based on equality, fairness and justice. They then create seven commandments that they all need to abide by and they are as follows:1) Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy.2) Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend3) No animal shall wear clothes4) No animal shall sleep in a bed5) No animal shall drink alcohol6) No animal shall kill another animal7) All animals are created equalAnd in order to make these commandments easy to remember for the less intelligent animals, they were summarized into \\"four legs good, two legs bad.\\"Unfortunately, as the pigs (being the most intelligent of all farm animals) start leading this society and succumb to the temptations that power provides, they decide to dominate the farm and the animals. Soon, the commandments are slowly altered to suit their purposes until the final commandment states, \\"All animals are created equal, but some animals are more equal than others\\", making the summarized version \\"four legs good, two legs better.\\" This one statement encapsulates all of humanity in my opinion - we're all equal, but some are more equal than others. I could not have thought of a better way to put it.What a brilliant story about a revolution gone wrong due to greed and tyranny. About how a communist society gave way to totalitarianism. About the evils of power, money, and propaganda.The foresight that Orwell displays in his writing is remarkable as anyone can relate to this story in recent times. A story told so lightly, yet so powerfully making it a political satire that will have you smirking and shaking your head at the same time. A timeless tale that will capture the hearts of many, but will also get you thinking. This is a must read."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"It's one of those books that simply must be read. It's perfection on many levels that I cannot describe. It's short so you have no excuse not to read it."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This book is fantastic. \\"Animal Farm\\" is a satirical allegory of the Russian Revolution, and the way Orwell approaches it is incredibly skilful. The story arc here tracks history from prior to the 1917 revolution, and through to the Tehran conference.The attention to detail is wonderful, and involves such a great degree of detail that it's almost hard to believe Orwell compressed so much into such a small space; you can almost find a new analogy on every page, whether it's between the characters and historical figures, character which represent broader groups, or of the betrayals and hurt. Each analogy has depth, and when any one thing receives a good portion of page space you can be assured that the writing pays for itself ten times over.Everything included on the text is based on clear and detailed thought. When Orwell writes, he manages to capture all the complex, hidden meanings in his words, and express it in such a way that is clear and conveys his precise meaning. And even though everything is written so as to make events obvious, Orwell does this in an understated way which adds alot of subtlety and depth to the story.My favourite part of the story was the relationship between Boxer and Benjamin. Their relationship is important to the story, but plays out in a very touching way. These aren't just complex characters, they're relatable and likeable too. The way their relationship plays out, and what we know as readers, the way our reading is already influenced, it great. Even though both characters have their positives and negatives, but I was sympathetic towards all these traits.I think what gives this book so much of its drive is the betrayal of ideas infused throughout so much of the story. It makes the book so much more powerful. Upon reading, \\"Animal Farm\\" is still incredibly relevant today - one need only look at what we're seeing today in widespread cutbacks to retirement ages, pensions, working conditions, etc, and the surrounding political rhetoric to see the parallels, the same betrayal of ideas. So please, read this book.5/5"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This book is often required reading for school (I read it in the 8th grade).

It is a view of the Stalin reign cleverly disguised as a fairy tale; concisely written, and yet poetic. The symbolic use of animals works wonderfully with the abstract 'moral'. The funniest thing, in my opinion, is that Orwell, with his wry sense of humor, dipicts the communist dictators as pigs. How true!

All the animals from Manor Farm are being overworked and neglected by the irresponsible owner, Mr. Jones. The animals are outraged and become conscious of their cruel and unjust treatment after listening to a discourse from Major, a respectable pig in the farm. The animals come to the agreement that a rebellion against their inebriated master must take place. The animals attack and scare away Mr. and Mrs. Jones. They seize the farm and proclaim themselves owners of &quot;Animal Farm.&quot; The animals equally perform necessary tasks, under their own supervision, to maintain the farm and establish The Seven Commandments which every animal must abide by. The animals' hearts leap with joy at the idea of successfully working together on a common goal but this feeling is too soon shattered and converted into one of hopelessness. The pigs, which have greater intelligence than the other animals, become the leaders and problems begin to arise. Napoleon, the clever and deceptive pig, expels Snowball, the trustworthy pig, out of the farm and takes total control over every aspect of the farm. He manipulates conditions and decisions such as food production, consumption, etc., and violates every single commandment to benefit only himself. Read and find out how a single force can cleverly compel others into submission to &quot;wise&quot; authority. Analyze how no system is ideal and how many things can happen when some have no education and less power, and others are privileged with it all. Discover how an expected utopia turns into an unexpected hell-hole."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"In very few pages Orwell manages to write a savage critique not only on the system of Communisin but also on capitalism.

It is a quick read (I was able to read it in a few hours) I would recommend this book to anyone!"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"After completing the text, I detested the book. I couldn't see the relation between this book and the world of reality (at this stage I had no knowledge of the Russian Revolution(RR)). But when, after countless hours of studying the book in-depth within class, I finally saw how closely the plot of Animal Farm, mirrored events of the RR, so closely in fact that this book could easily be mistaken for being part of the high school History sylabus for study of the RR.But, as this book carries such in-depth meanings concerning communism and morales, I don't believe it makes a good leisure reading book.In order to benefit most from this book, a general knowledge of events within the RR would be essential either before or after you read the book. Some of you may be thinking, why the hell should we read this book to find out about the RR when we're supposed to know about it anyway, but Orwell has entwined events, his own ideas and displays the problems of communism all within a fantasy world where animals take the place of humans and a farm symbolises the country of Russia anfd this to me makes all the difference between a history book and a novel with a factual background.All begins well when the animals adopt the social structure of communism and the farm prospers. But things start going uphill from there as animals, symbolising the workers and commonfolk of Russia, rebel, produce disapears and all animals except the pigs lose more and more responsibility for the organisation of the farm until at last the pigs, symbolising the leaders of Russia, gain complete control of the farm and begin to strip the farm of its produce.Though I had no background knowledge at all on the RR, I predicted the climax of the book from the end of chapter three. So as I read and read, I felt confined and wanted to yell at the animals as I though it was obvious as to how the book would finish and also that the animals seemed so daft because they let the pigs hoodwink them. Yet though the book was predictable, by the completion of the majority of our study I have to say that I now have readjusted my opinion and POV, and can say I've enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Like the first books of Gulliver's Travels, where Swift's pointed satire on English-French rivalry have been lost in the striking idea of tiny people and giant people, so this allegory of the 'dictatorship of the proletariat' has quite lost its political point against the power of the story. The equation of pigs with the Bolsheviks, the pig Napoleon with Stalin and Snowball with Trotsky is ultimately quite unnecessary to enjoyment of the story - exactly like 'Gulliver's Travels'. Yet the point was not lost on the people of the 1940s, nor on the oppressed people of Eastern Europe and Russia, who read the book in secret. Nor was the point lost on fellow-travellers in the West who made Orwell struggle to have it published. This is the only English book (along with 1984) guaranteed to have been read by every Russian dissident. That in itself is a monument to Orwell. This book will last as long as Swift's, possibly longer."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This book is an animalian illustration of how humanity time and again uses power for evil.

Just as Napolean, the pig, instigated a rebellion against the owner of the farm (Jones) by talking about how great things will be once the animals ruled the farm, today we are told by the Obama Democrats that once Bush and the Republicans are thrown off the farm (Washington), that all will be well, that things will look wonderful, and that none of us will ever be hungry again. In Animal Farm, though, the animals were far worse off after Mr. Jones was kicked off the farm. Like Obama, Napolean also did not have any experience in running a farm, but this did not stop him from stating that he would be more competent and able to handle the farm. Further, once Napolean took charge of the farm, the interests of the other animals started to decline more and more. He started to remove any sense of democratic principles by eliminating the need for public comment and strongly took action against any potential dissent. This is exactly where the Obama Democrats want to take our country--first, by stating that they (and he alone) can manage the country -- even though there is no experience to suggest that he ought to, and secondly, by eliminating any form of dissent by destroying talk radio and also by heavily regulating and taxing the internet in order to suppress the one free and open medium that is available to counter their message. The lesson of Animal Farm is clear: those who claim to provide us with utopia on earth often will create hell instead through dictatorship, centralization of authority, and a desire to obtain power for power's sake. If we learn the lessons of Animal Farm, our nation will be far better off."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm is a parable that can be related to nearly any system of government ever used by humanity. This story was written to reflect the real-life situation of communism. All of the major characters of this story were created to resemble a character in the true drama of the communist rule of the Soviet Union. Old Major, the philosopher-pig with a dream, resembles Karl Marx, the man who wanted equality for all the workers of the world. Napoleon, the pig-half man, is like Vladimir Lenin, the man who twisted Marxism so that nearly half of the world was working as his slaves and they loved him for it. Boxer the draft horse resembles the workers of eastern Europe, who were convinced that Lenin was a great man as he worked them to death. Mr. Jones, the former owner of Manor Farm, represents the czars of Russia who were murdered so that Lenin could take over their position. These similarities were created intentionally to closer relate the story to reality. George Orwell raises an interesting question with the close of this novel. As it ends nobody can discern between pigs and men. The pigs had risen up out of the muck to live as humans do, that is by enslaving all other creatures of god's creation. As the novel closed pigs lived and associated with men, acted like men, and proved themselves as capable of holding a position of leadership as any man. Through endless bickering, accusations, and general laziness men showed themselves as no greater than pigs. The enigma which arises from this situation is this: Is Humanity nothing but pigs or are pigs like humans with four legs and snouts? Napoleon the Pig is also an enigma to me. He used his fellow beasts' fascination with the philosophy of Old Major to manipulate them into working towards his goals. When he entered his position as supreme-commander-president-king of the Animal Farm, he seemed like a kind and just ruler. As time went on he grew more and more tyrannical, beginning by lying to his subjects and eventually executing everyone who disagreed with him, all in the name of animalism. Although the pig exemplifies all the traits of humanity that I loathe, I know a filthy swine is in the place of power and I am but a common citizen. I am not sure about how I would feel if I were in the position of comrade Napoleon. On one hand, I would be happy that I was making out as a thief, but on the other hand I would feel guilt about treating my subjects as slaves. Napoleon is truly the king of all vermin, a position that I wish I could lower myself to fill. I think Animal Farm is an excellent story. The story is an invaluable educational tool for the purpose of relating the true story of communism to something that can be understood by people who have not experienced it for themselves. For this reason I would strongly recommend this story as not only a very informative parable but also as an enjoyable story for anyone with any knowledge of the Russian Revolution and the Cold War."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"The animals of Manor Farm stage a revolution against Farmer Jones and the humans that run the farm.

The only difference is, all the main characters are animals and the setting is on an English farm. It tells of how the animals overthrow the human owner and try to run the farm themselves in the interest of freedom from tyranny. Things slowly start to change as a particular group of animals assume power at the expense of all the others.The allegorization to some modern governments and institutions is unmistakable and quite sobering. The story itself is not long and can easily be read in one sitting. This particular edition also features Orwell's previously unpublished preface and one he wrote for the Ukranian translation of this book. A long introduction by Malcolm Bradbury (emeritus professor of American studies) and a note on the text by Peter Davidson (research professor of English) explain some of the motives behind the book and a little background information on Orwell (i.e. Eric Blair) himself.

This is a simple paperback version of one of two Orwell novels that have become mandatory reading for anyone with a grasp on the English language. I am going out on a limb to instead recommend grabbing the hardcover anniversary edition with illustrations by Ralph Steadman (ISBN: 0151002177) instead, particularly to those who have already read the book once through. Here's why.A lot of the reviews on here clamor about how Orwell predicted our current political climate astonishingly well, or how accurate his allegory has become in light of the Bush administration. In addition to Steadman's wonderfully grim (and expectedly violent) illustrations throughout, I feel that the anniversary edition is given the additional benefit of an explanation of George Orwell's intentions and motivations from the author himself. The real cause he was pursuing, exposing the evils of Communism (not Britian, Western Civilization, democracies gone awry, capitalism, etc.), is very intresting to me, and I think this epilogue will be insightful to other readers. If you're new to Animal Farm, read the first version you can get your hands on, if you're going back to it again, definitely track down a copy of the 1996 version. I was very glad I did, and not just to have the kick of some slick illustrations, either.There's no use wasting my breath recommending the story of Animal Farm itself. It should be read, and will conceivably be continued to be read until the end of time. As long as politics and governments fail, and they will, Animal Farm is an essential, keenly observational allegory for our time, for all time.

Old Major, an old boar, speaks out his dream of an equal community of animals without the power hungry humans. As this dream becomes a reality characters change, like their great leader Napoleon ( a boar), who becomes more and more like the despised Farmer Jones, who was a tyrant at his time at the farm. Boxer (a horse) a loyal determined worker and Squealer a lying henchman of Napoleon cross destinies horribly. Napoleon rules murderously with evil henchmen at his side to make the other animals fear his presence everywhere. When you read the book you will feel the annoyances and the irritation when the pigs lie to the other animals. Orwell takes you on a roller coaster of emotion, which you never forget. The book is steeped in Soviet history, as if Orwell was a fortuneteller in his time. As you read the book you can see the writer knew a lot about the corruption of power. The novel is a great read for anyone who enjoys a good book even they it has the underlining of the momentous occasion, the Russian Revolution.

This is a classic novel written during WWII that followsthe occurrences during the rebellion of communists in Russia. Thissatire can be directly matched up with the actually happeningsdealing with the Soviets and their rebellion against capitalism.Throughout the book I was captivated and forced to read moreand more. When I began reading, I liked all the animals the same butabout halfway through the book I began to dislike the pigs and feelsorry for the other animals being put to work like the pig'sservants. I liked the fact that this book had understandablelanguage, was short, and the story was easy to follow. The storynever got boring at a single point throughout. George Orwell did anexcellent job writing the book to fit the story of the rebellion ofthe Soviets. The story from the Jones' farm matched well with thestory of the Russian rebellion. I enjoyed reading this book and Iwould probably recommend this book to a friend because it is a quickread, but it is also quite interesting and intriguing. I would alsoprobably purchase another one of his books and see if his greatwriting style is evident in his other books.At the beginning of the story, I liked every animal thesame. I did not like one more than the other. As the storyprogressed, I began to dislike Napoleon. Napoleon, like manyleaders, got power-hungry. He continued to desire more and morepower as the book progressed. The more power he achieved, the worsehis decisions became. He put the other animals to work as if theywere his slaves. He changed their seven \\"unchangeable\\" laws. Manyother things were done by Napoleon because of the power that he hadand the bad judgment he possessed. Napoleon's power hunger made merealize that too much of a good thing has a bad outcome. His powergot into his head and thereof controlled his mind. When things likepower and wealth are excessive, something needs to be done. If noaction is taken, excessive power and wealth can lead to harmfulconsequences.The end of the book was very interesting. Napoleon, theleader of the rebellion against human beings and the enforcer ofAnimalism, has become completely humanlike in his behavior. Napoleonends up making peace with the humans who were once enemies of theanimals on the farm. This ending is very odd considering the stanceof Napoleon early on in the book.The ending was quite unusual and unexpected, but overall thisbook was excellent.

But as it turned out I couldn't put the book down! I'd sit down expecting to have to force my eyelids to stay open for at least ten pages and an hour later have finished five chapters.Besides being glued to the page, I learned a lot about Russian history along with how a government functions. This simplified form of communism turning into totalitarianism helped me understand the uses of propaganda, secret police used by such leaders as Hitler and Stalin, and how the public is kept in the dark. When the sheep and horses were so blind to the slavery they were being forced into I at first felt angry, but realized that this is how many societies function. Ordinary, innocent people can become Nazis or can starve under a gluttonous ruler if they don't care enough to pay attention to what leadership is doing.My favorite character in the book changed as the story progressed. At first I felt intrigued by the pigs Snowball and Napoleon, amused by devious tricks and ideas. But as Napoleon become increasingly brutal I found that I liked Benjamin, who seemed to be stubborn and \\"unpatriotic\\", but turned out to be foreshadowing the end result of Animal Farm. I especially was moved by his display of emotions towards Boxer towards the end.While at the end I wanted to dislike the book's abrupt and rather depressing ending, I realized that it was the most appropriate ending and got Orwell's point across. Obviously the book could not have a happy ending since Russia's history of monarchs to communism to totalitarianism was itself depressing. It also left you questioning if the animals would rebel yet again or fall under the rule of the pigs.George Orwell is an amazing writer who has strength in simplifying complex ideas and turning boring, dry history material into amusing fictions. These two gifts have helped Orwell communicate serious problems which need to be addressed to all people (even sheep) and also help people become a little more skeptical of powerful governments.I would definitely recommend this book to anyone, even if they were not interested in politics and history. I would also like to read other books by Orwell because of his deep, yet easy to understand context.I still have some questions from the book: was the Major pig in the beginning Karl Marx or Lenin, or both? While many argue he was Lenin, I am somewhat puzzled by that explanation since the Major was not portrayed as malicious. I also wondered if the animals at the end of the book rise up yet again, or were there none smart enough left to lead a revolution against the pigs. Lastly, would the pigs resort to eating the other animals like humans? Beef-it's what's for dinner on animal farm."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Who couldn't love this classic Orwellian tale? Four legs good; two legs bad. I'd rather have no tail and no flies ..."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"On the surface, and in its purest form, Communism would seem like the perfect form of government. A society where everyone is equal and the government provides for all would appear to be utopian existence. However, advocates of Communism and those responsible for its application failed to take into account one important \`X-factor'... the human element. Human nature is competitive. It is instinctive to want to gain an edge and make one's self better, and to have control over one's own destiny. That's why, on paper, Communism works, but in practice, it failed miserably. The Soviet Union from 1917 to 1991 (from the Bolshevik Revolution to the collapse of the USSR) was the glaring example of the worst application of this form of government. Everyone being equal and dependent on the government meant that a few unscrupulous individuals could corrupt the system for their own gains and at the expense of the people. Josef Stalin reign of terror over the Soviet Union is the most atrocious occurrence of this.This little history lesson is necessary to provide to background to and understand the inspiration for George Orwell's masterpiece, \\"Animal Farm\\". Orwell, himself was an advocate of pure Socialism (which has many similarities to Communism). However, during his involvement during the Spanish Civil War (I believe that was the name of this conflict) in 1937, he learned how this system could be perverted when Stalin-supported Socialists took partial control of Spain's government and began suppressing opposition in terrifying ways. During the 1940's when the world was at war with Germany and enamored with the Soviet Union (because of they were exacting sufficient damage upon the German war machine), Orwell wrote \\"Animal Farm\\" as a parable of the best intentions of the rebellion gone awry.\\"Animal Farm\\" focuses on the rebellion of a group of farm animals who grew tired of the perceived mistreatment at the hands of their master, Farmer Jones. Inspired by an idealistic colleague and prodded by a few unscrupulous pigs, the animals revolted and took control of farm. Once the farm was in animal control, the two lead pigs, Napoleon and Snowball took command of the farm and set about establishing a society where the animals were responsible for their own well being and beholden to no one else. Alas, petty jealousies, scandalous activities, and gross manipulation of the minds and emotions of the lesser animals lead to the new society being just as bad, or worse, than the previous one. The famed line in book becomes \\"All animals are created equal. But, some animals are more equal than others\\".It's impossible to read this book and not see the very graphic parallels between the Animal Farm and Stalinist Russia. In each case, the peasants (or lesser animals) were goaded into rebellion to throw off leaders that were perceived to be oppressive. The respective rebellions were bathed in romanticism and idealism. Yet, in each case, the new society that grew out of the rebellions proved to be worse than the one that preceded it. The pig Napoleon is seen as the representation of Josef Stalin. Most of the other animals are representations of the terrified populace of the Soviet Union which suffered under Stalin, but was either too scared or too ignorant to stand up for themselves.\\"Animal Farm\\" finds itself as a regular institution on many high school reading lists. That should not dissuade adults from picking up this novel. It is as relevant a cautionary tale today as it was more than half a century earlier."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"I just finished reading this for fun, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I found myself, as I read it, to really connect to the characters. Especially Clover, although I would have done something about all the wrong doings the pigs were doing. I found myself hating the pigs and wanted to rip their throats out. If I were one of the animals, I would have revolted against Napoleon. The clincher for me was when the pigs started walking on their hind legs. Although I was surprised that the animal's memory was that bad. I always thought that dogs were just as smart or smarter then the pigs. At least my dog is anyway. They seemed like a bunch of idiots that wouldn't know how to eat if they weren't told how too. But one thing still confused me about the whole issue with Snowball. I mean was he really a traitor, or did Napoleon just make that all up? All in all, I really enjoyed this book, and recomend it to everybody."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm by George Orwell, is the story of the Bolshevic revolution, told using a farm's corruptness. Each character of the book is representative of one of the major people involved in Russia's dramatic change. The Czar, Lenin, Tratski, Stalin, the government, the working class, followers, and secret police, are all present in this story through animals. Old major a pig (Lenin), brings inspiration to the animals of the farm to take control of their lives. He dies, but Snowball(Tratski) organizes the attack on Mr.Jones (The Czar). After they succeed in riding the farm of Mr.Jones, Snowball makes plans of education and electricity for the future. Meanwhile Napoleon(Stalin), is planning his take over. Napoleon uses Snowball's plans but convinces the animals it is his own and that Snowball is to be banished. Squealer who is always at Napoleon's side goes around convincing everyone that Napoleon really is great. Boxer who is a horse(the working class) works very hard because he is thinking his work will pay off. When he gets injured and can no longer contribute to the progress of the far, Napoleon sends Boxer to a glue factory. The followers are the sheep and the dogs of the farm are the secret government. Anyway, the book is a fun and creative way to teach the Russian Revolution. It is a short and quick read that you can gain a lot from.

In the very beginnings of this book Mr. Jones is very drunk. The animals wait for him tom go in the house and turn the bedroom light off. All the animals had a high rspect for Willingdon Bueaty. That is the name of the prize winning middle- white boar that was OWNED by Mr. Jones. The old pig always liked to share his dreams with the farm animals. He was so respected that all the animals were willing to lose an hours sleep just for him. The animals eventually make a daring attempt to (live better lives)at the old farm. I give this book a rating of 5, and an age limit to 10 and up."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Taking a Russian history class and learning in detail about Joseph Stalin's rule would help one understand Animal Farm much better, as well as the characters. George Orwell's hatred of totalitarianism, especially that of the Stalinist USSR, formed the basis for this short satirical fiction.A band of oppressed farm animals oust Jones, their cruel human owner and take over the farm. Led by two pigs, Napoleon and Snowball, the animals proceed to run the farm by themselves so they are no longer exploited.Napoleon is clearly Stalin, while Snowball is based on Leon Trotsky, and the Old Major is Lenin. Squealer may be Molotov or Kaganovich, but I'm not sure. The first attack on the Farm by Jones and his men is based on the Russian Civil War (1918-1921), where disorganized factions of anti-communists attacked the Soviet Union from all sides, and lost. However, things don't always go in parallel, as the Old Major dies before the Revolution. Lenin of course precipitated the Revolution in 1917. And note the date of the liberation of Manor Farm: 12 October. That is close to 24 October, the date of the Bolshevik Revolution.Other items: Boxer the horse is the epitome of the hard worker whose two sayings are \\"Napoleon is always right\\" and \\"I will work harder.\\" In fact he may be Stakhanov, the worker whose team so efficiently met their quota in one of Stalin's 5-Year Plans, that the word Stakhanovite became synonymous with an A-One Soviet worker. And the inability of most animals to read only the first two letters of the alphabet hint at their being lowly, illiterate subjects blindly obedient to the State.The Seven Commandments--ironic for a Biblical reference in an atheist system-- plays an important key to the book, as they keep changing during Napoleon's reign. They are: \\"Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy, 2) Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend, 3) No animal shall wear clothes, 4) No animal shall sleep in a bed, 5) No animal shall drink alcohol, 6) No animal shall kill any other animal, and 7) All animals are equal.\\" However, as Napoleon consolidates his rule, the Commandments become slightly altered. For example, after the animal executions, analogous to Stalin's purges, the sixth Commandment has the words \\"without cause\\" appended. And talk about irony in using the name of Napoleon for the Stalin character when in fact Napoleon invaded Russia, the result of which increased distrust of the West by Russians.Orwell's portrait of the totalitarian state would be finalized in his masterpiece 1984. Animal Farm was a preview for that grand work, but the final thing that comes through in this book is that the Stalinist regime was just as oppressive as the czarist regime, with the ordinary animals on the receiving end-i.e. \\"but some animals are more equal than others.\\""},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"The story Animal Farm is something that every person in the entire world should read. This simple tale of a group of animals, neglected, abused, enslaved, and put down, rising up against their hateful masters with the hopes of creating an egalitarian society was meant as a commentary on the state of the Soviet Union. The depiction created of a Communist society from its conception to its death is one of tyranny, deceit, distrust, and rivalry that destroys the pure intentions of the original revolutionaries. Though the depth of the underlying political commentary may be lost on people with no interest in the operation of the economy or the government, Animal Farm is a very accessible story with easy to understand lessons in morality, fairness, and honesty.One note on the additional \\"filler\\" information added to this edition, it is both poorly written and uninteresting. While the life of George Orwell is interesting and something worth learning about, especially if you have aspirations towards being a socialist, the author of this section does such a poor job that reading tax codes in IRS publications is more interesting.In summary, buy this book, read it, lend it to someone else, read it again, lend it to more people, read it again, and dream of a world of egalitarian communism. Or you can just read the story, enjoy the struggles and triumphs of the heroic animals, despise the greedy pigs, and share the experience with someone else."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This book was really fun to read.

Anyway, I thought this was a great book and it can be read by just about anyone (children 10 and up), but it takes some knowledge of the Russian Revolution to get the whole meaning of this book. This book is basically about a farm that is taken over by animals. At first, things go great until Napoleon (Stalin) siezes absolute power and expels Snowball (Trotsky) from Animal Farm. Napoleon proves to be a tyrant and he takes advantage of the rest of the animals (general public) because they are gullible and are basically Napoleon's puppets throughout the whole book. My favorite characters are Moses, (The Church) and Squealer, who is the pig that spreads the propoganda around the farm.

Orwell wrote Animal Farm to express his views on how Communism and idealism and nationalism however good in theory, could not work in practice due to the faults of human nature. Look around you--it is happening today, and the more people who read Animal Farm and understand it's message, the better."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"It is so easy to read a book like ANIMAL FARM, say to yourself that it is entertaining enough not to hurt when you have to write your high school book report on it, and then get rid of it and go on with life as you grow into adulthood. But this book is entertaining the way Aesop's fables are entertaining; the life lessons of it keep returning like Springtime after long, cold winters.Orwell wrote this after discovering many of the intrinsic horrors of Communism in the Soviet Union and elsewhere before and after World War II. The political hypocrises and subsequent crimes inherent in the movement were made all the more genocidally infectious to innocent people around the world in the way they always are in political movements: by the leaders' demands of people to look at the culturally genocidal infections of the \\"other\\" (in this case laissez faire capitalism and its resultant colonialist/imperialist criminalities in the West), instead of allowing the independent questioning of the relevance and righteousness of what they were dealing with. The Frankenstein impulse of Man's ego as it governs the creation of utopianesque political systems and quasi-cultures has been alluded to many times before and after this novel (even before Mary Shelley's FRANKENSTEIN), but for me never so succinctly, so beautifully, and so painfully accurate as ANIMAL FARM.I just bought this novel for my son, age twelve. I bought it for him not just knowing that he loves animals and stories about animals (a way Dads like me sneak good literature in their system). As he approaches the (help me Lord) teen years where the peer group becomes everything, he will need to know that he can be caught in the same dynamic that the innocent and naive animals underneath the leadership of the pigs were caught up in. (Hearing me lecture about it would naturally have the opposite effect.) Hearing a confused but charismatic kid begin to sound a lot like Squealer in a new and unexpected context for him just might save his power of independent thought when peer pressure comes into play.If I could, I would buy this book for half the world, and let them give their dog-eared copy to the other half; there is no one whose life isn't touched by the intoxicating rhythm of power in groups, and its ability to lead people into total bondage of some sort while it promises to protect your freedom. For example: any and every woman I've ever known who felt the need to regurgitate feminist manifestos at their future ex boyfriends and husbands in order to protect the integrity of an illusory sisterhood--a sisterhood often run by women who would (and often are) sleeping with the very men these confused but loyal women have alienated in their name, needs to read this. Nancy Friday's MY MOTHER, MY SELF and Daphne Patai's HETEROPHOBIA are ANIMAL FARMs for the independent American Woman, struggling to truly know herself beyond the confines of patriarchy, its postmodern discontents, and any culture set up to combat it. For anyone starting the next round of self-improvement courses lauded by the newest pop-psychology guru that have this funny way of feeling like they are not actually leading you anywhere, the work of Stanford Peele, heretic of the twelve step program community, has written several ANIMAL FARMs on this self-help/addiction philosophy, serving them as well as all of us in innumerable ways. For those devoted to a pretty cerebral psychoanalytic perspective on life, or an often emotionally/socially detached Church or creed, psychologist/author Alice Miller's work are in different ways ANIMAL FARMs of their own: they are for the psychologically/transformation-minded who alternately pay too much surface and too liitle in-depth attention to childhood's true effect on the adult human heart...Steele's THE CONTENT OF OUR CHARACTER and Tony Brown's WHITE LIES, BLACK LIES are both ANIMAL FARMs for the Black Community--a community that may only truly take control of its (our) own destiny if we start looking for spiritual/economic *colonics*, instead of socio-political streetsweepers...The metaphors are endless, and endlessly fitting. ANIMAL FARM's power is that it is so deceptively powerful in its simplicity as to make the point only writers of powerful insight, intellect and above board courage can do, regarding what happens to men and women in groups when power becomes intoxicating. And today they need several hundred more pages and a million footnotes to do it AT ALL, let alone as well as Orwell did. It resonates in ways that force you to think beyond the conventional in life (i.e., the pre-programmed), and begin a search to find out what reality really is, for YOU, not someone else.If Jesus came back and was asked to give a sermon for the people of every nation, he would instead tell the world a parabel that would essentially be this book."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This is THE edition to own of Orwell's classic (and haunting) &quot;fairy story&quot;.

Talk about animal instincts!"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Originally written as Orwell's warning of the emerging Fascist nature of the Soviet Union, then operating under the guise of being a \\"Socialist Democracy of the Proletariat,\\" this ideological satire about anthropomorphized animals, has become a metaphor for all forms of \\"State run,\\" oppressive and Fascist-leaning governments that use guile, slights of hand, propaganda, lies, \\"double talk,\\" \\"double think,\\" and the rewriting of history, to wrest away \\"power and freedom\\" from \\"the people.\\"Eric Blair, who wrote under the pseudonym, George Orwell, fought in the Spanish Civil War on the side of the Republicans, and early on distrusted Stalin's government - even when it fought along side the West, in helping to defeat Hitler. Like Churchill, Orwell (through this novel, and his \\"1984\\") was a prescient voice of reason about the true nature of Communism.The key to the story is not so much the revolution that takes place, in which the animals uproot and run \\"the man\\" away, but in the generalized way in which revolutionary governments, once they assume power, in due course, tend to become nothing if not, oppressors by a new name. The common motif and paradigm of these erstwhile champions of the revolution is that they quickly learn \\"the ways of corruption and anti-democracy:\\" That is, they learn how to disrespect the truth, reject true equality and moral principles, and arrogate power unto a smaller and smaller elite group or ruling clique among themselves. They then begin to subtly bend and then change the Constitution and other rules so that in the end those instruments only favor and benefit their own cliques. Power is maintained in the hands of the new ruling cliques, first by rallying the masses to heroic efforts in the name of the original revolutionary causes, and then as power is siphoned away from the people, in the name of its more hollow and propagandistic symbols. Overtime all thoughts of the revolution grow dim and so do the people's freedoms. Cuba has been the classic case in point.Events of today however would suggest that it is again time to pull out and reread Orwell's warnings, only this time as they apply to the American Revolution, whose luster, under the present Republican administration and democratically run Congress, is not just beginning to fade, but has begun to take on the color and character of Orwell's Animal Farm.Our politicians have learned all too well how to show us the same kind of disrespect as did \\"Napoleon\\" in Orwell's tale: They lie to us and can no longer be believed; they use our national symbols to whip up emotions, send us into unnecessary wars, and to keep us divided; corruption among a smaller and smaller circle of elites is rampant; in the face of corporate money and the money of lobbyists our democratic freedoms including voting, are slowly slipping away and are being rendered meaningless. We are rapidly becoming a democracy in shell only. Another pretext, like a second 911, and we could see the final glimmer of the light of the American Revolution go out altogether. A \\"Fascist America\\" is no longer a distant thought.\\"Four legs good, two legs bad or conservatives good; liberals bad?\\"Five Stars"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Ever since its first publication in 1944, George Orwell's \\"Animal Farm\\" has been recognized as a brilliant satire by millions world-wide. In the beginning of this wonderful novella, an old pig, Major, incites the animals to insurrection against the oppression of their human master Jones. Major dies a few days later and a week or two after that the animals revolt and declare their freedom from the human race. However, it doesn't take long for another oppressor-- a pig named Napoleon-- to arise and lord it over the rest of the animals. Eventually, Napoleon makes treaties with neighboring farms and turns into something very much like the animals' old master, Jones. This is an imagery of what Hitler, Stalin, Napoleon, and countless others have done throughout history, and serves as a valuable lesson for humanity. This book ends on a note of despair: another government has failed in its attempt to create a perfect society. Our nation would do well to heed the lesson of this story if it wants to prosper in the years to come. Any government that substitutes its own laws for the law of God and depends upon itself for sustenance will become crushed beneath the weight of its own false independence. It is only by following God's laws that a nation can be blessed to prosper in its ambitions. Ultimately, without Christ, there is no freedom."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"J Dudinsky wrote:\\"The definition of communism is the government, usually totalitarian that controls the economy\\"The definition of a communist society is not that government controls society. The definition(as if a political theory can be defined in a sentence) is a form of society without a state, government, classes, the market and money.What some people seem to not understand about this book is that it is not a slam on communism. It is a slam on authoritarianism. It is a slam on the USSR and Lenin, Stalin and Trotsky. George Orwell was a socialist himself... Go read his book \\"Homage to Catalonia\\" or his essay \\"Why I write\\".Animal Farm is a great book. Even if you have no clue about what communism is(most of the people who wrote reviews don't) you can still enjoy the book. At times it is hilarious and at others horribly sad."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"The book Animal Farm has two sides to its story. One person can see it as a fairy tale and another could see it as a satire of a society in dictatorship. The story begins one day on a farm, called Manor Farm. A old pig named Major tells the animals about a life without humans, a life were animals were equal and ruled themselves. Major told them about the &quot;Beast of England&quot;, a patriotic song that stood for animals' freedom (animalism). Soon Major dies, but the words spoken at the rally remain in every animal's head and heart. One day without warning the rebellion begins. All the animals fought Mr. Jones (the owner) and his men. As the animals fought they thought of freedom and before the day was over they had won freedom. Jones and his men had fled. Soon the animals create their own society, with leaders, holidays, and dreams for the future. The two leaders were Snowball and Napoleon. They have a clash of differences and Napoleon, being the more cunning of the two manages to exhale Snowball. As time goes by Jones anf his men attack, to retake the farm, but the animals triumph. Soon the new named &quot;Animal Farm&quot; starts to alter. Laws are mysteriously changing, food is getting low and work is rising. It is not very long before the animals notice the change, but they can't express their feelings because now Napoleon and the pigs have to much power and the ferocious dogs Napoleon keeps for protection make sure all the animals remember there place. The pigs start to act like humans, and eventually start to wear clothes, live in the farmhouse, intake alcohol, and even walk upright. One day the owners of neighboring farms come for dinner with the pigs. A heated argument arises and as the other animals watch they can't tell the differance between the pigs and the humans, because the pigs have changed so drastically. As I read Animal Farm I kept thinking about how familiar the story was and I finally figured it out. The story is about a group ruled by a more dominant group and so naturally they rebel to make life better for themselves and to have freedom. They create their own law, customs, and traditions, but soon their vision of freedom becomes blurred. The pigs say all animals are equal, but the pigs act superior. There are people that will follow anyone in power and thats how the sheep were. They followed the expression, &quot;If one sheep jumps off a cliff the rest will follow&quot;. All the sheep believed whoever was in charge. There was a lot of propaganda in a way, such as the sheep bleating, &quot;four legs good, two legs bad&quot; and then later on, &quot;four legs good two legs better&quot;. When Napoleon took away Jesse's (the dog) pups and trained them to be his gaurds, that act reminds me of what the government in some countries do when they take away young boys and train them to be soldiers. I enjoyed the writers style. It was very creative how he tuned a typical new country turns into a fascist country into a story about farm animals. The use of his characters was very funny. The pigs were the bad guys, so you could call them &quot;fascist pigs&quot;. The conclusion to this story is not a good one. All the animals intentions were good at first, but soon their leaders greed only makes the new society of animals just as bad as the old society with humans. I also think a moral to this story is the importance of education. Most of the animals were not smart, exept the pigs, so naturally they took advantages over the other animals."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"When I read the book &quot;Animal Farm&quot;, I compared it to the overthrow of Milosevic and the revolution of Yugoslavia. Many things that George Orwell included in his book applied to Yugoslavia. I think that all revolutions begin the same way, and that &quot;Animal Farm&quot; can be compared to all of them. This book happened in steps, showing everything that happens during a revolution. From the very beginning with the overthrow of a leader to the rebellions that happen later. I know that in the future more revolution will occur. Even though they'll all start at different times and places, they'll all start the same way, and they'll share many common characteristics. &quot;Animal Farm&quot; is a guide to revolutions, and even though it was written sometime ago, the storyline still pertains to revolutions today."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"George Orwell's animal farm is a fantastic book written by such a wonderful author. It is a satire based upon the Russian Revolution, dealing with complex political issues such as communism and corruption. In a relatively short story, Orwell not only mocks and critisises different aspects of the revolution, but also explains many political ethics and principles. He creates many thought provoking ideas through such a simple story of farm animal, such as the fundamentals of the communist movement and of equality. It is, ideally, the story of a farm of animals who take over from their human master and revolt against humans generally because of the legacy left to them by their fellow 'comrade' Major. They create commandments and have an official song, these ideas described as showing 'Animalism'. The notion of equality is then established with the reader, and from this point Orwell uses very skilled writing to convey various messages. The farm progresses with the pigs becoming the 'natural' leaders. Conflict then arises between two pigs, Napoleon and Snowball. They both believe in the same principles of equality (or so they say) but have very different ideas for the direction of Animal Farm. Napoleon eventually drives Snowball out of the farm, literally, with the help of his dogs/henchman. After the departure of Snowball, a distinct fear and serparation is created between the pids and dogs and the other animals. Their workload is increased and the animals receive less food whilst the pigs give orders and eat food frivilously and take up residence in the Manor House. It is hear where Orwell most effectively conveys his ideas to the reader, in such a simple yet very ironic way. All animals are equal- these are the animals that revolted against humans to create a life for themselves. They are against human principles but they live in a house, sleep in beds, eat at tables, use electricity and consume alcohol. They claim they are in charge for the benefit of everyone but only truly help themsleves. Animal Farm is a great story, an accurate description of the russian revolution told in an objective yet cunning way, especially with the title - Animal Farm: A FAIRY TALE. The author has used wonderful animal characters to imitate their human counterparts, appropriately named and catergorised. The pigs (stereotyped as an animal to be greedy, dirty and cunning) end up taking full charge of Animal Farm, with Napoleon ( no doubt in reference to Napoleon Bonepart) as their bombastic leader. I recommend this book to anyone particularly interested in the contrast of politics with human morals and ethics. It is a wonderful and easy to read text, written in simple english but with an extremely complex and thought provoking messages.

First, you must determine your reading speed (or words read per minute), and then you begin exercise to improve peripheral vision, speed, and comprehension. Of course this fascinated me, but I never expected it too work. It did! I only doubled my reading speed, but that's certainly enough for me! Anyway, after you have completed the course, you have book-length assignments- famous books that are short but require some comprehension and understanding of the material to finish it- or at least understand it.

The concept is related to that of a changing society and changing times; laws must constantly be maintained in order to encompass all different types of people and situations. In the beginning of the story, the animals decided to revolt. This was in an effort to follow the ideas of Major, the old, wise pig. Once the revolt had occured and the animals had taken control,the pigs decided they needed leaders and that they were perfect. The other animals were almost forced to be dependent on the pigs because the pigs created an enviornment in which they were the main source of information. This led to great difficulties between each of the different species, and the animals began to question the authority of the pigs. This created an entire new world of chaos, in which the animals had not just revolted against the humans, but were now in a sense having a revolution inside the world they had created on their own."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Putting animals and communism together was a great idea.

I recommend this book because it is easy to read and a good lesson."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This book \\"Animal Farm\\" by George Orwell is excentlly written. Not only is well written but it is also fun to read. The Arthur uses animals instead of human to express what he wants to say. And that is that dictatorship is inhuman and wrong. He uses this book to portray communism in the Soviet Union. The animals in this book are fed up with their human master, Mr. Manor, who mistreats and underfed the animals. The animals who are told by Old Major, a white boar that he saw in a dream that the animals would revolt and take over the farm. This prove to be true as the animals did revolt and successfully drive out their human master. This, the animals rename the farm from \\"Manor Farm\\" to \\"Animal Farm\\". However, the animal do not enjoy prosperity as they have hope but actually they would be worst of then with their humen master because Napoleon, one of the boar takes over power and starts a dictatorship. Animal Farm relates very well to human government. Such as in Russia and in China. Where the form of government is communism. From an outside point of view it is supposedly that all person are equal. There is no one person richer then the other are more powerful then the other but this is untrue because in these two countries. The government is ruthless and non tolerant of free speech. The government is the central and most powerful group in the country. After reading this book, I found it very enjoyable. I couldn't put it down after starting to read it because the author uses animals in a way that make them seem human. Not only is the text simple to read and understand but you also get to learn about something. And that is the government form, communism. The book slowly shows how ruthless communism can be such as with the animals being slaughter for standing up to Napoleon. I would rate this book if it was on a scale of one to ten a nine because not only was it enjoyable to read but you actually can learn something from this book and that is that communism is not what it is suppose to be."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Perhaps I missed something in ordering this version of Animal Farm....maybe the (very) small print warning that the type size in this small booklet is so small that a magnifying glass is required in order to read it.

Total waste of money from a usefulness standpoint."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"The book Animal Farm is a fantastic illustration of communism in the world today. Fiurst, an old pig on an English farm has a dream about the animals rebelling against the humans. The old pig dies, but his dream still lives on with the animals. Then, the animals rebellion happens unexpectedly because the farmer has not fed them. The humans were run off the farm. Also, there is a rivalry on the farm between two pigs. One is named Napoleon, and one is named Snowball. The rivalry ends when Snowball gets forced off the farm by Napoleon's guards. Then Napoleon is in total control of the farm. He alters the commmandments that Snowball had written. Next, the pigs on the farm have broken all of their animal traits. The animals on the farm are unable to tell teh difference between the pigs and the humans. It's like the pigs are a reflection of the humans. Due to the reason above this book reflects how communism occurs in countries. I would definitely recommend people read Animal Farm. First, this book shows a reflection of human nature in a communist environment. It shows the pigs on the farm taking what they need to get a task done. Napoleon eleminates anybody that gets in his way of ruling the farm. Also, the book shows a great deal of teamwork between the animals. The animals on the farm built a windmill and a storm destroyed it, and they just worked harder and faster to build another windmill. Finally, it shows a good relationship amongst the animals on the farm. Boxer, a work horse, was a role model for everybody on the farm besides the pigs. He would never give up on anything. He always would work harder and faster to get things done. He would make certain sacrifices to help the farm. Overall, I think people should read Animal Farm."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This book shows how any ideology, however altruistic, eventually grows rotten as a political organization administers it."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This is possibly the greatest book ever written by man. &quot;All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others&quot; I can't read or think of that brillant line without getting shivers down my spine.

The pigs take most of the power themselves, believing they are the best administrators of government. Eventually the power corrupts them causing them to turn on their fellow animals, eliminating competitors through brainwashing and bloodshed.In &quot;Animal Farm&quot; George Orwell uses the farm to symbolize the communist system. Though the intention of overthrowing Mr. Jones isn't inherently evil itself, Napoleon's adoption of most of Jones' principles and mistreatment of animals proves that communism is just another form of inequality. Orwell intends to criticize the communist regime using symbolism. The farm represents Russia and the neighboring farms are Germany and England. The pigs represent Soviets and the other animals are workers. The Rebellion can be classified as the Russian Revolution and the whip symbolizes man's cruelty."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"I REALLY LOVE THIS BOOK.

For American citizens, these allusions are restricted to the Russian revolution; but for somebody who comes from a third world country, this book hits closer to home. Napoleon reminded me of local politicians who, as soon as they attain office, forget about the poor folks who elected them, and focus on hoarding money for themselves. His fierce dogs reminded me of ruthless military men who will do anything in order to insure that their leader retains power.

Marx wrote his manifestos on revolution in an ivory tower, which, in practice, came crashing down both is our world(USSR) and in Animal Farm(perhaps represented by the windmill?). As a passive reader of this novel, it is easy to notice the transition from commune equality to totalitarianism. However, when personally involved, such as the animals(excluding the pigs) on the farm, it is not so easy to notice the coup d'etat of the perfect democratic system. I, like many who have posted for this review, am young(freshman in highschool), and for such a broad range of people to understand this novel is representative of how thinly Orwell actually did spread the magical realism over his masterful work.&quot;I see Barsad, and Cly, Defarge, The Vengenance, the Juryman, the Judge, long ranks of the new oppressors who have risen on the destruction of the old, perishing by this retributive instrument, before it shall cease out of its present use.&quot;-Sydney Carton, Tale of Two Cities"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

Despite its age (the book was first published in 1945) it remains relevant to this day. Although it is often interpreted as a satire of Communism, I think that it can represent any form of oppression. After all, in the end, when the animals are watching the pigs (Communists) and the humans (Capitalists) playing cards, they &quot;looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was which.&quot; Animal Farm is as much a satire of oppressive capitalists as it is of oppressive Communists, because when you get right down to it, there isn't that much of a difference.

We Americans live in a country where nearly annually the debt ceiling is raised (TO OVER 8 TRILLION DOLLARS PEOPLE. THAT'S 8,000,000,000,000), and yet we are told over and over that we have a strong economy.The work their very lives out for an ideal they believe in, only to be sold to the glue factory. We Americans have our pensions and benefits taken away and still seem to find a way to vote into power the very people who make it happen.The animals live in fear of a nonexistent enemy, Snowball, and their leaders manipulate that fear to their own ends. This country was forced into an unwinnable war on false pretenses, and daily have to suffer because of it. Napoleon, Animal Farm's leader, uses Snowball and Jones to cow the denizens, Bush uses Al Qaeda and 9/11.The pigs consider the 7 Commandments of Animalism as changeable as this administration considers the Constitution, and substitute \\"American\\" for \\"animal\\" in the final Super Commandment \\"all animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others,\\" and you just about describe how Bush feels about his inherent power.In addition, the history which the \\"press secretary\\" Squealer relates, changes too. Just like the shifting reasons for going to war in Iraq. First it was WMDs, then it was freedom for the Iraqi people, now it's bringing democracy to the Middle East.And in the end, the pigs are successful in duping the animals into believing that they are moral leaders who believe in the fundamentals of Animalism, when in reality, they're just the new bosses, same as the old.Sound familiar?"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"George Orwell's Animal Farm is a superb animation of the Russian Revolutioon. The book is amusing and interesting; it includes a comic element as it synonymously demonstrates the evolution from the proletariat revolution to a totalitarian government led by the swine of the society. Orwell successfully simplified the not-so-simple theory of class stratification and Karl Marx's proposed solution of communism. Orwell's method of conveyance is incredibly inventive. He uses satire in the form of a fairy tale to share his indignation for ideological doctrines that would, if allowed, lead to the eventual destruction of a society. Each character in the story is representative of someone who was involved in the Russian Revolution. Old Major is Marx, and inspires the proletariat revolution by motivating the over-worked animals and educating them on the ways of the human beings, who represent the bourgeoisie. Orwell's creativity convinces the reader that the animals on the farm are intellectual beings, revolting against the tyranny of the humans. Animal Farm offers itself as an example of a responsible criticism of Marxism. The story gives us a peek at the Utopian vision, and then offers a long look at what results from using a Marxist approach at achieving it. I strongly reccomend this book, as it is entertaining and educational. Orwell succeeded in creating a fairy tale that evokes both sadness and laughter, while causing us to feel sympathy and even empathy for the working class animals. The book escapes complexity, but its message does not."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"With all the hype I was a little disappointed with Animal Farm. The premise is good - an allegory where farm animals take over their human masters, set up a government and satirise the excesses of left and right wing dictatorships in the process.However, it does get a little silly. And I don't mean that it's written a bit like a children's book or a fairy tale - that's the point. I think that the satire is often about as subtle as a sledgehammer. It is a tad repetitive which is ironic because it mocks the songs and anthems of the Animal Farm as repetitive propaganda. Seems that Orwell had some anti-propaganda propaganda of his own.The idea of the Animal Farm is a great one but would probably have been better as a short story. It just doesn't sustain the impact over 100 pages. To see a satire/allegory that does one only has to turn to the classic Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift.So, an interesting book - but good, not great."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This book has received justified praise for showing the crowning irony of the Russian Revolution, namely, that those who took over the leadership of the oppressed quickly became identical to the oppressors whom they had overthrown.

He breaks, then changes all of the seven commandments so that he didn't break them. This allegory shows that socialism is not a viable government, because if power is placed in the wrong hands, you get a dictator, namely, Napoleon.

Drunken Farmer Jones is OUT, and the Idealistic Farm Animals are IN. Injustice is to be expunged, and Order and Harmony restored in a democratic environment where the Lion lays down with the Lamb. Suffice it to say, as Scottish Poet Robert Burns indicated;\\"The best-laid schemes o' mice an 'men Gang aft agley,...etc.\\"[see \\"To A Mouse, On Turning Her Up In Her Nest With The Plough\\" 1785]One of the most powerfully told stories, the brief tale is about a host of farm animals who are enslavedby Propaganda-Spewing Hogs, whose Self-Centered Hypocrisy and Brainwashing Sloganeering enable them to destroy the lives of all the other farm animals by exploiting their labor and their naive and idealistic minds.The book tells the tale of what happens when \\"people\\" do not learn to think for themselves,and who permit themselves to be intimidated by tyrants.But why buy this 50th Anniversary Edition? The Illustrations are magnificent.These powerful graphics are the work of Ralph Steadman, who has won international awards.Children will especially find that this edition enhances their appreciation of this story.Also, this 50th Anniversary Edition, a hardback, contains George Orwell's unpublished PREFACE to the original edition, and also his Preface to the 1947 Ukrainian Edition..The essential characters are as follows:(a) The drunken Farmer Jones and his wife.(b) \\"Major\\" the wise old White Hog who shares his revelationand wisdom with the gathered farm animals. You may recall that the movie \\"Babe\\" about the sheepherding pig?\\"Babe\\" was a White also, so that gives some idea of the breed of Whites and what they look like.(c) Two other pigs, Napolean and Snowball, manage to acquire control of the animals by theirgood intentions, cunning, and impassioned rhetorics.(d) Boxer is the large workhorse who supplies the muscle in the farm's reconstruction projects for a Utopian existence of Fodder, Freedom, and Frolic.(e) Benjamin is a cynical, yet wise old Donkey who is Boxer's friend and companion.There is a host of minor characters to fill out the story..There are two movies made from the story, but both (1954 and 1999) differ from the original story, so I cannot recommend those.The book is full of its dramatic contemplations of fate, moments of terror, and open battles from factions representing both Good and Evil..This is one of the Must-Read storybooks in Western Civilization.."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm is a brief, easy to follow parable. It follows the pathology of a society from a democracy to a totalitarian state.

Telling a tale of a farm that is taken over by animals, he hooks you from the beginning. The symbolism used to compare the farm to communist Russia is obvious.

It's easy to see why the book has become a classic, and widely revered. Some consider it to be one of the most important books of the last century. Another reason that it is so popular is the length. It is easy to read and understand, but just because it is a short book, that doesn't mean that it is a small story.

No, it is simply too well established, too engrained in the English psyche, and has been too scrutinized and dissected...but all this with good reason. It is a terrific example of what a great book can be; brief and to the point, eloquent, relevant, and above all entertaining. Appealing to readers of all ages, it teaches an important lesson about totalitarianism, and even begs the questions - will totalitarianism and despotism always exist, in some form? The book seems to insist that it will, and caution against it, much the same as 1984, but one cant help but smile that it is all happening to a group of animals on a farm...The Centennial edition contains a good amount of additional material, and can help the casual reader gain insight into Orwell's intentions, the parallels with the Russian revolution, ect.

So if you could just work a little hard, a little longer, for a little less food every day, for a less comfy place to sleep on, it would really help the cause and the country. The goodnatured workers nod their heads, shrug their shoulders, and press onward, but with minds clouded with doubt and pain. They are plagued with a sense of unfairness, a sense that - perhaps - the pigs that fail to contribute to the work or to the food supply, could themselves eat a little less, perhaps. Just to help the cause. But never fear! With the twin motivators of fear and awe, coupled with the numbing Lethe of little food, less rest, and no warmth, the sweet animals of Animal Farm will gladly give all their labor, life, and litters to the privileged.After all, they may be exploited, but at least they are exploited by one of their OWN. And therein lies the absolute heart-rending tragedy of \\"Animal Farm\\".~ Ana Mardoll"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This book has been on my \\"to read\\" list for a while. A satire of Orwell's opinion on totalitarianism, particularly on Stalin's rule, it was an interesting read.When the animals at the Manor Farm decide to have a rebellion and overthrow the humans things are good for a while. But when a stubborn pig named Napoleon takes over, things take a turn for the worse. The animals are turned into the slaves of the pigs, yet are constantly reminded how things are better for them now then under oppressive human rule.This was a very quick read and also entertaining. It was actually very hard to put down, which surprised me. I was totally concerned about what was going to happen to the animals under Napoleon's rule. This is a very good read and points out a lot of problems with past and modern political systems. It details the evil of being politically ignorant in a humorous but very effective way. I was impressed with how convincing Napoleon's arguments to the animals were, from the outside it looks silly, but from the animals' perspective Napoleon seemed more reasonable than he should have.This book teaches something that I think a lot of us are aware of from history, but it does it in a wonderfully engaging and humorous way. I was surprised at how easy to read and well-written this book was; it is a book that has aged well and will apply pretty much forever.Overall I am glad I read it. I recommend that everyone pick up this book and give it a read through. It is a quick read and is something that will stick with you; a great cautionary tale about how government can lull the populace into submission while taking advantage of them."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Frankly, this book is frightening. And frighteningly awesome. It's so realistic that I'm afraid it's going to happen all over again. I have vague memories of having read it way back when I was in junior high, but reading it again recently, I had no memories of the actual book itself, so this time around was basically like reading it the first time around. And boy am I glad I did decide to reread it.So, it starts of seeming like, what is to me, a dream come true. The animals of Manor Farm decide to kick the human off the farm. I've always dreamed about something like this happening somewhere, to show humans that animals really do have feelings and the way we torture them on factory farms, raising them for food, is sickening. Unfortunately, from there it goes downhill (in terms of my dream of what would happen if this actually did happen in life), and what follows is a brilliantly master-minded story that gives us a unique look at the inner-workings of a socialist/communist society.Sure, with the animals and all, it's fictional, but it's based on truth so much so that, were you to replace the animals with human animals, you would have communist Russia. Orwell's story is told in such a way that, even though you are reading something serious and important, you are absolutely hooked from line one, and you won't want to put it down until you know what happens to the animals of Manor/Animal Farm. Even though, if you know a little something about communism, you probably do.I think it was absolutely fitting that Orwell used the guise of \\"pig\\" for the rulers of his farm. And the sheep, of course, were always the ones to blindly follow. It is scathingly critical in the funniest and most appropriate of ways. Despite the good intentions with which the farm is formed, we see how easily these intentions can change, and how readily the people in charge are willing to brainwash those \\"less intelligent\\" in order to gain a little more human comfort. It builds up in such a way, though, that it's almost as if those high up don't even realize what is happening.Animal Farm is satire at its best, and I could go on for ages about how brilliantly Orwell has parodied communism and given all the best reasons it won't work, but the fact is, the book is short and wonderful, so I think it's best for you to just read it for yourself. So do it! Now! :-) It's witty and funny and brilliantly constructed. More than that, though, it's informative!"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Thank you for getting my Animal Farm book to me right on time and in the condition that was guarenteed.

Afterward, rebellion comes quickly. Drink was the downfall of Jones. The level of his husbandry was poor.The animals get in the hay. Following Major's death, Snowball and Napoleon are the dominant pigs, (and pigs are the smartest animals, the obvious rulers of the farm).In time only pigs receive milk and apples. One of the horses deserts to a farm run by people for the rewards of ribbons and sugar cubes. Snowball is expelled through the machinations of Napoleon and democracy fails.Orwell's wonderful tale was produced in 1945. It captures succinctly the terror world, the illogic of rule by a totalitarian leader. Josef Stalin is one example of such a leader and was Orwell's target. Arguably Napoleon stands for Stalin and Snowball for Leon Trotsky. Hitler may be represented in the novel by one of the characters, Frederick. There are confessions and executions.Following Orwell's experience in the Spanish Civil War he sought to expose the dangers of totalitarian policies. In ANIMAL FARM he achieved perfection. There is balance, tone, rightness in the fable. It is suited to making the author's points. Step by step the trusting barnyard dwellers find their beliefs and their lives sacrificed to their leaders' goals."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Brilliant in its simplicity, harrowing in its telling, ruthlessly gritty in its depiction, enjoyed literally or metaphorically, it is a story which unfailingly continues to find resonance in contemporary times & events.Orwell's exceptionally crafted fable has the oft aspired but seldom achieved ability to rouse deep, raw, genuinely-felt emotions in the reader. The entire spectrum of assorted characters, from the sly pigs to the simple-minded horses, from the visionary to the myopic, are beautifully delineated. The heart-tugging trials and fate of Boxer, and of the \\"lower\\" denizens of Animal Farm cause ache and haunt long after the story ends.Despite its predominantly grim theme, the descriptions of the mannerisms and the likes and habits of its various characters do not fail to bring a smile to one's face."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"As someone with a definate penchant for book collecting, I am used to having my books disappear on occasion. Whether this is mostly from me lending books out (a common practice; I have now instigated a library-like process for friends wishing to borrow) or from stealing, I'll never know. This is my fourth copy of Animal Farm, and I guarantee that no one will ever take it.What could be better that the meshing of farm animals, Stalinistic politics and acid-drenched cartoons? Almost nothing I think. For anyone who has a love for either Steadman's work or Orwell's masterpiece will find this to be a delightful edition. It is also larger than I expected, doing much justice to the art, and in hardcover.A huge fan of all the aforementioned items, my jaw dropped when I learned about this collaboration. Happy now that it is in my possession, I'm quite satisfied with the purchase. I would say that this is not a product for someone who is unfamiliar with Orwell or Steadman, then again, someone who knows neither wouldn't appreciate its anomaly. I think Steadman chooses appropriate classic works to illustrate - Freud's bio and Farenheit 451 are two others that I hope to soon own."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"George Orwell like many in the British Labour movement saw the October Revolution and the USSR as creating a new model society. Others such as playwright George Bernard Shaw saw Mussolini and Hitler in the same light. By the 1930's as Stalin's crimes became ever more prevalent and after the crimes of the Nazis including the holocaust people became ever more critical of socialist dictatorships however social democracy was seen as the way away from another great depression and in Britain the Labour Party was elected to office in 1946. In 1944 FA Hayek published \\"The Road to Serfdom\\" which demonstrated how the kind of social democracy which denies legal tradition and undermines traditional views of liberty plants the seeds for violent uprising by totalitarian governments. Hayek's book was a major influence on Orwell played an important role in the novels Animal Farm and 1984 that Hayek wrote near the end of his life."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This is not Old MacDonald's farm, but an inspired allegory of socialism Stalin-style.

I bought it for my kids, but I also learned a lot."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"George Orwell was not only the author of 1984 but Animal Farm as well as written numerous essays, articles, etc. about his take on politics. In 1984, society was in the future under a totalitarian dictatorship where nothing was sacred or left to chance. In Animal Farm which I think it's more effective and definitely better reading material than 1984 is the story about a farm of animals who take over the farm against Jones, a drunken, abusive farmer and master of Manor Farm. At first, the rules were applied but slowly changed according to the leaders' rules. The animals in charge were symbolically pigs named Napoleon and his right-hand man, Snowball. Napoleon begins breaking the rules by sleeping in the main house and having parties with the other pigs. The rules or commandments are representative of Moses and the Jews when they were going to the promised land and received the ten commandments. Also, the rules begin to change when the pigs in charge become more like Jones by abusing alcohol and even killing other animals when they disobeyed. Slowly, the animals that were once united by their hatred towards Jones were becoming divided again amongst themselves. The story is quite a classic novel and better suited for younger readers than 1984."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm is a dark satire, showing us what the author considers are some of the worse implications of communism and its failures, and human politics in general.He uses a farm animal setting as the means to do this, as the various creatures set up their own class structures, leadership and indulge in repression and violence."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm by George Orwell is an excellent dramatization of the late Soviet Revolution. The author depicts all characters as animals in a farm where all the events of the revolution take place. I was originally introduced to this writing by Orwell in of my English classes in College. It was on the textbooks I kept with my even after graduation.The author's style and sequencing of events is absolutely fabulous. This is a great reading full of inspiring quotes and many lessons to learn form.If you are interested in learning about the Soviet revolution in an easy and humorous way, then get your hands on this fascinating story."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"The novel Animal Farm is a great read because of the history and everything that is behind it. Not unlike most stories there is a deeper meaning behind the surface plot, this novel being an allegory for the Russian Revolution. I personally liked this book because of how the author was able to adapt the story to the level of farm animals. It gives younger readers the opportunity to have an introduction to history so that when they learn the real detains it enables them to compare and contrast. Also for those who know the historical references behind it, it is just a fun way to look at the story."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm by George Orwell is an extremely rewarding book for readers about twelve and older, in accordance with some violent parts in the novel. The wording of Animal Farm makes it seem like a children's story (the full title reads Animal Farm: a Fairy Story) when in fact it is a cryptic warning about the dangers of communism. The book seems like an unfinished fairy tale: one where good does not triumph over evil in the end. A fairy tale without a moral. And that is, in itself, Orwell's warning: he ends the book openly, letting the reader think of all possible circumstances that could happen at Manor Farm. The novel is incredibly thought provoking, and many of the thoughts that are brought about relate to humanitarian concerns; thoughts of moral ethics, of rights and wrongs in a human society. I found the George Orwell's novel Animal Farm: A Fairy Story an entrancing and memorable short story of which I know the words and messages will remain with me throughout my life. Although this novel cannot amount for many words, what it lacks in volume (as is the case in many pint-sized books) is certainly made up in content. The content of this book will interest most readers immensely and cause them to more deeply consider their own ethics. I highly recommend Animal Farm to any reader above the age of eleven who enjoys a captivating story."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm is a novel that works well as an allegory for the Russian Revolution, but it is also a statement on how we are sometimes manipulated by those who are in higher authority. The interesting element depicted is the essence of anarchy and rebellion, and the cost it has on society. Clearly, the animals in the work do not feel as though they have gotten their fair share by the humans, which is Old Major's initial reason for the rebellion at the book's outset. However, the rebellion, and its laws become a bigger spectacle than imagined, and before some of the more noble characters can possibly realize it, Napoleon has completely gotten control of power over the animals, and they become blind to the truth. In this way the rebellion itself has a life of its own, and transforms the mild animals into animals of a vastly different nature.Another essence of Animal Farm is the picture of society with little freedom, voice or control. At one point after the rebellion, Snowball is ousted from the farm by Napoleon's deceptiveness, convincing the other animals that Snowball did not, in fact, play a heroic role in the battle with the humans. Some animals initially question this charge against the noble animal, knowing it isn't true, but eventually they submit passively, knowing the dangers of contradicting: physical pain, being exiled, or death. The breaking of the commandments of Animalism, and the manipulation and changing them by Napoleon, gradually break down their voice. Squealer seems to epitomize the idea of blindly following the pack when he continues to repeat, \\"If Napoleon says it, it must be right.\\" Gradually becoming less and less resistant to challenging authority, the animals become confused and lose their identity.Although this book has deep symbolic messages and undertones, it is an easy read and a relatively short book in length. Orwell does a fantastic job of painting his ideas of a wrong type of societal system, and doing it in a book easy to follow. Clearly Orwell's book is much more than a story about animals talking on a farm or animals rebelling against humans; it is about losing voice and control as a society."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"I recently read \\"Animal Farm\\" with my Sophomore English class. Whereas my students had the Signet version of the novella (the only one available in the school's Book Room), I trotted out my hardbound 50th Anniversary edition (the version I am reviewing) and read from it, mainly because it had larger text size than the students' paperbacks.I'm not going to get too much into the plot of \\"Animal Farm\\" as I believe if you're reading this review it's to decide WHICH VERSION of the novella is best. The book deals with the revolt and eventual takeover of an English farm by farm animals who viewed themselves as being mistreated by their human masters. Not only is \\"Animal Farm\\" an allegory of the Russian Revolution, it teaches very valuable lessons of how those in power operate (and manipulate the populace) to stay in power. Don't feel that this book is trapped in time, as many of my students made connections with the events from the story with what they see on the news today (Iraq, social injustice, political doublespeak, etc.).Orwell's narrative is an excellent story (though I think his \\"1984\\" is the better work) and is the same here, as in other versions. So why buy this PARTICULAR version? Quite simply, for Steadman's artwork which added so much to the story. His illustrations are not \\"classically\\" beautiful, but have a pop-art feel to them that is a perfect complement to Orwell's writing. The book is beautifully rendered and is IMO well worth the extra money.What this version lacks that other versions offer is editorial commentary; there are no essays about the significance of Orwell's work or biography of his life at the beginnning of the book. However, the editors do include Orwell's proposed Preface to the original edition of \\"Animal Farm\\" as well as the Preface to the Ukranian edition (and \\"No, it's not written in Ukranian\\"). Both are appendices at the end of the novella; both are free of extraneous commentary allowing the Reader to make up his/her own mind about the written words (which is what Orwell would have us do, right?).Beautiful bookmaking. A fitting tribute to a modern classic."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"\\"Man is the only creature that consumes without producing. He does not give milk, he does not lay eggs, he is too weak to pull the plough, he cannot run fast enough to catch the rabbits, yet he is lord of all the animals\\". Or at least he had been on Manor Farm, before the animals overthrew him. The animals on Manor Farm had been feeling oppressed, as they had been underfed and overworked. Then, a revolutionary pig named Major set in motion the revolution that would leave the animals in charge of the farm. At first, they had all been equal, working on the farm to their own capacity and the food produced would all go to the animals instead of humans or grocery stores. The pigs, who had taught themselves to read and write, led the other animals. They set up seven commandments that set up animalism, they basically condemned humans and all of their ways. The animals also set up their own traditions of visiting the skull of, now dead, Major and singing their song, which professed the essence of animalism, The Beasts of England. The also held meetings to discuss plans to improve Animal Farm as it became called. During many of the meetings, two pigs, Snowball and Napoleon, would always disagree, until one day, Napoleon chose to sic a pack of dogs on Snowball and expel him from Animal Farm. Napoleon enforced fierce rule on all of the animals with his pack of dogs. As time went on, it seemed his policies favored pigs, and, one by one, all of the commandments are broken and the pigs start looking even more like humans. One night, it is discovered that the pigs had been conspiring with the humans on other farms and the animals (who had not realized these things before) found out that they are, in fact, worse off than they had been under the rule of humans. The animals then notice that faces of the pugs begin to change and they all look like humans. This was an extremely good book, I would especially recommend it to anyone who has been recently studying the Cold War or WWII.One thing that I liked about this book was that, even though all of the animals had been personified with personality and dialogue, they still had animal names like Clover and Snowball. Also, their personalities seem to fit the animal. Boxer, the horse, is loyal, but intelligent and realizes he is being cheated by the pigs, he is also a hard worker. The pigs, of course, gain benefits at their alleged \\"comrade's\\" expense. They are also the brains of the group. Benjamin the old pack mule, was usually quiet, but smarter than the other animals and helped them open their eyes to treacheries of the pigs.Another thing that I liked about this book was the engaging curiosity it gave me. All of the foreshadowing shoed that Animal Farm would fall to oppression again due to Napoleon's rule, making the reader want to keep reading to see it happen and the exact cause. The Pigs' plans became clear when the banned meetings to discuss plans and decided that pigs would have total control of the farm. Once this happened, it made want to keep reading to see how the animals reacted (passively as they did throughout the course of the novel).Something else that made this a good book was that it described the pigs getting fatter as the other animals started to get overworked. It seemed that every pig got another chin after every previous promise given by animalism was broken. After giving the pigs the ability to drink alcohol, which had been illegal before, the pigs were described as being so fat that their beady eyes were hardly visible. It would seem that the pigs were leeching off of the other animals. Meanwhile, the other animals' ribs can bee seen through their skin.My best reason to recommend this book is that it's allegorical portrayal of fascism is not only accurate, but clever. While a farm may be an unlikely place for a fascist dictator to take over, it shows the telltale signs. A good (and actually animalistic government created by Major) is taken over by someone who disagrees. He convinces them that the old leader is awful and makes a scapegoat of him. When conflict with humans arises and their structures collapse. The leader uses talk to win over the people and makes promises without keeping them. Gradually rights slip away and slaughter ensues. If these tactics were out of context, it would be even easier to identify them. As one reads the book, it becomes more obvious why the story took place on a farm. On a farm, it is easier to show the manipulation of the less intelligent and the shirking that the pigs often do. This was a great book for people who want a reason to think and don't mind old-school political satire."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm is an allegory of a communist nation. The definition of communism is the government, usually totalitarian that controls the economy. According to the new commandments of the farm, \\"ALL ANIMALS ARE EQUAL BUT SOME ARE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHER.\\"(pg 133) The pigs are the government controlled by the leader Napoleon who has more rights than the working class (animals). The pigs are allowed to sleep in beds, while the other animals sleep in the barn. This is similar to the era when the Soviet Union was controlled by the totalitarian leader Stalin. The government was known as communist. But the citizen did not have the same rights as the dictator similar to the government of the Animal Farm.

Animal Farm is a light hearted tale with a meaning. Animal Farm is about a dream of animals rule and a new religon called &quot;Animalism&quot;. Animals taking over thier farm from their drunk owner and try to build a utopian society but they were in rude awkening. At first they were doing good: they made seven rules the animals had to live by, they were making more money and food then ever, and they finallay got to relax. But then things took a turn for the worse: animals having to fight in the humans attacks, snowball(the brians) was kicked off the farm, and they were doing more work and eating less. Pigs took control of the farm and the dreams were crushed but the animals were to stupid to figure out what was going on, even when they caught the pigs. &quot;Animalism&quot; was abolished and things were worse than before.

The dynamic between the animals and the farmer is the medium Orwell uses to make his case. Although it is a relatively simple and short story, it conveys a powerful message.

It may be just me, but I wouldn't consider the rest of the population to be stupid, and as you well know we all do not sit around and just watch the heads of our governments rule our lives while watching them with blank eyes. Even in communism, people speak up, and know whats going on."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This book wasn't that interesting to me.

Animal Farm has nothing to do with communism. Animal Farm is about the age-old question: What would the world be like if animals could talk?

If Orwell is trying to make a point that animals should be controlling everything because they provide much of it, he has done a terrible job. The reason that humans control this world is because we are the only life-forms that can communicate universally, which is taken away in this novel. But, after knowing it is a very bad point, the book is very clever with vivid verbs and a great flow.

Obviously, it is symbolic of society falling apart under a corrupt government(Communism), and the author uses animals as the characters in order to compare them to humans behaving like animals. That is really all there is to it, and, as I said, the symbolism is very obvious. It doesn't take a genius to figure out what the author is trying to say becuase he spells it out for you. The story itself is boring, lifeless and dispassionate. The animal characters have no sense of unique identity.

Although it has earned a reputation of one of our (20eth) century's most accomplished novels, I felt that the &quot;Animal Farm&quot; is a consistently overrated work. George Orwell's often cynical tone made me want to defend my own worst enemy - communism. Not only did he exaggerate and misinterprit historical events, which surrounded the Russian Revolution, Orwell forced me to believe that he was indeed unfamiliar with the system, which was ultimately the world's savior from fascism, a regime far more fearful.

Told is the story of the animals who live on Manor Farm suffering under the tyranny of their owner, Mr. Jones. One day they decide to throw him out and rule by themselves. But Animal Farm is not only a fairy story: It is a political allegory on Russia and the 1917 Revolution. Orwell, a strict enemy of Soviet Communism, makes skillful use of rethorical devices and hidden meanings to persuade the reader of his opinion. Readers of Orwell's later work 1984 will probably miss a bit of the visionary and philosopher that he turned out to be.

This short story about animals&iexcl; trying to prevail over their miserable lives is a reminder to the harsh capitalist society. The people in the bottom, the labor class, are not so well off as their masters. Enjoying their moments in their opera houses, the burgoeis will never understand how hard the life for a proletarian is.According to the introduction, George Orwell, or Eric Blair had started writing this little &quot;fairy tale&iexcl; while still in the World War, and published it at the end of it, in 1945. At the time the Soviet were praised for their brave confrontations against the Germans, and their communist society seemed to be the most ideal one, indeed. It is surprising that Orwell prophesized the fall of such society in which the government claimed itself to be following Marx's principles, claiming to be communists working for the people. Napoleon took over the farm, chasing away Snowball, as Stalin had banned Trotsky, and then started purge to kill him in Spain. And that was beginning of another hardship.There were many literary movements concerning how manipulated the original principles of Marxism had become, especially during and after the Cold War. But not many had managed to give such insight as George Orwell did in his &quot;Animal Farm&iexcl;during his time, on how nations like the Soviet Union or North Korea cannot stand so long. Corruption of Animalism, just as Marxism or Communism, brought once again a farm in which animals are not so happy. What is the difference between Napoleon, and Mr. Jones? Such had been the dilemma that divided many peoples.It is a depressing book, animals not having their share for their hard victory. As we must always, one should wonder about this in relation to our reality. How well will we bring control to the power we gain? How well civilized is our government? Like many questions in life, the longing for a ideal society has not been fulfilled. But we will work harder, in order to achieve it."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Nobody really notices that Animal Farm represents the russian revolution."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"As with all parables, if you ignore the symbolism of this tale, you will miss the entire point. Animal Farm is the story of the Russian Revolution, which started with lofty rhetoric about freedom and equality (as most political revolutions do), but ended with a tyrannical oligarchy wielding the same barbaric control over the masses which the tsars had wielded before the revolution replaced them. In each animal there can be seen a part of society, and the sadness of this story is that the animals who truly attempted to apply the socialist ideals were also too stupid to understand what was going on around them. The exception to this was Snowball, but even he was naive by not realizing the tyranny that was brewing in the self-serving mind of Napoleon. One of the most maddening things in this book was the mindless bleating of the sheep, who by thoughtless repetition of the Party Doctrine could drown out all reason, all intelligent debate, and ultimately, all of the truth about the farm which could have set the animals free.This book is a simple masterpiece, and it's lessons for all societies are timeless."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This book is very good, in depths readying.

The laws kept being changed to fit the pigs desires. The drastic changes at the beginning were accepted and Animal Farm was much better than the original Manor Farm. Animal Farm gradually kept getting worse. The ample food turned into crumbs. The name Manor Farm was changed back. The farm turns out much worse than it ever started with, but the animals supported the pigs and they couldn't remember their way of life with the farmer. The animals representing the actual Russian Revolution makes it even more interesting and frightening. I recommend this book to everyone. It is simple to read so anyone can read it.

The story takes place on what was originally the Manor Farm but is soon renamed by it's unhappy, over-worked and under fed animal residents who eventually plan rebellion and take over the farm. The animals are brought to the realization that they are the slaves of Mr. Jones by the old boar, Major. Major is responsible for teaching the animals that one day rebellion will come and to prepare for it. The animals eventually have a revolution and are led by the pigs. At first the animals are happy and satisfied with their new, free life on the farm but soon things begin to take a turn for the worst under the ruler ship of the pigs. The pigs use propaganda and fear to control the illiterate working class of animals, who are deceived into thinking that they are better of than with the farmer.This book is a very precise allegory for communism, including characters that represent Leon Trotsky and Stalin. Although the book is a very accurate representation of Russian Communism it can be read even if you do not know much about Soviet Russia, and would even be a good read if the allegory was not recognized. I would recommend this book to any reader, because even if they are too young to understand the allegory it is still a well-written and entertaining piece of literature."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"A book for everyone. While some may miss some of the complexities, everyone will get the main idea that Orwell wanted to convey: not to blindly swallow all that your leaders tell you. Hopefully, most will also get the message that power and evil are brother and sister, and those in power will do evil because it's what comes of it. And, of course, they'll lie about it."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Orwell's \\"Animal Farm\\" works on both levels - as a simple fable of greed and corruption, and more specifically, a brilliantly scathing satire on Communism.The animals of Manor Farm in the English county of Willingdon are spurred to rebellion by the visionary white boar - Old Major. Led by two other boars, Napoleon and Snowball, the farm animals with the stalwart shire horse, Boxer, oust the incompetent, selfish farmer, Mr. Jones, and change Manor Farm to \\"Animal Farm\\", henceforth to be governed by the revered laws of Animalism, and its Seven Commandments. However, venality and brute force subvert the high ideals of Animalism, leading to its ironic culmination, which Orwell sums up in the distortion of the final, and most sacred commandment. No spoilers. Read it for yourself.History buffs will find delightful parallels in the many personifications of past Russian Revolutionary figures, whether it's Old Major as Lenin; the gifted, inventive Snowball as Trotsky; or, the brutal, cunning Napoleon as one of recent history's megalomaniacal dictators - Stalin. Then, there's the litigious, double-dealing farmer, Foxwood as the United States, and the gentleman farmer, Pilkington as England/Europe. Not to be left out is Religion - \\"the opium of the masses\\" - as represented by Moses, the Raven, squawking about Sugarcandy Mountain, and the rewards awaiting hardworking animals. Most moving perhaps, is Boxer. His betrayal by the pigs is ultimately the betrayal of the common man, who is the backbone of any nation.Orwell's writing style is masterly, never a word out of place. His sense of social injustice and righteous anger never boils over into melodrama, or cheap manipulation. \\"Animal Farm\\" is not a story with a happy ending, but history is a very long story. Unfortunately, Orwell died before the end of the Soviet Empire. But perhaps, he saw it coming anyway. No dictator stays in power forever, just long enough to do maximum damage in minimum time."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Over the past couple years I've begun collecting hardback copies of classic novels. Animal Farm was one of those we were forced to read freshman year in high school. A lot of my friends were proud to have read 'Animal Farm, because they actually made it through an entire book. But this short novel resonates even deeper when read with the eyes of middle age. Although written about Communism in the 1940s, it's really a blueprint for the stages of all who are corrupted by power at the expense of others. Labor will always be exploited by the clever, no matter what the political parties are called.

The political commentary being made by Orwell may be referencing his own times, but the point being made is all of history, past and present. Totalitarianism can arise from any mimic-democracy. It almost always is seeded by a economically challenged society that elects a \\"strong man\\" to lead. Stalin and communism, Hitler and national socialism are obvious but extreme examples. But Orwell's reminder here is that it doesn't take very long before a leader that has been given absolute power will take over everything for the \\"good of the society\\" through manipulation, lies and even murder. Beware the the figure who promises equality to all. That sort of promise almost always eliminates the middle class, and only creates a ruling class to oversee the rest of us \\"equals\\".

Yes the parallels with Stalin's Soviet Union are obvious: Old Major as Marx, the primer of the revolutionary ideals; the egalitarianism of 'animalism' (communism); Napoleon the brutish Stalin; Snowball the original revolutionary chased into exile (Trotsky). But the book runs deeper than a simple direct fable of the events in Russia from 1917. The English Civil War is also there, especially Cromwell becoming Lord Protector, taking on the trappings of monarchy - trappings even more untrammeled than the monarchs had previously enjoyed.Orwell was a writer deeply preoccupied, and concerned with the exercise of power wherever he went.

I read Animal Farm to help my grandson with his school project. Why I failed to read this amazing allegory for the last fifty years or so is beyond my reasoning. Though my grandson started rather uninterested, when I discussed the ideas behind the story, he got into the discussions and responded with intelligence: \\"Boooo! Napoleon sucks!\\" Never mind!Power corrupts but absolute power corrupts absolutely! No doubt the idea of equality is an amazing concept. Orwell though, realizes the truth behind this fallacy of allowing a government to set those standards. On an individual basis, we can manage equality. On a larger scale, we end up weakening society and individuals without seeing their true strengths and talents. We make everyone equal and never reward hard work. People are equal to live, not to be rewarded just for existing.Napoleon the Pig did not start off by usurping all the power. It took him a while but without opposition and imposing fear on the other animals, he managed to take over and live way above and beyond the others. He changed the rules to fit his agenda.It is indeed a political book. A book not to be discarded or ignored as I have done in my ignorance. Orwell made me laugh, get excited, get outraged and cry. I laughed with the animals, triumphed in their successes, got excited when they built their windmill and cried when the slaughterer took Boxer away.A wonderfully executed fable, not to be missed."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"great book fast upload and delivery. great print and story line. will look for more books to purchase . ."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"an unbelievable story that makes a pretty real resemblance to historic situations.

Some people say that the author depicted communism. I understand the view but I gently disagree. I believe this is a story of power and greed. This story shows how some groups of our society conjure up their intelligence and power to exploit the less intelligent and misinformed. Pig Napoleon represents a greedy, selfish and deceitful leader who says everything is for the poor and needy but in fact only fattening his own belly. Squealer represents media that mislead and manipulate the public with lie to secure Napoleon's power thus securing his own. Boxer stands for honest, hard working general public who gives loyalty and trust to the very people who will exploit to his death. His motto is \\"I will work harder.\\" and \\" Napoleon is always right.\\" In the story Boxer earned love and support from all animals. However I find it disturbing that he never asked anything back for his dedication. There was no evidence or rational explanation why Napoleon should be always right. There was no reason why Napoleon should dictate how Boxer's everyday life should be. His life was such a waste. After all only the few old remember how good an animal he was! Sheep are the very own foundation of pig's power. They say \\"Four legs good, Two legs bad.\\" at the beginning yet change their tune to \\"Four legs good, Two legs better.\\" at the end. They are saying this over and over again yet they do not even understand what they are saying. All these blind loyalty and waste of their life contribute to evil empire of Animal Farm. All things that happened in Animal farm are happening this very moment somewhere on this earth. People were persecuted and executed for pointing out Squealer's lies and Napoleon's evil tyranny.

The author writes about a farm controlled by a harsh Mr. Jones. The animals worked hard and had little to show for it; they were not fed to satisfaction, nor did they have comfortable stables. Orwell uses the animal farm as a symbol of the struggle between socialists and communists.The plot of the story starts with the dream an old boar, \\"Major\\", has about an upcoming animal revolution against humans. He calls all animals together and instructs them on how to act when this uprising will take place. He makes it clear right away that no one can know when this up-rise will take place; and whether it will even happen in their lifetime nevertheless, he gave them over a set of rules by which to live that they should pass on to their offspring. He starts off by telling them why they deserve to be independent; \\"man is the only creature that consumes without producing. He does not give milk . . . and yet there is not one of us that owns more than his bare skin\\" (p. 29). Major emphasized continuously over the importance of equality; \\"and among us animals let there be perfect unity\\" (p. 31). They also established a list of seven commands they must never violate once they win their freedom. Eventually Major dies and life on the farm continues, until the day Mr. Jones forgets to feed them. The animals stormed Mr. Jones home in search for food and when Mr. Jones began hitting them they started butting and kicking until Mr. Jones and his men fled for their lives. The animals began to realize that their time has come and they started implementing the rules that Major had taught them to abide by.Napoleon, one of the farm's pigs, who had a tremendous thirst for power, started manipulating the animals into crowning him as their leader. As time went on Napoleon began to veer away from the path Major had advised them to follow. He gave special treatment to his fellow pigs, and slowly began transforming himself into a dictator. Eventually he took over the whole farm, and had all the animals working as hard as they did under Mr., Jones while he laid back and enjoyed himself. The commandment that read \\"all animals are equal\\" (p.43) was suddenly changed to \\"All Animals Are Equal But Some Animals Are More Equal Than Others\\" (p. 133). None of the animals dared challenge him for they feared for their lives. And so all the freedom they so eagerly awaited for, vanished, as a result of Napoleon's thirst for power.Orwell, so amazingly foresaw what the future had in store for those that preferred the so-called freedom of communism. People will always try to dictate other people's lives; they may use sweet talk in the beginning in order to gain people's trust, but as soon as they feel comfortable enough they will run away with their power; never looking back."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Yes, George Orwell had brilliant books in addition to 1984. It being shorter may be be preferable for some reasons. Another example of this from a different genre would be Of Mice And Men vs. The Grapes Of Wrath for Steinbeck.It's a brilliant extended metaphor. It is clear what he's referring to. One can often make a point about the real world in a setting distanced from the real world. Conversely, knowledge of the real world situation can affect what you expect to happen in the story. I'm not sure what Orwell meant by using farm animals in particular."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"I have a mixed relationship with Orwell. At times I greatly enjoy his works, and at other times (1984 I'm talking about you) I just can't bring myself to appreciate what are well known as classics. Luckily, Animal Farm is one of the ones I can appreciate.Ready for a Revolution, the animals at Manor Farm have had it with the way they have been treated by their human owners. A rebellion breaks out and drives the humans away from the farm and the animals take it over for themselves. They all chip in to do the hard work, but as time passes, certain animals raise themselves as leaders and begin delegating, promising great hopes of tomorrow for the other animals. More and more the perfect society morphs into what they used ot know, with many of them being unaware of it.These are animals, of course we're going to like them better than a story about people. Who can't be charmed by a horse who wants to work hard or a donkey that just seems a bit gloomy. And I think it's a brilliant way of putting the authors outlook on certain societies and government out there. And the subtle way that it's done is most impressive too. The pigs have brains, there's no denying that and it was interesting to see how Orwell used them to present the change in power amongst the animals. I do think Orwell was a bit unfair to some of the animals though; there should have been a few outstanding cases amongst some creature other than the pigs, just like there are a few outstanding people amongst an unfair government as well.Obviously this is based on the authors interpretation of communism. But I think the bigger lesson, rather than focusing on any particular government, is that when you have a group of sentient beings, there are going to be some that want more power than others, and no equality can exist in such a dynamic. No utopia will ever be reached because of this trait of humankind either. It just so happens it's represented by animals in this book. And this book isn't very long. It doesn't even reach a hundred pages in my version which is astounding when you think about how much detail and how many ideas are packed into it. And it's presented well without feeling rushed. Although I do have to say, I would have appreciated it being even longer and more ideas being thrown out there. As good as it is, I definitely can see it being even better.A four and a half star book for me. It's definitely a classic and presents a unique outlook on the power struggles that exist in life.Animal FarmCopyright 194585 pagesReview by M.

However, as time passes by, the animals' plans start to crumble and the future doesn't seem as rosy as before. The pigs have some other plans for the farm.

It struck me how well he was able to protect the leaders by using common scare tactics (\\"Listen to Napoleon or Mr. Jones will come back\\") and changing the rules, or commandments, to suit the desires of Napoleon (adding the words \\"in excess\\" to the commandment that animals are not to drink liquor).This book explores the possibility of a utopian society and is closely fashioned to the vision of the communist party. While its founders have good intentions (Ol' Major and Snowball), the downfall comes from overzealous, greedy, and corrupted leaders (Napoleon). Can Utopia be created?There are many, many lessons to be learned from this book. There is something for us all, especially if you are interested at all in politics. It is good to remember this book so that we, unlike the animals on Animal Farm, don't slowly become enslaved by the leaders sworn to protect us.Notice the word slowly. At the beginning, a revolution takes place where the Animals take over the farm, establish their noble 7 commandments of Animalism, and the people appoint Napoleon and Snowball to guide them in their new society. Napoleon is quick to take power from Snowball and begins using Animal Farm for his own greedy purposes. He abandons and changes the rules of Animalism to suit his purposes. Old traditions, such as the anthem sung by Ol' Major and the markings on the flags symbolizing the work of the common beast, are done away with. So are the committees created by Snowball for the improvement of the animals. Napoleon surrounds himself by bodyguards and, through an act of cleansing many of his enemies, begins to rule the farm in fear. No animal seems too shocked when the pigs begin to walk upright like their enemy, but are more shocked to see the whips come out again. In the end, the leaders become the very people that Animal Farm was created to be protected from and are duped into a worst lifestyle than was given to them previously for the welfare of the leaders. This didn't happen overnight, this happened over the course of a few years. In fact, most of the animals on Animal Farm weren't even part of the original revolution."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"I first read Animal Farm two decades ago, while I was in high school. I'm sure many of you did, too. I reread it recently, and I'm convinced that this is one of those books that one should reread when one is a bit older. Orwell's fable of farm animals' revolution sold out by their pig leaders is simultaneously short, fun, shocking, and engaging. It's also pithy and wonderfully written. Plotwise, you just have to crack a wry smile at the historical parallels that Orwell creates when his characters begin spouting their Marxist philosophies and begin to plot a revolution. Other plot points & themes are timeless -- the supply shortages, summary executions, propaganda, political assassinations, and single-candidate elections in \\"Animal Farm\\" can be seen in many dictatorships, from Stalin's to Saddam's. Overall, I highly recommend rereading this book, especially if you were a teenager the last time you read it."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Orwell's satire of Soviet Communism and the death of Utopia is one of the standards of political satire of the twentieth century. The motto that \\"All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others\\" resonates through this story as the major failure of Communism.The story begins on a farm where the animals have had enough of their human owner and stage a revolt. Initially, all animals are equal, but soon enough, the pigs take control and slowly turn the Farm into a dictatorship, while perverting the original commandments laid down after the Revolution. Lenin, Stalin, Trotsky and the NKVD are well-represented by various animal characters, as are the show trials and massive state projects undertaken by the Soviets. Most compelling are the workers, especially the horse Boxer, whose motto, \\"I will work harder,\\" is a simple mantra of the optimism of the Revolution and the willingness to carry whatever load is asked, for the good of the Farm. When Boxer is no longer useful, he is ungloriously disposed of, with little regard or thanks for his years of backbreaking labor.The end of the Book is simply Communism as Orwell saw it in his time: a corrupt regime ignoring and robbing its people, while making friends and mixing with those it claimed were the enemy, to the point where it was impossible to tell them apart.Orwell had first-hand experience dealing with the Stalinist brand of communism while he was fighting in Spain, and obviously realized that instead of cultivating a workers' paradise, Communism had spawned a culture of fear and lies.This is a great story written in tragic fashion, all the more sad when you realize that the small farm is a metaphor for millions of people and an entire nation, under the thumb of a merciless and corrupt government."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"I know that this book was written as a satire of communism, and I'm sure that's been drilled into everyone's head a thousand times over. I won't talk about that; instead, I'll talk about what the books means to me. I skirted around reading this book for a while because the subject seemed like something I wouldn't be particularly interested in, but I was wrong.Animal Farm was started on an idea that was planted in the mind of the other animals by an old and respected farm figure -- Old Major. He had a dream that animals would take their place as the true heirs of the land. After Old Major dies, a revolution takes place on the farm, and the animals overthrow the owner, Mr. Jones, and claim the farm as their own.At first, things went as planned. All animals were equal, and many things were done with the good of the animals in mind. Then, the pigs (who were smarter than other animals, naturally) began to slowly warp this dream into something more cruel and deceitful until the animals can hardly distinguish between the pigs and Man.I think this story can apply to any form of government. The pigs kept the other animals in line by telling them what they wanted to hear or using excessive force -- much like many governments in the world today. They twisted and warped the thoughts of the masses, making themselves look more heroic and &quot;for the masses&quot;. They even had the scapegoat in the form of a banished pig named Snowball on which all their problems were blame. &quot;Blame Snowball&quot; seemed to be an underlying motto in the book.The pigs benefited from the prosperity of the farm while it's other inhibitants suffered. Most of the animals were fiercely loyal, and the pigs misused this trust. A great example is Boxer who worked harder than anyone on the farm, and when he was no longer useful to the farm, he was suddenly an expendable asset (and you can imagine what happens from there). And you can see hints of that in any society. I never expected to enjoy this book as much as I did, and it will definitely be a part of my library for years to come."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"\\"Animal Farm\\" is so short, so easy to read, and is so famous and influential, that the question is: Why would you NOT read it? If you are new to Orwell, then this is the perfect place to start. It displays, in miniature, his characteristic skepticism, good sense, and keen insight into the corrupting effects of power. It also hints at that underlying sense of guilt that pervades his longer works.The book was criticized at the time of publication for being a flawed fable, in that the pigs, being innately more intelligent than the other animals, were naturally fitted to be the masters. I think that misses the point. This is an allegory of human society, not a manual of animal husbandry. Every character and incident in the story has a clear parallel in modern history. Now that the Soviet empire is no longer with us, I suppose the allegory may not seem so relevant, but there still exist totalitarian regimes that came about as a result of a popular revolution being commandeered by extremists and, no doubt, there will be others in the future. Some lessons of history should never be forgotten and Animal Farm is a great place for each new generation to learn them."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm is a short, witty, clever satire of the rise of Communism.

In this story, all the animals worked together to overthrow the humans. Everything in the farm was going great, infact it was perfect, until Napoleon became power-hungry and kicked Snowball out of the farm.

Finally the rules were so unfair that some animals wanted to rebel but thier plan was discovered before they could take any action. That was when Napoleon started killing them, after seeing what happened to some of the animals, the other animals lived in horror in a prison that they once used to call home.

Animal Farm presents the problems of Soviet Communism in a metaphor that is easily understood, and engaging to read. At the outset, the animals follow the wishes of Old Major, a boar, who represents the idea of Karl Marx and Lenin. He presents his idea for a peaceful society, free of human oppression and harmony for all species. Old Major dies three days after the meeting and the younger pigs, Snowball, Squealer, and Napoleon all establish \\"Animalism\\", which is based on the foundations of Old Major's ideas.The pigs assume control of a Democratic Animal Farm; decisions are made based on the wishes of all the animals. However, over time, a rivalry develops between Napoleon and Snowball, both fighting for control of the Farm. One day, Snowball gives a passionate speech about his idea to build a windmill for the farm. However, Napoleon orders nine dogs to attack Snowball, who is chased off of the farm. Napoleon now declares that only pigs will make the decisions, because it is what is best for the society.Napoleon changes his mind on the windmill, and the animals set to work on the project. The windmill is destroyed however, during a violent storm. Napoleon sees his opportunity. He blames the destruction on a Snowball conspiracy, and now declares that anyone who opposes Napoleon's rule is a traitor. Napoleon begins acting more and more like a human, sleeping in a bed, drinking alcohol, and trading with other farms. Old Major's original plan forbids these kinds of actions, but Squealer explains his actions through propaganda. There is finally a domino effect which leads the animals down the path of the Russian people in the 20th century.I felt this book presented a great metaphor of the Russian Revolution, bringing about sympathy for the animals, who were led down the wrong path. I felt Napoleon's character was developed well, starting as a believer in the original ideals, to a power hungry dictator. The animals of the farm also symbolize the population of the Soviet Union, trusting leaders and their decisions.

If you wonder &quot;satire of what&quot;, then I strongly recommend you to read this book and find it out yourself. I admire Orwell\`s ingenuity for transforming a fairy tale into a great literary success - that is the ultimate satire.Good job."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"I found that the book Animal Farm was a bigger \\"American Classic \\" than I thought it was going to be. The book was written by George Orwell, which in turn was a pen name for the writer Eric Blair. He was born in India but educated and raised as an Englishmen. The book overall was great. It definitely had a good flow to it yet it still kept you on the edge of your seat waiting to read what strange thing happened next.Orwell has a line in the very beginning of the book that is stated by the animals of the farm \\"man is the only creature that consumes without producing. He doesn't not give milk, he does not lay eggs, he is too weak to pull plough, and he can not run fast enough to catch rabbits, yet he is the lord of all animals\\". That line was my immediate realization that the book was going to be at least half way good. The book consists of a large group of farm animals that can apparently talk. They decide to take over the farm on one huge swift operation. After successfully taking over the farm in the very early part of the book, the remainder of the story basically consists of them surviving and getting through life. One flaw that the story does have is the lack in explaining obvious obstacles for animals. Them having total hatred for humans being able to read write and logically hold a farm is a little too much to believe. The entire basis of fact and fiction shouldn't necessarily be thrown together. Having animals speak but at the same time having the rest of the story and its plots completely believable. To me, having animals building a windmill in a story that's supposed to be true is very much out of question. All of this even coming to the animals having a set of seven commandments. 1. Whatever goes upon to legs is an enemy. 2. Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend. 3. No animal shall wear clothes. 4. No animal shall sleep in a bed. 5. No animal shall drink alcohol. 6. No animal shall kill any other animal. 7. All animals are equal. The commandments and multiple other lines being written on the barn of the wall by a set of very intelligent pigs is too much for a serious book. One thing that did make it a well-rounded book is the fact that you could direct this book to many different audiences. It has the appeal to kids with the talking animals and doesn't have extremely hard grammar. On the other hand, it still has the maturity level of an adult. Another flaw about the book is the fact that not much of it changes. The characters (all the animals) tend to do the same stuff over and over again. They wake up and work everyday, and have a big meeting on Sunday where the flag signifying their freedom is raised. Not too much changes besides the obvious small and brief problems. The animals tend to also die off way too much. Animals seemed as though they were unlimited.Overall the book was great. George Orwell is a fantastic writer. I would definitely read his other books. Although a lot could have improved this one, I think overall his book was good."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"\\"All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others,\\" is the baffling commandment written on the barn wall at the end of Animal Farm. It is not understood until the reader has made his or her way through the satire, encountering the feats and challenges of Naploean, Snowball, and the other animals living on the farm. Animal Farm is a witty, yet critical story of the farm animals on the former Manor Farm, overthrowing the human owner, Mr. Jones. The old boar, Major, professes that humans are the root of all evil and the animals must rebel and take control of the farm. His goal is to spread this message to animals everywhere, and eventually animals will take control over humans entirely. Finding that each event and character relates to an aspect of Russian history, reading Animal Farm became not only an irresistible book to put down, but a continually unfolding story of Russia in its totalitarian state that Orwell, the author, so despised. The excitement of the rebellion of the animals creates a vivid picture in my mind, as does the animals' confusion of the totalitarianism that begins to form. As the pigs continue to gain power and the animals continue to be convinced that it is for beneficial reasons, I cringed at their stupidity, which was probably Orwell's intention. As the story unfolds, it becomes predictable in a good way, as to how the animals will react to Naploean's incessant rise in power.Throughout the novel I found Squealer to be my least favorite character. Representing the propaganda viewed by the public due of Stalin's (Naploean) orders, Squealer makes speeches to the animals, lying to convince them that Naploean's power- hungry ways will positively affect them. This becomes very frustrating when the animals continue to believe Squealer's nonsense about things that obviously aren't true. His way of manipulating the animals is very perplexing and evil, making him my least favorite character, yet most intriguing.Animal Farm is very original in the sense that it is not only an enjoyable, leisurely read on its literal level, but creatively educates readers about Russian history at the same time. George Orwell cleverly created characters and a whole story about animals on a farm that symbolize figures and aspects of the rise of communism in Russia. Animal Farm is witty in the sense that these Russian leaders he is critical of represent pigs, and extremely critical of totalitarianism, which Orwell strongly despises.At some points during my reading of Animal Farm, I was confused as to why and how the animals could possibly believe the outrageous lies that Squealer spoke of. It just didn't seem believable that they would be this gullible. However, knowing that this novel is a satire, I learned that satires often exaggerate points to make the reader more critical of an aspect of society. Orwell most likely exaggerated the animals being this gullible and the egregious stories Squealer made up, making me much more critical of totalitarianism.I would definitely recommend this book to all of my friends or anyone wanting a fun read. I would also recommend it to anyone looking to teach or learn about Russian history.I would love to read other works by George Orwell because he puts aspects of society into a whole new perspective. Not only does Animal Farm represents aspects of Russian history through animals and their life on a farm, his opinions are very strong, and seem to grow throughout the book. It would be interesting to see what else he has to say in his other books.The end of Animal Farm is the most clever and witty part of the entire book and leaves the reader laughing and stupefied at the same time. What I love about the ending is the complete irony it presents.Orwell remarks at the end of Animal Farm that the story ironically ends almost in the same state it began. The problem at the beginning becomes the problem in the end; it went full circle. The difference between man and pig is incoherent. Just read it. You'll love it."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm is a book that makes you think about what you are reading. I felt claustrophobic when I was reading this book because every time the pigs were acting like hypocrites, the other farm animals would just go with it. The pigs always had Squealer to rely on to convince the other animals who were stupider than the pigs.My favorite character was Benjamin, the donkey. He was my favorite because he just sat back basically and watched everything happen and didn't do anything stupid about it. If he had spoke out and protested against the pigs, he would have been killed. If he tried to keep a rebellion quiet and just talk to the other animals about rebelling, the animals would have been stopped and punished.I liked the book because it showed me a different perspective on communism and how it can come into power. Using animals instead of people was brilliant, I thought, because it's something that not only adults can relate to.I give praise to the author George Orwell because he constructed this masterpiece over fifty years ago and students in schools across the nation are still reading it. The book is still being read and learned from after all these years.I learned from this book about Russian history and how people like Stalin and Trotsky came into power starting a communist reign. I also learned a bit about Orwell and how political he really is.I thought the ending of the book was very good. How the pigs were acting more and more like humans everyday when all they told the animals was to be against humans, because this is why they rebelled in the first place. In the end, the pigs couldn't even tell the difference between the pigs and the humans because they were so alike.I have no questions about the book, and if there are things left unanswered then I think that they were meant to be unanswered by the author. I think if they were answered that it would only detract from the book.I would definitely recommend this book to a friend because it's such an enjoyable quick read. I would like to read 1984 by George Orwell after reading Animal Farm because I enjoyed Animal Farm so much.All in all, Animal Farm was a very enjoyable read and I recommend it to anyone who can obtain the book."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"When reading the title Animal Farm on a blue book that has a picture of a pig and a horse on it, many questions come to mind. After reading the back of the book, which contained the summary, it made things a little clearer and only makes you want to read more. This is exactly what I thought whenthe book was assigned for me to read.Usually books that are chosen for school, I don't really like, or they don't hold my interest very well, however Animal Farm by George Orwell was an exception. Overall I thought the novel was a nice, easy read, that kept me involved and at times left me wanting to read on. The book paralleledRussian history, and told a tale of two pigs that over threw the farmer, and then they took control of the farm. They developed a new source of government called animalism, which was a spin off of communism. The two pigsin charge were Napoleon and Snowball, but symbolically they were Trotsky and Stalin. Throughout the whole course of the book it showed how Napoleon became power hungry and over threw Snowball. It also told of the strugglesand hardships that the animals went through, with their new government and new leaders.The book taught me different lessons about how being power hungry could corrupt one. This lesson was displayed throughout the book, mainly by the character Napoleon. He is a strong leader and wanted everything to be his own way, no one else's. He displays this characteristic about himself by the ejection of his right hand man, Snowball. After Snowball has been removed from the picture, Napoleons power really gets to him. He starts creating all of these crazy work hours, which force the animals to work long, hard hours, with little food. While Napoleon and the other pigs eat feasts and drink beer as much as they please. All of this shows how power can go to a pig's head.The reading of the book Animal Farm, really brought out different emotions in me. There were times when I was reading, that I just felt like yelling at the animals for obeying Napoleon's absurd rules for so long and never questioning it. Then at other times I was proud of all the hard work theanimals did, and how they accomplished all of their goals without the help of humans. When Boxer died, I felt as though I could cry, and I probably would have if I didn't have to stop to tend to something else, which took mymind off of the book for a second. So for anyone who plans on reading the book they should be ready for their emotions to be going in all different directions, because mine certainly did.My favorite character throughout the book was Boxer, the carthorse. Boxer was a strong worker, always willing to do more and wanted what was best for the animals and the farm at all times. Throughout the book he had a motto,\\"I will work harder\\", which eventually evolved to \\"I will work harder\\" and \\"Comrade Napoleon is always right.\\" Those words that Boxer lived by showed how dedicated he was to the farm and his leader, Napoleon. Up until the very last moment of Boxer's life he was always helping and working his hardest. Another reason he was my favorite character was because his personality was very loveable. Even though he worked from sun-up to sun down, he was stillpleasant and considerate around the animals. Always helping and showing the animals, especially Clover, his tender side.As a whole I thought the book was very well written and think it was a very creative idea that George Orwell came up with. However if there were one thing I could change, it would have to be the ending. I thought that book ended abruptly, almost like it was a cliffhanger at the end of a chapter, leaving you wanting more. The end described how half a dozen farmers and half a dozen pigs were all sitting around a table, drinking beer, and discussing the success of Animal Farm, while little do they know, the animals are right outside listening to them. Although it was a thoughtprovoking ending, it left me unsatisfied and wondering what was to become of the animals, and if there would be another rebellion. If I were George Orwell, I would have had Snowball come back and take over the farm, leaving the reader feeling content about the book and knowing that the animals would have a good life with a worthwhile leader.I would recommend this book to a friend, because it is an easy yet thought provoking read. On the contrary I don't think I would read anything by Orwell again. The reason I feel this is way is because he writes mainly on things that have some sort of political meaning, and the political worlddoesn't interest me. Although if you are a person who really enjoys that particular kind of writing then by all means George Orwell is an author who deserves your time for his books.Now when I go to turn in my copy of Animal Farm, all of curiosity will be cured, all of the unanswered questions will now be answered. The book with the horse and pig on the front now tells a story within itself. After reading and doing my final analyzation on Animal Farm, I don't know if Iwill ever be able to look at a pig the same way again."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Take the ideas and concepts of totalitarian governments, write a book with farm animals rebelling against their master, and mix in the events of communist countries around and leading up to World War Two. And the finished product is Animal Farm, the \\"fairy story\\" by George Orwell. I had neutral feelings throughout the book except for some important events, such as when Boxer was carried away by the horse slaughterer, and the end scene in the farmhouse. At these points I was very caught up in the story. Overall, I did not enjoy reading the book, but I did not mind it. My favorite character and the one who stood out most to me in the story was Benjamin the donkey. He was the oldest among the animals and the wisest, except for the pigs and maybe the dogs. Even though he knew of the dangers and deceptions, he stood by and let them become slaves to the pigs because he believed life would always be bad no matter what any animal did. Besides these traits, the main one of Benjamin's that I like is that he is the only animal smart enough to see what the pigs and dogs are doing to the animals. This also leads to what I dislike about the book. I did not like how all the animals accepted the ideas and rules of the pigs so easily. This may have been how it was in real life, but I still have a hard time reading the book and watching the characters give up their freedom so willingly.George Orwell is an excellent writer. He managed to portray totalitarian rule in a very original way, with animals on a farm acting out the rise of communism in Russia. He follows actual events well enough that Animal Farm can teach the general history of Russian communism. I learned about the start of communism, its rise and corruption, and what it came to be. The ending of the book was very well done; I could not put the book down for the last forty or so pages. The end scene was especially good. It left me in thought about communism, society, and man in general. I thought George Orwell stopped the story at a good point, even though it left me with many questions about the fate of Animal Farm, also known as Manor Farm. I would recommend the book to a friend because I think everyone should read it once. The book may be an easy read, but it should be read by all because it has higher level concepts and ideas that make it stand out among others of its kind. I am also interested in reading other works by this author because Animal Farm had great style and great ideas. Now that you have learned of George Orwell's great work, it is time for you to witness it for yourself. I dare you to pick up a copy of Animal Farm and see why it is considered a must read in today's day and age."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"It goes throgh all the stages that communism does, only it's on a farm.

As Old Major (one of the older pigs) said, &quot;Man is the only real enemy we have. Remove Man from the scene, and the root cause of hunger and overwork is abolished forever.&quot; The barnyard animals agree with Old Major and decide to overthorw their cruel master, Mr. Jones. After an unexpected take over of Manor Farm, the animals elect the pigs as their rulers. Two of the pigs happen to be Snowball and Napoleon. These two are the main leaders of the farm. With Snowball and Napoleon as rulers, many adventures lay ahead for the animals on Animal Farm (formerly Manor Farm). Adventures of war, defeat, deceitfulness, and changes in every day living. In the end, a strange twist occurs that may surprise you. &quot;Animal Farm&quot; is a powerful look at how a government and leadership applies to many people. Many countries are in basically the same situation as the animals of this story. That is what I think makes &quot;Animal Farm&quot; such an interesting book. I also think it is interesting how the author, George Orwell, puts certain animals with certain personalities and how certain things that may seem small turn out to be a major event in the book. I think it is awesome how George Orwell uses this in his writings. If you are into a book where defeat and leadership are a main subjet of the book, or you just like to read about talking animals, I would highly recommend the book &quot;Animal Farm&quot; by George Orwell. It has been a favorite in my bookshelf for years and I hope it will soon be part of yours."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal is probably the greatest book I've ever read.

I want a book that offers a vision for something greater. Although they say Orwell was a socialist, I feel this book risks leaving the reader to default into thinking that a capitalist system like the modern one is the best, because \\"it works.\\" No wonder this book is assigned en masse to public high school students in America - or was, at least, when I was in high school in the 1980s. Yuck!I don't like this book because it's utterly depressing: it offers no hope. It's just an endless spiral into misery. I want a vision of a society that is beautiful, that isn't destructive, where hope and healing are real, where exploitation is not the byword of the day.My answer: I see our hope in healing our childhood traumas, working out our ancient rage and our ancient fantasies that our traumatizing parents will rescue us. If the masses of humanity work out these inner demons then capitalism crumbles, totalitarianism is rendered irrelevant, war becomes moot - and beauty can rise to the surface."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"If anyone is looking for a creative and enjoyable book to read, they should take a look at Animal Farm by George Orwell. This book is about a group of farm animals who are mistreated and abused by their owner, Mr. Jones. One day, the animals on Mr. Jones' farm rebel and exile him and all of his workers out of the farm. The animals run the farm together and start a Marxist lifestyle, dividing the work equally, making fair rations and deciding on farm issues as a whole, with all of the animals equal.. However, the pigs, led by two named Napoleon and Snowball, begin to gain control by slowly building up support. Napoleon, due to vast disagreements with Snowball, runs him out of the farm and takes complete control in leading the animals. From this point on, the lives of the animals, especially the pigs, change forever. Napoleon becomes a dictator, and nothing is the same, or for that matter, ever will be.This book is very unique. Unlike many books where the author has you following one or a few key characters, George Orwell tells the story of the farm as one. There are still main characters, but you are not necessarily following that one character throughout the entire book. One of the main characters is the pig Napoleon. He is very much like a dictator. Much like Hitler, he works his way into power by lying to gain support. Once he has that power, he takes total control of the farm and forces the other animals to follow him and do as he says through fear. The story of the animal farm reminds me of the rise of the Soviet Union: communism turning to totalitarianism.I enjoyed greatly Animal Farm. George Orwell uses very strong language and the storyline really draws you in. I also thought that the way he made his entire book a metaphor of the Soviet government was incredibly creative. The characters are quite similar to regular people in their personalities and speech except that they have several views and reactions that you might expect an animal to have as well as hatred towards humans and the way of life. His concept of animals running a farm on their own is very unique. Because this concept is so unusual and intriguing, the book is somewhat difficult to comprehend, reminding me of my experiences with Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury. These two authors put ideas into each of these books that are so far off from the norm that it is hard to see what it would be like to live in the book. You could describe Animal Farm is a mix between the uniqueness of Fahrenheit 451 and the theme of talking animals in Babe by Dick King-Smith. I would recommend this book to people that enjoy fables, especially ones involving politics. If you like books like Fahrenheit 451, you will enjoy this Animal Farm by George Orwell."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm may seem like a book about Old McDonald, but don't be deceived by it's title.

For a 9th grade student, or for anyone with a limited knowledge of Russian history, it is difficult to compare all the book's characters to the historical Russian figures. A better background in history would have made the book more meaningful. The characters in Animal Farm are well-developed. It is an interesting story on a basic level, even if you do not know much about Czar Nicholas II. The faults of the communist style of government are evident. For example, although all the animals are suppose to be equal, some animals, such as the pigs, are more equal than others. One of the most memorable parts of Orwell's book is when I saw the true side of Napoleon. When he takes the pups away from their mother, trains them to attack, and orders them to go after Snowball, we see what Napoleon is really like. From that point on, I was not surprised by Napoleon's actions. I disliked him and his lack of respect for the other animals. You'll understand Animal Farm better on a deeper level if you know something about Russian history and events leading up to the Revolution."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Remember the days when \\"conservatives\\" claimed to be for smaller government, lower taxes, lower spending, etc ... ? Well, what happened when they won the presidency in the 1980s followed by congressional takeover in 1994 with the same \\"conservatives\\" and their ilk still controlling all 3 branches of government and most of the state and local legislatures? Nothing's changed for the better. Just like what happened in Animal Farm, there's always oppressors and suppressors protesting their policies especially when it comes to the war in Iraq, cooking the books and laws, intervening as was the ugly case in the Terri Schiavo tragedy, spending and wasting even more taxpayer money on illegal wars and riches for the already well to do, etc ... Even most rightwing talkshow hosts these days are unable to digest, but are forced to admit, the fact that these \\"borrow and spend conservatives\\" are far worse than \\"tax and spend liberals\\". In fact, today's so-called \\"conservatives\\" who promised an end to communism and the Cold-War have already allowed Putin of Russia to run a dictatorship while acting like the same kind of communists they used to complain about. Just like it happened in Animal Farm, people are unable to tell the difference between the folks they threw out of power and their replacements who originally came in to power giving false promises of better this and better that.

If you already own 1984 or have read it then skip Animal Farm or find a copy to borrow (it can be read in its entirety in a leisurely afternoon). I realize this book is considered a classic--as well it should be. But it is a classic because of what it mocked, IMHO, and not because of what it represents as a literary work. The story is...incomplete and accelerates through large swaths of time--seemingly much more interested in arriving at a preordained conclusion than exploring the path along the way.Animal Farm was an idea George Orwell had for a tale of animals gaining the human capacity for self-awareness and self-actuation bent, prodded, and cajoled into a didactic telling of the evils of the Soviet Revolution. When one considers the pitched battle waged for the minds of the proletariat between West and East in the 1940's, 50's and 60's, it is easy to understand how this book could have garnered critical acclaim among Western intelligentsia. But as a bedtime story for children its diction is complicated and its message garbled for a developing mind; and as an allegory for adults it is \\"childishly\\" transparent in parts and rushed in others--so much so that I found it necessary to remind myself that I was reading a \\"classic\\" instead of being entranced by a great work.I would suggest one of two things happened in the telling of Animal Farm:One, Animal Farm was George Orwell's attempt to engender in youth a fear of Communism. If this was his intent I feel comfortable in my opinion that Animal Farm is an abject failure. I adore George Orwell's writing and his powerful prose, but he is no J.R.R. Tolkien meets Henry Kissinger.Two, Animal Farm was the stirrings of the Party, doublethink, and the idea of the perpetual struggle for no more than the struggle's sake. If this be the case, than Animal Farm was a fine effort that led to George Orwell's Magnum opus--1984. In either case, I do not think Animal Farm stands the test of time. That is, one hundred years from now I think this book is seen as nothing more than a quaint period piece.

Likewise, we continue to see, as in Orwell's day, the rewriting of history through a sinister use of language and phraseology to deceive and control. But without a valuable awareness of the past, we have no reference point and we are easily duped.This book should be required reading for every human being, especially during this time of dangerous apathy. Even students, once relied upon to be the cutting edge of protest, today rally behind the hit song, \\"Waiting for the World to Change\\"--just waiting it out instead of participating.Truly there is nothing new under the sun, as Orwell's allegory illustrates. We just need to be aware--and there is enough history behind us that we could easily BE aware.

This easy-to-read book is a story of &quot;Manor Farm&quot; and the many animals that live there. At first glance it may appear to be an extra long children's story, however, the reader will soon pick up on the underlying story. This fable is allegorical in nature due to the fact that it tells the story of Soviet communism. This is a story that features a workers' revolt where the working class (the animals) rise up against an oppressive ruling class (humans). This revolt resembles the revolt advocated by Karl Marx, the so-called &quot;father of communism&quot;. The animals' revolt against their oppressors only leads to a much harsher oppression within a dictatorship, once again pointing to the Soviet brand of communism. Orwell paints an accurate picture throughout this story of both the dictatorship, which is represented by pigs, and the lesser working class, which is the rest of the animals. Despite the serious nature of Orwell's message, there is some comedy as well as action that make this story a good read. Although this book was originally published in 1946, it is still relevant today. In today's world there are still residual effects of Soviet communism as well as many dictatorships. By reading The Animal Farm one is able to understand the oppressive nature of a dictatorship, and of communism in its impure state, which will allow one to have a better understanding of the tactics dictators use to seize and remain in power. This understanding will also shed light on the events occuring throughout the world today in the form of war and strife. This short book that resembles the nursery rhyme &quot;Old McDonald's Farm&quot; is a much more complex story than it appears. Anyone who considers themselves to be an historian or a casual reader could benefit from reading this classic tale."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Kay Calhoun Book Review - Animal Farm 10/30/00Animal Farm is a deeply compelling piece of work that asks us to imagine what world figures are represented by Animal Farm characters. The story is about an animal revolt (revolution) against the farm owner to make for better lifestyles and more justice in their existence. Each character in the book (animal) has its own distinct personality and represents someone in world history in the real world.I liked the book immensely, because it was extremely well written by Orwell and the characters were well developed. The book was easy to read and hard to put down. Besides being a pleasure to read about these characters, Orwell's book taught lessons on racism, dictatorship, propaganda, totalitarianism, loyalty and socialism.Orwell was a genius to have real world figures represented by animals and had trouble getting this book published because of the political atmosphere. Orwell obviously used one main character to represent Stalin of the Soviet Union and during World War II it was a hard time to publish anything against an allied country.I highly recommend buying and reading this book and suggest you think about each animal character and who they represent in real life, and you will learn a lot about the Russian Revolution. This book is an eye-opener on the pitfalls of totalitarianism...All this is apparent from a little book about animals! Buy it and read it!"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm is a book that achieves many things, but mostly it is accurate. Author George Orwell has clearly done much reasearch on how the Bolshevik revolution unfolded, and what life in the communist Soviet Union was like. He follows the revolution step for step, up until the late 1940's when the book was written. The careful description of the carachters and the part they play in the story and in history is fantasctic. The carachters such as Comrade Napoleon (representing Stalin) or Snowball (Trotsky) or even Old Major (Lenin) or the dogs (KGB) all act exactly how they are supposed to. This accuracy on Orwell's part makes the book extremely humorous. But, even though Animal Farm is witty, it can take itself seriously. Along with this humorous look at the situaition, there is also a tone of the grim reality of what did happen in the Soviet Union, (i.e. the execution of people opposed the Stalin). The struggle conveyed by the animals is probably accurate as well. With all it's humor, and it's historucal accuracy, as well as George Orwell's writing style and good vocabulary, make Animal Farm a great read. In short, this is one of the greatest, if not the greatest political allegory of modern times.

I liked the book well enough, that's for sure. It is a very powerful little book (mine is 128 paperback pages) with political ramifications throughout. It would help if you understood history and political science, especially from the days when Orwell wrote this (1946). I give it four stars because, when I first finished the book in an English class, I was not fulfilled. Was it for politics sake? Was it to get by senior English? (Since then, I've taught the book to high school sophomores who, by the way, would probably also not give it five stars if they were polled). I don't know. It's certainly worth a read, though, and it might not be a bad idea to have the Cliff Notes near-by.

The farm animals are now worse off than before their revolt. A good idea gets twisted into something bad--a common theme throughout human history.

The pigs willfully edit the Seven Commandments to make themselves \\"more equal.\\" (No one outside of the pigs really remembers what the commandments actually were--The Major Pig's visionary precepts are now a farce.)

That animals can overthrow their previous repressors, the humans and yet due to the greater intelligence of the pigs, they came to rule the Animal Farm by propaganda, misinformation, subtle changes to the democratic system initially instilled. \\"Four Legs good, two legs bad!\\", the initial slogan and maxim in which the animals followed devoutly soon corrupted and degenerated into something else.The ending is at once tragic and poignant.

I was hooked to Animal Farm from the start reading it in a few hours. I know that there have been comments and analysis on his work that describe this master piece as a poignant criticism of Marxist ideology, yet deeper thought and analysis of Animal Farm points to the propensity of power to corrupt under any political system independent of ideology. Someone once said that the propaganda machine in a democratic society is just -or more effective-than the whip in a blatantly totalitarian society; examples of this phenomenon are evident throughout the book from beginning to end.This work speaks loudly to today's generation in any democratic society. It speaks of the responsibility to be informed and to think independently with a willingness to objectively assess the policies and decisions of the political leaders we elect. No longer can we simply allow our leaders to decide strictly on the assumption that they know what is best for our own good. Nor can we allow our opinions to be molded by government's propaganda machine: the mass media.Orwell completed this work in 1948 giving the piece a sort of uncanny prophetic feel, if one extrapolates it's content to describe the shadow on politics cast by tyrannical corporations under current free market neo-liberal policies. It's too simplistic to describe Animal Farm as a criticism and warning against Communist totalitarian regimes; moreover, it speaks of class war and what the elite will do to keep the lower classes in check.Furthermore, this a must read for those interested in the power of group think as well as the use of propaganda and language to manipulate thought.

When I first heard about this book, I was pretty skeptical that it would be a good book. I was wrong. It deals about the Ideas of \\"Animalism\\" (communism), what makes social classes, and how a country can be like while ruled under a dictatorship (Which in this case, would be an animal version of Stalin).

Not bad for a story whose primary characters are talking barn animals.Written in 1946 and intended as an allegory paralleling the revolution of the Bolsheviks and the eventual rise of Stalin in post-WWI Russia, Animal Farm replaces the Communist intellectuals and elites with pigs (Major, Snowball, and Napoleon, who are Marx, Trotsky, and Stalin respectively), the smartest animals on the barnyard; the secret police is represented by ruthless canines; the sheep are mindless followers of the regime (\\"four legs good, two legs bad\\"); Boxer the horse represents the common, downtrodden worker and hero/\\"true believer\\" of Socialist ideology (not surprising as Orwell was a proponent of democratic socialism); and the humans are symbols for the fallen Czar (Jones) and Hitler and the rise of Nazi Germany (Frederick). The story has simple though excellent characters (my favorite is the cynical donkey Benjamin) many of whom arouse both our sympathy and our contempt as the idealism of the Revolution is turned on its head by elites corrupted by power; the cure becomes poisonous, as the chilling final chapter reiterates.Many elements of this book have entered the popular lexicon under our noses (\\"some animals are more equal than others,\\" \\"four legs good, two legs bad\\" etc.). The story itself has been translated to animation and film (with varying degrees of success) and was even adopted by Pink Floyd to create their 1977 masterpiece Animals. But nothing can usurp the original novella's importance. Along with 1984, it is perhaps Orwell's best piece of work, and definitely his most enjoyable.I've noticed that some of the reviewers here (particularly the one or two-star reviews) are junior-high students who have read this for their English classes, and don't exactly \\"get\\" it.

It was obvious that the story was a satire of Communism (all the animals call each other \\"Comrade\\"), and at times it was very funny in its ridiculousness. But there was a disturbing grain of truth throughout the book which can make the reader uncomfortable. Here is a revolution that starts from a common spirit of cooperation and a desire to make things better for the whole group. But when one group takes control, and uses lies and intimidation, or even murder, to keep that control, one is reminded sharply of oppressive governments around the world that are very real. The ending was definitely a slap in the face: as the \\"common\\" animals look on, they find that they cannot tell the difference between their pig leaders, who now go on two legs, and the evil humans they had overthrown.

Well now that I've picked it up, I realize that I would have enjoyed it then as much as I did now. This thinly veiled (perhaps obvious) critique on the government at the time in Russia provokes many questions on the legitimacy of any government and the inability for communism to operate effectively. The animals band together to overthrow the evil \\"human\\" to form their own government - animalism, where all animals are created equal.

It is a humorous yet realistic satire on Soviet Russia. Although never specifically named as the target of Orwell's story, much controversy has come about from Animal Farm's similarities to the Russian Revolution. Telling the story of animals who are tired of suffering under the oppression of humans, it brilliantly illuminates the struggle of the common man against tyranny. Old Major, a prize winning boar who has the revolutionary spirit of Karl Marx, tells the animals of a dream he has had of a utopian farm where animals have the power. After winning over the emotions of most of the farm animals, Old Major dies and the pigs (Napoleon and Snowball) take over the revolution. Napoleon forces his way into unquestioned power using underhanded tactics and clever slogans like \\"Napoleon is always right\\" and \\"Four legs good, two legs bad.\\" Addressing his fellow animals as \\"comrades\\" Napoleon is reminiscent of Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin, covering up the corruption of the farm by saying it's all \\"for the good of the animals.\\" As conditions worsen and support for the revolution dwindles, the power is questioned and the animals wonder what happened to their dream of equality.The allusions pour out of this seemingly elementary story, every action was masterfully planned by Orwell to emulate history. For readers who enjoy history and contextual significance, Animal Farm is perfect. Even readers with no knowledge of the political importance behind this book would still find delight in this whimsical story of animals that kick the humans off their farm and try to set up their own government. It is an extremely simple concept, yet is speaks volumes about revolution gone wrong. George Orwell's progressive eccentricity mixed with his classy criticism makes Animal Farm perfectly poignant. This reader would recommend it to all ages!"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm by George OrwellI first read this book 10 years after I was out of high school. I remember my high school english instructor saying something along these lines, \\"I see no reason to have you read Animal Farm.\\" Of course this was the same instructor pushing Clinton/Gore bumper stickers on us for extra credit (kind of like telling kindergardners you'll give them as many Jolly Ranchers as they want if they vote clinton/gore). I was young, impressionable, and living with two far left parents (they both voted for Mondale for God sake). Years later I was actually listening to Michael Savage while in grid lock traffic. He was talking about our current political climate and discussing it in relation to Animal Farm (I had no frame of referance). I was still a far left little wacko myself and was only listening to Savage so I could argue with him (Portland Oregon has a way of doing that to impressionable youth). This was the moment I started to awake from my fog. I decided to purchase this fine book (got it used right here on Amazon for less than a dollar).If you want specifics about the story this is the wrong review for you. Instead I am going to focus on what this story did to open my eyes. I began to read this book and amazingly my entire political universe changed. Why did my high school teacher decide this book wasn't important. If anything the story is historical in that it describes the reality of the American mind during the cold war. How was this book tossed aside so easily by teachers who were supposed to be teaching me to think for myself? The clouds started to lift from my eyes. I began to realize that I had been blindly following like the rest of the sheeple. That's when I started reading, thinking, not believing statements just because so and so said so.I eventually gave this book away at a garage sale. It was hard for me to part with this tathered old library copy of Animal Farm. The old horse (Boxer was his name right?) who kept trying to work harder for the Marxist Pigs; only to be sold for slaughter once his usefulness to the Pigs had come to an end. It reminds me of the middle class who say to themselves \\"I must work harder\\" in our current society to maintain their current standard of living. Will we as Americans end up at the financial slaughter house because of the free trade practices of semi socialist government? Most don't realize that Marx expressed the need for free trade in letters to Engels in order to bring down the bourgeois.The pigs preached in the beginning that \\"four legs good, two legs bad.\\" Sounds like the nonsense that disseminates like a disease from the Repugnicans and Demoncrats. They both spew their hate and promise change. Yet somehow just like the pigs they both end up walking on two legs in the end. The end of the book states that men were with the pigs (playing cards I believe). They started to fight and their countanences were the same.This book is a must read if your teacher just so happened to leave this off your high school reading list.

I'd read Orwell as a girl, one with ethnic roots reaching back to the Baltic States (Latvia) then occupied by the Soviet Union, and so having grown up on stories of human cruelty and betrayal, of human nature gone corrupt when faced with the seduction of power -- all of that rather than the common, soothing fairy tale. For that reason, I surely understood it on a deeper level than most of my peers. I was fifteen the first of many times I visited the Soviet Union. And even though I had been born in the then freedom of the United States, I understood well enough that what I was witnessing was the essence of evil.George Orwell was a socialist. With leanings towards Trotsky, perhaps an idealism that would be tested by the ugly reality of human nature, he did not stand where I stood in terms of ideology. I leaned more towards a laissez faire capitalism, a system never tested on this planet to this very day, but that did not detract from my enthusiasm for \\"Animal Farm.\\" On this barnyard, we saw eye to eye and snout to snout.\\"Animal Farm\\" is a story as if written for a child, and yet, not. Its language is simple. But the adult aware of history and politics, of the ways of government out of control, fully recognizes the parallels Orwell intended with the Russian Revolution. His animal characters had human counterparts. Marx, Trotsky, Lenin, Stalin, all find their form here among pigs become men, or is it men become pigs. Guard dogs mimic KGB, hard working horses (Boxer) mimic the hardworking proletarians, tragically deluded. A farm of abused and overworked animals, often slaughtered when they have passed their prime as work animals, revolt against the farmer - mankind - surely the epitome of cruel animal. Alas, given such power as to run the farm themselves, the animals quickly shift into social classes delineated by power. Pigs rule, and with their rule comes privilege. To sustain privilege, the pigs change laws to their convenience and pleasure. The basic tenet of \\"All animals are equal\\" becomes \\"All animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others.\\"Orwell wrote about the Russian Revolution. And well he should, because it can be argued that the cruelty of that government has as yet not been fully understood by the \\"free world\\" even today. Yet the power and timelessness of this tale is that it can be applied to all governments when not held firmly within their checks and balances -- and frightening parallels can be witnessed in the current administration of the United States.

Boxer is a hard working loyal animal who has the strongest will on the farm. He works for the dictator Napoleon the pig. Boxer is the one you will always find working like crazy when all of the other animals on the farm slack off. Boxer has two life mottos, the first is Napoleon is always right, the second is I will work harder! Even though he has been loyal and hardworking to Napoleon, he is betrayed in his time of need. I would say that Boxer has heart, and he is my favorite character in this novel, that is why I gave Boxer five stars. Napoleon, the pig and a leader. Napoleon is the leader/ dictator of animal farm. He tricks all of the not as smart animals on the farm to do his dirty work. Napoleon only has one strength, he is smarter than any one on the farm. He starts rebelling the animals of what used to be Manor Farm, he gets them to fight the owner and drive him away. Then he makes some laws for the farm which after there victory of rebelling was called Animal Farm. Some of the laws were don't drink alcohol, don't wear human clothes, and don't sleep in houses on beds, all which were broken by a certain dictator. Napoleon considers himself a war hero, and a regular day hero. He thinks very highly of himself, and all the other pigs, but the other animals he considers not as good as the pigs. I would consider Napoleon to be a pig Hitler. In his hardest workers time of need Napoleon betrays him. I can't stand characters like this, but I guess every story needs a bad guy, this is why I gave Napoleon two stars. Other books I would like to recommend are Johnny Tremain, Bud not Buddy, and any of the Harry Potter books.

These animals are tired of the way that Mr. Jones treats them. One night, a pig, Major, has a dream. In this dream, he sees this particular farm living peacefully, because there are no humans on the farm. So the next day, Major reveals his dream to the other animals and they decide to revolt against Mr. Jones'. However, three days after the dream, Major dies of natural causes. He had three other pigs, Napoleon, Squealer, and Snowball, carry out his plot. The animals are successful in getting rid of the humans, but that is not the end of their problems. Now, they have to make their own harvest, create a set of rules for animals to follow, control those animals who depend on humans, and create a name for the farm. During all of these tasks, many other major events take place. For example, Napoleon wants to be the leader of the farm, but Snowball wants to be a leader to. So the animals decide to have an election take place. To find out what happens later on in the book, you're going to have ot read it.Animal Farm is a great book. It has a very strong plot, and a very interesting theme. I think this a great George Orwell story, and I recommend it to young adults, like myself.P.S.: If you decide to read this book, get the printed version, because if you get the audio book, you will become annoyed by the man speaking."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Have you ever imagined what life would have been like if animals talked and ruled us instead? Well that's just the world that George Orwell creates in Animal Farm. Old Major, an old pig who is about to die, tells the rest of the animals to fight and revolt against the Jones, the owners of the farm, for their forever wanted freedom of life. After they revolt, Napoleon, a pig, becomes the leader of the newly born farm. Napoleon makes all the decisions for the animals like a president or king. Conflicts arise when the animals revolt against each other, and everything starts to go wrong.George Orwell does a great job in Animal Farm to keep his readers reading. This book has many events going on upon the farm in every chapter, not every seldom chapter. This book changes my opinions on animals and how they look at things. Before I would look at them at think of a normal animal, now I look and see actual feelings like humans.I recommend this book to readers who like fiction, and to people who enjoy animals.ColinDes Plaines, Illinois"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This story was incredible when it first came out during the rise of the Soviet Union, and with a certain someone in office, it's even more effective today.

They also liked the urgency with which Orwell wrote; he did not have time for character development and background when he had such an important task--showing how power can corrupt, specifically with Stalin. The class was sad to see the fates of some characters, but they understood the symbolism of these ends."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"I often wonder how I dodged the bullet of reading so many \\"classics\\" when I was in school. If I read this, I don't remember doing so. Either way, reading it now (later in life) really reminds you that the more we think the world changes, the more it doesn't.Animal Farm tells the story of how easily influenced the masses are by charismatic leadership and information control. It's downright eerie how universal this book is. The reader can unplug character names (Snowball, Napoleon, etc.) and plug in any number of names in recent news. Even events - such as the destruction of the windmill and the repercussions - reflect strongly on some of our country's own actions in recent tragedies.When the windmill is destroyed, the leadership of Animal Farm finds a person to blame (who can't be found) and uses this as an excuse to draw the animals into seemingly ridiculous acts that obviously violate the rights of the animals... but they don't mind. It's for the greater good.Sound familiar?If you haven't read Animal Farm in the past decade, do yourself a favor and do so. It's a short book with a long lasting message that is a true today as it was when it was first written."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Very quick read.

It teaches that by drawing on fear and hope, the powerful can make people believe anything they want them to believe. It teaches that Ideals and Ideology are weak contestants in the battle with the tendency for self promotion.Perhaps the greatest lesson of Animal Farm is however that you should not believe everything that you are told."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This was an excellent book. The characters Orwell creates using the animals are as close to real as a writer can get. The idealism was amazing it was pefectly related to the Soviet Republic using the pigs. The author also described the problems between the animals and their conflicting views perfectly.The best part of the book was when Snowball is expelled from the farm and Napolean slowly turns the idea of Animalism bad and becomes the dictator of the farm. This is described very well and perfectly shadows the Soviet government plan.One of the most vivid story elements was the theme, the theme Orwell was trying to create is opposition to the Soviet government using animals. The other story element accomplished well by this book was the conflict between the pigs and the other animals of the farm. Orwell writes this conflict as a continuing problem of the pigs being supreme and the other animals having no rights. These story elements and the rest of the book is excellently written by Orwell."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Like the many truths about human failings expressed in the ancient Greek and Roman fables, numerous subtle meanings and fundamental truths can be superbly revealed with wit and humor in fable-like tales, such as Animal Farm. This book gives an excellent example of the good and bad aspects of human nature within the social-political context and yet it is set within the Animal Farm fairytale with its marvelous life-like characters. Animal Farm is a must-read for all who love and appreciate the art of satirical writing.My only regret is that there are so few such books newly written these days. So, perhaps you can imagine my pleasure at finding one, which I would sincerely like to recommend in addition to Animal Farm. It describes a fantastic, contemporary science-fantasy adventure tale set in the animal world --- that of an imaginary honeybee society --- to expose our own human ecological short-comings. It is entitled, ACCUSED BY FACET-EYES by C.B.DON. I really enjoyed the wit and humor in this candid eco-social satire as much as Animal Farm. &quot;Accused By Facet-Eyes&quot; presents an all important eco-message and warning in much the same way that the outstanding Animal Farm classic gives its social-political message, and so I would place both these books in the same literary category of social-criticism. Do give both books a try, if you enjoy a thought-provoking read!"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm is kind of confusing because of its allegorical-historical nature. It's hard to keep track of the animals and who they really represent, you'd probably have to go back and check who's who (Napoleon = Stalin, Snowball = Trotsky). Also, you have to know a chunk of Russian Communism to get in touch with this. But in essence, this story is brilliant. Orwell is brilliant. He has encapsulated Communism into this dark but hilarious satire. Animal Farm will make you laugh, cry in outrage, and most of all horrify you with Napoleon's blatant hypocrisy (but of course the animals don't notice, ahem). Squealer the pig also topped my list as outrageous. He's like the spokesperson who reports new rules and is the great Napoleon defender (squeal!). The sheep are absolutely funny, who have nothing to bleat but &quot;Four legs good, two legs bad!&quot; until they are trained to follow a new chant: &quot;Four legs good, two legs better!&quot; Makes you think of the masses - they believe anything they are told.Watch out for the wickedly terrific ending. This book is such a riot. It's a hoot. And it was horrifyingly real."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Through a coincidence of history, Animal Farm appeared in stores the same month that the atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The irony of this publication date for one of the most politicized novels of the 20th century did not escape its early readers, or its author. Orwell made no secret of the fact that his writing, and Animal Farm in particular, was single-mindedly focused on the obliteration of totalitarian regimes. Animal Farm, while obviously referring to the general scope of all forms of totalitarian governments, may be seen as a satire of the Russian Revolution of 1917 in particular. Because of this controversial subject matter, British publishing houses were loathe to take on Orwell's work, and he was rejected throughout his entire first round of publishing attempts. Upon the novel's eventual publication in 1945, however, Orwell was instantly famous.Animal Farm is set on an English farm named Manor Farm, owned by Mr. Jones. The fable-like story concerns the rebellion of the farm animals, and is told entirely from their point of view. The story opens with Mr. Jones stumbling into bed, unable to lock up the farm properly after a night of excessive whisky drinking. Old Major, the venerable and well-respected pig, has called all the animals together for a meeting to take place after Mr. Jones has gone to bed, and they gather outside the big barn on the farm. Old Major tells them all that he had a miraculous dream last night, in which he saw his approaching death, and also understood more clearly the life of animals. He wants to impart his realizations to the rest of the animals while he still can, as well as rouse them to take the action that he has come to feel is necessary. Soon after, the animals rebel, and the Animalism regime begins.This book is a definite must-read for everyone and I give it five stars."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"this book is written to criticize Stalin and the soviet empire. it shows how the revolution was honorable and positive, but lead to nothing new but the same treatment, just under new leadership.one thing to remember, George Orwell was a socialist. he believed in socialism. but what he saw in the Soviet Union was an aberration of that. the Soviet Union, under both Lenin and Stalin became a totalitarian state--something that Orwell goes into much deeper in 1984--and not worthy of praise as a true socialist empire."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"This is another interesting book. It has a very insightful look at relationships if you take it away from the main story. This is probably his best work.

At that young age I just could not grasp the brillance of this book.A few years later since I already had the book (an it was such a short book)I decided to read it again. This time I can say that I was captivated.George Orwell was quite a pessimist, but he had a really great way of getting his point across in his stories.This book is such an insightful look at man's true nature. Watching the farm slowly change throughout the book from a complete hell for the animals to an animal utopia and then back to what it used to be by their own hands (or hooves) gives no hope to what the future of our world can be.The last few lines of Animal Farm made such an impact on me. They really say all that needs to be said in so few words."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"The story Animal Farm by George Orwell was a compelling one. No wonder the cliched saying to not judge a book by its cover is used so much. My dad urged me to choose this as my book, and unwillingly, I went with it. The only reason why I chose this book was because I love animals and I love discussing books with my dad. I was amazed when I couldn't seem to put it down.The story opens with telling of a farm. We could compare the dreams of these enslaved animals with those of our own. How we want freedom and to work for ourselves. People everywhere strive to be rich, popular, or independent whereas the animals in the story dream to be free. The dream takes another step when a faithful and well respected pig with the name of Old Major sang a song entitled The Beasts of England and gave an uprising speech of a world where human no longer walked the grass of England. In this world, there was plenty of food and not a whip in sight. Old Major seemed to make this an achievement definitely worth fighting for, so thus they began to make their dream a reality.Throughout the story, I read as the pigs slowly changed the rules to suit their needs. They took advantage of the dumber of the animals and their power over them. The animals didn't complain. In their minds, they were free. They did not notice how Napoleon was slowly enslaving them once more.Orwell tells of how power corrupts everybody. To me, I feel this book tells of how dreams are dreams and they aren't meant to live. They are a promise of a better future or a hope of a new tomorrow. These promises and hopes are not to be kept. In reality, life will come with its struggles no matter how well you eat or work. Benjamin seemed to be the only creature on this farm to realize what I have realized. &quot;Only old Benjamin professed to remember every detail of his long life and to know that things never had been, nor ever could be much better of much worse--hunger, hardship, and disappointment being, so he said, the unalterable law of life.&quot; It gave me chills at the end of the story when I read the last sentence. I think it'd be best to conclude this review with that one sentence. &quot;The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was which.&quot;"},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"Animal Farm, by George Orwell, represents how communism, designed to aid the public, really does the opposite. In addition, the book shows the horrifying consequences of totalitarianism, as well as the pluses of Democracy. For example, in the beginning of the book, Manor Farm is controlled by Mr. Jones, a cruel man who frequently gets drunk and often forgets to feed the animals. Then, suddenly, the animals of Manor Farm rebel. They kick Mr. Jones out of his own farm and take over. The farm is now dubed \\"Animal Farm.\\" Immediately, the animals realize that they need a ruler. It seems that Snowball, a very smart pig, is suited for the job. Animal Farm is running smoothly, with snowball as the farms ruler, until Napoleon, another very smart pig, has his say. He had been training nine large and scary dogs since their birth, training them in his own ways. In a meeting with all of the animals, while Snowball is speaking, the nine dogs burst into the meeting and chase Snowball out of the barn. Napoleon then becomes ruler. No one dared to disobey him, for they do not want to feel the wrath of the nine, terrifying dogs. As ruler of Animal Farm, Napoleon steadily uses his power more and more. In the end, Napoleon is punishing animals with death and acting like humans. He uses his power to the fullest in the worst way possible. Additionally, in the last few pages of the book, the pigs are having a meeting with the humans. They praise each other and are having an enjoyable meal until a fight breaks out. That is when the animals realize that they are being used just as much as they were with Mr. Jones. They have no say or rights; all they can do is work or die. They are living with communism.The strengths of this book are that it is realistic, not in the sense of the characters but that it shows what communism is. Also, in this book you can relate to the characters even though they are animals. The weakness of this book is that it is a short read."},{"Title":"Animal Farm (Signet Classics, CT304)","review":"i would suggest this book to any young person who wishes to learn more of the evils of both capatialism and communism.

Salinger's classic &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; and the coming-of-age novels of S.E. Hinton -- with the added distinction that this book was actually written by a teenager (or, at least, a young man who was in his teens when he began writing it). It takes place in Madison, WI, Daniel Grey Marshall's home town. I am a resident of Madison myself, and a senior citizen, to boot, and I picked up the book simply because it was written by a fellow-Madisonian. I hoped that it would help me better understand the younger generation -- especially the kinds of kids I'd seen hanging out on State Street and in Peace Park. I got much more than I'd bargained for, because this book took me behind the scenes into a world that I'd hitherto only experienced from the outside. As I lived alongside (and inside) Jim, I felt exhilirating joy and excruciating pain -- and ultimately, towards the end of the book, was reduced to tears during a scene with a young policewoman which occurs in Jim's hospital room. And the tears continued to roll down my cheeks right to the book's conclusion. Intellectuals may complain that &quot;Still Can't See Nothin' Comin'&quot; is juvenile in its tone and overloaded with melodramatic incidents, but so what?

It's amazing how Jim &amp; his friends change in ONE year. I have never laid awake at night, sobbing for one character before. But I guess I wasn't really sobbing just for Jim. I was sobbing for Philly, and Jeremy, and Mandy, and Leslie, and and all the other kids just like them out in the world, and the hellish life they are forced to live. And hell is what Jim goes through.The book is funny though, too. It is also heartwarming. I'm not lying - there are parts when I definitely went &quot;aww&quot; and smiled a bit.

The story was enticing and interesting, creating both an \\"inner\\" and an \\"outer\\" landscape into which the reader is enveloped as the story progresses. In this way, it reminded me of a kind of mixture of a 21st century Blade Runner (an outer landscape with interesting appeals to all the senses) and the Matrix (an inner landscape involving cyber realities and machinations leading to moments of surprise and revelation).It really was an enjoyable novel, the kind that takes you away for the time you are amongst the pages; and the kind which you find yourself re-visiting as daydreams in the time before re-opening the pages. I would recommend to anyone, not just sci-fi fans. I'm looking forward to his next work."},{"Title":"Cybernetica","review":"At the peak of the technological revolution there was a war between governments and large corporations over computer access codes, privatized data, and net security. Breaking down firewalls and stealing from competitors became routine. Corporations and governments world-wide stole from one another, hijacked enemy mainframes, spread viruses, and sabotaged networks. \\"Netrunners\\" were hired continuously to either create better cyber defenses or break into newly created cyber defenses. History calls it The Encryption War. Since that time the world has lived through three encryption wars. A fragile treaty is the only thing that stands between peace and a fourth war.Needless-to-say, the public evolved during it all. Most people in the world now have chips in their heads. It began as a mental performance inhibitor (or at least that is how the government sold it to the public). It is now called Sublimation. A DNI transmitter can subliminally activate the functions of brain operation controlling abstract thought, sending commands into the unconscious mind without the host ever knowing it. The world does not realize that the classic fictional story \\"1984\\" by author George Orwell has finally come true.Galaxy Pictures holds their latest movie premier, starring Annalise DeSoto, at the Omega Theater. The audience plugs their chips into the stems and actually feel as though they are inside the movie. This will later be noted as the first successful cyber attack in history. There is only one survivor, Annalise. The Onyx/Enigma Group owns Galaxy Pictures. They hire a solo named Nisha to protect Annalise. (To put it simply, a solo is an altered person, super human.) But Annalise and Nisha are soon marked for death by their own corporations.A group of insurgents called \\"drifters\\" (immune to sublimation) are launching their long-planned for revolution to destroy their version of Big Brother. The question now is not whether Annalise or Nisha will survive, but will the world.**** Fans of the Matrix Trilogy films will adore this novel. There is much more going on within the book than I explain in the synopsis above, as well as other major characters. But to even touch upon them would triple the size of this review. The story begins with the cyber attack at the movie premier. But afterward the story slows down a lot. This is necessary to help the reader understand how society functions in this futuristic time line. Once the reader comprehends it all, the pace picks back up. From there on, it is non-stop action. In fact, should this novel ever be made into a film, it would probably rival \\"The Matrix\\". Excellent hard core science fiction! ****Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews."},{"Title":"Cybernetica","review":"Thirty-five years have passed since the destruction caused by the Encryption Wars devastated much of society.

These are lumped together as criminals and hunted down by the leaders of the corporatism that rule the city. That in turn has led to some banding together of the fringe element. One particular group, the Drifters, plans to tear down sublimation and return civilization to its roots of freedom, but this revolt will be fought mostly in cyberspace, which is owned and controlled by the Cybernetica corporatism. However, no one is prepared for the spark, an assassination attempt of an actress or the results of the hiring from shadows of two con artists to investigate the murder.CYBERNETICA is an intriguing science fiction cautionary thriller that brings 1984 into the cyber age by depicting a society in which computers do the thinking for people. The story line moves forward on several fronts including the who-done-it, but deftly comes together with a battle to determine the future of mankind; one side wants programmed cattle while the other prefers free will. Orwellian fans and anyone who appreciate a well written exhilarating warning tale about the government-industrial-media complex telling us when to go to the bathroom will want to read this dark futuristic thriller.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Cybernetica","review":"\\"Cybernetica\\" is a fast paced science fiction novel. The author Michael J. Cavallaro incorporated all of the elements of a good story into one action packed adventure. He incorporates science fiction, suspense, technology, espionage, and of course his character development is excellent. I was able to jump right into the story. His descriptions of the places and events happening are very well written. I could \\"see\\"what he was writing.The story takes place in the future when the government has managed to sneak its way into our minds through a technological process referred to as \\"Sublimation.\\" People who are unable to be affected by this technology are said to have \\"Blindsight.\\" They live on the fringe because the government cannot touch their minds.I loved how the science fiction technology gets incorporated into the thriller/espionage aspects of the story taking the plot to a higher level. The characters have extra abilities. The corporate andgovernment corruption are also all taken to a higher level because of the additional capabilities brought about by the technology that is included in the story. I highly recommend this novel to science fiction fansand to espionage fans who are looking for something \\"a little more\\" in their stories.Five out of Five spaceshipsReviewer: Paige Lovitt for Multiverse Reviews"},{"Title":"Cybernetica","review":"Cybernetica by writer and editor Michael J. Cavallaro, is an original science fiction novel depicting the possibilities, if not probabilities, of a futuristic concept of technological mind control. Providing the read with an intricate and enthralling plot, Cybernetica tells of the intertwining stories of the assassination of a famous actresses, a couple of con-artist paired together for an important investigation, an \\"in-book\\" of modern technology which enables neurotransmissons to communicate with computer interfaces, and the ethical issues of a biologically enhanced bodyguard. Engaging its readers from the very beginning with an ever-intriguing plot, Cybernetica is very highly recommended to all readers with an interest in science-fiction for a remarkably gripping, vivid, and intimate depiction of future people's lives and conspiracies."},{"Title":"Cybernetica","review":"This is some hard core science fiction! The details were extremely technical, but obviously well understood by the author because he did a very good job of making it easy and fun to read. I loved the idea of this world that has evolved in the story and was unable to set it aside until I found out how it all ended. Very well done, and for all science fiction fans, a must read!"},{"Title":"Cybernetica","review":"Michael J. Cavallaro's Cybernetica is a particularly impressive debut novel, a multi-layered work of science fiction that both challenges and entertains the reader. It's a rich and detailed story that draws upon a variety of socioeconomic and political themes, features particularly complex characters (several of whose true natures remain a mystery throughout the bulk of the story), and takes place in a near-future world in which technology threatens to trump individuality permanently. In Cybernetica, the populace is largely controlled via the technological wonder of sublimation, a computer-to-brain connection that controls the thoughts and actions of those plugged into the system. All is not peaceful in this brave new world, however. Over the years, three Encryption Wars have been fought, and a significant number of freedom fighters still work and plan in an area called the Free Side, continually seeking a way to stop the process of sublimation and restore free will to those being controlled by the government. In the middle of things are those with blindsight, men and women immune to the effects of sublimation. In this novel, many things are afoot on a number of levels, all of it leading up to an impending showdown between the free will forces, the government, and the corporation responsible for the sublimation process.Jake Radigan is a blindsight who lives by his wits until he and his partner are hired to find a certain person on behalf of the National Crime Center. They have no idea what they are getting themselves into by accepting the job, but it doesn't take all that long for them to begin questioning their actions and putting their trust only in themselves. In time, they find themselves working alongside Annalise DeSoto, a famous vid star suddenly targeted for assassination, and her chip-enhanced Zero bodyguard. Jake and Annalise are linked, both having witnessed and survived a brash cyber attack aimed at the company behind sublimation. As the deadly fighting in the encroaching Brawl Zone draws ever closer to the heart of Intercity itself, their journey becomes a struggle to survive and, when the time comes, to fight. The story takes a number of twists and turns, largely because the motives of the three principals in the struggle (the government, the chip corporation, and the drifters on the Free Side) are sometimes quite difficult to judge. The subconscious effects of sublimation make it hard to trust many a character, and all sides in the fight seem to have justifiable reasons for what they are doing.Like all good science fiction, Cybernetica explores complicated themes drawn from modern-day technologies and future possibilities. The growing connection and interdependence between man and machines conjure up notions of a technological line somewhere in our near future that should not be crossed. In Cybernetica, that line has been unquestionably crossed, creating a society in which technology supersedes the individual. The system certainly has its benefits - a controlled population free of the strife and problems caused by free will - but its problems are even more obvious. He who controls the technology controls the minds of the citizenry. Blindsights have little place in this society, having to live by their wits while enduring a measure of discrimination by those who are plugged in. Then there are the drifters who are working to put an end to sublimation and thus give the gift of free will back to their fellow man - but how far should they go in their anti-technology zeal, and how quickly? How would they keep someone else from exploiting the anti-technology changes they would make? Who should have the power in society? The people? The government? The corporations who built the technology? Michael J. Cavallaro poses these and a number of other probing questions in Cybernetica, even as he fills the pages with increasing suspense and action. In other words, this is cutting-edge science fiction written in the best tradition of the genre."},{"Title":"Cybernetica","review":"In a futuristic world, where man's emotions are controlled by a system called 'sublimination', in order to keep them in check, we meet Jake Radigan. On one of his usual cons for survival along with his sidekick, Billy, they discover the perfect victim, Ian Van Curen. Soon enough Jake discovers there's more to Van Curen, a side to him that will have Jake plunged right into the chaotic struggles of domination. Enter into this scenario Annalise DeSoto, a famous and well-liked actress, along with her 'solo' bodyguard, Nisha, and the complex plot thickens.Cavallaro's dark science fiction suspense thriller takes you for a ride into a futuristic world of power, a world where governments and big conglomerates vie for power, where humans are toys to be manipulated. Perhaps a future not too far off in reality. We now have our rebels who struggle and fight for what they believe in, as we see in Jake Radigan. But the most chilling aspect of Mr. Cavallaro's book is the connection between man and computer. The idealistic thought of a human race controlled by a chip heightens the realistic aspect to his theme. With the speed our computer technology is now racing at, who is to say whether or not this will be one of our futures to look forward to.Although not a sci-fi reader, more into watching sci-fi movies, Michael's Cybernetica was easily visualized as I read it, almost in frame by frame movie clips. His descriptive details were thorough, offering as much information to place the answers to the five W's further into the book. The comparison to Matrix and Total Recall in the opener was to expound the similarities: a human race fooled into believing they are in control, a chip utilized for the 'better' of the world. Cybernetica is the perfect book to be made into a movie.A very good read but with a warning: you need to be an avid sci-fi reader in order to appreciate the technological descriptions without getting lost.Lea Schizas - AllBooks Reviewer"},{"Title":"Cybernetica","review":"We are living in rapidly changing world, in which the boundaries of nations, peoples, and even basic ethical rules seem to be in flux. Not on this, the pace of change also seems to be quickening. Into this world, many science fiction writers have ventured, some with dire predictions of doom, some with utopian visions of hope.Michael Cavallaro has elements of all of these in his book, 'Cybernetica'. Set in a future that has seen a major war of a different sort (the Encryption Wars, in which information and information technology was both a cause and a weapon), most people in Cavallaro's story are linked to a major network in brain-to-computer fashion, something that can combine elements of Big-Brother-esque monitoring and mind control. Beyond this, there are independent persons who refuse to be part of the grand networking, striving to maintain independence and privacy, striking out against the megalithic force of Cybernetica.Cavallaro rolls different characters together in intriguing ways - there are criminals and more saintly persons, and the lines between the two are not always distinct. Cavallaro creates a deliberate blur between the two poles because life itself exists more in the gray zones than the black or white sections.Some may see Cybernetica as a cipher for American corporate culture, but it is more than this. It does not fit precisely as an attack on Republicans or Democrats, conservatives or liberals, for the temptations to power and control for their own purposes reside within each group in uneasily similar ways. The lop-sided economic growth in the world coupled with a disparate level of technological advance sets the preliminary stage for all manner of possible future scenarios - Cavallaro presents one such here.Those who are science fiction fans should find this a great read. Those who like to explore the future, or find stories that pick up upon and critique current society will also find elements of interest here."},{"Title":"Cybernetica","review":"In the realm of sci-fi reading, I really like near-future/cyber style novels. I was contacted by Michael J. Cavallaro, the author of Cybernetica, asking if I would be interested in reviewing his work. Of course I accepted, and it's a pretty good read with a couple of minor cautions.The basic storyline revolves around an escalating war between a group called \\"drifters\\" and the government/corporate areas that control the population via \\"sublimation\\". Sublimation involves chip implants that modify behavior and actions via an enormous computer networks. Drifters are unchipped individuals that aren't affected by sublimation, and they want to overthrow the control of society. Control of the network is key to the war effort, and both sides need to maintain/gain that control. It's very easy to see plot and stylistic elements from both The Matrix and Total Recall in the book.On the positive side, Cavallaro does an excellent job painting a scene. Becoming immersed within the story happens with little effort. There were only a couple things that I would offer to prospective readers. The first item is that the editing of the book is pretty bad. I'm used to seeing one or two misspellings or incorrect word usages in a book of this size. Cybernetica seems to have these errors much more frequently. I'm not sure if this is a self-published effort, but it certainly seems as if that was the case. (Edited 03/12: The author contacted me and said the first print run was rushed. These errors have been corrected in the second printing. Thanks, Michael!) The other suggestion I'd make is to try and read the book without interruptions. I had a number of books going on while reading this one, and I was having problems following the story line at times. If I had read this through in two or three days, I'd have had less problems tracking the story.But even with those caveats, it's an interesting read for fans of cyber sci-fi..."},{"Title":"Cybernetica","review":"Cybernetica is an awakening for the general malaise of a nation subdued."},{"Title":"Cybernetica","review":"Reviewed by Leslie Granier for Reader Views (1/07)\\"Cybernetica\\" is a futuristic novel that depicts a city unlike anything that exists today. It begins with two men, Jake Radigan and Billy Hawkins, attempting to steal a man's vehicle by deceiving him. However, it turns out this man knew their intentions and had a huge surprise in store for them. He knew of Jake's past experience as a stringer and coerced him into helping him with an assignment. Jake and Billy have a condition known as blindsight and are therefore basically considered outcasts in their society. In this society, everyone is monitored through sublimation, which is a computer network that tracks their thoughts and their movements. There is imminent war and one faction known as the drifters is suspected of having interfered with the network that controls sublimation.Those in power are obviously not pleased since their ability to monitor their citizens is no longer as effective. So Jake and Billy agree to find out what is going on and to try to end it. Along the way, they face many exciting and dangerous adventures in their quest to learn the truth. There are also many surprises about who is really behind what is happening in \\"Cybernetica.\\" This book really got me thinking about both the wonders and the dangers of technology. In this instance, people lost all of their freedoms when the technologies available were used for the wrong reasons. Just because technology is at our disposal doesn't mean it is right to use it. It is also important to never let one group or individual get too much power or there may be no turning back without a major incident occurring.One suggestion for the author is to have this book proofread again. There were far too many misspelled words as well as extra words that should not have been there at all. I did find this to be somewhat distracting.\\"Cybernetica\\" is a book that gives readers a clear warning about maintaining a balance of power. In many ways society is better off with less technology. It is pretty scary to think that in the future our thoughts and actions will be able to be controlled and that by the time we realize it, it may be too late.Received book free of charge."},{"Title":"The Married Guy's Guide to Great Sex","review":"I found this book to be exceedingly useful but it very much depends how you use it.

It dispelled the common myth that the clitoris is the key to female arousal (something I had asked him to quit because I felt he was just trying to flip a switch) and moved him to better things which lead to me feeling truly treasured and vaginal orgasm (a much superior experience).

Born in 1898, he had a long career in academia including the Sir Ernest Cassel Professor of Commerce at the University of London, a position he held from 1930 to 1965.This collection of essays was edited By Arthur Seldon, who was Plant's Research Assistant at the LSE after completing his postfraduate studies and who later found fame at the Institute of Economic Affairs as Editorial Director.Plant's publications were relatively few in number and confined mainly to academic journals, yet he gained a considerable reputation as a teacher and lecturer.In this volume, Plant applies his considerable intellect to issues which were considered unfashionable at the time such as immigration and property ownership from a classical liberal perspective. Also contained within it are six articles on economic processes including a review of a book of articles in honour of Friedrich von Hayek, the Nobel Economics winner.Arnold Plant's career spanned the end of Classical economics and the beginning of neo-classical. His life spanned the end of the liberal British economy and it's replacement by growing state control and the further re-emergence of the free market as a dominant force in the UK economy.These essays command attention from students of economic policy both in Britain and elsewhere. Particularly germane are his articles on immigration in light of the controversy in Europe concerning decling populations.I would commend this book to anyone who is concerned with the wider application of market processes or the history of economic thought."},{"Title":"French Frolics (Anonymous)","review":"The modern parisian couple Alain and Chantal certainly do keep themselves busy diddling anything and everything that comes (forgive the pun) into their house...As a married couple sleep in seperate bedrooms connected by a shared bathroom making the furtive sex quick and tittilating ....Except for Alains introduction to the maid of her extended household duties the rest of the book is mundane ...Its a one read and then collect dust type of book very monodimensional ..."},{"Title":"The Plant Sitter","review":"Gene Zion's plant sitter still retains the excitment it held many years ago.

Its fascinating to finally see how Cleopatra presented herself to her subjects -- in traditional Egyptian style for the local population, in Greek style to the Greco-Roman world at large. It's also sobering to see how little remains of her reign. The Romans went after her Greek-style statues, but since they didn't understand Egyptian art, many works of art in that style survive. Besides the impressive visuals, the book includes important essays on many different parts of Cleopatra's reign, life in Alexandria, and the legends that have swirled around Cleopatra after her death. A good comprehensive look at this famous queen, scholarly and readable. But boy, those visuals...!"},{"Title":"Cleopatra of Egypt: From History to Myth.","review":"This book, I would say, is the best book I have read, (and that's a lot) on the Ptolemaic Period and Egypt's last and fateful Macedonian Queen, who died for her ambition, and desire to restore her country as major power. She was brave enough to challenge the enslaving and powerful force of Rome, and dreamed of an independant Egyptian Empire. But her attempt to achieve her goal cost her her life, and her country.After her death, the Romans destroyed most representations of her. They overlooked, however, the many exquisite Egyptian-style statues of the queen, however, and instead destroyed what would have been the many classical depictions of her, which are lost to the Romans wrath. But fortunately, the Egyptian art survived the centuries, and with these gorgeous and mysterious representations of the living goddess herself, Susan Walker, with the help of the British Museum, has pieced together an accurate and enthralling portrait of her eventful life.The sections, on subjects such as Alexandria, The Ptolemies, and Cleopatra and Rome, this book contains dozens of well-written and powerful essays on the monarch's life and relationship, and also Egypt at the time. Lavishly illustrated with hundreds of full color images of Egyptian style artwork depicting the queen, and also many statues of the people that influenced her life such as her lovers Julius Caesar and Mark Antony, and her nemesis, the enigma Octavian, later to be Augustus, the first emperor of Rome.I recommend very strongly this book to anyone at all interested in Egyptian, Greek, or Roman history, and art.

As the story unfolds, author Seymour Shubin deftly unveils the gradual changes that affect the narrator's personality as events and his own actions conspire against him. The dire consequences arising out of individual judgment, or lack thereof, move Paul Weiler inexorably toward a totally unexpected (in his view) and ultimate fate. First time around, ANYONE'S MY NAME made the New York Times best seller list. One good reason likely springs from the fact that Shubin has written a novel without a single chink in its tightly controlled first point of view. Contemporary writers would do well to study and learn from Shubin's technique. The story's power, however, is contained within the word, &quot;anyone&quot; in the title. Although it is natural to ask ourselves, &quot;How could Paul Weiler be so stupid?&quot; the novelist's skill shows that our smug small lives are far more fragile than we think. ANYONE'S MY NAME illuminates the truth in the saying, &quot;There but for the grace of God go I,&quot; as we come to realize that what happened to Paul Weiler really could happen to anyone.&quot;"},{"Title":"Anyone's my name,: A novel","review":"In the early 1950s, Paul Simons writes true detective stories even as he yearns to become a great writer of higher quality work. He is tired of writing at a twelve year old's readability level. His spouse Ginny also desires for Paul to scribe better stuff than the trash he always seems to be writing. She loathes his detective stories, not understanding that they pay the bills.As Paul digs deeper into the weird world of the killers he writes about, he himself begins to emulate the behavior of his subjects. Soon Paul becomes the target of a police man hunt. However, his descent does not become complete until a writer of true detective stories wants to tell Paul's story to the world.Originally published in 1953, ANYONE'S MY NAME was written over a decade before the Supreme Court's Miranda ruling. However, unlike many of the books and movies of that era, this novel not only holds up well in the nineties, it feels as if it has been written from today's headlines. Readers have the rare opportunity to see what makes a killer tick before, during, and after the fatal event. This novel is not just a good detective story, it is a great criminology tale that uses the psychology and philosophy of murder as its basis. If you have not had a taste of Seymour Shubin, one of the all time greats, try this novel. Subsequently, the reader will clamor for more of his literature.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Anyone's my name,: A novel","review":"This is a beautifully written novel exploring the issue of what could make an ordinary man become a murderer. Although it was written in the fifties it could have been written yesterday. I enjoyed this book tremendously and look forward to reading the rest of Seymour Shubin's books."},{"Title":"Anyone's my name,: A novel","review":"The central idea of this novel is interesting enough: an ordinary man, very much on the side of the &quot;decent people,&quot; unable to understand how it is to be on the other side, the side of criminals and outcasts, until he finds himself precisely there, rejected by a society that will not listen and that prefers to view his tragedy in simplistic terms: in this case, that he is a blood-thirsty, lust-driven monster, rather than accepting that he is just a weak man whose only sin was lack of courage, just like so many other men. However, the tone in general is too didactic and in most of the book lacking in sincerity. The author is trying too hard to demonstrate something, and it shows. Only the final part is (and only occasionally) candid and moving, but, alas, too brief. The author takes his time describing the circumstances that lead Paul to his crime, his feelings of remorse and his attempts to escape afterwards, but the end, the epiphany of how it is like to be one of the characters he described too shoddily in his true-crime articles, is too quickly resolved, as if it was too intense for the author to handle. This does not mean that the book is not worth reading; it is fast-paced and quite absorbing, but I just couldn't help comparing it with other, better and less self-conscious books about the world seen through the eyes of a criminal."},{"Title":"Na Ki\`i Pohaku: A Hawaiian Petroglyph Primer","review":"Na Ki\`i Pohaku is the result of detailed research of the history and significance of Hawaiian petroglyphs dating from the time of the first arrival of the Polynesian people in Hawai\`i.

It helps to keep on track with the foods that you are eating and where you are at with your carbs for the day.

Two minor problems that, if fixed would make it even better: there isn't a lot of space so you have to write very small; it doesn't have a column for tracking calories (frankly, low carbohydrates make you lose weight a LOT faster and better hunger control, but losing weight ultimately means you must intake fewer calories than you burnoff every day -- so calorie counting is just as critical as counting carbs)."},{"Title":"Sarton Selected: An Anthology of the Journals, Novels, and Poetry of May Sarton","review":"Book arrived in a few days,sooner then expected. Book in great condition and packaged well. This book has turned out to be a very good read. Recommend this book and the seller. Very pleased with both."},{"Title":"Country Boys: Masculinity And Rural Life (Rural Studies Series)","review":"There's no such thing as too much men's studies: this privileged group needs to see itself and not think of itself as universal or de-sexed. Also, men's studies fulfills the most when it covers the intersectionality of masculinity and other areas. Books have been produced about older men, black men, bisexual men, rich men, poor men, and finally this book publishes work on rural men. Like much men's studies, the contributors are both male and female.Though this book includes photographs of men of color and non-Christian men, not one article spoke of rural men of color. There are articles that speak of racist, and religiously intolerant rural men, but that did not suffice in terms of diversity. Because many men of color and immigrant men work on farms, this is a sore absence.I applaud the editors for including articles about the UK, New Zealand, Sweden, and the US. However, this book only mentions rural men in industrialized countries. What about the countless rural men in developing nations? The status of the US is intriguing here. Only a few chapters cover this nation and they are placed somewhere in the middle of the book. Did the contributors need to cover Americans in order to get published or did they want to prove that the US is just one country of many that has rural men?R. Connell is the godfather of men's studies. Having him contribute a chapter somewhat blesses the text. Cornel West once did that in the book about Black men in academia. Now that I think of it, Patti LaBelle blessed the young songstresses who remade \\"Lady Marmalade.\\" Still, I didn't think Connell's entry was strong. It just proved that he can write on history, rather than just sociology.I wasn't wowed by this book, but I truly appreciate its addition to the genre."},{"Title":"I was a high school drop-in","review":"How does a college professor teaching Education at a small suburban college discover what it is like in school now? He enrolls in a local High School and spends time as a student. In order to better understand the student and to help teach his college students, the author enrolled in a local high school in Aurora, Illinois and spent six weeks as a student. He \\"Dropped-in\\" so to speak, hence the title.Written in a basic journal style, he nevertheless spends a great deal of time describing his classmates and teachers as well as telling stories of notable experiences. I was a Senior at West Aurora High School when Cliff attended and I believe he accurately captured the High School experience of the time as well as the common experiences and emotions felt by high school students of all generations. Using both humor and compassion, it is a good look at high school through adult eyes. Overall a good read and recommended to Education majors everywhere."},{"Title":"I was a high school drop-in","review":"I met Cliff Schimmels,when he spoke at a Christian Education Associate International meeting, in 1986. This book had just been published. He was a great inspiration to a second year public school teacher.

This is the best book on education that I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Gospel of Thomas and Christian Wisdom","review":"Now in an updated and expanded second edition, The Gospel of Thomas and Christian Wisdom by Stevan Davies (Professor of Religious Studies, College Misericordia, Pennsylvania) focuses upon the writings known as the Gospel of Thomas which were discovered in Egypt in 1945 as part of the now famous Nag Hammadi Library, a collection of first century Christian documents that are some of the earliest written records we have available arising from the earliest days of the Christian movement. This Bardic Press edition returns to print a classic work of painstaking yet accessible scholarship and features a new forty page introduction discussing recent developments in scholarship, the distinctions of the Gospel of Thomas from the canonical gospels, the role of Mary Magdalene in the Gospel of Thomas, and additional, invaluable insights into one of the most exciting finds of the 20th Century in Biblical Studies. Not to be missed is a fascinating and provocative essay on the possible use of the Gospel of Thomas an oracle text for those early Coptic Christians thought to be responsible for the Nag Hammadi Library collection. Highly recommended reading for both scholarship and the non-specialist general reader with an interest in Christian Theology and History, The Gospel of Thomas and Christian Wisdom is an enduring work of substantial value and interest. Also very highly recommended reading are Professor Davies other works: The Gospel of Thomas Annotated & Explained; Jesus the Healer, New Testament Fundamentals, and Revolt of the Widows. Additionally recommended is Professor Davies' The Gospel of Thomas website which is a world class Internet website dedicated specifically to this subject."},{"Title":"The Gospel of Thomas and Christian Wisdom","review":"Davies's book is quite good representation of scholars's view on gospel of Thomas. He arguments, that the GoTh's groundwork is wisdom tradition. The book thus represents one of various views abot GoTh's underlying traditions. On the other hand, one must take in consideration that The Gospel of Thomas and Christian Wisdom consentrates on just one part of the gospel. Also, one gets a feeling, that the author is overburdened with repudiation of gnostic label for GoTh (as gnosticism should be something negative). This effort seems to be the main starting point for the interpretation.. so the discussion sometimes gets quite one-sided. Nevertheless I must commend the inclusion of the paper \\"Does GoTh have a meaning\\" in this second edition of the book. Here author also acknowledges the fact that his view is just one among the many that seem equally legitimate and so puts the whole book The Gospel of Thomas and Christian Wisdom into a more objective perspective."},{"Title":"The Golden Road","review":"This book has the same charm and story telling as Anne of Green Gables. It concentrates on a family on P.E. Island and the various adventures of the young band of cousins growing up together. If you recall the old Disney Channel show \\"Avonlea\\", this book is where most of the main characters originated, with some name changes."},{"Title":"The Golden Road","review":"I have read this book many times since I was 13, and I'm 19 now. I think the ending is very sad, the realisation that we all have to grow up, and the hints we are given about the future of the characters we have grown to love. I was near tears reading about cecily, and the ending seemed so final. We can never return to our childhood, but we can remember the good times in reading this book. Whereas the Story Girl, although a fascinating book, is, in reality, little more than a stringing together of many stories, in this book the characters are properly developed."},{"Title":"The Golden Road","review":"The Golden Road and its prequel, The Story Girl, are two of the best books I have ever read. I never seem to get tired of them, either...I have read them countless times! If you enjoy L. M. Montgomery's novels, such as the Anne of Green Gables series, these books are a must. The Golden Road tells the story of cousins, Beverley (who narrates the story), Felix, Cecily, Felicity, Dan, and Sara Stanley, also known as the Story Girl, plus their friends Peter, the hired boy, and Sara Ray. The adventures these eight have are sometimes exiting, sometimes sad...but mostly really funny! For instance, one time, they have the governors wife to tea...but they think she's their deaf Aunt Eliza and comment on the governors big nose and such things!

It will make you laugh, and even shed a tear or too. It will bring back memories of childhood, or of the childhood we wished we'd had. Of all of Montgomery's novels, this is the one I return to most often. A true little gem, for all ages. The sotry of great aunt Eliza's visit is one of the funniest chapters I have ever read. Delightful!"},{"Title":"The Golden Road","review":"Despite the long-ago nature of the story, children like Beverley, Felix, The Story Girl, Felicity, Dan, Cecily, Peter and Sara Ray live today. Montgomery treats children - and their points of view - with respect. She shows their virtues, faults, triumphs and follies in an honest light - sometimes poignant, sometimes funny. She also captures that magical betwixt-and-between time that the Story Girl and Beverley are approaching, as they begin to move away from childhood. The ending is sweet and sad at the same time."},{"Title":"The Golden Road","review":"I enjoyed The Golden Road, but not as much as I enjoyed The Story Girl. I recommend you read the two novels together, one right after the other. If you enjoy reading books set in a long-ago era, the books have a charm to them. If you like action, these books will not appeal to you as much.In my opinion, it is not possible to enjoy The Golden Road unless you have just recently read The Story Girl. Not all of the characters and actions in TGR will be understoon unless you have read TSG. The characters are a lot of fun and are well-written. The adventures this group of friends have together will stay in your memory forever."},{"Title":"The Golden Road","review":"I loved this book. I read the Story Girl years ago, but the 'Road to Avonlea' books ruined the concept for me, and I forgot that there was an original sequel. And then, my sister borrowed it from the library; I was bored, and so picked it up. I read the entire book that afternoon - forget about the fact that exams were six weeks off, that I should be vaccuuming - I couldn't put it down. I admit, I had cherished hopes of the Story Girl and Bev, but they were dashed. Felicity and Peter, I am sure, were happy for the rest of their lives....and I was crying so hard when I read about Cecily.

The story ends on a bittersweet note as the children are growing up, but is nonetheless worth reading."},{"Title":"The Golden Road","review":"\\"The Golden Road\\" is the sweet-souled sequel to Lucy Maud Montgomery's excellent \\"The Story Girl.\\" The novels must be read in order; \\"The Golden Road\\" picks up without preamble where its predecessor left off.The King brothers Bev and Felix; their King cousins Felicity, Dan, and Cecily; \\"Story Girl\\" Sara Stanley; and neighbors Sara Ray and Peter Craig face winter in the small town of Carlisle, on Canada's Prince Edward Island. To pass the time, the children decide to publish their own magazine, with stories, advice, and personal ads. The magazine will be only the beginning of their adventures, as the children wrestle with New Year's resolutions, host the strange visit of an aunt who isn't an aunt, survive a snowstorm, spend a night in a witch's house, attend a wedding and a funeral, and prepare for the departure of some of their own.\\"The Golden Road\\" is less about telling stories, although the Story Girl has a beauty in finally solving the mystery of the Awkward Man. This novel centers on the interactions of the children as they arrive at the awkward edges of adolescence. Much of the story, including a bittersweet ending, is told in retrospect by one of them.

This is the &quot;THE&quot; book that give such an excellent details about Java classloaders besides Bill Venners's &quot;Inside Java 2 VM&quot; book. I should know from writing a paper on classloaders and find that most books deal very &quot;cursory&quot; with the subject matter. I suspect that most authors probably have little knowledge or experience about classloaders. Since Classloaders is so fundamental to locating and loading bytecode by the JVM at runtime and it's important for key technologies like RMI, hot EJB delpoyment, security of mobile network code and most importantly server side programming, this book is indispensable. The other thing I find useful with this book is object serialization and bytecode generation which is important for dynamic proxies.Any Advanced Java developers must be conversant with classloaders,class search rules,serialization, bytecodes, JNI and more.This is the book to get to go beyond rudimentary Java development and deployment."},{"Title":"Component Development for the Java Platform","review":"I bought this book for my department (well, my company bought it - I ordered it ;) ) to help us with the deployment problems we'd been having. These were normal issues, of making sure all files are in the right place, that environment variables were set correctly, etc. We always solved them, but it usually took a whole day to install something and make sure it was all working correctly. Enter Mr. Halloway's book.While most Java books tell you how to write \\"this\\" or make an algorithm to do \\"that\\", Mr. Halloway's book tells you how to take almost no extra time and make those programs garaunteed to work in any installation environment. It's more than just changing your mindset, the book gives you very clear examples of how to make your application easily deployed and dynamic. For example, in chapter 2 you learn how to easily create an application that can continue running and update its classes to your new version.The best section in the book, I think, is the section on ClassLoaders - which I garauntee will be your best friend after reading this book. Before reading the book, I almost never dealt with the ClassLoader. Now I use it all the time to:1. Create dynamically updated classes2. Manage security features not built in3. Allow for easy deployment without needing knowledgeof the file system structurePerhaps most valuable of all is Mr. Halloway himself. ..., he has been more than willing to help me understand any parts of his book that were confusing to me. To me, that was the most valuable return on my purchase.Other resources to check out after reading this book:1. AVALON FRAMEWORKThis is from Apache.org and it's a good framework foreasy configuration which continues in the same vein as thisbook. http://jakarta.apache.org/avalon/2. Stuart Halloway's Ideas for a Configuration API...Definitely worth checking out, it will give you some greatideas."},{"Title":"Component Development for the Java Platform","review":"This book is invaluable to EJB container developers, and to Java architects who pay attention to various issues of software deployment. For example, what are the alternatives of object serialization when a class was not designed with serialization in mind? The book provides some hints.The level of details that the author provides is admirable. The author not only introduces the ideal models, but also faithfully presents the reality of using these models.I certainly lookforward to the second edition of the book."},{"Title":"Component Development for the Java Platform","review":"I had already been teaching some of this book's material, from notes I had put together. Then I found this book - it covers more material, and does it beautifully. I give the book my highest recommendation.This covers component software from the standpoint that I prefer: the underlying technology that make components work. This book is not for the cut&paste; programmer. It's for someone who wants to understand what really happens when a program (or component) starts execution. It's for someone who wants real control over code activation, or someone who just wants to execute every test() method in every class, without having to type in the ever-changing list of class names.This book also has a place in any library on code security. For example, reflection exposes a lot more of your program than you may have thought, and serialization creates a whole new family of possible data exposures. Security is not an explicit topic, but lots of the material has security implications.The only major topic this book misses is long-term (XML)serialization. Well, that's new at Java 1.4, and the book seems to predate that API. Maybe the second edition will cover it better. The book doesn't mention EJB styles of serialization or the Java Activcation Framework either, but those are just applications of the basic technologies described here.There was good reason for this book to be written about Java. I look forward to a .NET companion volume, when (if!) .NET provides the same capabilities. In the mean time, I'd recommend this to any advanced programmer, since analogies to Java will help readers understand environments other than Java, too."},{"Title":"Component Development for the Java Platform","review":"It heleps to have a problem to solve in order to recognize an elegant solution. Stu Halloway's book is exceptionally well-wriiten and an informative read. His examples clearly support the issue at hand. Three such issues of importance to me include Dynamic Proxies (Section 3.4); Custom Metadata (Section 3.7) and Generative Programming (Chapter 7).In the Dynamic Proxies section, he writes: &quot;The strength of dynamic proxies is method call forwarding.&quot; [p. 87] Such succinct expression brings clarity to the discussion at hand, exemplifying the author's firm grasp of the subject.His Custom Metadata section illustrates pragmatic guidelines for implemenation of new-found insight:&quot;Standard java compilers will not emit your custom attributes, and the Reflection API provides no support for accessing them. If you want to define and use custom attributes, a custom class loader that tracks the attributes as classes are loaded, and extensions to reflection that can access these attributes at runtime.&quot; [p. 101]Chapter 7 (GP), has been my focus. I appreciated his thorough comparison of parametric and inheritance issues in light of Czarnecki et al., Generative Programming: Methods, Tools, and Applications (p.176) wrt their emphasis on parametric polymorphism.Indispensable stuff."},{"Title":"Component Development for the Java Platform","review":"This book is a must buy for everyone who wants to know how technologies like EJB is implemented.

Like how one divides his application to deployable components, why and when. Nothing about that - author just gave us tools that we can use without providing any further information. But I know Java provides CL, reflection and serialization for many years already - how does it help me to write components ? Where are some real-life examples (besides RMI, EJB and JSP) ?The chapter about GP (Generative Programming) gives a good description of various approaches about it (and if you know JBoss and it's dynamic invocation stack built with dynamic proxies vs other containers running \\"rmic\\" - you understand them even better) but still, I would call this book \\"Java CL, reflection, serialization and high-level GP overview\\" - that's exactly the information that I've received from it. Nothing about \\"component development\\" besides some basic example in the very beginning.2) The book spends time and space discussing C++/COM integration with Java and while I understand some will find this information invaluable - I'm sure for most Java developers (and that includes me) this is highly irrelevant.3) In 2007 it's became outdated in many points as we have Java SE 6 released and 7 upcoming - author only mentions J2SE 1.4.2. Right, many points still hold true but not all of them (does setAccessible(true) allows one to write final fields or not?) and one can never be sure whether what's he's reading is correct today the way it was back in 20014) I checked \\"Java Class File Editor\\" plugged by the author - it's just a bunch of classes without any documentation (and I've never heard of any bytecode instrumentation guru using this library so it's not of big value after all).

On the other hand, at certain points you want to just yell, \\"Snap out of it!\\" We've all lost loved ones and we all deal with uncertainty in this new world of global terrorism. Still, Nace provides readers with an intimate look into his life and his soul in what amounts to his life story told in a scratchy, minimalist style that wavers from crudely child-like to darkly beautiful.Nace relates his story of growing up in New Mexico and having to take care of his ailing father while his mother worked long hours to provide for the family. One line stands as a powerful statement about the book when he says, referring to his father, \\"He died...I kept living.\\" The line is stated almost apologetically and without the least bit of optimism about life going forward. It's a tragic line in the most classical sense.After his father's death Nace loses himself into drugs and alcohol as he is unable to cope with life, and especially unable to carry on relationships with women. Nace would eventually end up in New York City in an attempt to at once lose himself, and yet find some meaning in life. Nace finally finds love and eventually becomes a father but questions the wisdom of bringing a child into this world. By the end of the tale, or maybe it's really the beginning, Nace has resigned himself to what we all eventually do, and that is that life is what you make of it. Nace it seems as finally found peace and come to terms with his own life.Nace's story isn't all that uncommon, but the fact that he shares it so intimately with us makes it a powerful tale. It's not for everyone. It's definitely not for those who think comics begin and end with the sludge put out by certain companies. It is small press at its finest, however.Reviewed by Tim Janson"},{"Title":"Drawn Out","review":"Don Nace's Drawn Out is a twisted, surreal life, coming of age tale. His drawings tackle the difficulties of alcoholism, drug addiction, relationships with women, then marriage, fatherhood, death, and trying to fit into the rat race of commuting to NYC and working a 9 to 5 job. This is a great purchase for anyone who has ever felt like ripping their own face off (or someone else's) while somehow trying to fit in or make it in this crazy world. He is sometimes compared to Crumb, Pekar, or Ralph Steadman. He is probably closest to Steadman, although I make no claims of being an expert on their collective work. This is more of a wack-ass art book than a graphic novel, but the pics definitely tell a story.

At a time when intermarriage rates are rising and assimilation is a growing phenomenon, it is important to instill in our youth a strong sense of Jewish pride in the Jewish men and women who have overcome adversity to become legends in their own time. Seymour Brody has provided a wonderful biographical tool to teach Jewish and non-Jewish children about the important contributions American Jews have made in various ways in this wonderful update to his Jewish Heroes of America. Brody has made this edition more egalitarian by adding biographical profiles of an additional fifty women (including Jenny Maas Flexner).Brody's brief (2 pages), but informative, biographical sketches highlight where the heroes have lived and worked, what awards they have won, what professions they have worked in and what accomplishments have brought them fame and the respect of both Jews and non-Jews in America. When known, he also mentions whether they are Ashkenazi or Sephardi and their religious affiliation. Brody's book covers the whole span of American history from the prerevolutionary years to the present. Examples of Jewish soldiers are given for every war that the U.S. has fought. Among the people that are represented are lawyers, rabbis, politicians, businessmen, entertainers, athletes and health care workers. Each entry is accompanied by an illustration by award-winner Art Seiden.An improvement over the previous edition is the inclusion of a name index, although a subject index and bibliography / reading list are still lacking. At times, the entries read less like narratives and more like resumes. Sometimes, Brody is too vague, using phrases like &quot;played an important role&quot; instead of telling what the specific accomplishments were. It would have been better if Brody has chosen a greater number of stronger role models (he includes Jews who rarely acknowledged their faith and Jews who intermarried).Overall, the book does an excellent job of paying tribute to Jews from most of the states who have left their mark on America. By including first-generation Americans, Brody also demonstrates that what has made America thrive for centuries is its willingness to accept people from every nation and from every culture, letting them live in a home of freedom where they can fulfill their every dream. This book is very highly reccommended for public, school, synagogue and general Judaica collections for both young adult and children's collections"},{"Title":"Jewish Heroes & Heroines of America: 150 True Stories of American Jewish Heroism","review":"I found this book during a Web search on astronaut Judith Resnik, who was the first Jew in space and the second woman in space.

Judith Resnik is included in this book, along with 149 other American Jews who, in many different ways, are real heroes that we can all look up to.

The author Brody who is of a military background himself devotes more than the usual space to Jewish military heroes and participants in all of America's wars. He does the commendable work of making known to a larger public many quiet heroes whose deeds have been far greater than their public names.The book is excellent, but far, in my opinion, from perfect. It does not include enough of the cultural heroes , the scientists, writers, and other creators who have so enriched American life. It does not in my opinion always include the best examples from a particular area of endeavor.Nonetheless it is a wonderful compilation which can only deepen the appreciation of the Jewish contribution to American life."},{"Title":"Jewish Heroes & Heroines of America: 150 True Stories of American Jewish Heroism","review":"And one of the stories in the book, one of the 150 illustrated true stories of American heroism included in \\"Jewish Heroes & Heroines of America : 150 True Stories of American Jewish Heroism\\", which was published in 1996, is now the main focus of an entire book by Oregon newspaper columnist Bob Welch, who has written the story of Lieutenant Frances Slanger of the U.S. Army Nurses Corps during WWII.

Meier was a one-armed Swiss farmer who claimed to have been visited by extraterrestials over a period of years. These researchers made numerous trips to the Meier farm in Switzerland during the period when contacts were allegedly taking place. It describes the reactions of senior scientists at IBM, NASA, the US Navy and elsewhere to the hundreds of photographs, physical evidence and advanced scientific knowledge presented by the minimally educated Meier. Though often dismissed as hoax, the Meier case leaves a great deal which is unexplainable in any ordinary way. These visitations may well be more significant than the Betty &amp; Barney Hill case in impacting our understanding of the place of humanity in the universe. The book left me wanting to know more."},{"Title":"Light Years: An Investigation into the Extraterrestrial Experiences of Eduard Meier","review":"I've heard about Eduard Meier for many years and assumed he was a kook, not because I don't believe that aliens from other worlds are here, but because of the things he claims. Like traveling back and forward in time; the Pleadians taking only 8 hours to get here from their homeworld (which is light years away); his travels to Mars and other planets in our solar system; etc.But after reading this book, I now think that his claims are true. This book introduces the reader to the investigators who tried to disprove Meier's claims and instead, ended up having to believe him because of all the evidence and proof that exists.The book also shows just how bizarre Meier's life became due to thousands of people coming to see him. And how the UFO community tends to be its own worst enemy - all the backstabbing and vying for control over what little evidence exists.A well written and fascinating look into one man's bizarre life and the problems with trying to prove the existence of ET."},{"Title":"Light Years: An Investigation into the Extraterrestrial Experiences of Eduard Meier","review":"Author Gary Kinder explores the investigation into whether Billy Meier had actually been contacted by aliens or not. I was pretty well convinced by the book that he had made contact. A lot of people investigating the phenomenon in the book were deeply skeptical of Meier and did all they could to try to figure out how he could perpetrate a hoax, but could not find much. I thought the skepticism was getting ridiculous as I read on. But if someone doesn't want to believe in something, it doesn't really matter how much evidence is presented. My only disappointment with the book is that the author did not go into great detail about what the Pleiadians said to Billy Meier about themselves, their civilization, what they knew about our civilization, and what they were doing here. Kinder dismisses what the Meier said about the Pleiadians as \\"ravings\\". Meier made notes of each of his visits with the aliens, so going into detail about the conversations would not have been a problem. Kinder should have let the \\"madman\\" speak, instead of leaving it out of the book."},{"Title":"Light Years: An Investigation into the Extraterrestrial Experiences of Eduard Meier","review":"Book Content Description from Inside the Front Cover:In 1975, a Swiss Caretaker named Eduard \\"Billy\\" Meier disappeared on his motorbike into a forest near his village. He returned with several clear photographs of a large, silvery disk hovering in the sky. Over the next five years Meier produced hundreds of bright, detailed photographs. He also recorded the sounds of \\"beamships,\\" collected several metal samples, and made films of the ship in flight.Dozens of witnesses have seen the beamships and corroborated Meier's fantastic story. His evidence, investigated by a professional security team headed by a retired U.S. Air Force colonel, has been examined by scientists at IBM, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Arizona State University, and the Mc Donnell Douglas aeronautics company.For the past three years Gary Kinder, author of the highly acclaimed Victim: The Other Side of Murder, has investigated the Meier story.

Si aparentemente hay trazos de realismo magico --como las andanzas del Cuique, espiando con fines puramente esteticos a todas las parejas de reci&eacute;n casados en el Hotel Santa Maria de Ostuma y en la ciudad misma--, es porque los atributos ins&oacute;litos de sus personajes y el contexto mixto-geogr&aacute;fico lo permiten.

Lo que de manera realmente inigualable logra Chuno Bland&oacute;n con su genio socarr&oacute;n, pero serio, en el mejor estilo castizo de Cervantes, Camilo Jos&eacute; Cela y Jardiel Poncela. -- Carlos Chamorro Coronel, articulista, analista pol&iacute;tico...EL AUTOR:Jesus Miguel (Chuno) Bland&oacute;n, nacio el 13 de diciembre de 1940, en San Rafael del Norte, Jinotega, donde curso los primeros estudios, se gradu&oacute; de bachiller en Matagalpa, en el Instituto Eliseo Picado. En 1959 ingreso a la Facultad de Ciencias Juridicas de la Universidad de Leon, donde se relaciono con personajes tan disimiles como Carlos Fonseca Amador, Francisco Rosales Arguello, Arnoldo Aleman y Julio y Brice&ntilde;o, y compartio aulas con los escritores Sergio Ramirez Mercado, Octavio Robleto y Alejandro Serrano Caldera.Aunque se graduo de abogado en 1967, sus caminos frecuentados han sido el periodismo, el teatro, la radio y la literatura. De 1962 a 1966 fue redactor del Diario Universal, por esos a&ntilde;os trabajo con el combativo periodista Rolando Avenda&ntilde;o Sandino en el diario Extra y en el Semanario del mismo nombre. En los a&ntilde;os 60 y 80 (2da. &eacute;poca), su programa radial \\"El tren de las seis\\", parodia y satira sobre los personajes politicos de la epoca, alcanzo tal popularidad que, hasta la fecha, ningun otro programa radial ha logrado.Su obras El nacatamal de oro (1984), obra satirica en contra de Anastasio Somoza y El mas querido (1983), satira sobre el enfrentamiento entre el sandinismo gobernante de aquella epoca y la contra, fueron llevadas a escena exitosamente. Entre Sandino y Fonseca (1979), libro de ensayos historicos sobre la lucha armada en nuestro pa&iacute;s, constituyo un eslabon fundamental para la composicion de la presente novela, La noche de los Anillos. En 1989, Blandon publico Cuartel General, un texto que describe las relaciones amorosas del general Sandino con la bella telegrafista Blanca Arauz y tiene a San Rafael del Norte, como marco geografico. Chuno es tambi&eacute;n canta-autor y ha grabado numerosas composiciones.Apasionado lector de James Joyce, William Faulkner, Alejo Carpentier y Juan Rulfo, con La noche de los anillos, Blandon se inserta firmemente en la copiosa producci&oacute;n narrativa que ha distinguido a Nicaragua en los ultimos a&ntilde;os"},{"Title":"La Noche de Los Anillos","review":"Este es un libro excelente que narra la historia de un grupo de amigos en el norte de Nicaragua.

One imagines him as a grey haired gentleman in rumpled slacks and cardigan with a pipe and sneakers who makes it his kindly mission in life to fill his students with a zest for his chosen calling.His explanations are elegant, simple and fascinating. I can't think of higher praise for someone trying to make sense of a discipline as complicated as materials science.The problem with most academics is an inherent need to appear learned. This leads to obscure and convoluted explanations that are, if not overtly, at least subconsciously designed to maintain the gap between the ignorant masses and the enlightened adepts. Even when such academics make a conscious attempt to simplify, their efforts are too often sabotaged by the bad habits of a lifetime.This is why good popularisers are so difficult to come by, and why the Gordons of the world should be so prized.This book isn't just about the science of materials, but about how such an exotic subject actually connects with our everyday lives. We live in a certain way, and not in a different way, because of the strengths, weaknesses, costs and working difficulties in the materials that we use. I don't think most laymen ever bother thinking about the world in quite this way.This book is not actually meant for engineers or scientists, although most such technos would greatly benefit from reading it (if only to learn the meaning of true grasp and clarity). Its true benefit is to those curious laymen who wish to know more, but who find the usual explanations beyond them.This book should be required reading for all undergraduates, not just aspiring scientists or engineers. In fact, it should be especially required for non-technical types."},{"Title":"The New Science of Strong Materials","review":"This book is part of the Princeton Science Library, the best collection of books on mathematics and science for the intelligent layman.

This is a delightful book!Subjects such as elasticity of materials quickly bog down in mathematical detail and in the process of learning the subject, the student or interested person may quickly lose touch with what they're actually trying to grasp. This book is mostly a nonmathematical treatment (there are only a handful of mathematical formulas, chemistry equations and graphs throughout the book) which describes in a practical way what really happens with materials. Of course a deep understanding of this topic requires the full mathematical treatment, but this book certainly makes the subject accessible and engaging to anyone interested in the question &quot;Why Don't You Fall Through the Floor?&quot;I agree with the reviewer who felt this is the kind of book that an undergraduate engineering, physics or applied mathematics student should read along with the more technical textbooks when first introduced to the subject of behavior of materials."},{"Title":"The New Science of Strong Materials","review":"I enjoyed reading this book.

David Dallin writes without a hint of ideology about a topic that very few others have written about in such a unbiased way. Furthermore, to write in this manner during the Cold War and during the very end of the \\"Red Scare\\" makes this book truly remarkable.The book deals with Soviet Foreign policy of the Malenkov/Bulganin government as well as the foreign policy of the early Khruschev years. I don't know yet what the political beliefs of David Dallin are. His writing is free of any hint. His coverage of the subject matter is just plain good. The style of writing is like that of a novel.

Each of the authors (none of whom I've read before) contributes a story of 15-25 pages, some of which are fictional treatments of historical incidents or persons, the rest of which are straight fiction. Most of the stories are fairly basic short tales, with a reversal near the end that showcases the spy's skill or trickery. Common protagonists are bewitching and cunning women who shockingly turn out to be spies, and blacks and children who are inevitably smarter and craftier than suspected. As befits the depressing reality of the Civil War, many of the stories are rather bleak and depressing, in their setting if not always in their outcome. There are a few, however, that are a little more swashbuckling and James Bondish in their approach, such as Robert Randisi's &quot;The Knights of Liberty&quot;, James Cobb's &quot;Monica Van Tefflen&quot; and the one true throwaway entry, Bill Crider's &quot;Belle Boyd, The Rebel Spy,&quot; which is a silly treatment for a cliffhanger serial film. What each author has done well is inject obscure period details and history into their stories, with the result, that even if the story fails to entertain, it will inform. All in all, the collection strikes a fairly good balance of suspense, tragedy, horror, romance, politics, and of course, history-however, if the stories have greater impact if you read them one a day instead of all in one sitting. Another reason not to read it in one sitting is that the typeface is set incredibly small. Even for someone with young (30 year old) eyes like myself, reading it for more than 30 minutes at a time was a strain."},{"Title":"The First-Aid Companion for Dogs and Cats: What to Do Now, What to Do Later, over 150 Everyday Accidents and Emergencies, Essential Medicine Chest, At-A-Glance Symptom Finder, How to Prevent","review":"This is a wonderful resource full of helpful, potentially life-saving techniques that every pet owner should know.

Frustrating.Finally, we have a resource with good, practical advice on when to call the vet, and what to do in the meantime, or in some cases - what to do instead.

There are some basic illustrations too. Plus she does tell when to take the animal to the vet immediately or during the day.She lists an essential medicine chest to have to treat your dog or cat. Many of the medicines she lists are human medicines in reduced strength. Plus meds never to give especially to cats. I liked the easy at a glance symptom finder to use. There are areas on how to prevent accidents. There are some basic illustrations with clinically proven techniques.I just killed a prairie rattle snake in our driveway at our ranch in OK. A neighbor had come over and said about a week ago a rattle snake bit her puppy in the face and the dog eventually died. At least I have a book that describes what to do if one of our dogs gets bit by a rattlesnake before taking the dog to the Vet.Also I have seen Black Widow spiders. There is a section on insect bites too.The book has a chapter what to do if a dog or cat is accidentally shot plus what to do if the dog or cat gets poisoned... maybe eating a poisonous plant, antifreeze or lots of chocolate. Many more chapters on a wide array of emergencies that could happen to your cat or dog and what you can do and sometimes to take the stricken animal immediately to the Vets.Five stars for a great first aid book on cats and dogs at the right technical level for all family members ( INMO age fifteen and up) to use. INMO get this book first for quick information and techniques for your emergency first aid on dogs and cats, then latter a more detailed book you can read deeper about the subject you are interested in after the danger to the animal has past.I liked that this book is not super technical. Any member of our family can use it to save one of our cats or dogs. You don't have to have vast medical experience to use it. This was the right technical level for us.I have another book three times as big with detail descriptions of internal organs and detailed medical information. It was written for operating Veterinarians. In an emergency you may not have time to wade through technical analysis.

Not every emergency needs a trip to the vet. It covers bug bites, snake bites, allergies, what to do when your dog gets hit by a car, etc. all in alphabetical order or in the index. It tells you what to stock in your pet first aid kit including using many human medications you probably never gave a thought to using, and those that you shouldn't use.i.e. NEVER EVER give aspirin to a cat.What else can I say?

Marcio Souza's tale of the \\"Empire of Acre\\", created by Brazilian filibusters in a remote part of northern Bolivia in the Amazon basin, may or may not have much to do with Texan history, but the idea is at least similar. THE EMPEROR OF THE AMAZON relates the picaresque adventures of a Spanish vagabond in the literary style of the 19th century popular press, which was also sometimes the style of Brazilian author J.M. Machado de Assis, who was a much better writer. A crew of drunks, actors, nuns, diplomats, whores, and fantastic personalities---for example, a male-genitalia-collecting English gentleman who believes that the Manaus opera house was set down on Earth by aliens---careen about the vast jungles of the Amazon, using the rivers as highways, hoping to strike it rich by exploiting the rubber resources available there at the end of the 19th century. The land is only there to be exploited, workers only pawns in their ambition. After endless sexual and alcoholic escapades, they overthrow the Bolivian officials in Acre and establish a (short-lived) Empire.This was the first novel by Marcio Souza, who has subsequently published a number of others, none of which I've read. Though I may say that THE EMPEROR OF THE AMAZON is an extremely youthful novel, with a lot of sex and wry humor, it is certainly well-written, once you begin to see the point, which is to satirize the wastefully extravagant, parasitic society of the Amazon then, and the pretensions of Brazilian society in the 1970s when Souza wrote. I believe the author encountered some political difficulties after the book was published. At least, I bet he had a good time writing it. You will enjoy it, even if the messages are more or less drowned in hi-jinks."},{"Title":"The Emperor of the Amazon","review":"This was the first novel by Marcio Souza, a gifted Amazonian writer. The novel is based on the true story of Galvez, who briefly gained Acre (a remote state in the western Brazilian Amazon) from Bolivia in the late 1800s. At the time, the Amazon was bustling with the rubber trade, so the economic importance of the state, one of the main rubber producers in the country, was quite obvious.Galvez is a migrant from Spain who meanders through the Amazon beginning in Belem, from where he is chased, ending up in Santarem then in Manaus. A bohemian, he is dragged into the plot to save Acre from a Bolivian-American coalition that would annex Acre to Bolivia, despite the majority of Brazilian rubber tappers living there.Souza uses crude and sarcastic language in order to depict the decadent and complex society living in the Amazon, with prosptitutes from Europe, Northeastern Brazilians tapping rubber, American and European magnates, scientists with strange theories about the region and overall adventurers seeking a new life (as was the case with Galvez).Souza pokes fun at that society as well as the military conception of the Amazon at the time the wrote the book (1970s), which drew some political trouble for him at the time. He has since written much, of which I have only read Mad Maria so far. His style is definitely reminiscent of Emile Zola in the crudeness of the language. If you are getting acquainted with Souza, I would recommend Mad Maria first, since it is more of a standard novel. In Emperor of the Amazon, he uses a different style of breaking up the chapters into little pieces, which can get distracting at times. Overall, however, it is a very interesting book, continuing the tradition of able Latin American writers using sarcasm and an artistic touch in a almost surreal environment."},{"Title":"Random House Webster's Spanish-English English-Spanish Dictionary: Second Edition","review":"I purchased this dictionary to assist me in a continuing education spanish class.

On the plus side, Kohler includes pictures of a great many extant garments, which are invaluable as a resource (the book's value as a source rises considerably after 1500 for this reason). On the other hand, there are many &quot;patterns&quot;--especially in the medieval period--which, unless you read carefully, can be interpreted as being taken from extant garments, and the introduction claims almost outright that these diagrams are &quot;correct.&quot; They are not, being instead Kohler's own hypotheses. Many of them do not work as patterns. I have known many a beginner who took these diagrams as gospel and have ended up with nothing resembling an actual medieval garment. Use the illustrations (but not the &quot;patterns&quot;) and the book can have some degree of usefulness."},{"Title":"A history of costume,","review":"Amazing that the original author's name is listed without the names of the editor and translator.Author Carl Kohler died in 1876 near Nurnberg, Germany. His paintings and writings, upon which this particular reprint of a compilation are based, were previously published, intact, in German under the names \\"Die Trachten der Volker in Bild und Schnitt\\" and \\"Die Entwicklung der Tracht in Deutschland wahrend des Mittelalters und der Neuzeit\\", both in the late 1870s.Emma Von Sichart, the editor of this publication, took it upon herself in the early 1920s to gather up Kohler's sketches, drawings, paintings, and writings, and put them together in a new book. During the process, she deleted almost all of Kohler's introductory or period descriptive writings, and replaced those words with either her own, or Max von Boehn's, another historian.In addition, Emma Von Sichart added new, contemporary photographs and sketches to bring Kohler's work \\"up to date\\", at least as far as the very late 1920s. In many places she eliminated or changed Kohler's measurements, or interpretations of the cut of clothing, simply to make the work more \\"accessible\\" to the seamstress, costumer, or interested reader of the early 20th century.Further, in order to bring the publication to English speaking markets, Emma Von Sichart's writing was translated by Alexander K. Dallas, M.A., which might have further changed the original content.So, before we blame Kohler, who, in his time, was very highly regarded as a serious historian and quite the expert in period clothing, styles, customs, etc., we must first look to the likelihood of errors created by the editor Emma Von Sichart, and the translation errors of Alexander K. Dallas.If by any chance you have the original German publications of the late 1870s, you do indeed have a spectacular rare treat of period costume history.Just keep in mind that this particular book is a facsimile reprint of a translation of a heavily edited and recompiled selection of at least two originals."},{"Title":"A history of costume,","review":"The text of this book is dry, but very informative. There are many sketched and black and white illustrations, but not enough to fully support the text. (I recommend Boucher's 20,000 Years of Fashion as a companion). The patterns give a better idea of the construction of the clothes, but they are approximations and no tips are given for making your own. Make sure you refer to other sources before using his patterns. This book is most useful for its detailed descriptions of specific periods, including not just the cut and style of the period, but also material, shoes, hairstyles, accessories, and who wore what and how and on what occasions."},{"Title":"A history of costume,","review":"This is a decent overview of costume history from the Ancients to the mid 19th century with authentic resources (statues, portraits, extant costumes, pictures) as well as some original illustrations (be cautious with those and cross-reference, especially with women's garments and periods where the shapes are linear and the sides and bust are flattened--Kohler tends to round things out and represent the bust in a more rounded, typically 1860's style). It also contains a few patterns that are minimally useful (lack or proportion or instruction, etc.) except to understand the anatomy of the garments and how the pieces might fit together. No color pictures, but enough illustrations and primary resources to contribute to an overall sense of a period in costume history."},{"Title":"A history of costume,","review":"This is one of the first costume references I got when I began to study the subject in college.

The characters are more than intriguing. Their stories and personalities have drawn me in.In The Yada Yada Prayer Group Gets Down, the main character, Jodi, is forced to take a close look at many of her preconceived \\"Christiany\\" ideas about life, people, and responsibility. She's growing up, spiritually and personally through relationships with the prayer group - a diverse group of women actually modeled after close friends in the author's own long-standing women's bible study group.I appreciate the cross-cultural church-visiting the prayer group does...and saw myself sitting in those pews and folding chairs willing my comfort zone to expand exponentially!The challenges faced by individual characters effect Jodi's daily life and understanding of herself as a Christian. She often asks, \\"How would I handle...\\" or \\"What if I were...\\" It makes me ask those same questions.The beautiful, difficult, relational obstacle course that friendships between very different people can be comes alive in this book. I knew the book was more than a \\"good read\\" when I found myself muttering (in a real-life relational obstacle course-type situation) \\"Things are getting out of hand.

The book should be called \\"Jodi\\". The book focused on her and her alone. Characters are introduced in this book and never elaborated on or broken down into detail. If there is an issue with another character it was never addressed well enough to be resolved. The whole MaDear incident was not realistic on how it was handled. There needs to be realism in a book related to religion. And for the record, the prayer group never \\"Got Down\\"!!!!"},{"Title":"The Yada Yada Prayer Group Gets Down (Yada Yada Prayer Group, Book 2)","review":"Jodi, Nony, Hoshi, Adele, Florida and the rest are back. This time they deal with some pretty serious issues. Denny, Jodi's husband, is accused by MaDear, Adele's mother, of lynching her baby brother; Nony takes off to Africa when her mother has a stroke; Florida, now with custody of her young daughter, has to deal with Carla's hostility - she wants to go back to her foster parents, and Hoshi has to tell her Shinto parents that she is a Christian.The incident between Denny and MaDear brings a whole new set of circumstances to the multi-racial group as Adele separates herself from her praying sisters. Old hurts and prejudices come to the surface, and the entire group learns a new way of praying.Jodi's healing after her accident that killed a young boy, is a long, slow process. Not just physically, but mentally, spiritually and emotionally as well. An ugly confrontation at the school where she teaches third grade force her to take a whole new look at forgiveness. Is she really responsible for the sins of others? How do you pray that way?And what about that drug-crazed woman who forced her way into Jodi's home during a Yada Yada prayer meeting and robbed them at knife-point. A knife that actually drew blood? The long-reaching consequences of that terrifying day permanently affect the lives of all who were there.I found this second book from Neta Jackson to be quite a reading experience. All these women, who met for the first time at a women's rally in Chicago, come from vastly diverse social and cultural backgrounds. Their bonds grow stronger through each experience as a group, and individually. They meet in each other's homes for prayer; they take turns visiting each other's churches, learning even more about themselves and their sisters. I particularly enjoyed the visit to Ruth's church. Ruth, a Messianic Jew, gives some great descriptions and deep insight into the blending of the old and the new.The Yada Yada Prayer Group Gets Down - on their knees. On a book-rating scale, this gets 5-Stars. On a scale of 1 to 10 - this is definitely a 10. I can't recommend it highly enough. But, I also suggest, if you haven't already done so, to read the first Yada Yada Prayer Group book first. There are a few things in this second book that might not make a lot of sense without the background of the first."},{"Title":"The Yada Yada Prayer Group Gets Down (Yada Yada Prayer Group, Book 2)","review":"THE YADA YADA PRAYER GROUP, Jackson's debut solo novel, garnered glowing reviews from myself and countless others when it came out last year. Jackson's voice was so fresh and her concerns were relevant covering issues that often are not addressed. While the first Yada Yada book could easily have stood by itself, there was plenty of material in it for at least one sequel, and maybe more.I opened THE YADA YADA PRAYER GROUP GETS DOWN eagerly since I had enjoyed the first book so thoroughly and wanted to see what Jackson would explore here. Sure I had some trepidations about this second novel since I am all too familiar with the sophomore slump that many authors experience. Looking at the cover I saw the new shot of dancing feet that was much like the delightful line of feet in brightly colored socks on the cover of the first book. This screamed to me that the books were being packaged together. I then had concerns that Jodi Baxter, the protagonist of this \\"package,\\" would therefore wind up as a packaged person, whose quirks and flaws would become frozen in time.I should have trusted more in Jackson's God-given talent and inspiration, because she has delivered a second novel that builds on the first and, in some ways, surpasses it.As it opens, Jodi and her family are in the midst of a steamy city summer. Their home, or \\"two-flat,\\" in downtown Chicago is about as far from the Gold Coast as you can get, and unlike many characters in Christian fiction who seem to be effortlessly upper-middle-class, the teaching couple struggles for money (Denny still doesn't know whether or not his contract for the upcoming year will come through) and participates actively in their local culture.The members of Yada Yada, as fans will know, are an eclectic bunch both ethnically and sociologically, including an elegant South African faculty wife, a very young ex-con baker, a middle-aged Messianic Jewish bubbe, and a permanently indignant African-American salon owner. It's the latter's aging mother whose troubled past provokes a rift in the prayer group, and it is this rift that forces Jody and Denny to confront their present-day beliefs.Those beliefs affect their daughter, their son, and Jodi's quiet Iowa parents, as well as the Yada Yada members, their families, and an unwelcome new acquaintance, Becky Wallace. But what makes this book work is not necessarily this brand-new action, but the interactions of Jodi and her sisters in Christ as they get to know one another for better and for worse. Jodi is not a perfectly cheerful cardboard Christian --- she doesn't always cook with love, she holds grudges, and she argues with her husband. Instead, she's a struggling, contemporary woman of faith whose life reflects her most cherished beliefs. I closed this book wondering how Jackson will further explore this group in future books.--- Reviewed by Bethanne Kelly Patrick"},{"Title":"The Yada Yada Prayer Group Gets Down (Yada Yada Prayer Group, Book 2)","review":"I just finished all 3 books.

Jodi Baxter is back with the rest of the mixed group of women. I can identify so much with Jodi; we both tend to take our faith and God for granted, and we both need reminders to pray always. In this book the prayer group is attacked while in Jodi's home by a knife-wielding young woman. How each woman reacts to the drama changes the group and the reader. Jackson is not a writer who allows you to read her books passively. She drags you into the book until each character becomes dear and you are forced to face your own feelings and faith. This book made me realize three things: 1) I need to look at my own prejudices closely and examine how I treat other people, 2) I need to pray with my husband; our lives will only be better for it, and 3) I want a group of friends like Jodi's! Even with the misunderstandings and anger, these women encourage each other to grow, and not just in faith. This book really starts to explore some of the members of the group that received less time in the last book, and I just can't wait to read the next one and get to know everyone even better."},{"Title":"The Yada Yada Prayer Group Gets Down (Yada Yada Prayer Group, Book 2)","review":"This follow-up to the first Yada Yada Prayer Group book is a little slower-paced than the first, but contains plenty of drama and excitement. Where the first book ignited a passion for heartfelt praise, this novel draws the reader deeper into a bare-bones examination of the road to overcoming personal prejudices. It challenges us to look at how we LIVE our faith, and to strengthen our relationships with fellow believers. The short-view: Slower, and deeper impact."},{"Title":"The Yada Yada Prayer Group Gets Down (Yada Yada Prayer Group, Book 2)","review":"This book is about Jodi and the various relationships with the women in her prayer group. The theme of this book is aboutforgiveness. We see many examples of this through: forgiving the woman who robbed the prayer group, the mother of the boythat Jodi accidently killed, and MaDear and what she went through when her brother was murdered.I really enjoyed the book. It was very uplifting. I loved the humor in the book. And I loved the forgiveness theme.MaDear thought that Denny was the man who lynched her brother. At the end of the book, that situation was resolvedbeautifully.This author describes very well the relationships today between the various races. Jackson lives in the inner cities amongvarious races, so she brings her experiences into this book to describe how the various races fit in with each other.I look forward to reading more books from this author."},{"Title":"The Yada Yada Prayer Group Gets Down (Yada Yada Prayer Group, Book 2)","review":"The Yada Yada Prayer Group has been meeting for a while now and everyone is starting to get used to each other. Even though the group is very diverse, friendships are beginning to flourish and everyone is starting to open up little by little. But then one night at a group meeting, a woman comes into Jodi's house and threatens the group with a knife causing many old wounds to be opened in the group. Other issues with racism, anger, and trust put the group through a tough time as it tests all how strong is their friendship and their faith.First off, I love love love the Yada Yada book series. I wish I was in a group like this. I love how this book series is very daring in the topics it chooses. Racism is something that most Christian books avoid because it's a touchy subject. Since the book is told from Jodi's POV, it's very easy to take her side on the issue with Ma Dear, Denny, and Adele. You get frustrated with everyone for not communicating with each other, yet at the same time you realize why both sides act the way they do. I also love how the group visits the different churches. It's nice to see them in the setting of a different denominations and have a new worship experience. Again since Jodi is the main character, you feel her pain and frustration. I felt the same way she did about certain issues. Some of the other characters seem a little too perfect at times, like how they are immediately ready to forgive Becky for what she did to them. I know that we should forgive those who hurt us, but It didn't seem realistic that people would be willing to open up their arms like that so soon. Sometimes you feel that since there are so many women in the group, it's hard to keep track of them all. I keep mixing up some of them or I forgot who's even in the group. I think that Jodie herself mentions this issue about whether or not the group is too big to keep close relationships with everyone. But it's really cool how diverse the group is, all races and ages are represented allowing readers of all ages to enjoy the book.If you haven't already read the first book in the series, I definitely recommend it. This series is one of my favorites, the books are page-turners, you laugh, you cry, you get angry, you get irritated, it's like reading a slice of real life."},{"Title":"The Yada Yada Prayer Group Gets Down (Yada Yada Prayer Group, Book 2)","review":"Keep reading!

I am two books in on the Yada Yada Prayer Group series and I have enjoyed both books! The characters and story lines are realistic, refreshing, and relatable...they spark an array of emotions...A good read, anywhere, anytime."},{"Title":"The Yada Yada Prayer Group Gets Down (Yada Yada Prayer Group, Book 2)","review":"Once I got all the characters and their relationships straightened out, it was great. It shows an example of a strong Christian marriage in Jodi and her husband Denny, and what real fellowship is all about as the sisters get involved with each other. They \\"encourage one another to love and good deeds\\". They demonstrate the power of prayer in our lives and they strengthen their faith as they see how God works. I felt the forgiveness the characters experienced and once again - was broken and humbled. Also loved learning of different cultures and traditions. Can't wait to go on to Yada Yada #3."},{"Title":"The Yada Yada Prayer Group Gets Down (Yada Yada Prayer Group, Book 2)","review":"This book begins a journey thats 7 books long which is like a Christian soap opera.

This ladies prayer group brings together women of different cultures and Christian faiths and demonstrates a godly type of love. The first two books have inspired me to love the LORD more and to love His children as He has loved me. One thought that strikes me in particular is that God does not love me any more than he loves YOU, and you, and you - all people are God's children. I do cherish the Word of God and believe with all my heart there is one message, but that does not make me any better than any of God's children. As God opens my eyes to truth when I study His Word, He will reveal the same truths to others as they pray and study. It is not my place to judge but to love and pray for all people. I'm so excited about the messages given in these books! I highly recommend the Yada Yada series! I just know that Neta and I have an affinity one to the other!From Dawn Kurtz author of a \\"novel\\" soul winning book:Secret of the Mexican Doll"},{"Title":"The Yada Yada Prayer Group Gets Down (Yada Yada Prayer Group, Book 2)","review":"The Yada Yada Prayer Group Books by Neta Jackson are so wonderful. Read book 1 and was immediately hooked and had to find book 2. Since on a limited budget, I turned to Amazon.com to find the best price possible as I want to be able to get all 7 books! They are wonderful reading and entertaining as well as speaking about Jesus and how people from all walks of life come together and pray for each other and their families..you will laugh at times, and then there is times when you need a tissue.

For someone living in the Chicago area they are a delight to read as the streets and the buildings mentioned are all so familiar.

A Christian Book that to me was very Human, and hard to put down. I actually listened to it on CD, as I have a long commute to work. Commuting for me is Painful as I live in Northern Virginia. But I found myself not wanting to leave my car, because I really wanted to hear the whole book in entirety. I am sharing this book with my sisters in my own Bible study group at work. And I just found out there are more! I love this group of women, who were so real to me, that I almost started praying for them myself! I love love love this book. Thank you Neta Jackson!

I enjoy the Yada Yada Prayer Group series so very much. Neta expertly crafts her characters so that you almost instinctively assign voices and faces to these characters. You feel as though you know these characters; you go to church with these ladies, they are in your choir or your small group. I told my niece that I am already lamenting my completion of the series. It will be like the feeling of loneliness you experience when you have to leave your church family and move to another location. You know you will miss these people who have meant so much to your life and your spiritual growth. Sounds like an extreme view of characters in a book? I challenge you to start reading the series. You will be delighted. You will also be challenged in your spiritual walk as the main character Jodi Baxter is challenged and grows spiritually. Treat yourself to the ladies of the Yada Yada Prayer Group!"},{"Title":"The Yada Yada Prayer Group Gets Down (Yada Yada Prayer Group, Book 2)","review":"I would recommend this series for anyone. I have already read through books 1-6 and am waiting for book #7 that will come out this week. I liked the series so much I now am buying a set of my own and am passing them around my church and friends to read. It will open your eyes to see how different ethnic groups look at church and prayer and how they see life from their culture.

I'm already on to #3 (Yada Yada Gets Real). Peggy Phifer's review gives an excellent overview of the story, so I won't do it again. But I do have to give special kudos to the audio versions of these books. Barbara Rosenblat's narration is spectacular. Each character is distinct with their own accents & personalities, making a great story outstanding. Very highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Yada Yada Prayer Group Gets Down (Yada Yada Prayer Group, Book 2)","review":"Neta Jackson has once again delighted and entertained her fans with another Yada Yada book. Her skill as a writer glows as she \\"fleshes out\\" the characters' personalities, and is careful to ensure that none of these women are candidates for sainthood! Their lives, families and problems are so very human and her descriptions of situations, dialogue and solutions are so very real. I have finished reading all of her Yada Yada books, and am painfully aware that the author cannot possibly write fast enough to satisfy what is becoming a (world-wide?) voracious appetite for her wonderful books. Keep them coming, Neta!"},{"Title":"The Yada Yada Prayer Group Gets Down (Yada Yada Prayer Group, Book 2)","review":"Wonderful book that examines many issues women today face, but with a great story as the back drop.

You will become involved in the lives of these characters - feel their hurts, and celebrate their joys. Extremely well written and very believable! It didn't take long for me to feel like these ladies were my own friends. I can not wait to see what will happen to them next. I wholeheartedly recommend this book, and the entire series to anyone who wants to be reminded that God is still at work in the lives of His children. Start with the first one (which starts out slow, then takes off like a bang), and read through to the end. It will challenge you to long for and work harder at a deeper walk with the Master! I will be very surprised if you do not love it!"},{"Title":"The Yada Yada Prayer Group Gets Down (Yada Yada Prayer Group, Book 2)","review":"The first Yada Yada book introduces the various women of the Yada Yada Prayer Group - this one continues the story and develops new insights to the characters. Why is Jodi the way she is? Why is Adele? When we see Jodi's parents and Adele's mom, you can realize how their experiences have shaped their daughter's lives. And it's just a great story on top of everything. I love the visits to different churches too - it is really interesting to see how different people worship. Love these books!"},{"Title":"The Light of Krishnamurti","review":"This text is a welcome contribution to the growing body of books about Krishnamurti, written by people who were close to him and whose lives were profoundly affected by his. It makes no bones about being autobiographical, but what gives the book its tenor and vigor is the constant braiding of the author's life with K's in terms of what she calls \`The Light'. This is not an allegorical or literary device: rather, it is the thematic ground from which their lives (and, indeed, all lives) grow and in which alone they find substance and meaning. The word \`light' appears, not only in the title, but in each of the ten chapters into which the book is divided. The locus and focus of the action is Ojai, where the author spent her formative years as one of the first students of The Happy Valley School, an experience mirrored over twenty years later, when her son Raj became Brockwood Park School's first student. It was obviously an inspirational time, with that sense of unbounded possibility which living with Krishnaji generated in people. Gabriele had a bent and a talent for music, which kept her in touch with what she terms her \`sleepworld', a place of joy and sunlit innocence, to which she had access as a child. It comes as one of the epiphanies of the book, when the light she experiences in this state takes on the form of the actual Krishnamurti, telling her to attend next day's talk in the Oak Grove. From then on she no longer visits her \`sleep-world', but a lifelong bond with K is sealed. The author goes through numerous changes, ...the integration of \`The Light' with the work of clairvoyant healing for which she is noted heralds the onset of her mature years...Deftly, however, the author moves on to a clairvoyant description of a talk at Saanen and an account of K' death in similar vein."},{"Title":"The Light of Krishnamurti","review":"The Light of Krishnamurti is not in this book. The author freely uses the name of Krishnamurti to promote a very boring autobiography. Mrs. Blackburn does not contribute in any form to advance the knowledge about this profound and spiritual leader."},{"Title":"The Light of Krishnamurti","review":"Having read Gabriele Blackburns book on The Science and Art of Pendulum a number of years ago I was delighted to discover her autobiography: The Light of Krishnamurti and learn more about the author and her interesting life growing up in the Light of Krishnamurti. Thank you."},{"Title":"The Light of Krishnamurti","review":"It's a book about 'the light', whatever that means. If you believe in spirits, magic, astral travel and all that mumbo jumbo, you will probably enjoy this book. Otherwise, skip it. It is not about Krishnamurti, there's not even one page dedicated to a discussion of his life or ideas. I don't know why Mrs Blackburn put Krishnamurti's name on the cover if all she wanted to do was to write about herself. Maybe she's well aware that with a more appropriate title, like \\"The Autobiography of Gabriele Blackburn\\", she wouldn't have found a publisher."},{"Title":"The Light of Krishnamurti","review":"If you are in any way interested in the teachings of J. Krishnamurti, do not waste your time with this book. It's a self-serving autobiography of a self-proclaimed 'healer' on an ego trip. Every page is filled with I's, Me's and We's and there are several pictures of the author and her husband. Apparently her parents knew Krishnamurti and this influenced her in a very peculiar way, so she decided to tell the world about it. The opening pages contain the following statement, which reflects the spirit of the entire book:&quot;(My parents) conciously asked for a third child. They wished for one who would be able to understand the inmensity of Krishnamurti's teachings, live them, and be a bearer of that Light of Truth. Apparently such a one was attracted to them, as I was conceived in Ommen that summer. I was born on May 10, 1930, a date so close to Krishnamurti's birth date that they took it as a sign.&quot;There is also a story about what &quot;really&quot; happenned to Krishnamurti when he died, as the author claims to have seen it all while in some kind of out of body experience. Enough said."},{"Title":"Joy of Gardening Cookbook","review":"I was lucky enough to buy this fabulous book for about 25 cents at a rummage sale. The book is something that I've wanted for years....basic recipes with veggies, fruit, and herbs from the garden. I agree with all of the great reviews on this book. The only thing I would have to do is substitute healthy oils for the nasty hydrogenated vegetable oils and a healthier form of sugar.

For gardeners or CSA (community supported agriculture) subscribers, this practical book is a good resource when a crop is ready to get picked and you'd like some ideas. Most recipes can be made from items readily on hand, so I rarely have to go shopping--I just head straight from the garden to the kitchen and get cooking. There is basic information about how to cook each vegetable in case you have an idea of a dish you'd like to make (or create) and need to know how long to boil, bake, grill, etc. the vegetable. If you prefer actual recipes, the book has these too, and I've enjoyed many of them."},{"Title":"Joy of Gardening Cookbook","review":"This book is organized by ingredient.

Also a great gift idea for families w/ gardens"},{"Title":"Joy of Gardening Cookbook","review":"Garden Way's Joy of Gardening Cookbook by Janet Ballantyne is a classic that deserves space in any cookbook collection. I actually keep one at work too so I can grab and read up on a particular fruit, vegetable, or technique when the mood hits me! I, too, have collected cookbooks for 40+ years, and can't understand how anyone could NOT profit from this one! The color photos (there are hundreds) help understand equipment, technique, step by step instructions, and what the finished dish should look like. The information on prep and use hasn't changed. With more people planting gardens or buying from markets close to home, this is an invaluable guide to using produce. Some of my favorite recipes include: Pickled Beets & Purple Eggs (my grandpa used to fix these), Cabbage au Gratin, Strawberry Cheese Strudels, all of the herb recipes, such as Boursin Cheese, Cottage Cheese Herb Spread, Sour Cream Dill Dip, Herb Cheese Soup, Pesto, Italian Seasoning Mix; Thai Chicken in Lettuce Leaves, Garlic Cream Sauce for Pasta, Onion Spiral Bread, Hay & Straw (noodles, julienned ham, fresh peas, fresh parmesan, butter, and a bit of heavy cream), Fried Rice, Chiles Rellenos, Roasted/Marinated Peppers, the 6 potato salad variations, Smoked Pork Chops on a Potato Apple Bed, Sweet Potatoes in Ginger Honey Sauce, Pumpkin Orange Cheesecake, Creamed Spinach with Garlic, Zucchini Chocolate Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting, Squash Apple Nut Bread, and the techniques for tomatoes-I make my own pizza sauce from my homegrown tomatoes, and use it to make a gigantic pizza that's fantastic. There's even a chapter on \\"Oddball\\" vegetables, and a shopping list chapter for ingredients you may want to keep on hand. While this book is light on fruits, it's heavy on ideas. Janet tells you what to do with the early harvests, the older (tougher, woodier) vegetables, and the best way to preserve each for storing. I really can't imagine any one not getting their money's worth from this book. In fact, I'm getting ready to order one for a gift now. Check this out, you'll be so glad you did. Janet also did a book on tomatoes, and Garden Way did a book called \\"Zucchini Cookbook and Other Squash\\" if you're interested. While out of print, they're worth tracking down. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Joy of Gardening Cookbook","review":"Although out of print for many years, this book still contains many great recipes from Janet Ballantyne. It was first printed in 1984 and an anniversary edition was printed in 1994. Several of my favorite recipes, including vegetarian, are in this cookbook and I just bought a used one for my daughter."},{"Title":"Joy of Gardening Cookbook","review":"This is a terrific cookbook for gardeners and non-gardeners alike. Although it was published some time ago, the author's information is timeless. As a home economist, she has created some great vegetable recipes. I believe that even if someone doesn't like vegetables, by using this book, he or she should find appetizing ways to fix them. A unique feature of the book is the emphasis on using fresh veggies right out of the garden. Of course, if someone doesn't have a garden, fresh vegetables are also available from many sources. The author does comment that since her first edition was published, higher-fat ingredients have fallen out of favor. A cook should find it easy to substitute lower-fat ingredients in that case."},{"Title":"Joy of Gardening Cookbook","review":"Glad I stumbled across this book, it is excellent for turning vegetables into wholesome food that allows you to taste the essence of the vegetable. The recipes are reliable and not to complicated, if you want gourmet recipes, this ain't it. Then again there are some inventive and tasty little gems here.I have been collecting cook books for two decades, and this is a great book for anybody with a farm share, a big garden, or a yen to learn to make vegetables more palatable. You won't win Iron Chef with this book, but you will make veggies more interesting at the next potluck. Also, the recipes are adaptable so a green bean pate recipe can be changed to make a combination of flavors with blanched green beans & onion with a zesty sauce. If you have some skills, you can adapt the flavors of one combination and present the taste in a new form. Remember, the quality of the vegetables is key, thus garbage in, garbage out, fresh wholesome veggies in, fresh zesty flavor sensation out.Finally, the recipes are mostly easy to execute. Janet Ballantyne is an educator, and knows how to present recipes in a fool proof fashion. Go ahead and get this book so you can enjoy your garden fresh veggies more."},{"Title":"Joy of Gardening Cookbook","review":"I have had a copy of this cook book for years, and it shows its age.

I can only think of one recipe that I didn't like."},{"Title":"Joy of Gardening Cookbook","review":"Janet Ballantyne knew just how to put together a comprehensive information book about vegetables.

Her do's and don't and why were enlightening. I have spent days reading the book from cover to cover.

The author could have explained everything in a book half the size. His explanations are not entertaining either.The author is obviously well versed in chaos theory but lacks the ability to write a good book. For a good read on a similar topic that is much better written try The Black Swan by Taleb or The (MIS)Behavior of Markets by Mandelbrot."},{"Title":"The Essence of Chaos","review":"Edward Lorenz takes a complicated topic and makes it accessible for all people, regardless of prior knowledge of chaos theory. He provides interesting and easy to follow examples of chaos, fractals and complexity. The illustrations are helpful and he includes a glossary of terms to aid the beginning chaos enthusiasts to quickly become familiar with the terminology. Mr. Lorenz gives a brief history of chaos and explains how it is used in the study of mathematics, meteorology, economics, music, and other fields. The book is very interesting and is highly recommended for those who would like to acquaint themselves with the exciting world of chaos."},{"Title":"The Essence of Chaos","review":"My first intro to chaos was Gleick's book *Chaos: Making a New Science* which focused on the history of the discovery of chaos. Although this was fascinating - and a good read for those just learning about dynamical systems, strange attractors, and the like - Lorenz's *Essence of Chaos* was much more satisfying. Lorenz analyzes specific chaotic functions, gives you the math (equations are in the appendix) and generally accomplishes what the title suggests - that is, exploring the essence of chaos. I highly recommend it for anyone interested in this deeply fascinating subject."},{"Title":"The Essence of Chaos","review":"Lorenz did a great job when he wrote this book!The very first time when I heard of chaos theory was year ago while watching some old documentary about Nostadamus. In film was mentioned chaos theory and said that acceptance of it by many people could change whole look to life and so on. Movie left to me questions - what is that theory, what it's standing for.Finaly my interest lead me to this book and it clearly showed me what kind of staff is that chaos theory! That was and is really intriguing!Book is well written. There was of course some places that wasn't easy to understand. I myself have studied high math,encountered differential equations but anyway had some difficulties. That's why not 5 stars to book - it's really not for absolutely everyone although almost close to it. I couldn't stop it reading, I was done in two days.This book encouraged me for further reading."},{"Title":"The Essence of Chaos","review":"If your interest in Chaos was piqued by Gleick's book on the subject, you may have found it unsatisfying. While it conveyed a enthusiasm for chaos, it only superficially answered questions about what characterizes a chaotic system. \\"The Essence of Chaos\\" is a much better book for gaining an understanding of chaos, mainly because it includes a discussion of the mathematics. Both authors strive to avoid mathematics as much as possible, but in the end, I believe Lorenz achieves a better balance. He only touches lightly on the math, but without that, it's impossible to understand what makes a system chaotic. He doesn't quite go so far as to show a practical application of chaos theory, but a clear and concise example of that probably doesn't exist yet. But, he does achieve the goal of demonstrating and examining the fascinating characteristics of a chaotic system."},{"Title":"The Essence of Chaos","review":"Having read several books about Chaos Theory, and having been promised a user-friendly and yet academic book on the subject, this book fell a little short. Certainly academic, not so easy for someone who does not have a solid background in the sciences and mathematics fields. The various sections cover much of the recent research, and if you can get past the equations, you get a more complete sense of the progression in the subject."},{"Title":"The Essence of Chaos","review":"Lorenz has done it again. This is a terrific inside look at chaos by the man who made Gleick's book possible. And it had a few interesting new ideas too--who would have thought there was a different way to present fourth-order Runge-Kutta? Who would have thought Runge-Kutta could convert a phase-space circle to a nice-looking fractal attractor? A good book for the air plane."},{"Title":"The Essence of Chaos","review":"I read this book when it was snowing outside in the Sierras. I was immediately able to correlate this book with the chaotic snow fall.Extremely good read."},{"Title":"The Essence of Chaos","review":"Chaos is not randomness and randomness is not chaos. Ed Lorenz, one of the founding fathers of chaos theory, has produced a book aimed at explaining chaos theory to the public, starting and ending on the same point- common usage has incorrectly rendered \\"chaotic\\" and \\"random\\" to be synonyms. Randomness implies that there are no equations to govern the evolution of a system, while chaos implies that the system is incredibly sensitive to its initial conditions, but there are equations behind the curtain. A pinball machine, flipping coins, tossing dice, and the global weather are all examples of chaotic systems, despite what your math teachers might have told you. Along the way you get a small dose of the history of the field and the relevant higher-level mathematics.Lorenz does, I think, a pretty good job of explaining the subject. The more mathematically inclined reader will find all the details and differential equations in the appendix of the book, but for the most part you do not need to have that much of a mathematical background to understand the main points of the book. Sometimes the explanations do get a little hairy, and might require a second read. Lorenz makes analogies with simple systems and everyday occurrences (such as a pinball machine and skiing down moguls) in engaging language mostly free of jargon. I would recommend this book if you are interesting in learning about the basics of chaos theory. I haven't yet read Gleick's famousChaos: Making a New Science, but this seems like an excellent place to start."},{"Title":"The Essence of Chaos","review":"Edward Lorenz is credited with \\"discovering\\" chaos theory based on his meteorological work.

Although beautiful patterned knits are common from Jo Sharp, there is nothing common about the amazing designs and inspiring photos in this wonderful book. I admit to being a knitting book junkie. I buy dozens of books, look through them, \\"Ooh\\" and \\"Aah,\\" and then they go on the shelf with all of the others. This is not the case with Jo Sharp books, and this one is no exception.

Although there are many thousands of books that discuss the techniques and theories for picking stocks, buying insurance, or building your career, there are very few that actually discuss--or even understand--the more subtle energetic and spiritual principles behind finding true wealth. But it is these underlying principles, of course, that form the true basis of all success. Money Magnetism explains these principles and gives simple, easy-to-follow techniques to magnetise the resources you need to lead a rich and fulfilling life. Even if you think you are looking for a book on hard-core financial management--buy this book, too.

Sometimes the story was a bit far-fetched for me, but the quick-witted writing kept me interested."},{"Title":"Rough Chick","review":"I finished reading this book last week. It's kind of like a fable more than just a basic story. I usually just pass a book on or put it up on my shelf and move to the next one, but this one has stayed with me. This is for anyone looking for something outside the typical beginning-middle-end plot points."},{"Title":"Rough Chick","review":"It's a little strange, a lot crazy, and very entertaining. It made me laugh. It made me cry. 'Nuff said."},{"Title":"Rough Chick","review":"This book has plenty of subtext for the active mind. There are themes under themes in this story, but they don't compete with each other and end up in a convoluted mess. The story follows a clear, linear path and is often quite funny too. I won't give away the ending, but I didn't know how well the plot was put together until I understood about the elemental pentacle. The author seems to be knowledgeable on a few varying topics. There are philosophical and historical references along with some occult jargon. I liked Larkin, the conflicted anti-heroine (and not just because she's a Virgo), but I LOVED her lover, Alice. Their conversations are a great dance of half-intimacy. I wished there were more exchanges between them. This book was a very entertaining read and if you want to get everything out of it, you might want to read it more than once."},{"Title":"Rough Chick","review":"I like many of the supporting characters very much, especially Alice, Adan, Frankie, and the witches. Adan in particular is a real achievementa believably smart, troubled kid who isn't written as a smart, troubled adult in a child's body, which is a frequent pitfall in writing child characters. His exchanges with the main character, Larkin, are often superb, and the dialogue in general is often crisp, funny, and flawlessly arranged and punctuated. I love the name &quot;Larkin Fisher.&quot; It's mildly androgynous, with a hard, sharp soundand Alice's shortening to &quot;Lark&quot; is amusingly incongruous. The story is well designed and comprehensive and worth recommending."},{"Title":"Rough Chick","review":"This book was...intriguing. Poignant in parts. Funny in a dark humor sort of way. If you want to know what you're getting story-wise, here's the scoop. The main chick, Larkin, doesn't really like people. Not many, anyway. One day she's sitting in a coffee shop, minding her own business, when another woman walks in and starts talking to her (uninvited). She rattles off this whole woe is me (woe is I) speech about how she's a battered woman and Larkin starts feeling less annoyed and more like she should help her. This is where the strange parts come in. I don't want to give away too much because I enjoyed being surprised. I'll just say that Larkin, referred to as Rough-and-Tumble by her girlfriend for her \\"contentious and uncommitted nature\\", tries to do what she thinks is the humanitarian thing. Along her journey, you get to meet some offbeat personalities and the disturbingly honest Adan, a seven-year-old boy who has accepted the fact that all adults are insane. In addition to a clever story and interesting imagery, this book also leaves you feeling that we are all (in a true Earth-based religion sort of way) connected to each other."},{"Title":"Rough Chick","review":"One might think the book was a bit too much. But the story stays within the realm of the possible and even includes the probable. I enjoyed the pace of the book, with its quick-witted exchanges and refusal to dwell on insightful moments."},{"Title":"Rough Chick","review":"I really liked this book.

The book is not set up very intuitively, nor does it lend itself well to general troubleshooting. The troubleshooting offered is positioned in areas of focus that would be difficult to determine without considerable knowledge up front, as opposed to assisting in isolating a problem step-by-step. Further, instead of helping identify parts, etc., the authors seem to assume that you have a thorough overall knowledge of your particular motor, and offer no path to that information. In its defense, the book does go into great detail about disassembling and cleaning or rebuilding different devices and systems. But again, it doesn't help you determine problems, so who'd know what to disassemble? Sorry kids, but major thumbs down on this one."},{"Title":"Johnson/Evinrude Outboards, 3-4 Cylinders, 1958-72 (Seloc Marine Tune-Up and Repair Manuals)","review":"This book helped in troubleshooting my problem but said absolutely nothing about how to fix it."},{"Title":"Johnson/Evinrude Outboards, 3-4 Cylinders, 1958-72 (Seloc Marine Tune-Up and Repair Manuals)","review":"This is a very nice product and it lasts a good long time.

Even then there will still be gaps in information that must be filled by an actual mechanic who has experience with the unit in question. Seloc did a good Job of providing basic information, they organize this manual better than some others. Most of what you will need to know can be readily found. Unfortunately some information is simply missing and some of the basic specifications were wrong. for example this book states that the stroke for the 80hp Super sea king and the 75hp Super sea king are the same. this is incorrect.

The book is rife with illustrations, maps, drawings, photographs and Sumerian hieroglyphics."},{"Title":"Babylonian life and history (By-paths of Bible knowledge)","review":"I bought this because I wanted a reference book on Babylonians and it was very cheap, 8 bucks at Barnes and Noble.It's extremely dated and makes vast assumptions that are horrifying. The blurb on the back advertised a discussion on Babylonian \\"vampires\\", to which I said \\"Really?\\". The passage that discusses vampires is about one page long and is simply a tangent proclaiming that Egyptians were terrified of vampires, evidenced by how they seal up organs in jars and entombed their pharaohs. This is absolutely untrue.The blurb also mentions a practice called \\"baby-farming\\". The index says \\"baby-farming\\" can be found on page \\"xi\\", which of course is the introduction. The introduction is a repetition of the blurb on the back. So I will never know what 'baby-farming' is.The text is by a Victorian writer, something that makes itself very apparent when discussing marriages and he states that marriages are arranged 'much like ours are'. What he considers pertinent is bizarre and how he comes to his conclusions are vague at best.An absolute waste of money."},{"Title":"Edinburgh: Picturesque notes","review":"bought this when we returned from visiting edinburgh. realized i had never actually read robert louis stevenson. only had seen movies of his work. so was great to find out more about a city we loved visiting, and great to experience reading his writing. found out why his works are classics - he's a really good writer! made me want to read more of his work."},{"Title":"The Story of Harriet Tubman: Conductor of the Underground Railroad (Dell Yearling Biography)","review":"This book is my introduction of Black History Month to my fifth grade students. We read this book aloud and discuss it in detail. It tells the story of Harriet Tubman, a great, courageous black woman who was instrumental as a conductor of the Underground Railroad. The story begins with Harriet at age six and tells of the beatings and hardships she endured throughout her life. My students love this book because it is poignant, funny, and exciting. Harriet's life reads like a James Bond novel. She was a commander and a spy for the Northern army. She was a conductor of the Underground Railroad. She risked her life repeatedly to free her people and family from the bonds of slavery. Most of my students have never heard of Harriet Tubman and after reading this book have come to admire this wonderful black woman."},{"Title":"The Story of Harriet Tubman: Conductor of the Underground Railroad (Dell Yearling Biography)","review":"I thought that The Story of Harriet Tubman by Kate McMullan was a really good book.

The story had a lot of action in it and each chapter unraveled another adventure. Like how she knew the swamps by heart and how she was a part of the Civil War.

Unable to read or write she became the Moses of her people, leading over 300 black slaves to freedom. Her contribution didn't stop there, however. She lectured about the evils of slavery and taught many. She served in the Civil War as a nurse, a scout, and a spy. She founded a home for poor, sick, and needy black citizens.The Story of Harriet Tubman, Conductor of the Underground Railroad is an excellent book. I rate it Five Stars for readability, content, historical value, character training, biography, attention to historic detail, portrayal of an American woman, and truth.There are other books about Harriet Tubman, and one day I may read and love them all, but this book was the right book at the right time for the kids that I am presently working with.

Hate him or love him, you have to respect him.I am REALLY proud of my copy as, if you check the inside front cover, you will find it was a gift to somebody in 1947! A first edition.And his advice to the English people on how to protect their future?\\"They must breed faster, work harder, and probably live more simply, think more deeply, get rid of their snobbishness and their anachronistic class distinctions, and pay more attention to the world and less to their own backyard.

This outstanding and highly recommended interactive picturebook is enhanced with a guide for parents, &quot;Retelling Pictures, and factual information about hyenas."},{"Title":"How Hilda Hushed Her Hiccups: Letter-Sound Listen & Retell Adventure S","review":"I'm a music teacher for twenty years and after reading How Hilda Hushed Her Hiccups I decided to base my summer camp on this wonderful book! There's so much to see and learn that my students wanted me to read it every week! How Hilda Hushed Her Hiccups has won the 2001 Ben Franklin Award in the category of Teaching/Education. It's filled with hours of reading over and over again, lots of fun filled rhymes, searching for Harry the Hamster, and singing the Hilda songs and jingle that are presented on the CD. I would highly recommend this book for any child....I have not met one that didn't LOVE it!!!!"},{"Title":"How Hilda Hushed Her Hiccups: Letter-Sound Listen & Retell Adventure S","review":"Move over Berenstein Bears' AB&amp;C rhyming books and make way for How Hilda (a hyena) Hushed Her Hiccups:&quot;As she hopped and hiccuped and hiccuped and hopped, the hyenas around the Hair Hut must stopped! 'Help me,' cried Hilda, 'to stay on the ground! with these hiccuping hiccups I hop all around!' One hyena piped up, 'I know what to do! Try hopping on one leg and then hop on two.' 'Or this,' yelled another. 'Just try something neat. You could hang upside down with your head by your feet!'&quot;The beautifully drawn and delightfully bouncy story will give beginning readers and their parents the giggles while learning words that begin with the letter H. It also is accompanied by an audio CD with sound effects and songs. The next soon-to-be-published book (and CD) in the series is Finny (fish) Finds Friends in the Forest.It will be a while, though, before the Tinis and their talented non-sister staff complete the whole series of funny rhyming alphabet books. Teachers and school librarians will be happy to know that three of the five Tini sisters, the ones who established the Atori Publishing Company, have education degrees and classroom teaching experience. In fact, Mariellen Tini is currently an elementary school principal!I highly recommend this wonderful book to everyone!"},{"Title":"How Hilda Hushed Her Hiccups: Letter-Sound Listen & Retell Adventure S","review":"Hilda, a hyena, has the hiccups, and nothing seems to cure them. An adventure to Hiccup Land is Hilda's only hope for help in this first book by Atori Publishing. Children 3 to 7 years will enjoy the large, bold pictures and cute story. The professionally produced CD recording allows youngsters to read along as a narrator and three actors perform a zesty dramatization of the story. Also included are several upbeat and well-crafted songs, well suited for kids. The entertaining story stands on its own, but the authors provide several additional learning opportunities, including facts about hyenas and practice words that inlcude the letter &quot;H.&quot; This is the first in a new series entitled, &quot;Listen and Retell Adventures,&quot; in which fun and education are blended together with imagination and interactivity. An impressive debut."},{"Title":"Our Constitution and what it means","review":"This is the greatest book on learning the constituion the fast and easy way. Don't let the number of pages fool you it is jam packed with information on all their is to know about the constition. Let me warn you this is a beginners guide for people who don't know what the constitution is, not for law graduates. This is a helpful book if you are taking constitution classes of basic government in high school(not AP).Over all it is a great book."},{"Title":"The Dwarfs","review":"A well-established member of the Absurdist Theatre tradition, Pinter pulls no literary punches in this, his only novel. For those who know of his plays' stark ambiguity and pointed pointlessness, this novel will be nothing too new. Pinter is a man of thematic contradictions, someone who elucidates the morals and meanings of senseless with the tools of obsfucation and slyly crafted symbolism. He has a point -- he always does -- but those points are always disguised, usually as themselves, and so his work is never what it seems to be.You either have patience for Pinter, or you don't, and part of what most lovers of Pinter go for is the translation of his work onto the stage by living actors with some measure of skill. Pinter's work is of life, despite how surreal it always may seem, and it finds its greatest expression in the medium of flesh and blood.Therefore, this novel falls short in some ways, most notably in that it is only alive as much as the reader's own imagination is, and given the smoke screens and philosophical fogginess that permeates the text, it is likely that readers will run high on impatience before they do on understanding.However, for those careful and delicate literature lovers with the time and focus necessary for the task, Dwarfs is a densely layered and methodically crafted tale of common lust and betrayal mixed with some rather heavy-handed but finely wielded philosophy. Sometimes the writing delves into repetitious, monochromatic, self-aggrandizement, but this is usually just the knee-jerk aspect of Pinter's play-work marring the novelistic medium. In general though, he gains a lot of ground with this book, even if, by the time you're done reading, you're not sure where you've ended up."},{"Title":"Remember Me to My Father","review":"Nemec is one the most unappreciated fiction writers we have. Every one of his books is gutsy and passionate and full of strange twists. This book combines accurate, unsentimental pictures of growing up in the 50's in tight concentric circles with the drama and risk of breaking out of those circles into manhood."},{"Title":"Remember Me to My Father","review":"Fantastic novel! I read it once quickly and then had to reread it to savor the exquisite subtleties. It caught the trials and tribulations of a boy growing up in the mid-1950s perfectly. Ben's story brought back the poignancy of my high school years all too clearly: the yearning for those cute coeds that I was too painfully shy to talk to, much less ask for a date, and that secret longing for a mysterious older woman of the world who would initiate me into the wonders of manhood. Well done."},{"Title":"Remember Me to My Father","review":"Having grown up in the Cleveland area myself, I was partial to this book right away since it's set in a suburb of Cleveland. That in itself is what made me first pick up the book actually. But I think the story here will appeal to anyone who ever had to endure the trials and torments of adolescence (and of course we all do). Ben Farkas's portrait is painted in soft colors at first, but they soon darken. This turns out to be a very tense, gritty and powerful picture of a boy walking a tightrope across an emotional abyss. When he seemingly makes it safely to the other side at the book's end, it will bring a real sense of satisfaction to just about every reader I have to think. That was certainly true for this reader anyway."},{"Title":"Remember Me to My Father","review":"This is quite simply one of the best coming-of-age novels I've ever encountered, especially in its unique explorations of what it feels like to be a young athlete with good but not exceptional ability who has aspirations of stardom. The scenes between Ben and his father are so frank at times they're almost too painful to read. The author is also right on target in each and every relationship he depicts between Ben and a coach or a so-called &quot;male&quot; adviser."},{"Title":"101 best magic tricks","review":"This book contains most of the classic tricks that are in most books, although some stand out better than the others. It contains a fantastic introduction telling all the palming techneques, patter, and the atmosphere to put around a preformance. Also suggests what should be worn for boys and girls, which is unique for a book in this day in age."},{"Title":"The Proverbs: An introduction and commentary (The Tyndale Old Testament commentaries)","review":"Billed as a commentary, this book is more a collection of verse-by-verse textual notes. The first quarter of the book is devoted to an introduction to Proverbs and subject studies of its recurring themes -- God and Man, Wisdom, The Fool, The Sluggard, The Friend, Words, The Family, and Life and Death. The notes on the text itself are frequently insightful and helpful, but if you want an in-depth analysis of the text you should look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Proverbs: An introduction and commentary (The Tyndale Old Testament commentaries)","review":"I discovered this through reading a blog post by C.

The author is helpful in concluding functioning principles from the text and he always gives a scripture reference for his opinions (most the time more then one scripture, which I like). I have used this book consistently in my quiet times for a few months and it is helpful in getting God's perspective on topics as a whole, rather then reading a chapter in Proverbs and going from topic to topic."},{"Title":"The Proverbs: An introduction and commentary (The Tyndale Old Testament commentaries)","review":"This is an excellent commentary on the book of Proverbs.

This book is a handy and well-thought-out compendium of ideas and insights and suggestions that can make the early months of loss more manageable.The first chapter tackles the psychological: several compassionate stories are offered that make the complexities of mourning seem more \\"normal.\\" These men and women got through it, and thus, so can you. The rest of the chapters cover financial issues, taxes, social security, and so on, including some thoughts about funeral arrangements.Written by experts in their fields, these chapters offer up-to-date information and provide an excellent starting point for getting back on one's feet.

It relates the principles of marketing to real companies, such as Amazon.com, Coca-Cola, and Nabisco. It comes with a CD-ROM, but I didn't find it particularly helpful.

It is a very low cost investment, so if you find you dislike roleplaying you have only lost a few dollars as opposed to buying several books and dice sepratly which could cost you [more than the Amazon price]. This set comes with five color charecter sheets, one for each class. They are Barbarian, Paladin, Necromancer, Sorcereress and Amazon. There is a set of dice, all those you need to play. There are &quot;adventure tiles&quot;, which are essentially interlocking tiles which can help you form small dungeons to help your players visualise their enviorment. The book contains three small phamplets. One is a rules intro, one contains the monster statistics, the last is a book with a &quot;quest&quot; for the players to run through. Th Dungeon Master should only let the players see the rules book, the rest needs to be kept to himself to avoid spoiling the plot.Essentially the plot of the quest is to have the players retrieve the Butchers Cleaver. Yes the Butcher from the first diablo. There are new npcs. This adventure does not take place in Tristram from the first diablo, but rather a smaller town some distance away.The verdict: If your an experianced roleplayer: Pass on, maybe you should take a look at the AD&amp;D Diablo 2 book &quot;Diablo 2: the Awakining&quot;If you are new to pen and paper rpgs but have played Diablo: Definitly pick this up. It is an inexpensive intoduction to a great hobby.If you haven't played any kind of RPG: A maybe, if you are interested in RPG's you should gather a group of five friends and divide the cost of this between you. Make sure you have friends willing to play, as you don't want to but this book and not be able to play the game.Oh and by the way, this was supposed to come with minitures, but WOTC decided not to include them as it would drive the cost of this game up. Also, this product comes packaged with the collecters edition of the Diablo 2 game (its supposed to be around $60, only ten more then just the game and, it also has a soundtrak cd and a DVD with cinematic scenes from the game) No one knows when Diablo 2 the computer game will come out as blizzard is notorious form delays. So if you want this product you might as well pick it up now. And if you later buy the collectors edition, you can give the D&amp;D Adventure game to a pal, so more people can learn to play."},{"Title":"Diablo II Tabletop RPG Box Set (Dungeons & Dragons)","review":"I feel that experienced players should pass on this one. There are some minor adventures in here, so I suppose it can count as an adventure module of sorts rather than a box set.The most useful thing in this item is the dungeon cutouts. Using them is so much easier and quicker than having the players map the areas they explore on grid paper.Basically, the cutouts are generic illustrations of standard dungeon parts (30 Foot Hallway, 20 Foot Hallway, 30x20 Chamber, etc.) As the PCs explore you simply attach the parts to each other in Leggo-like fashion. Its actually quite workable and the art and detail on them is very good (for what it is).The Monster counters are simple cardstock punchouts. They're messy and you'll lose half of them in 2 weeks.You get a set of dice, so thats always nice. Unless you feel that some minor adventures and the dungeon cutouts are worth the price, don't get this item.But, I can agree with the Lothaire, its a good introduction to Diablo/AD&amp;D. Experienced players should think about it before purchasing."},{"Title":"Diablo II Tabletop RPG Box Set (Dungeons & Dragons)","review":"If you're an RPG veteran and want more info on the world of Diablo, get this book. If you love the computer game but want even more adventure (or want to run your own games), get this book. It's got everything you need to explore and adventure in the world of Diablo 2, using Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2nd Edition rules.I only wish that this (and D2 itself) had come out sooner. With D&amp;D Third Edition only one month away, the rules in this box set will quickly be outdated. Still, it's a good buy if you're: 1) staying with 2nd Ed 2) willing to convert the rules (WotC is publishing a conversion booklet) 3) Just want tons of cool background information about Diablo 2"},{"Title":"Diablo II Tabletop RPG Box Set (Dungeons & Dragons)","review":"A great game if:* You want a tabletop game but don't want to deal with RPG rules. This is very light and you don't even need to create a character.* You want some dungeon tiles and tokens.* You (or your party) is starting out with tabletop RPG's.Don't get it if:* You want a full DnD game* A lot of char-levels* Various monsters.For all of those you should get the other books (Awakening, Diablerie and To Hell and Back).The included materials are high quality even tough the tokens could be stiffer and bigger and the rules are easy to understand. Great for new players or collectors, not so good for people wanting to play a full game over a long period of time.The adventure itself ties nicely into the world and takes some ideas from both games so if you're a fan you should probably get this."},{"Title":"Life Like Dolls: The Collector Doll Phenomenon and the Lives of the Women Who Love Them","review":"Just for Dr. Robertson, this review is gonna ramble...This is the kind of book that makes serious anthropologists cringe. This is the kind of book that makes the &quot;hard science&quot; scientists make jokes about social &quot;scientists.&quot; I appreciate Dr. Robertson's attempt to appeal to the largest possible readership in order to sell the book, but, unfortunately, wandering around in the middle just made the book tedious, repetitive, rambling, poorly presented, and way too generalized. Instead of scientific conclusions (or even, methods) Dr. R. makes huge sweeping generalizations about what his little computer-generated statistics tell him! I was embarrassed for him. I understand that students were major contributors, so maybe I should keep that in mind. Congratulations, you can all say you are &quot;published&quot; contributors on your resumes now, through the kindness of Dr. Robertson. But, leaving the students out of it, Dr. Robertson often wandered off the subject (Porcelain Collector Dolls) into other areas and kinds of doll collecting, sometimes seeming to imply that other kinds of doll collecting are just as weird and demented as PCD collecting. Maybe so, but other kinds of doll collecting should have waited for another book, instead of muddying the water in this volume, generalizing, summarizing, pontificating, and just making the book an exasperating trial to read. That said, I do think the subject is a fascinating one, and I think the manufacturers would be even more fun to study! When I first started working in antique and vintage doll repair, my first response to the PCD's I saw in doll magazines was the same one Dr. Robertson most often encountered outside of the PCD collecting &quot;world:&quot; Eeeee-ee-eew; nauseating; weird! Who could be collecting these dolls? Well, now I know who they are, and that could have been summarized in an essay. After checking out some of those dolls at doll shows, I began to think about their usefulness in the Los Angeles area carpool lanes. Hmmm...might be worth the investment, but would I be strangely compelled to keep buying them?? Have a trunk full? More in carseats in the back? I doubt it. I don't exactly fit the &quot;profile,&quot; and don't collect PCD's, although I am the &quot;right&quot; age and I do have a few other kinds of dolls lying around the house. I've never felt the &quot;empty nest&quot; syndrome (who first made that up, anyway?) -- I was thrilled when I finally had more time and a spare room to use for my avocation repairing dolls. I also think it's telling to note that the most often quoted sources in the book are both very out of date; why Dr. R. used studies from 1896 (Hall and Ellis) and Freud, who isn't even in the bibliography, and who no one takes seriously anymore anyway, is really beyond me. I was mildly entertained by Dr. Robertson's discussion of &quot;hyperreality,&quot; but it was just one among many concepts he was handing out as scientific fact. It's fine to hypothesize and speculate, but he forgot to tell us that the WHOLE BOOK is a hypothesis with a lot of speculation thrown in! This is what my mathematician husband calls &quot;telling stories!&quot; God help anyone who believes this information hook, line, and sinker! The frequency charts in the appendix were really disappointing and will go over the heads of most readers; why didn't he just use bar graphs? Chapter 8 was the best, most organized, and most interesting section in the book; I wish I'd read it first and saved myself a lot of time."},{"Title":"Life Like Dolls: The Collector Doll Phenomenon and the Lives of the Women Who Love Them","review":"this was a horrible book first of all i just turned 14 and i have been collecting porcelin dolls since i was 5 years old and this idiot is trying to say that doll collectors have mental problems...this book really distured and upset me when i read it lkast year and it made every one who know that i collect dolls think that i have pervesed tendencies if i could give it 0 stars i most certainly would"},{"Title":"Life Like Dolls: The Collector Doll Phenomenon and the Lives of the Women Who Love Them","review":"Doll collecting is a fun, enjoyable, innocent, creative, and time-honored hobby.

By the way, men collect dolls (and I don't mean action figures) too.100% trashy psychobabble with no substance."},{"Title":"Life Like Dolls: The Collector Doll Phenomenon and the Lives of the Women Who Love Them","review":"As a doll collector myself, I had good motivation to buy and read this book. The area of focus, however, is on baby, or child like dolls, and I have little interest in these. As it was published in 2004, I was expecting more about fashion and icon dolls, but there was almost nothing. The author also concentrated his efforts on what he referred to as PCDs, meaning porcelain doll collectors. There are many other mediums available and currently in use in the manufacture of collector dolls, which makes them more durable and more versatile, but this was barely mentioned.It seemed like this book was written by someone or persons who had no personal appreciation of doll collecting, and the material seems dated. I would have liked to see pictures and interviews with collectors, maybe even a chapter on designers.The author made vague illusions to fear of dolls, but otherwise, the information within the book was informative, and did seem accurate, albeit, somewhat dated."},{"Title":"Life Like Dolls: The Collector Doll Phenomenon and the Lives of the Women Who Love Them","review":"This book occupies a strange position between popular nonfiction and academic writing: It's a well-researched, careful study of porcelain collectors' dolls and the women who collect them, but it's written in a way that is very personal and immediate. It caused me to look at my own collecting behaviors in a new way. The conclusion could reach further, but otherwise I found the entire book surprisingly fascinating. If you're interested in anthropological research, women's studies, consumerism, toys, dolls, human evolution, geriatrics, family studies, or art, then consider this book. It will start you thinking, and you'll never flip past the doll ads in magazines again without taking a close look."},{"Title":"Parisian Sketches (Dedalus European Classics)","review":"Pre A Rebours, this series of meticulously detailed vignettes conjures up not merely images, but, more enticingly, the tastes, sounds and smells of the rampant Paris of the 1870's. From the burlesque of the Follies-Bergere to the melancholy of a Parisian bus ride, the reader can drain the absinthe from an unattended glass, or smudge the generously applied make-up of a cigarette girl or a lascivious whore. For every odour of affordable perfume, there is the smell of a sweaty armpit, for every pair of pretty ankles, there is the less becoming sight of a pair of tattered shoes or a stained dress. Indeed, Huysmans descriptive indulgences is the scintillating genius of a pure prose artist, where any plot or morality have been tossed from the window of a poplar inn, into the stagnant, stinking pools of the dried up Bievre.But only a gross misreading would label the work of Huysmans as that of a man fascinated only with decadent whims and amoral extravagances. An admirable thinker, Huysmans impressions of the shameless and grotesque weekend excesses of his fellow Parisians cannot fail to call to mind our own even more rotten contemporary society.This series of sketches represents a Huysmans who still held within him love/hate fascination with Parisian life, before he would turn his back on Paris, and Zola's naturalist movement, in A Rebours and the guidebook like novels charting the adventures of Durtal, his alter ego. If these Parisian Sketches are Baudelairean in one sense, where beauty and pleasure are drawn from deviance and repugnance, and the city dweller's manipulation of nature in order to match his bloated requirements evokes his own beautiful downfall, they just as easily evoke the colourful world of Renoir and Monet. They are impressions that precede the delight of Jean Renoir's \\"French Can-Can\\" as much as the bourgeois hypocrisies of Bunuel's \\"Belle de Jour\\".Peppered with the original illustrations throughout , this volume is translated with subtlety by Brendan King and is a must for admirers of Huymans' work."},{"Title":"Parisian Sketches (Dedalus European Classics)","review":"\\"Parisian Sketches\\" is worth the paperback cost simply for the chapter that spends a few pages discussing the various erotic odors emanating from the underarms of Parisian grisettes.

Not only are suggestions made on how to improve the soil, but also what *not* to do. Specific, real world examples are given. Some techniques take time, so do not expect overnight solutions. Unless, of course, you haul in 12\\" of new top soil.*** AmendedWhile the minimum of 50% sand used in this booklet is the most common figure I have found, NCSU's Urban Horticultural Note #3 advises at least 70% sand for their clay soils. They also suggest using pea gravel, roughly 3/8\\", instead. It doesn't lead to compaction like sand in lower quantities can."},{"Title":"Gardening in Clay Soil: Storey's Country Wisdom Bulletin A-140 (Storey Publishing Bulletin ; a-140)","review":"This bulletin is pretty short, as all Storey's Country Wisdom Bulletins are. If you are looking for a thorough, complete, exhaustive guide, glance at the page count for this booklet and move along.That said, there's a lot of useful information in this book. It discusses the various soil amendments you can use to change the texture of your soil, including how they'll affect the soil pH and how often you'll need to re-apply them. (And yes, it does say that one option is to truck in a whole new layer of top soil, because it is one way to deal with the problem, but it also mentions how expensive that would be.) It also discusses when and how to work with the soil to avoid turning your yard into a giant brick.One thing i didn't like, though, was the suggestion to grow things like mint in order to break up the soil. The author suggests that you can simply pull the mint out when you're ready to plant something else there, but in my experience, getting rid of mint is much harder than that."},{"Title":"Gardening in Clay Soil: Storey's Country Wisdom Bulletin A-140 (Storey Publishing Bulletin ; a-140)","review":"I have some serious clay in our yard where I want to grow the garden so I am looking forward to implementing the tips from this book.

I'm surprised that moving to an area with better soil wasn't a suggestion as well."},{"Title":"Day of the Dead","review":"I have read this book to my 6 year-old daughter ab out a dozen times in the last 2 weeks. The colorful and rich illustrations are awe-inspiring and capture the spiritual side of this Mexican holiday. The story reflects the anticipation of the children as their parents prepare for this day of feasting and honoring passed souls.Another plus in this book is the use of the Spanish language. Scattered throughout the book in short phrases, the words can be interpreted by context for the non-speaker.I love this book and so does my daughter. We live near the border of Mexico and can attest to the fact that it is culturally accurate and reflects the Mexican culture in a beautiful way.

The narrative of the story leads the reader from the preparations for the fiesta all the way through the procession and celebration.

Peyton and earned her the Carnegie Medal. Suitable for teens, it is still a fascinating story for adults (it is one of my favorites). This is the story of a young English woman in the years right before, and during the start of, WWI when women's roles were changing and aviation was starting to take off so to speak. Read &quot;Flambards&quot; first and &quot;Flambards in Summer&quot; after &quot;Edge of the Cloud&quot; for the whole story. Years later Peyton wrote &quot;Flambards Divided&quot; as a sequel to the trilogy. In the 1980s Yorkshire Television and PBS aired a series based upon the Flambards trilogy, leading to renewed interest in the books, which were first published in the 1960s. Get comfy -- once you start reading this book you'll not want to put it down!"},{"Title":"The edge of the cloud (New Windmill Series)","review":"I'm one of the people who stumbled across the book after watching the the mini-series on PBS way back in the early 80's as a child. Like the other reviewer states, this book works best when read in the order of the trilogy, Flambards, The Edge of the Cloud, Flambards in Summer, and for a finale Flambards Divided. It tells the story of a young girl, Christina, in the years directly leading up to the First World War. Aviation was still in its infancy, and plays a major part in this installment of K.M. Peyton's trilogy as it centers around Christina and her fiance/ cousin William.The book is really more of a coming of age story than its predessor, Flambards. Flambards pretty much covered the gamut of childhood and the threshold of young adulthood, this story actually has the characters dealing with real world adult issues of being more or less on their own for the first time.It's a great book, a wonderful series, and I highly recommend this to readers of any age."},{"Title":"Wilderstein and the Suckleys: A Hudson River Legacy","review":"If you are interested in this sort of thing, it is a really enjoyable read with plenty of illustrations.

Its story is excitingly told in this Osprey 'Aviation Elite Units' volume by John Weal.JG 52's initial combats in 1940 showed little promise of the great victories to come. By December 1940 the wing had claimed 177 kills, losing 53 pilots in the Battle of Britain alone. The invasion of Russia in June 1941 was the catalyst that transformed JG 52 from second-stringers to topguns. Flying the superlative Bf 109F, JG 52 pilots like Adolf Dickfeld, Gunther Rall, Hermann Graf, 'Macki' Steinhoff and Gerhard Koppen decimated their poorly-trained, -equipped and -led opponents, scores mounting at incredible rates.In May 1942 Graf became the first JG 52 flier to score 100 kills. By September he had downed 150. In December Gerhard Barkhorn scored his 100th; JG 52's cumulative total topping 4,000 kills! Almost unnoticed was the arrival, in October, of a skinny, blond-haired replacement named Erich Hartmann, destined to be the world's most successful fighter ace.As the tide turned against Germany in Russia, scores continued to climb. Though the wing was awash in high-scoring Experten, the Rall-Barkhorn-Hartmann trio assumed the catbird seat in late 1943 and dominated the wing's final years on the Eastern Front. The high scores came at a cost with Experten and tyros alike falling to a resurgent Russian Air Force. By war's end JG 52 downed almost 1/4 of ALL Russian aircraft lost to Luftwaffe fighters, an incredible accomplishment yet one supported by documentation.Given the huge canvas of JG 52 operations and space limitations, Weal's history can only provide an overview. The amount of detail provided is nevertheless impressive, Weal touching upon on the exploits of many of JG 52's topguns. He also contributes 10 pages of color profiles. One hundred and twenty photographs depict personnel and aircraft.Weal's book is a great introduction to some of history's deadliest fighter pilots!"},{"Title":"Jagdgeschwader 52: The Experten (Aviation Elite Units)","review":"Very good documentary of JG52. Great historical timeline coverage and photos. I found this a great reference for modeling as well."},{"Title":"Jagdgeschwader 52: The Experten (Aviation Elite Units)","review":"Excellent coverage of this well know unit of the Luftwaffe. Typical of the Osprey format in their series of military subjects. Very informative and this book is exactly what I expected. Color plates are superb."},{"Title":"Jagdgeschwader 52: The Experten (Aviation Elite Units)","review":"This book provides a very good history of Jagdeschwader 52 on the tactical level but almost none on the strategic level. However, considering this is the history of one specific airwing, as opposed to a class of aircraft (the author, Weal, has written many of the Osprey series books on specific aircraft in different theaters of the war [Stukas during the early war period]) or history of an entire airforce this is too much of a problem.The book also has many photos from Weal's personal collection of Luftwaffe photos. These you will see no where else. In addition, there are many color plates that provide a useful background for model builders on different camaflauge schemes and flight monickers. These plates, along with the photos (many of which provide closeup photos of aircraft and crews) can prove very valuable to model builders. The only weakness of the book, in terms of illustrations, is the fact there are no color plates on pilots and their flying kits. Hence for figurine builders not a very good reference.One weakness of the book is the lack of analysis of the factors that contributed so much to the 52's success. Was it recruitment? Morale? Training? Ground support? Did the wing have the pick of the Luftwaffe's pilots? The book leaves unanswered the question of why this wing was so successful. This is especially considering that so many of its members (i.e., Hartmann, the ace who downed about 352 aircraft) started their careers so late in the war."},{"Title":"Christianity and Feminism in Conversation","review":"The book do.es a great job of helping women find their spiritual self.

Meticulously well done it is the only good history of the 1948 war, a masterpiece that is unfortunately only half completed. It details struggles, debates, raids and ambushes in the most honest and fair manner, using concrete evidence without bias and without politics. This book should be required reading for the Israeli-Arab conflict, however it is often brushed over to more easy to read shorter histories of the 1948 war. However despite this many volumed length of the project this is a grasping and exciting read, drawing on military and political topics, discussing minorities and often unheard of events. All students of the middle east and Israel and military history will enjoy this.Volume II covers the period between November 29th, 1947 the partition resolution and the end of the Mandate, April 15th 1948.Seth J.

Always in the background is the spectre of arrest, punishment, and death at the hands of an uncompromising, unforgiving, remorseless, ever-growing State. Regulation, corruption, favoritism are the watchwords. And it all started with an elected government strongly supported and contributed to by big business. Could happen right here in this country. Sure could."},{"Title":"The Vampire Economy: Doing Business Under Fascism","review":"Gunter Reimann's book The Vampire Economy provides a look into how business/government relations were conducted under the new regime of fascism. Reimann describes how the state took control of the natural resources of the country and through establishing a massive bureaucracy the government would decide who to allocate the resources to by picking the winners/losers in economic affairs. The new resource allocation methods by the state took months for orders to be fulfilled, massive amounts of paperwork had to be filed which traveled through several government agencies just to determine whether you would be accepted or denied. The new system required business to hire contact men who had connections with various levels of government departments which meant that the more money you had the better chances you would have at hiring a good contact man you could get your needed resources approved by the state. Businesses were given quotas to fulfill and if you failed the party would force you to resign your position and a party leader would take over your business. Private property was allowed under the fascism government on the condition that you were serving the state and not your private self-interest, which was seen as greedy and punishable under the law. According to Reimann the government established massive bureaucracies, regulations, restrictive trade policies. You lived in an environment of fear not knowing who was loyal to the party one complaint against the new system could get you removed and jailed. The Nazi government engineered an interesting trade policy with many South American and poor European nations. First, the Germans practiced currency manipulations, producing a special currency (I forgot the name) and used those to purchase imports from South America. The \\"special currency\\" issued to South America was only redeemable in Marks which forced the South Americans to purchase German manufactured goods at higher prices. When the markets crashed many Americans focused on internal developments, and the South American countries needed an export market which they found with Germany who manipulated the South Americans in the trading practice. There is more in this book than what I discussed and its an interesting book on an intersting topic. Overall it's book dealing with the way business was conducted under fascism."},{"Title":"Sacred Narrative: Readings in the Theory of Myth","review":"This book is a collection of essays on various theories and interpretive approaches to mythology. The editor, Alan Dundes, has compiled a broad range of studies that provide early approaches to theorizing myth-making and then moves into relatively recent approaches to myth. The essays are well-chosen, and they are linked together by Dundes' well-written introductions. Dundes is a fine folklorist, and his thorough grounding in the history of folklore study provides an excellent resource for placing the essays into a useful intellectual framework for learning about myth. Some of the essays are classics, and Dundes provides fair as well as critical appraisals of the various approaches used by the essayists. This compilation is essential for anyone interested in mythology as well as anyone interested in religious history and the social sciences."},{"Title":"Sacred Narrative: Readings in the Theory of Myth","review":"For readers interested in learning about myth, this book is a great starting point.

This volume is thoroughly grounded in serious scholarship, and it fairly presents a range of issues and approaches. When Dundes offers criticism, it's done with intelligence and insight, and he provides ample evidence to back his claims.

She was very helpful and I apperciate all she did for me."},{"Title":"Lewis Cass (American statesmen)","review":"Lewis Cass is one of the strangest biographies I have ever read. Only rarely in the book is Lewis Cass the center of the narrative. After reading the book, I still do not know if Lewis Cass was ever married or had a family. I know very little about his personality or disposition. I know only about his public career and some of the public issues with which he was involved during his long public career. Cass is presented almost exclusively through his public actions, statements and writings.His public career is quite a story in itself. This native of New Hampshire move west into Ohio in time for Cass to become a general in the War of 1812, fighting on the front between Detroit and what is now Ontario. He then stayed in Michigan where he served 18 years as territorial governor.Having grown into a National Statesman, Cass later served Andrew Jackson as Secretary of War, followed by a term as Ambassador to France. Upon to his return to the United States, Cass was a serious candidate for the Democratic nomination for President in 1844 before a deadlocked convention turned to James K. Polk. Four years later, Cass won the nomination, only to lose the election to Gen. Zachary Taylor, a loss which, according to the book, was probably attributable to the candidacy of former President Martin Van Buren on the Free Soil Ticket.Presidential politics being behind him, Cass served two terms as Michigan's Senator until the rise of the Republican party swept him out of the Senate and into the cabinet President Buchanan's as Secretary of State. It was from this position that Cass watched the dissolution of the country as well as the cabinet in the waning days of that administration.Returning to Michigan, Cass supported the cause of national unity until his death in 1866.The most interesting thing about this book is the literary style in which it is written. Throughout the book, Cass is portrayed as a righteous character opposed by a series of villainous figures toward whom attention is directed in the particular sections of the book. Prominent among these are General Hull of the War of 1812, Andrew Jackson and James Buchanan. The general style is to relate a particular aspect of history and then allude to the public role which Cass played in it.During the section on the War of 1812, Cass' position is contrasted favorably with that of Gen. Hull who is treated most roughly in the narrative. In the section on Cass' governorship of the Wisconsin territory, most of the attention is directed to the French inhabitants who occupied the territory at the start of Cass' tenure. A contrast is drawn the French, who are presented as happy but unambitious, and Cass who introduced American initiative and drive into the territory and, thereby, advanced it into the Western powerhouse which it became.The section on his service in Jackson's cabinet portrays Jackson in a very unfavorable light, while praising Cass. Cass' service as Minster to France is presented most favorably.Cass' Senate years were dominated primarily by the issues of slavery which were gradually tearing the nation apart. Cass is portrayed as the creator of the doctrine of Popular Sovereignty in which the voters of each territory would be permitted to decide the issue of slavery for itself. Swipes are taken at Stephen A. Douglas who is popularly remembered as the advocate of that position. The conclusion of the Senate service is seen against the backdrop of the swing of the Northwest from its tradition allegiance to the Democracy (Democratic Party) to the new Republican party which would soon sweep the area and the country into Civil War.The service in Buchanan's cabinet is used to present the deterioration of the country as well as Buchanan's feeble efforts to deal with the problem.The style of writing is shockingly judgmental in its treatment of the public figures portrayed in the book. While modern readers may expect to see facts presented in a way as to portray figures in favorable or unfavorable lights, we rarely expect to see the conclusions presented by strong and extreme adjectives.What real value there is in this book is its portrayal of the general history of the times and places in which Cass played his roles in the nation's drama as portrayed in the 1890s. It is in seeing our history from through the 1890s eyes of the author that we can take the greatest lessons from this book."},{"Title":"Oxford Business English: Grammar & Practice","review":"Grammar and Practice is an excellent text for teaching English as a second language to business persons who are serious about studying English.

In the early 1980s, after over fifty years of economic decline and a significant loss of population, McCormick was featured in US News as one of a number small towns likely to disappear. This prediction proved overly pessimistic and McCormick has survived to become a significant stop on the Palmetto state's Heritage Corridor. Ken Fortenberry's book highlights an interim period in the town's fortunes during the mid-1980s. As editor and owner of the town newspaper, the McCormick Messenger, Fortenberry found himself literally under fire when he started to print the details of some of the shadier goings-on in the local Sheriff's department. Kill the Messenger follows the Fortenberry family's fortunes throughout their brief period of residence in McCormick, in the process revealing a deep-rooted corruption in the social and political fabric of the town. The book is a quick read, written in a journalistic style aptly suited to the subject matter. In its description of the town and some the local charcaters, Fortenberry pulls no punches and the book's impact is still felt in the town. Unlike Savannah's Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, you won't find this particular book featuring as the centrepiece of a literary tour and you won't find too many people willing to sit down and discuss 'the book' with either. However, Fortenberry's book does have a certain morbid fascination with the local population, as the McCormick County library can't keep a copy on the shelves - over a dozen have been stolen to date! Indeed, perhaps this acts as the strongest recommendation for Kill the Messenger."},{"Title":"KILL THE MESSENGER: One Man's Fight Against Bigotry and Greed","review":"While I agree with a number of the comments made by the first reviewer here, I would like to add a number of further observations that I think lend extra value to Fortenberry's text. In his portrait of McCormick, Fortenberry pays particular attention to the subject of education. McCormick is rigidly divided along lines of race and this is reflected in the schools. The more affluent whites are warehoused in the lamentable Long Cane Academy, which survives on the display of teenage flesh in hopelessly outmoded 'beauty pageants' and door-to-door ticket sales for BBQ and alike. The county's majority black population attend the crumbling public school system, the appearance of which more befits a gulag than an educational facility. The County had opportunity to change this situation through a school bond referendum earlier this year, however, the aging white residents of Savannah Lakes Village - a 'Gone With the Wind' and golf themed retirement complex/special tax haven newly built on the County's lakeside border - voted against the bond and set back educational progress another 15 years. Fortenberry's book highlights the root of this apathy and spiritual corruption. His portrait of a community hopelessly divided along the colour line is spot on and little has changed in 15 years. Perhaps it is time to re-read Kill the Messenger and take some decisive action."},{"Title":"KILL THE MESSENGER: One Man's Fight Against Bigotry and Greed","review":"McCormick is nothing like the book says it is. My dad grew up in that small town and everybody knows everybody. It's a small friendly town. Fortenberry is a journalist that doesn't have anything better to do than ruin pople's lives. He even wanted to make a movie out of the book. I just wanted to say that this book portrays the small town of McCormick as a town that is still in the civil war and that is divided. The book is nothing like real life!"},{"Title":"Police for the Future (Studies in Crime and Public Policy)","review":"In the book, Police for the Future, David Bayley provides a systematic assessment of the performance of the police institution as a whole in preventing crime, concluding that the police-as they are currently constituted-do not prevent crime. His study was based on primary research, personal interviews, and first hand observation in five countries: Australia, Canada, Great Britain, Japan, and the United States. Bayley analyzes what police are accomplishing in modern democratic societies, and asks whether police organizations are using their resources effectively to prevent crime. In particular, he assesses some of the major obstacles to effective crime prevention, describes some of the reforms currently being tested by the police, and explains the choices that modern societies have with respect to creating effective police forces. In his concluding chapter, Bayley describes and advocates some new and unique roles for the police force. First, he recommends creating ! a new job title for police-\\"The Neighborhood Police Officer.\\" The neighborhood police officer, or NPO for short, would become what the general practitioner is to the field of medicine. Accordingly, Bayley envisions NPOs being employed as extensively as conventional patrol officers (Bayley, pp. 146). The main focus of their work would be to diagnose and solve community problems. An NPO's performance would thus be \\"evaluated in terms of his or her knowledge of local needs and ability to formulate plans that lead to a reduction of those needs\\" (ibid., pp. 148). Second, Bayley calls for major changes in the current organizational structure of the police. In particular, he argues that \\"Basic Police Units\\" should be created-which he defines as \\"the smallest full-service territorial command unit of a police force\\" (ibid., pp. 152). BPUs would determine \\"what resources localities require, stock them for use, and oversee their coordinated deployment\\" (ibid. pp. 152). These d! ecentralized units would focus on crime and disorder at the! local level and not be held accountable for anything more. Finally, professor Bayley would like to see the occupational expectations of upper management significantly reconstructed. Commanders should be thinking about the \\"big picture\\" and avoiding micro-management. Some of the skills that they would need are: a knowledge of what is going on in their organization, an awareness of potential problems, the ability and propensity to propose and initiate reforms, a strong emphasis on program evaluation, the ability to adjust to new organizational practices, and the motivation to encourage a culture supportive of crime prevention. And effective crime prevention, Bayley concludes, will require police systems to be stratified according to function, performance indicators, and accountability (ibid., pp. 159)."},{"Title":"Acting One","review":"The First Six lessons--goal and obstacle, the other, tactics, expectation, and their summary &quot;GOTE&quot; -- are excellent and concise.

This imitation version of Footprints poem authored by Powers was never listed anonymously by her in any form anywhere. Margaret did not publish in 1964, so that statement about the book is untrue. Apparently Margaret Fishback Powers decided to become an evangalist only 25 years ago, this poem was written in 1963 by a different author whose work reflects it's anonymous authorship at the U.S. Copyright Office. What bothers me most about this book is Margaret only quotes scripture, she never authors poetry. Think about that people, doesn't a poet write poetry! Margaret does not author poetry, therefore in my opinion I think she is only interested in taking claim to someelses work, namely mine.

(Bollingen Series XXXV.2)","review":"THE NUDE: A STUDY IN IDEAL FORM, a classic investigation and summation, is one of scholar/historian Kenneth Clark's finest works - and that is high powered praise in view of all of his contributions to literature. Few writers inform with such dignity of prose, style, and warmth as Clark and THE NUDE is no exception. This handsome and illuminating volume dates back to 1953 and is based on six lectures given by Clark for the A. W. Mellon Lectures in Fine Arts at the National Gallery in Washington, DC. Clark opens his book with a lyrical treatise \\"The Naked and the Nude\\" in which he not only introduces his manner of examining the use of the nude as pictorial image for artists from ancient Greece through the Renaissance to the present, he wraps his scholarly information with personalized psychosocial commentary that is uniquely his own and allows the reader to settle in for the exploration ahead.Approaching first the male nude [\\"Apollo\\"] from the Kouros of 600 BC through the vases, sculptures, reliefs, and paintings from all periods of history, he then moves to two views of the female nude - Venus I [the celestial female form] and Venus II [the woman of earthly form]. Having laid the foundation for the use of the nude in general, he then addresses the artistic emotions of Pathos, Energy, and Ecstasy in a manner that is near novel-like in reading. He closes his lecture series/book with a thought-provoking discussion of how man has viewed the nude through history, vacillating between laud and honor to the depiction of guilt, of the human stain. And finally he demonstrates in \\"The Nude As An End In Itself\\" both the occult appropriation of repeated forms and the acknowledged plagiarism of the nude studies from the earliest to the current. The Book is generously illustrated but in the paperback version available the illustrations are in black and white only. This profound and warmly human book is a must for artists and art lovers alike. Highly Recommended. And as is so often the case, Amazon.com does its readers a great service by finding ways to make books of such importance as this available to the public."},{"Title":"The Nude: A Study in Ideal Form.

The writing is so well done, one might accidently read right over the meaning in the haste of seeing what will come next.If you're the highlighting or underlining type, I'd recommend saving such marking for the second read as more of the true significance bubbles to the fore.

He has such an appreciation for the nude in art, and he has seen and thought about so much art, Possible reasons someone might not love this book. ...the illustrations are in black and white, not every art work that he mentions is illustrated. (he expects you to know what he is talking about). His dividing the nude up into different types . . .ecstatic, energy, pathos, etc is a little artificial. I really like being exposed to someone's strong responses and discriminating eye."},{"Title":"The Nude: A Study in Ideal Form. (Bollingen Series XXXV.2)","review":"It is my opinion that Kenneth Clark's THE NUDE should be in every artist's library. If I taught figure drawing, this would be required reading for my students. It is a history of the nude in art, but Mr. Clark was clever not to tell the story in a chronological way. He describes the evolution of the nude from the sculptures of the gods to the emotions that the nude represents; emotions such as energy, pathos, and ecstasy. It is not just history, however. There are essays on the difference between \\"nude\\" and \\"naked.\\" Mr. Clark talks about the nude and Christianity and the nude as an end in itself. This is also an excellent book for those who work as artist's models.

The best part of the book is the photographs and the design. It is a labor of love in that respect.The text (seven homilies) is a bit thin. I would have liked more information about his life and more testimonials from his spiritual children, like the Fr. Arseny book, rather than so many details about his incorrupt state. It's a nice introduction, however, and will motivate you to learn more about his life and seek St. John's intercessions."},{"Title":"Organ Works","review":"Johann Jakob Froberger was a master of keyboard music. This collection, a Dover reprint, contains dozens of toccatas, ricercari, fantasias and capriccios, all beautifully engraved and readable at either piano (harpsichord) or organ. All the pieces are set in two staff notation and for the most part can be played at the piano. There are a very few instances where a foot pedal of the organ would be helpful where a large reach in the left hand occurs, but 99% of the music is realizable on the piano. In those rare instances, a rolled chord will suffice on the piano, not so on the harpsichord. This music, incidentally, sounds beautiful on the modern piano.I was particularly surprised, since this was my first exposure to Froberger's keyboard music in any quantity, at the great creative variety and awesome invention in these pieces. Much early baroque music has been overlooked, in my opinion, due to the overwhelming productivity and creative genius of late baroque composers like JS Bach, Domenico Scarlatti, and Handel. But more and more 17th century keyboard music is making its way into affordable reprints. The period was one of great importance in the evolution of baroque music and deserves much greater attention than it has received to date.I cannot recommend this volume highly enough."},{"Title":"Organ Works","review":"Here's what's in it:TOCCATASToccata I in A MinorToccata II in D MinorToccata III in G MajorToccata IV in C MajorToccata V in D Minor\\"(\\"Da sonarsi alla Levatione\\")\\"Toccata VI in G Minor\\"(\\"Da sonarsi alla Levatione\\")\\"Toccata VII in G MajorToccata VIII in E MinorToccata IX in C MajorToccata X in F MajorToccata XI in E MinorToccata XII in A MinorToccata XIII in E MinorToccata XIV in G MajorToccata XV in G MinorToccata XVI in C MajorToccata XVII in G MajorToccata XVIII in F MajorToccata XIX in D MinorToccata XX in A MinorToccata XXI in D MajorToccata XXII in C MajorToccata XXIII in D MinorToccata XXIV in A MinorToccata XXV in F MajorFANTASIASFantasia I* in C Major\\"(\\"sopra Ut, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La\\")\\"Fantasia II in A MinorFantasia III in F MajorFantasia IV in G Major\\"(\\"sopra Sol, La, Re\\")\\"Fantasia V in A MinorFantasia VI in A MinorFantasia VII in G MajorFantasia VIII in D MinorCANZONASCanzona I on DCanzona II in G MinorCanzona III on FCanzona IV on GCanzona V on G[?]Canzona VI in A MinorCAPRICCIOSCapriccio I in G MajorCapriccio II in A MinorCapriccio III in D MinorCapriccio IV on FCapriccio V in G MinorCapriccio VI on G[?]Capriccio VII in G MajorCapriccio VIII in G MinorCapriccio IX in G MajorCapriccio X on DCapriccio XI on D[?]Capriccio XII in F MajorCapriccio XIII on ECapriccio XIV on ECapriccio XV in F MajorCapriccio XVI in F MajorCapriccio XVII in A MinorCapriccio XVIII in C MajorRICERCARESRicercare I in C MajorRicercare II on GRicercare III in F MajorRicercare IV on G[?]Ricercare V in G MinorRicercare VI in C-sharp MinorRicercare VII on DRicercare VIII in G MinorRicercare IX on ERicercare X on G[?]Ricercare XI in D MinorRicercare XII in F-sharp MinorRicercare XIII in C MajorRicercare XIV in D Minor"},{"Title":"US College & University Reference Map: Over 1300 top colleges in the US and Canada","review":"My only criticism of this map is that there were a few four-year schools which were missed.

The writing is fairly academic, though not techincal. I usually enjoy systematic theology that has an air of devotion and awe as it expounds upon God, His ways, etc. So no bad mark on Bosma for not recounting Reformed doctrine in a more worshipful, expressive tone; but on the same token, no extra points for writing with the head and the heart.All in all, for 2 or 3 bucks, this isn't a bad buy. I believe Christians should be students of theology, this resource aids in that venture. Bosma hits the staple systematic theology areas: sources of knowledge, God, man, Christ, salvation, and Church, before presenting particular Reformed beliefs on means of grace (infant baptism among them). He naturally closes with the doctrine of the last things. In total, it's about 300 pages of good theology (allowing for non-essential differences and preference in the Sacraments). Bosma also included a handy topical index and an English-Holland dictionary of key terms in the back (something I've never seen in a systematic).Also, this 1927 edition has a very interesting gloss finish on the hardcover, which I found unique and appealing. Good font and type size too: easy on the eyes."},{"Title":"Keeping It Living: Traditions of Plant Use and Cultivation on the Northwest Coast of North America","review":"A text tightly packed with information and concepts.

It's a pretty simple tortoise-and-hare story, where \\"Little Red\\" (driven by Brother Bear) \\"putt-putt-putts\\" along while the bigger, louder, arrogant cars foil each other with their meanness and over-confidence. Red eventually wins the race, to the great delight of the bears and my son.I've used this book to teach all kinds of things, from rhyming to colors (the cars are red, orange, yellow, green, and blue) to counting (\\"four big cars\\") to prepositions (\\"over, under, around, and through\\") to social concepts like persistence, kindness, fairness, and self-assurance. And it's got some great vocabulary that your little ones are unlikely to encounter anywhere else.

But To a God Unknown is not only my favorite Steinbeck book, it is my favorite fiction book of all time. And it is shorter (a novella) and has fewer characters than either Eden or Wrath. As a result, the story is straight forward, but beautifully conveyed:Joseph, the protaganist, successfully begins his life anew after moving across the continent to California. He works hard. His farm is prospering. He is happy and satisfied. Until, that is, his siblings and their families follow him and move nearby. One brother, who is overtly religious, is troubled because he believes Joseph \\"worships\\" a tree on Joseph's property. The brother stuns Joseph by cutting down the tree, leading to dire consequences.If you've avoided Steinbeck in the past, this novella is a good place to start. A wonderful book.As an aside, I've always believed that the many (not all) of the titles of Steinbeck and Hemingway books are wonderful, and this is one example - To a God Unknown. Also consider titles such as The Winter of Our Discontent, For Whom the Bell Tolls, Death in the Afternoon, etc."},{"Title":"To a God Unknown (Bantam books)","review":"This was a book that made me think thus appreciate what the earth is really about. The descriptions that J.S. used to describe the land and attitudes towards life were indeed beautiful. Simply, the metaphors in the book are what make it so great. The contrasting of ideas and the usage of biblical names for characters with non-christian beliefs sets the tone of the brilliant book.

This book, however, needs no favoritism towards its author on my part. A multifacited tale with description transcending any other underlies a plot so strong and powerful that the novel sticks with you and overshadows all others."},{"Title":"To a God Unknown (Bantam books)","review":"I opened this book for the first time - one of the few Steinbeck novels I had not yet read - shortly after completing my own first attempt at writing a novel. The little book is one of Steinbeck's earliest published works and, interestingly enough, the one that took him the longest to complete. It was in this context that I found the book most provoking: myself an aspiring writer, it was interesting to witness part of the development of one of my favorite novelists. Although not yet as strong and defined as in his later works, the classic Steinbeck tone is still there, and, of course, it is set against the oft-revisited setting of the fertile farmlands of Central California.What prevents me from giving this book a higher rating is that, in the scope of Steinbeck's literary career, it is not very impressive. The characters do not gel together as flawlessly as those in most of his later works and the classical allusions to parallel stories and characters in the Bible are a bit shaky and somewhat inconsistent. Nevertheless, what prevents me from giving this book a lower rating is that it remains a thoughtful, intriguing, and insightful piece on the nature of man's relationship to the land and to God.Overall, it is certainly a worthwhile read. In both its length and the complexity of its symbolism, To a God Unknown is certainly more accessible than Steinbeck's more celebrated longer works, such as The Grapes of Wrath or East of Eden, but it is in no way a comprehensive sample of Steinbeck's essential style and literary voice."},{"Title":"To a God Unknown (Bantam books)","review":"\\"To a God Unknown,\\" is a curious little book written early in Steinbeck's career developing into one of the better American writers to come along since the entity of what we know as America came along. It is his third book preceded by \\"Cup of Gold,\\" and \\"The Pastures of Heaven.\\" It came out the same year 1933 as the better known \\"The Red Pony\\" novella and predated \\"Tortilla Flat,\\" by two years. I've read a few of Steinbeck's works and consider him pretty near my favorite American writer. As such, \\"To A God Unknown,\\" just didn't resonate with me.I would only recommend the book for those wanting to better understand Steinbeck and how his style developed. For the pure joy of reading, I'd direct avid and semi-avid readers elsewhere. It seems to be a largely symbolic tale of paganism versus religion. It is curious what drove Steinbeck to want to address this dichotomy of belief but address it he does. Through a tale of Joseph Wayne who migrates west upon the death of his father, Steinbeck scratches the surface of the land of California that his writing seems so deeply connected to. Wayne loves the land. He indeed loves the land. So much so that he has a little episode of sorts with the land upon his first arrival. It kind of left me taken aback and not wringing true. Couldn't have dear John shown this characters love for the land in another way than to have to have Wayne dismount his horse and wallow in the dirt mounting his dear new land? Though it makes for curious reading, it sure is entertaining to write about it later.When writers make a concerted effort to explore life's deeper meanings through symbolism it many times comes off as a forced convention. Steinbeck had much more success later on in other works when he learned to relegate the symbolism to the subtle. A large oak tree on Wayne's new land represents his late father. A grove of trees with a huge green mossy rock and a magical stream represents something else...maybe Eden perhaps. Wayne meets a wife along the way, prospers and loses it all, and eventually becomes sacrificial (quasi-Jesus symbolism) in his love for the land.The dialogue for each character comes from a collective voice not unique to each character Steinbeck is attempting to develop. It comes across as slightly wooden and unlike how real people would talk. The actions of the characters seem to represent some deeper symbolic meanings...when as a reader I'd prefer them to reveal the depth of the characters or advance the march of the story. With both dialogue and action, I was left wanting.\\"To a God Unknown,\\" is a short book and not, by all means, a bad book. It is the genesis of a developing writer that seems to have used this book as a stepping ladder to bigger greater things. I am grateful for the gift left by Steinbeck of deep and rich literature. With \\"To a God Unknown,\\" Steinbeck was on his way to deeper and richer.Read on dear fellow readers.-MMW"},{"Title":"To a God Unknown (Bantam books)","review":"Steinbeck tried too hard with this one. This book tried, more or less, to do what T S Eliot did with the Wasteland. This book is loaded with symbols. To understand this work completely, for the lay reader, Steinbeck is demanding too much. The book delves into Earth worshiping, Greek epics, and of course, the Bible. It is no wonder it took him so long to write it--to work out the kinks. I did, however, thoroughly enjoy this work. This work almost boardered on the surreal for me. This work seemed to be written from a dream. I had the sensation of being swept into a dream of some lunatic while I read this book. But I liked being a part of that dream. I believe this was his third published book, after Pastures of Heaven--a novel of interlinked short stories--so I feel it is a wonderful improvement over Cup of Gold, and a wonderful third novel, but still far from The Grapes of Wrath or Of Mice and Men. Following Steinbeck's novels is a great way to study the growth of a writer--duh!--and I feel To a God Unknown is a nice third novel, as far as third novels go.

And as with many of his works, it is set in a part of the state that he knows well, the area within an easy drive of Salinas.While I didn't really enjoy the story (I was uncomfortable with the body blows delivered to the characters,) Mr. Steinbeck's writing skills kept me going.

But in the future, these settlers would refuse to welcome others, including those of their own kind."},{"Title":"To a God Unknown (Bantam books)","review":"I love Steinbeck's writing.

Clearly one of his earlier novels but probably the first that shows signs of a classic."},{"Title":"To a God Unknown (Bantam books)","review":"Even though I loved Steinbeck's prior book, The Pastures of Heaven, I had trouble getting traction in this one. A Vermont patriarch dies and his favored son goes West to Northern California. There he buys land and builds a farm and it flourishes. His three brothers eventually follow him, and there are four families on 640 acres of land between the river and a ridge. He gets married to a school teacher whom he more or less takes as a willing prisoner back to his farm. Practically all of the dialogue in the book is stilted, cerebral, portentous, awkward, silly-sounding. The characters are archetypes: Joseph, the protagonist, worships the earth and its fruitfulness. Thomas, the brother with whom he is closest (if it is possible for any of these people to be close to each other) has an uncanny affinity with animals. Burton, another brother, is a fundamental Christian obsessed with righteousness and religion. And the last brother is a drunkard. My initial impression was that it was like a fable or fairy tale and therefore it was not possible or designed so that the reader could identify with and enjoy the characters other than as oddities. This all changed as I became gradually more and more immersed in the book. When a devastating dry spell strikes their previously flourishing farm, Joseph begins to do some very strange things in response as the farm withers and the cattle starve to death. I began to identify more strongly with the obsessions of the characters, and began to realize how deeply that I too am governed by impulses and inexplicable irrational internal beliefs that determine what I do and how I live. While I am driven by a \\"God unknown\\" different than Joseph's, I am still driven by it. In fact, my efforts to find God are in a way to free me from my obsessions, or at least understand and channel them better. As the book draws to a close, it appears that salvation (in the form of a rainy season and therefore escape from total ruin) may come -- but is it because of Joseph's strange actions in the wild grotto to which he retreats? The gentle priest who prays for rain? The old man who is the last person in the country to see the sun set every night from his high cliff, when he sacrifices one of his beloved little animals? From having to force myself to continue reading, this became a true page-turner for me in its second half."},{"Title":"To a God Unknown (Bantam books)","review":"This story is not as powerful as The Grapes of Wrath, or some of Steinbeck's other works, but this is a very well written and lesser know treasure. I would only recommend it to true Steinbeck fans though. It contains the same basic style as many of his other books. The story moves along quickly so I did not find it to be excessively boring. It was somewhat strange though. The main character Joseph is very close to his land where he has built his home. And on his land there is a great tree. In it he believes is the spirit of his dead father. He believes the tree gives him guidance. It plays a major role in the book. The book itself incorporates pagan beliefs as well as Biblical beliefs. There is happiness and tragedy as well as mystery and lust.

I have to disagree with the reviewers who are giving this book low ratings. Addressing that first, I must say that this book does an impeccable job of intertwining mysticism and realism. It's not misogynist at all, and to pull a quote (as one user did) to support that claim, completely takes it out of context. Doing that is incredibly single minded and unfair to the entire book.I have read almost the entire Steinbeck catalog and 'To a God Unknown' is definitely in my top three so far and definitely one of my favorite books ever written.I love Steinbeck for his ability to take simple people and simple life and describe it in ways that capture your full attention. In this book (just like many of his others) he takes common life and weaves a magical and moving story that calls to your very being. His novels transcend the time period given to them and as I read this, I realized that this story could take place at any time and in any place.This book took me to my very core and touched things that are important to me. Things like family and friendships and the relationships we build as humans to all things on the earth. How we all have superstitions and how we, as humans, look to a higher power or at least question if there is or isn't something greater than us. Be it religious or spiritual, be it God or nature or nothing at all. This book is amazing in its ability to capture those sentiments and present them in a way that is never dry or dull.This book is a like a living work of art to me. I really feel that if you like Steinbeck at all or if you ponder over the human experience, you'll love this book."},{"Title":"To a God Unknown (Bantam books)","review":"TO A GOD UNKNOWN was one of the first novels that John Steinbeck wrote. However, it is not for those who are really into GRAPES OF WRATH or OF MICE AND MEN.

Nominally set in Steinbeck's beloved California hills, it has many parts that forcast the writing that would come later in &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot;, or more directly &quot;East of Eden&quot;.The characters, the story, the ending, are so obviously metephorical that you know they are more than just people. At the same time, the story on it's face is worth reading several times. It speaks to many themes that run throughout our lives, and at least for me caused a great deal of thought.What more can you ask from a book?"},{"Title":"To a God Unknown (Bantam books)","review":"Reading Steinbeck's 'To A God Unknown' the first time, I was left with a vague yet very definite emotional impact that lingered with me for several days. That was ten years ago, and after recommending the novel to a friend, I decided to revisit it myself. Time surely makes a difference, but even though the novel had less of a charge the second time around, I still found it worthwhile to puzzle out Steinbeck's ideas and to examine them for attraction.'To A God Unknown' begins with Joseph Wayne, eager to leave his father's farm in Vermont and to strike out West to homestead in California. After receiving a odd blessing from the patriarch, he travels west, and settles in the valley of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora. Not long after, his father passes away, and Joseph's brothers join him. Together, they build a successful ranch - partly, Joseph believes, because the spirit of his father has followed them to California and has taken up residence in a protective oak tree. Joseph surreptitiously (perhaps even to himself) offers small tokens as offerings to the tree, which disturbs his evangelist brother, and which will finally causes a break-up of the family. More important than the tree, though, is another spot on Joseph's land, a sort of genus loci for a different sort of power, something ancient and unknowable, which eventually draws Joseph deeper into its mysteries.Readers who have enjoyed Steinbeck's more famous works such as 'East of Eden' or 'The Grapes of Wrath' may find 'To A God Unknown' too different for their liking. While it is stylistically similar, written in the spare, plain manner of his other stories, on the surface of it I believe it comes across as strange and often inexplicable. At least that's the way I felt about it the first time through, even though I couldn't deny its effect. With this second reading, armed with a foreknowledge of events, I believe I see Steinbeck's goals quite a bit clearer, though the total effect is somewhat analogous to a particularly challenging riddle, that once solved, dulls its charm.I'm not exactly sure that I would recommend it again, at least not before I knew the tastes of whom to which I was recommending it. With its dedicated anti-humanist stance, coupled with its presentation of organized religion as a false face protecting us from raw natural power, it is in a unique position to put off the majority of its readers. Even those few who may find such a standpoint interesting may dislike Steinbeck's rejection of anthropocentric ideals. I found it terrifically interesting, even the second time around, though maybe a little single-minded. Its major drawback is that Steinbeck advances a viewpoint here, instead of presenting possibilities, and I find that fundamental difference to be a limiting factor, regardless of the viewpoint. Still, it is a position that isn't extensively held, and might even be considered quaint or naive by today's standards, and I think that, to obtain a broader, more objective outlook, there is much merit in examining out-of-favor viewpoints for useful value, and not to dismiss them out of hand."},{"Title":"To a God Unknown (Bantam books)","review":"As a lover of Steinbeck's work, I may be prejudiced here, this novel about how a man can feel about himself and his place in the sun is a good way to get a feel about J. Steinbeck's evolvement as a writer of powerful & moving human emotions. As with any story, you must remember the place & time in history that it was written and the cultural parameters occuring during that time. I find this an exceptional early work for an author built on an uncommon, dare I say \\"daring\\", openess for religion, raw sexuality, family values and mystical beliefs at a time when American society was strait-jacketed into religous and social constrictions. It is stories like these that let readers stretch and push the boundries of acceptable behaviour and kept censorship at bay.

Steinbeck later in his life made many a pronouncement concerning how it was the duty of the writer to capture the human spirit, in all its greatness and frailty. Unfortunately, in this novel I found few characters that even resembled human beings. It smacks of a young writer trying too hard; so packed with portents, symbols, mysticism, and pseudo-majestic dialog that I almost gave up on it several times.

I've found it in many of his works, but this has the most overt example: \\"I thought he'd pick a wife as he'd pick a cow- to be a good cow, perfect in the activity of cows- to be a good wife and very like a cow\\" (67).

I decided to reread it to find out why it had such an influence on me.It's not regarded as one of Steinbeck's best or even a particularly good novel.Criticism ranged from lukewarm to scathing. The New York Times called it \\"a symbolical novel conceived in mysticism and dedicated to the soil\\" which \\"attempts too much\\" and \\"achieves too little\\" and hence \\"fails to cohere.\\" A reviewer for The Nation judged the novel \\"pitifully thin and shadowy.\\" The New York Herald Tribune called it a \\"strange and mightily obsessed book.\\" In reading it, I could see the roots of Steinbeck's voice, but not enough to explain its impact on me. The plot's a bit thin , the writing sometimes over-the-top. Steinbeck was clearly still developing his voice. So why did it impress me so much? At first, I thought it was the larger-than-life and deeply passionate protagonist, Joseph Wayne. I'm a great believer in passionate protagonists . But then I realized what I so admired was that the book was original and ambitious.The young Steinbeck had taken risks. Years of living and writing have hopefully tempered my writing with craft. But in an age when originality, ambition and risk are frequently viewed with caution (how many movies today are remakes of old TV shows and comics?), perhaps aiming high should be part of the equation as well.

Reviews here gave me two incorrect impressions: first, that it was set in the early 1800s, when it's actually the early 1900s; second, that it's preachy, when it's actually full of questions and murky answers. And that's what I liked best about it.\\"To a God Unknown\\" follows Joseph Wayne, who has been blessed by his dying father. Joseph heads from Vermont to California's rich farmlands. He believes his father is watching over his endeavors, embodied in a tree on the land. He loves his homestead, invites his brothers and their families to join him, and together they create a paradise for themselves. Yet darkness lurks along the edges, in a glade full of foreboding, and in the dissensions between siblings. It's hard not to be reminded in small ways of the biblical story of Joseph, blessed by his father, disparaged by his brothers, but neither the biblical references nor the pagan sacrifices can be easily categorized here.Steinbeck spent five years writing this book, though it's a barely a third the length of \\"East of Eden,\\" which was written much quicker. I can see the wrestling here in the characters, Joseph, Elizabeth, Rama, and so on. Each of them views life and death through different eyes and beliefs. Each of them embraces or shuns the land, based on these beliefs. Steinbeck gives rich descriptions of the terrain and the foliage, and he inhabits it with this rich cast of characters. As in almost all of his works, the vibrant energy of life throbs throughout, and yet is laced with the inevitability of death.While not my favorite Steinbeck novel, I'm amazed that this is not better known and talked about more. It is full of deep searching and struggle. These people wrestle to understand God, the land, life, love, and death. They make courageous choices and foolish ones.

The head of the family starts to worship an oak tree on his land that embodies the spirit of his dead father and develops a deep connectedness to the land and nature, much to the chagrin of his Christian brother. This has themes of the rhythms of nature, as well as pagan superstition and the internal struggles of one man as he struggles with traditional religion and his feelings of the purity of nature. Having read much Steinbeck before I was eager to start this book and soak myself in his beautiful prose and whilst that still held true, I did find this slightly hard to get into initially; you could tell this was one of his early books and he was finding his voice. After about thirty pages though I was enthralled and revelled in his writing until the resonant and moving conclusion. Steinbeck has the ability to reach to your very core and make you feel the passions, sadnesses and tribulations of the characters along with them and whilst in less experienced hands you may have trouble believing in and engaging with some of the ideas presented here, with Steinbecks deft touch you not only believe them but you also live and breathe them. This is a worthy addition to your Steinbeck collection and as I have stated on other reviews for his work, I have yet to read a bad Steinbeck book and this is truly no exception.

While on his ranch, he feels a strange sensation and comes to believe that the spirit of his father has entered an oak tree on his land.

His brothers Thomas, Burton, and Benjy, as well as their families, soon come to join Joesph and his hand, Juanito.The brothers are all very different. Joesph is an intense man, feeling a spiritual, almost sexual connection to the land and its fruits. Thomas dislikes the company of people, preferring to spend his time with animals. Burton is a devout Christian and Benjy is a womanizing drunkard. The brothers find that under Joesph's leadership, they become prosperous. With Juanito, Thomas and Joesph discover a little glade containing a stream issuing from a mossy rock. Juanito tells them that the place is sacred and Joseph believes it to be the heart of the land. This place comes to have special significance in the second half of the novel.Joesph courts and marries a schoolteacher named Elizabeth, who tries to understand her new husband and his ways. Joseph talks to and makes small sacrifices to the tree he thinks of as his father's spirit, which angers his brother Burton. He leaves, but not before killing the tree. Whether that is the cause or not, the land soon after succumbs to drought and the brothers must make tough decisions or risk losing everything they have worked for.To a God Unknown explores the nature of man's beliefs and the effect they have on himself and the surrounding environment.

This book is simple and beautifully written."},{"Title":"To a God Unknown (Bantam books)","review":"I can't wait to read it my aunt read it when she was younger may she R.I.P"},{"Title":"To a God Unknown (Bantam books)","review":"Though a fan of John Steinbeck's works for a great many years, I only recently took up \\"To a God Unknown,\\" and it was with great surprise and joy that I discovered his greatest masterwork came early in his career. An alternately brooding and exalting meditation on self, nature, and God -- and the frayed connections amongst them, and amongst humans to one another -- \\"To a God Unknown\\" subsumes Steinbeck's trademark image specificity into a larger description of the life and death of land, and how we owe our own to its.His characters are thoughtful, but confused -- certain of truths and sorrows that are secretly fringed with doubt. You will find no portrayals more fascinating or complex than in this book. I can honestly say that I cherish \\"To a God Unknown\\" as much as I do any art not spilled from the mind of Bruce Springsteen."},{"Title":"To a God Unknown (Bantam books)","review":"As always with John Steinbeck's novels, \\"To a God Unknown\\" is lyrically descriptive and intensely potent with emotion and meaning. The topic matter of this novel might seem like strange territory for the Steinbeck of \\"Cannery Row\\" or \\"Of Mice and Men\\", but is filled with his trademark depictions of men who have been broken by life trying to find their way. This time the novel focuses on Joseph Wayne and his family as they try to eek out a living in the valley of Nuestra Senora in California.Joseph Wayne leaves his family and dying father in Vermont to fulfill his dreams of owning his own land in the vast unknown country. After he has established his farm, he receives news that his father has passed away, and his brothers shortly come to live with him at his ranch. The Wayne family experiences every prosperity the land has to offer and happiness settles on them; however, Joseph believes that this prosperity is due to the spirit of his father who resides in the great oak tree he built his house next too. He daily offers news and sacrifices (of a sort) to the tree as a way of thanksgiving. This worries his devoutly Christian brother Burton, who eventually destroys the tree when he leaves the ranch. As soon as the tree is destroyed and dying, disaster settles upon the ranch and the Wayne family.After the disaster strikes, Steinbeck takes readers along on Joseph's quest as he madly searches for the meaning behind the dying land and a way to bring it back to life. In his search, he means to leave no stone unturned, no matter what the sacrifice. \\"To a God Unknown\\" is a compelling examination of man's fate and beliefs. The story is beautifully told with vivdly poetic descriptions of the land. And yet the characters seem to lack some luster, some thread of reality. While some may mark that up to the story being a fable, a vast quantity of the dialogue rings untrue and leaves the characters flatly, one-dimensional. The story is strongest when the author isn't forcing his characters to confess things to move the story along, when it's allowed to unfold with the enviable grace that infuses all of Steinbeck's greatest works."},{"Title":"To a God Unknown (Bantam books)","review":"&quot;To A God Unknown&quot; is Steinbeck's disturbing treatment of spirituality, superstition, and the power of faith. This is a story that will stick to the ribs of the thoughtful reader. At turns horrific and beautiful, this is a book to be read at intervals in the course of the life of a spiritual seeker. You will be haunted by the truths found beneath the hard stones of Steinbeck's simple language, and will find yourself returning again to this disturbing kingdom of the soul. Combining elements of Christianity, Paganism, and free-form superstition, this book may well cause you to reassess your thoughts on the nature of the mind and of god."},{"Title":"To a God Unknown (Bantam books)","review":"John Steinbeck's &quot;To A God Unknown&quot; reached into my soul and what emerged was a clearer sense of myself. This novel truly spoke to me. It is known that Steinbeck had an adversity toward organized religion, and that fact is evident in the text of this book. What struck me most was the insight into paganism and the worship of nature in its truest, rawest form. Man living in harmony with nature is a recurring theme along with the fact that humans must not desecrate the earth for monetary gains, but rather must understand nature and live within nature's guidelines. Steinbeck's lyrical prose confirms these beliefs that I hold close to my heart"},{"Title":"To a God Unknown (Bantam books)","review":"Every great once in a while, a gem of a story falls into your hands, and so it is with &quot;To A God Unknown&quot;. I have never understood why this book has not received the notoriety that it well deserves. It is truly Steinbeck's sleeper.I have recently been reading some of the current 'bestsellers' and the Oprah books and have become thoroughly disillusioned and disgusted with what we're killing trees to produce. I think it's time to reread something worthwhile.If only J.S. could be reincarnated."},{"Title":"To a God Unknown (Bantam books)","review":"The story is based on man's relationship with the land. On another level, it re-enacts the ancient ritual of sacrifice in return for rain and thus crops and life itself. It retells the ages-old worship of wooden gods and animism. It leaves one to wonder if we had ever purged ourselves of these \\"ways\\" but rather embedded them further within ourselves in these \\"modern\\" times. It is a pagan theme that goes throughout. Beautifully written, the heart and feel of the California landscape never left me doubting as to where this is. If you've ever spent time in the valley, the descriptions hit home. If you've never been, it will prepare you mentally and perhaps physically, for the heat. And in the little oases of wood and stream, he has captured the coolness and mystic qualities that still exist today. From a premier California storyteller, this is a California jewel."},{"Title":"To a God Unknown (Bantam books)","review":"To a God Unknown is a book full of powerful images. Reading about the mossy stone in its lonely pine grove still makes me shudder, and I am not a superstitious or particularly spiritual person. To the protagonist Joseph, the land is god and god is everything, and it exacts great and terrible payments for the fertility and life that Joseph craves. Like almost of all of Steinbeck's novels, it is beautifully written and full of vividly drawn people. However in other ways it is very unlike most of his novels. It isn't funny, not even a little, and it isn't quite about people. I can't quite describe what it is about (the interconnectedness of all life? human longing for kinship with nature? fate?), or adequately explain the feelings it evokes in me."},{"Title":"To a God Unknown (Bantam books)","review":"John Steinbeck has a habit of leaving the reader hanging a little bit at the end of his stories. &quot;To a God Unknown&quot; is no different. This is one of the more admirable qualities of Steinbeck as he does not tell the reader what to think. He trusts the reader's intelligence.Steinbeck tells this story in the setting that seems to be his trademark, the early agricultural societies of the West. Joseph Wayne is struggling in his faith. He adopts pagan beliefs because they work while his land prospers. When the tree that is the center of his pagan beliefs is killed by his religious brother, the farm and his life begin a downward spiral. While the story almost seems biblical in the beginning, it becomes strange after the tree is killed. While Joseph seems to be a saint in the beginning, his character unravels. After the death of his wife and giving away his only son, Joseph takes to worshiping the moss growing on a rock. Eventually, the moss becomes the center of his life. The mossy rock becomes the scene of his demise as it was the scene of his wife's demise.The last scene will require some thought and reflection for the reader. Perhaps you will find your own interpretation. In the final scene, the priest hopes Joseph is happy with the rain. He says this unknowing of Joseph's death/apparent suicide. Both the pagan and the priest received what they prayed for in the end. The priest has the last word. I think this tells you who was right. The thought-provoking nature of the book makes it a very underrated classic from Steinbeck."},{"Title":"To a God Unknown (Bantam books)","review":"Years ago I read this novel at the urging of my father, a big Steinbeck fan. He said it was 'spooky'. It was tough to understand at the time, and still tough upon rereading now, but that is the beauty of it.. what is being said here? Steinbeck seems to flit back and forth between approval of his main character's actions and warning against them. The message comes through clearly that Nature is a chaotic force, but some devotees have a special connection with it. Nature is truly presented as another religion, perhaps more powerful than the ones we consider mainstream. And like any other religion, the God of nature calls a particular few, sometimes causing division in families . The style is sometimes a bit disconnected, but the book is a definite recommend for deep thinkers. Also particularly interesting is the foreward explaining the origins of the novel's theme and the time and effort it took Steinbeck to write... he spent more time on this novel than on any other. I will pick this up and reread it again, in a few years. It's that kind of book."},{"Title":"To a God Unknown (Bantam books)","review":"Maybe I read too much Steinbeck, but its only because I usually love his writing. However, I found this particualr novel to be dissapointing. Although there was potential for interesting characters and character development, it never came through. I understand that the main character was supposed to be hard to understand, but I don't like that it was this idea that was developed rather than the character himself. The points on religion and connection to the earth fell through in similar fashion; interesting ideas were brought up in sporadic well-written scenes, but then never fully developed. If you want a better written and more pleasurable read that include the same, but thought-out views, read East of Eden. This novel was in fact the predecessor to Steinbecks masterpeice; and it seems to merely be a brainstorm. The plot itself was a dissapointment as well. I usually enjoy Steinbecks cynical realism and irony, but in this case it was pitiful. There was so much foreshadowing, that what it led to became unimportant and inti-climactic."},{"Title":"To a God Unknown (Bantam books)","review":"\\"To a God Unknown\\" is one of the most cryptic or simply weird novels I have ever read. I write this more as a book report, as opposed to a review, for my own clarification.The story begins simply enough. Joseph Wayne, a carbon copy of his father, upon reaching adulthood faces the harsh realities of sharing a small Vermont homestead with his three brothers. To his father's chagrin, he travels west to the new promised land of California, where he finds a fine tract of land and sets down roots. Everything seems at first so promising in his land of milk and honey. Yet he soon finds out that the previous settlers had been forced to flee on account of a mercilessly relentless drought. Undaunted, he dismisses out of hand any notions of past disaster and even goes so far as welcoming his three brothers to move west to share in the wealth.Steinbeck drew a sharp contrast in the way he depicted the four Wayne brothers. The stoic Joseph was the oldest and natural leader of the pack. Thomas was a naturalist whose love and caring for wild things overshadowed everything else. Burton was the fire and brimstone brand of fundamentalist who forcefully took exception with anyone who departed from his notions of creation. The baby of the family, Benjamin, was by disposition prone to laziness, drinking and womanizing. At first, the unified family made a success with the land. But, as so often seems the case when it comes to the long-term practicality of communal living, internal dissensions spelled its ultimate demise. Benjamin's transgressions with one of the farm helper's wives results in his being brutally stabbed to death. Furthermore, owing to Joseph's pantheistic inclinations,* Burton leaves the farm.The final blow arrives in the form of drought. In searching out sources of water at an ancient, legendary spring, Joseph tragically loses his new wife to a freak fall. Emotionally and spiritually distraught by the scorched earth, Thomas flees with the few remaining emaciated livestock. Lastly, Steinbeck closes the book with Joseph's suicide. Perhaps he provided this as a metaphor. Did not Christ give up his life here on Earth so that we might have a better chance of reaching heaven? Could it not, therefore, be interpreted in a rather convoluted way that Joseph's taking of his own life was a means through which to bring about the drought's end and return to the people its promised land?*Joseph views a large oak tree on the farm as an extension of the soul of his deceased father"},{"Title":"To a God Unknown (Bantam books)","review":"John Steinbeck's To A God Unknown has got to be one of his most powerful and breath taking books. Steinbeck did borrow the idea from a college friend but took it far beyond the original conception. Transitions from dark, moody scenery to light-hearted glimps of life make this a story as epic as East of Eden, as touching as Tortilla Flat, and as thought provoking as Junius Maltby."},{"Title":"To a God Unknown (Bantam books)","review":"I read this book for a book report. It was hard to understand. It is hard to find the deep down meaning and put it into words. Even though it was hard to interprate it was an exelent book. It was very inspring."},{"Title":"To a God Unknown (Bantam books)","review":"Granted, I've only also read Totilla Flat and Of Mice and Men. You can tell that Steinbeck spent five years on this -- it pays off. There is so much texture in the book, so many foreshadowings, and a good dose subtle references. It's difficult to put a lot of those in a one book without losing the subtlety, but it works here. It feels like Steinbeck obsessed over every line.To be sure, when this was written, John was still a rookie, and his style and some of his charetarization would improve over time, but for my money's worth, it repays it's price several times over.Thanks Penguin!"},{"Title":"To a God Unknown (Bantam books)","review":"For anyone raised with a pro-nature, Christian ethic, this book is unsettling. Steinbeck personifies nature in a way many readers will see as essentially true. However, many of novel's themes hint at the dualistic Earth-worship which many Christians suspect is hiding within the trappings of New-Age theology. If this novel were made into a movie, it has enough dark undertones that it might be aired on the sci-fi channel. I'm a big fan of Steinbeck's work and this is a particular favorite of mine. However, it is not representative of his other writing. This is a quirky, disturbing novel."},{"Title":"To a God Unknown (Bantam books)","review":"Steinbeck comes back with a masterpiece yet again. A deeply religious book, this novel will change the way you see life. A must read, for the casual reader and for the die-hard Steinbeck fan alike. I rank this as one of the best books of all time."},{"Title":"To a God Unknown (Bantam books)","review":"Steinbeck seemed to be trying to do too much with this novel. After a really good start, with the typically magnificent descriptions of the Californian countryside one can expect from Steinbeck, the story seems to lose its way. The chief protagonist's struggle to become the lord of his farmland eventually becomes uninteresting, and even the potentially interesting leitmotiv of earthy paganism vs. otherworldly Christianity is handled too superficially to draw the reader's attention. The primary reason for the novel's failure as a literary work is the very stiff and unnatural dialogue among the various characters, which is something very unusual for Steinbeck (one only has to recall the completely natural and believable characters in novels like \\"The Grapes of Wrath,\\" \\"Winter of Our Discontent,\\" or \\"Cannery Row\\"). Since the the main themes of \\"To a God Unknown,\\" i.e. rural California, man's struggle with and against nature, etc., were so near and dear to Steinbeck, it just fails to live up to expectations. Given the high quality of Steinbeck's many other literary masterpieces, this novel is a great disappointment."},{"Title":"To a God Unknown (Bantam books)","review":"A year and a half ago, I discovered Steinbeck, and in the midst of a reading frenzy, concluded that I wanted to read everything he wrote. To An Unknown God is the third step on that journey. Like his first two published works, A Cup of Gold and Pastures of Heaven, the enjoyment is more biographical than literary.In another review, I commented that extremely talented novelists can sustain a bad idea for 200-250 pages. Here, Steinbeck shows that he is smarter than your average brilliant novelist by ending this at 186 pages To actually describe it -- a farmer new to California comes to believe that a tree embodies his father's spirit -- makes it sound worse than it is, but the pleasures are more in individual passages than the work as a whole. I especially love the opening page, in which a young man defends his desire to move away because the extended family is growing too large for the farm: \`The land doesn't stretch, sir.' Good luck ever finding five words that can explain more of world history.As the introduction notes that Steinbeck himself admitted, the characters aren't particularly likeable (or I would add, unlikeable enough in compelling fashion). When reading the novel, I at first thought Steinbeck had lost control of his material because I didn't particularly care for the main character. Then another character tells the man's bride his faults, which were exactly my objections.At the point, I realized that the problem instead was that Steinbeck wasn't (yet) writing like Steinbeck and was committed to the obscure symbolism at the expense of the actual story. Like his first two novels, To An Unknown God is heavily imitative of others. On the surface level, it feels a lot like Thomas Hardy, which gives it stiff, nineteen-century feel. (Apparently, he was in fact deeply inspired by a poet he knew personally, one who has very little reputation today.) This works well in the lovely descriptions of the landscape. During the dialogue, however, there's this distracting sense that people don't talk like that.The symbolic level is a battle between Christianity and various forms of paganism (complete with characters with names like Joseph and Rama, stones described as being like an altar, various actions compared to (and including actual) blood sacrifices, etc.). The significance of it is not particularly clear, and if the introduction is correct in its reading of Steinbeck's own comments on his motivations, ultimately not that important (with paganism being a stand-in for obsession or paranoia akin to the horses in the play Equus).The rambling introduction by Robert DeMott is better than most at telling the soon-to-be reader important context instead of spoiling the plot, but ultimately, it too has to strain to defend the work (\`not considered a great novel, though it is a quirky, memorable one'), falling back on its importance for laying the groundwork for the dazzle Steinbeck was about to unleash on the world."},{"Title":"To a God Unknown (Bantam books)","review":"One of Steinbeck's early novels that moves the reader with memorable verbal imagery of the Salinas Valley."},{"Title":"To a God Unknown (Bantam books)","review":"Purple and brown, dusty wine shot through with wheat-colored sun.John Steinbeck's, \\"To a God Unknown,\\" is both love letter and a Dear John to his native Northern California countryside.The author lingers often and long on the Salinas Valley landscape, now a land of milk 'n honey, moist, juicy, dashed with clover; now a dry and crusty graveyard frozen beneath a foreboding moon. These pastoral passages can transport. Steinbeck looks at the same places and renders them differently with each new encounter.The protagonist is grafted by his creator to the land, and Steinbeck is an avid guide, reading the topography and its changes like a mood-ring, drafting his American rustics to rise and fall depending.Steinbeck's dialogue, at this point in his life, was not as strong. The exchanges between country people, makin' butter and castrating cows, seems like they're chatting from the couch about their inner swoonings. But you move along with a sense of the things that are agitating them.As Golden State portraiture, we can see how past is prologue. After Burton, Joseph's holy-rolling brother, leaves the farm in disgust with the devil's presence, the protagonist tells his wife: \\"We'll try to get along without another hand. If the work gets too much for us, I'll hire another Mexican.\\"Oh brother.It is a dark and brooding book, mostly tragedy with redemption only in death. Steinbeck's characters shrink before the enormity of nature. Christians new to the heathen west are bent on exploiting and controlling the wilds. Others are more ready to make love with them.Earthy stuff.There are many ways to read \\"To A God Unknown,\\" and with some work, you might find your own."},{"Title":"To a God Unknown (Bantam books)","review":"Steinbeck returns to the valleys of California in \\"To a God Unknown.\\" Of all of the landscapes he writes in, this most seems like home. He knows every detail of the land in the way only a son could.He describes the seasons and seasonal changes. Spring being the season of procreation and birth; summer the season of work; fall the season of the harvest; and winter the season of preparation and patience.It is really in the winter that contains the most detail. The other seasons move so quickly but the idle days of winter seem to inspire the descriptive prose within the pages. I also think this season may be the underlying theme of the book, winter being the season of death in a human's life.To combat the fear of death, Steinbeck introduces faith. There is a tree in the yard that Joseph believes embodies the spirit of his father and a moss covered boulder in the woods that represents an ominous fate.Where I don't believe that Steinbeck himself is believes in Paganism (I think he is Christian), I do think he has a respect for people whose beliefs were formed based on the land, on his land.On a side note...John is always the son of Joseph and Joseph is always the son of John. John's are very good or very bad, never mediocre. If they are mediocre they are called Jack. I doubt John Steinbeck ever went by Jack."},{"Title":"Stories of the ancient Greeks,","review":"As this excellent little volume states in the preface these are the ancient stories that MUST be passed on to each new generation. This is as true now as it was in 1903 when this edition was copyrighted. These are the classic tales of Greek glory. You cannot consider yourself well educated without knowledge of them- this applies as much to our own time as it did in antiquity. More importantly, there is something satisfying to the soul in these stories. Perhaps they resonate with the soul at some unconscious level.The first half of the book deals with 32 three to five page stories from Greek Mythology (this includes the tales from the heart of the Iliad and the Odyssey.) The second half is composed of another 32 stories from Greek History. This division is somewhat arbitrary since there is, and must be, considerable overlap of the two.I found the writing style to be clear and faithful to the original sources. This book was written for grammar school students in 1903, but in my opinion is it a good introduction or review for the general adult reader of today.There are 24 excellent line illustrations included, as well as a two page map of classical Greece."},{"Title":"Stories of the ancient Greeks,","review":"I bought this Kindle edition to read to my first graders who are studying Story of the World Volume 1.

So there seems to be a lot of cross-referencing, unless one looked at \\"qital\\" first -- but it has no cross-reference to either jihad or war. At the end of almost every entry there is a \`further reading' reference to other books for consultation on the topic. Pertaining to \\"shahada\\": while \\"it is customarily understood to mean martyrdom\\", this book notes that this term appears 50 times in the Quran, and opines that this word \\"signifies rather a \`legal' concept (rather than the term) of martyrdom....It is in the hadith literature that we come across the full-blown concepts of martyr and martyrdom\\" (p. 584). Almost a full page is spent on this topic, and explains that \`shadaha' also refers to non-military actions. The author presents a rather sympathetic treatment of the Shia claim that Muawiya actually signed a \`peace treaty' with Hasan and recognized the later's claim to the caliphacy - a claim that the Sunni strongly challenge. This encyclopedia also contains articles not related specifically \\"in\\" the Quran, as by its noting various personalities involved with Islam, such as by providing a half-page-long commentary on al-Singkill who: \\"was one of the most prominent Islamic reformers of the Malay world in the seventeenth century.\\" Pertaining to overall translations of the Quran, the author refers to not only the works of Y.

Then, when you get a chance, go and read the living things that it came from.\\"This, the last sentence in the book, powerfully wraps up an engrossing examination of both sides of the controversy on logging old-growth forests. Always on the side of the environmentalists, I came to understand and sympathize with the loggers who cut them down. Not an easy task for any writer to undertake. But Dietrich has done it, and done it well. No wonder he won a Pulitzer Prize. The writing is clear and sharp, and at times, poetic in imagery. Yes, I have been to the Olympic old-growth forests of which he speaks, and he is right when he says that the minute you enter them, there is magic. Even the loggers feel this. The stories of individuals, both on the side of timber and the side of trees, eloquently speak of passions and lifestyles, battles won and lost. Anita Goos is not someone I will soon forget. Dietrich tells of men and women who choose their battles, sometimes unwillingly, but who enter the fray with hearts and minds wholly in the cause.It is well to follow this book with \\"The Hidden Forest\\" by Jon Luoma, written seven years later."},{"Title":"The Final Forest: The Battle for the Last Great Trees of the Pacific Northwest","review":"I read this book for my research paper on old growth forests. Originally I was going to just try to fly through it and take out the information that I needed for my paper, but as I read it I got really into it and almost forgot about my paper altogether! I think the best thing about this book is that it represents all sides of the issue. William Dietrich talks to cutters, truck drivers, biologists, environmentalists, foresters, and the community itself and tells all sides of the situation in his book. When I originally chose to do my paper on preservation of old growth forests, I was completely against cutting down of trees, and even though I am still not exactly for it, this book really helped me to be more open-minded and understand the different point of views..."},{"Title":"The Final Forest: The Battle for the Last Great Trees of the Pacific Northwest","review":"We use this book on NOLS expeditions specifically because it treats conservation as a dilemma of competing moral values.

The stories told in this book could never be explained or understood in a 30 second television news broadcast. And while much of the news is depressing, this book offers hope for a brighter future where science, conservation, forestry, and consumer interests can meet for the future use of our forest resources."},{"Title":"The Final Forest: The Battle for the Last Great Trees of the Pacific Northwest","review":"Dietrich wrote this book when the controversy over the Northern spotted owl in old-growth forests was at its height. The policy debate was resolved in early 1993, as one of the first major acts of the Clinton administration. Because this book was published in 1992, it misses the end of its own story.Setting that important limitation aside, Dietrich has given us a well-written, compelling story about the owl and the communities that depend on the forest. Each chapter focuses on a person as a representative of a community - - activists, scientists, political actors, foresters, loggers, and so forth. The owl also gets its own chapter. That's an effective way to capture the various sides of the debate. Dietrich is admirably sympathetic to everyone; I don't think any group would feel they were slighted in some hatchet job here.That even-handedness doesn't hide Dietrich's basic story. It takes 500-1000 years to grow an ancient forest. We cut 85% of that forest in a century. The logging industry was going to face a major contraction with or without the owl, though the owl may have sped the change up by a decade or so. Because of the owl, we have some lower-elevation old growth left."},{"Title":"The Final Forest: The Battle for the Last Great Trees of the Pacific Northwest","review":"This book was very interesting and well-written. Dietrich uses descriptive language that makes you feel like the mountains are right out your window. The organization of the book also made it easy to read and understand everyone's individual stories and viewpoints on the issue of the forest. It was interesting to hear the logger's and cutter's stories because they are so attached to the forest in such a different way than we normally hear about, such as from biologists or environmentalists. They talk about even what they wear to work and how if their job wasn't in the forest, they would be changed because the forest is all they know. The way the controversy was brought up because of the owl also shows the impact it has in the forest. The trees that make up the forest are some of the largest in the world, so when a large political and environmental debate is brought up because of an owl, it is quite amazing. The book focused mostly on human-environment interaction. Every person has their own ideas that matter to the forest as an ecosystem, place of work, and a place to study the environment making this book a very interesting read."},{"Title":"The Final Forest: The Battle for the Last Great Trees of the Pacific Northwest","review":"Dietrich was introduced to me while I was visiting the Hoh Valley rainforest in Olympic National Park in Washington. Being inside a rainforest was a life-changing experience and Dietrich's 'Final Forest' consolidated all the feelings for me. His well-written account of Pacific Northwest landscape, past and current, along with the excruciating fight to save whatever is left, is important for current and future generations to elevate their cognizance towards environmental stewardship."},{"Title":"The anatomy of peace","review":"This book is one of the most common-sense things I have read in a long time. Although Reeves clearly comes from a western, white, upper class perspective (the only real criticism I have of some of his theories), he understands and clearly, simply explains the faults of our present political systems, in a way that is easy to understand. Even though this book was written in 1945, as WWII was ending and the UN was being formed, his criticisms of the international system and his discussions of the great powers of the world and their policies are eerily reminiscent of present day international affairs. I am upset that it is out of print, and think it should be required reading for anyone interested in peace studies, or in any part of the world other than their own."},{"Title":"The anatomy of peace","review":"It left a lasting memory, when I read this book in the early 1950s. I did so again now. It is a classic in the field of seeking Global Peace through Global Law. Reves said metaphorically, in matters of world peace and international relations we are still looking at the world as though we were living in the Ptolemaic age, where the sun rotated around the earth. All of our attempts to create peace have been futile, be it treaties, international leagues, socialism, capitalism, morality or religion. \\"The failure of Christianity as a civilizing force of society is an incalculable tragedy...Two thousand years is time enough to judge the efficacy of a method.\\" No wonder we failed: Religion, morality and the rest of them are not the problem. Instead, he said, the real culprit was nationalism. \\"Nation\\" has always eclipsed \\"God\\". Are we not praying to God to bring us victory, even though our enemies pray to the same god for the same benefit?Instead, the only way to create peace on the face of this Earth is global governance and binding international law. Every nation has simply to surrender some of its sovereignty to a global authority and thereby support a lawful human society. In order to create permanent peace and to abolish war forever, we have to establish a world government and he recommended a gradual progress, starting with a limited number of fundamentals and to progress from there. Contrariwise, the League of Nations or the newly formed United Nations were on the wrong track.It did not subtract from the impact of the book that he gave few specifics about the structure or function of a possible world government. His was an early text, which he wrote during WW II and it was not until after it was published that a few months later the Hiroshima bomb exploded. When at the end of that devastating war Albert Einstein was asked for his opinion about the future, he simply asked the journalists to read \\"The Anatomy of Peace\\" by Emery Reves. It is lucid, cogent and gives you serious doubts about the world we are living in. It is no less relevant today than it was then."},{"Title":"Kaplan GMAT 2004 with CD-ROM","review":"I bought the 2003 version in May and decided to get the 2004 version in July because I wanted to get more practice tests.

My test taking and math skills were pretty rusty. I want to get into a top 20 MBA program to make it worth the investment. Consequently a great score was very important. I was shooting for 700.I bought the Princeton book / CD, the Kaplan book / CD, and the Official Guide from ETS. I also downloaded the PowerPrep software from ETS for free. I completely exhausted the Princeton and Kaplan material - test strategies, exercises, practice tests. I did all the practice tests in PowerPrep. Moreover, I did the last third of the questions from the Official Guide (the harder questions are in the back).I did not take a training class. I took a Kaplan class 14 years ago for the LSAT and was not happy with the investment. Better would be to find a study partner in your area.My assessment:1. The Princeton book by far has the better explanations of test taking strategies, as compared to Kaplan.2. The Princeton questions are much more similar in structure to the real GMAT questions, as compared to Kaplan.3. The verbal sections of Princeton practice tests are pretty similar in terms of difficulty to the real GMAT verbal section, as compared to Kaplan.4. The quantitative section of the real GMAT is far more difficult than Princeton practice tests.5. The Kaplan practice tests are much harder than the real GMAT.6. The free online tests that come with the Princeton book / CD are a great added bonus.7. The PowerPrep software is identical in look and feel to the real GMAT, but the quant questions are definitely easier.8. The Princeton book has the best approach to the writing sections, but do review the Kaplan material as well.If you want a top score then my advice is to get all three books and download PowerPrep. You also need a lot of time to prepare, particularly if you're working full time or if you've been out of college for a while. I studied and practiced for about 8 weeks. You also need to be comfortable with taking the test on a computer. It is more difficult than on paper - harder to read on the screen, harder to take notes, etc.First, start with the Princeton book - this will give you a solid foundation. Next, exhaust the PowerPrep software. This will give you a good baseline of where you are and where you need to focus. (I scored 730 and 740 w/ the PowerPrep software.)Next tackle the Kaplan book, but only focus on sections where you are having trouble. Then exhaust the Princeton Software. (I scored 720 and 730 on the practice tests on Princeton's CD.)Then do the Kaplan CD practice exercises and practice tests. The tests are very hard, more difficult than the GMAT . . . particularly the verbal. You will score lower on these tests. The practice exercises don't give you enough time to answer all of the questions. Nevertheless, try not to become too frustrated. Keep in mind that you are building stamina and you are improving by seeing new, challenging quant questions. (I scored 640 on the diagnostic, and 680, 580, 650, 600 on the Kaplan CD practice tests, much lower than Princeton and PowerPrep.)When you're finished w/ the Kaplan CD, start doing the last 1/3 or so of each section in the Official Guide, 20 questions at a time. These are ACTUAL GMAT questions. The explanations are EXCELLENT, far better than either Kaplan or Princeton. Unfortunately some Official Guide questions are repeated from the PowerPrep software.Meanwhile, mix in online practice tests from Princeton; again you'll have seen some questions before. Don't sweat the recycled material. You won't remember the answers to many of them and you'll have to rework the quant questions anyway. At this point it is more important to understand why you are missing certain types of questions repeatedly and to improve how you attack specific question types. (I scored 750, 710, 690, 730 on the Princeton online practice tests. However, these scores are suspect due to the recycled questions.)My advice is to take NO tests the day before the GMAT. Clear your head some. Spend time getting comfortable with a template for the writing section. Review specific questions that you've missed in the past - the Official Guide is ideal for this - understanding the correct approach. Relax if you can and get a good night's sleep.Last piece of advice, bring a snack and use ALL of BOTH breaks. Stand up, stretch, whiz, drink something, eat something. The test is exhausting and you need to use the breaks to clear your head and refocus.If you do all this you should get a great score. The real GMAT was VERY difficult, even after all of my preparation. I even guessed on a few quant questions that I had no idea how to attack. The whole test went by in a blur. Stamina and timing, however, were not an issue with so much full-length practice.I ended up with a 760, far better than I targeted and expected, even better than on any practice test I took. This was a pleasant surprise, given how difficult the test was as compared to much of the practice material. However, by using all of the practice material effectively I am now able to look at top 10 programs instead of top 20! Yeah!"},{"Title":"Kaplan GMAT 2004 with CD-ROM","review":"The most important thing to know about this book is that the practice tests are MUCH HARDER than the actual GMAT. I initially took the diagnostic on the software and got a 680. Encouraged, I went through the software program for a couple of weeks and then decided to take a practice test. Got a 550 and it really freaked me out. I'd like to go to a top school, and a 550 isn't even in the ballpark. I really don't know if Kaplan makes their tests so hard on purpose to scare people into registering for a course, but it almost worked on me.Instead though, I purchased several other books. Without a doubt, the best one for prep is the \\"Official Guide\\". The tests that you get when you register (or from MBA.com) are the best indicators of what you'll actually score. The Princeton review tests seemed much easier than the Kaplan tests (though they proved much more accurate), and the material in that book isn't that great - with the key exception of the writing part. They basically tell you exactly what to do to get a good score - follow their advice, it works.I also got the Kaplan GMAT 800 book. Not great, but not bad. There aren't enough practice problems in this book. You'll do better just practicing the Official Guide problems at the BACK of each section. Make sure that you do the last 100 problems in each section, which are much harder than those at the beginning of each section.Overall this is how I scored on the practice tests, and on the GMAT (so that you can get an idea of how the practice tests compare)Kaplan: 550, 610, 680Princeton: 720, 7402 downloadable tests: 720, 760Actual GMAT: 740In conclusion, while the Kaplan tests report low scores that do not reflect your likely performance on the GMAT, they also serve as good practice. Buy this book, the Official Guide, and the Princeton Review Verbal Workout (for the writing section)."},{"Title":"Kaplan GMAT 2004 with CD-ROM","review":"I'm a GMAT tutor with 15+ years of successful students behind me. Here's what I suggest for the GMAT:1. Use the Kaplan CD (as cheesy as the presentation is, the tests are very good). I've read the complaints below that the prep tests from Kaplan are too hard, and I have to disagree with the point being made by these students. The only way, on a computer-adaptive test, to increase your score is to test using HARDER, not easier problems. I may kick ass at medium level questions, but unless I want a medium level score, practicing at a lower level hurts rather than helps.2. Ignore the Kaplan book. Use The Princeton Review books (either Cracking the GMAT or GMAT Workouts for Math and Verbal) for tricks and psychology. Try the Official Guide for extra problems and basic review issues (but use as much of the Princeton psychology as you can -- the official guide encourages you to do the problems straight, and that's a huge waste of time).3. Take as many practice tests as you can. That means Kaplan, Princeton Review, PowerPrep. Barrons, Petersons, and Dummies are all awful. Don't bother with their instruction or their tests.4. Check out your local library. Many public libraries have crazy collections of old, out of print Official Guides, chock full o paper-and-pencil tests going back a good 20 years. By all means, use these -- they're a goldmine of practice questions.Good luck!"},{"Title":"Kaplan GMAT 2004 with CD-ROM","review":"I bought this book, the Arco Master the Gmat Cat 2004 book, the Offical GMAT Review book, and the Princeton review book (ok, I went a little crazy on the book buying). To be honest, I didn't even crack open the book and just used the CD. The CD was great, it has tutorials on anything and will create a custom study plan based on your diagnostic test. The CD tutorials are probably slower than using the book, but they provide a good overview and have the benefit of preventing you from missing some things that you might ignore in the book. Additionally, they perhaps make the process of studying a little more fun.You can view this as a negative or a positive, but I found the adaptive practice tests on the CD much harder than the PowerPrep tests provided by GMAT or those provided by the other books. On the quantitative section I found myself really pressed for time. Since so much of the GMAT is pacing, the difficulty of these tests can help you learn to work faster, on the downside, they might make you think you have to work faster than you actually do on the real test. My best score on a practice test using this CD was 680. My best score was 770 using the PowerPrep GMAT software, 720 using the Princeton software, and 750 on the actual GMAT.So, as long as you realize that you'll probably do a little better than the Kaplan tests indicate and you at least try the free PowerPrep tests to get a better feel for actual pacing, I think this book is a good bet.If you were only going to buy one book, I'd recommend the official GMAT review book, then the Kaplan, then the Princeton, and then the ARCO."},{"Title":"Kaplan GMAT 2004 with CD-ROM","review":"I am rather suprised at the low overall customer-review rating of this book. I used a combination of online sample tests, the Kaplan book, the Princeton Review and ETS study guides. Of these resources, I feel the Kaplan more closely replicated the questions on the actual GMAT. My score from taking the Kaplan book's exams were consistently within 10 points of my actual score, proving there is incredible similarity between Kaplan's questions and ETS'. The Princeton Review book has reasonable sample questions as well, but explanation as how to arrive at an answer simply don't make a lot of sense. The study CD ETS mails out once you signed up for the test is just incredibly too easy. I steadily scored 700+ every time I took an ETS sample test... my actual was nearly 100 points less. :(The GMAT test knowledge you've built over the years; in reality there's little you can do to significantly increase your score, but you do stand a better chance of feeling prepared by using using these guides.

Threw the CD in the garbage can.- Actual exam, 2 months into studying: 740.I recommend that you finish all exercises in the ETS book, the last math exercises are hard and resemble more what you get on the actual test.

Loved the 2001 edition: it had nice paper - white and thick, very nice for side notes. The book was very well organized and quite condenced - 350 pages. At the end it has a powerful Math review with the most useful formulae; that was one of my favorite sections.The Software is also the best of what I have seen: it is easy to use, helpful, interactive, and funny, which was very helpful to me in those cold winter nights as I was crunching math and verbal. There are about 4 tests on the CD, but you can really take them 6 or 8 times and still see new questions. (maybe my memory is bad?).NOTE: The Tests that are on the CD are not scored the same way as the Official GMAT; you will be about 100 points off (below) from your final GMAT score, so do not let this fact distress you.CD includes 4 full length practice tests, 9 verbal practice tests, 15 math review lessons, 9 math practice tests, quizes, a games, and a great fun interface.Book Score: 5/5Test Simulator: 4/5 (not representative, but tough is good).--Bogdan"},{"Title":"Kaplan GMAT 2004 with CD-ROM","review":"I just took the GMAT and want to share my experience. Hopefully my advice can be helpful to those of you out there who need to prepare for the GMAT.I'm not a native speaker of English and have never taken a standardized test before in my life; yet I scored a 770 on the GMAT in my first try. I owe quite a bit of that score to the Kaplan book - although I never followed their course (or anyone elses for that matter).The Kaplan book is good, but it's the CD rom that's really worth your time. If you follow the quizzes and test exams on the CD rom you'll be in great shape for the actual GMAT.I started out with Arco's 24-hour course. Arco's book is great, and it has quite a bit more stuff on the math and verbal part than Kaplan has. On the other hand, it's still only a book - I didn't get any CD with it.Then I went on to tackle the official guide from ETS. Anyone who wants to prepare for the GMAT should work some of the problems in this book. I did them all, but I don't really think that's neccesary -- just do the final third in each section and you'll be fine.Finally I read the Kaplan book. There was not much in the book that I didn't already know. In fact, Kaplan has much less material than Arco. However, when you start working with Kaplan's CD rom you realize how much info is packed on that disk. There's 18 quizzes with 9 math and 9 verbal and they're all great practice. They actually force you to work *faster* than you'll need for the real test. Also, there are very few errors in the Kaplan material, and their problems come very close to the real ones.I took the four GMAT CATs on the CD rom and got 700, 780, 660 and 700. There's no question that Kaplan artificially lower your score so you're guaranteed to score higher on the real test, but that's cool as long as it doesn't discourage you. Just know that's the way it is.I also took the PowerPrep tests, just for practice... but I had already done the problems in the ETS book ! However you should definitely work with PowerPrep to get a sense of the problems and the way they're presented.Hope this helps. Good luck !!"},{"Title":"Kaplan GMAT 2004 with CD-ROM","review":"This is the first (and probably only) time I will review a book on Amazon. But I promised myself I would do a review after taking my GMAT because the advice of others who have posted their reviews before me were very helpful to me and I wanted to add my experience so it would hopefully help others.My experience with the Kaplan book is a familiar one if you read other reviews on this site (either reviews on this 2004 Kaplan book or on previous GMAT Kaplan books from 2003, etc.). I mainly focused on using the CD-ROM. The CD may seem a little juvenile at times in its presentation but the lessons and the strategies it gives you are helpful. The book mainly gives you the same stuff you'll get on the CD so I mainly skimmed through the book. However, I did like the book's advice on how to ready yourself for the GMAT in the final week.The best piece of advice I can give anybody is when you take the practice tests on the Kaplan CD, DO NOT get discouraged if your scores are lower than you would like. As others have stated, the Kaplan tests are clearly harder than the actual GMAT. If I had not read the reviews of this book on Amazon, I may have never taken the actual test because I was very discouraged by my Kaplan test scores. I understand Kaplan probably wants to make it more difficult so you study harder (and then they can in some fashion take credit for preparing you) but I think they should say something that allows the reader to know that they are getting questions that are generally more difficult than most questions on the actual test.I don't recall exactly what scores I received on Kaplan's CD-ROM tests but I do recall that my highest score on any of them was a 550. To show you how incorrect of a predictor the Kaplan tests are, I scored well over 100 points HIGHER than 550 on my actual GMAT test (I took the actual test on Nov. 21st).Though I think Kaplan is a helpful supplement to use in preparing for the GMAT, I would highly recommend downloading the two free practice tests through MBA.com to get an accurate idea of where you stand. Maybe take one of the two tests right away and see where you are at before you get down to studying. Then maybe save the other practice test for the final week or so before your real GMAT exam.The two downloadable tests are by far the best at honing in on what your actual test score may look like. I would also recommend using the ETS official guide book that you can buy through MBA.com because it has loads of good practice questions (just a warning, some of the questions in the official guide book are repeated in the two downloadable tests).In summary, Kaplan helped me but I got a lot more out of the resources from MBA.com. As long as you don't let Kaplan discourage you, you should be fine. The actual GMAT test is not as bad as you may think and you can do well with some quality study time and doing practice problems. I did MUCH better than Kaplan would predict and I am very happy about it.

The bad part is that the low scores a person gets can lower ones confidence. Good thing that I had read reviews after taking few of the tests and that had made me feel better...Overall the ETS book is the closest to the real GMAT although the tests in ETS are somewhat simpler....I had taken those tests too long back and had scored 690, 710 so dont really bother....another piece of advise - on the real day take the questions one by one no matter how u think u r performing....i had thought i had screwed my exam big time and was expecting a 660-670 when i actually saw 740...there are a lot of experimental questions and the better u r doing the more the chances that the experimental questions would be having ambigous answers...All the best!!"},{"Title":"Kaplan GMAT 2004 with CD-ROM","review":"After being out of school for over 20 years, I decided to take the advice offered on this page in order to focus my preparation.

The CD lessons and book were marginal.Over the course of three weeks, I tried to take a balanced approach by taking only two mini (category-based) tests an evening. On the weekends, I would take a simulated GMAT. As noted in the other reviews, these tests are far more challenging than the PowerPrep test.

It has turned out be a disappointment.I took the GMAT in 1997. I studied with the Princeton Review \\"Beating the GMAT\\" and got a 690. I don't remember liking that book all that much so I expected more from this one. After all, this book includes \\"proven test taking strategies\\" from their $1,000 class...However I found very little of use in this book.

Perhaps that is helpful? For now I will focus on the study guide from the ETS itself. That book provides actual test questions with explanations.So if a book costs $37 and has 352 pages but only 26 pages are useful, what should the price P of the book be?"},{"Title":"Kaplan GMAT 2004 with CD-ROM","review":"I'm bothering to write this review because I'm frustrated. This CDROM (to be fair I barely opened the book) should be great. I found the lessons to be well written and useful, despite the annoying and childish graphics and animations. I also found the mechanics of the test function to be great, with the computer keeping track of both how you changed your answers and which questions you spent your time on. The problem is the questions themselves.The practice tests are a key element, and the questions are poorly written. Some questions have typographical errors and misspellings, others have logic errors. I got one of the math questions wrong because I hadn't considered the possibility that variable x was irrational, despite the fact that the official GMAT instructions clearly state that all numbers are real.I found the free downloadable PowerPrep software from ETS to have much more useful sample tests. The PowerPrep software includes real GMAT questions. I certainly didn't get every question right when I took the tests, but to my relief I agreed with their logic in explaining why my answers were wrong. This was in marked contrast to Kaplan.I still give Kaplan 3 stars out of 5 for the useful lessons. I believe that working through this material probably increased my score by 50 points. But if I were to do it again I would consider skipping Kaplan's tests altogether."},{"Title":"Kaplan GMAT 2004 with CD-ROM","review":"This book really adds very little to the information already dispened in the official GMAT guide.

In the answers to many of the CAT exams presented on the CD, the author will advise you that your time is better spent &quot;going back and reviewing the answers you provided to previous question&quot; which is quite contrary to the nature of GMAT CAT exams where you are not able to go back to a question once a final answer is confirmed.There are some useful tricks and shortcuts on the CD, so definitely go ahead and purchase it, but this should only be used as supplemental material and not as your main study guide."},{"Title":"Kaplan GMAT 2004 with CD-ROM","review":"I bought this book because my friends recommended it to me and after studying this book for few weeks, I found the ways which kaplan present their materials is not bad, however, I think Princeton does a better job.

I find their Math questions is extremely misleading. I wrote many practice exams from different sources: Kaplan, Princeton, ETS and score800. My math score from Princeton, ETS, and score800 were fairly consistent, around 45-47. However, with Kaplan, I only got a 36. I also find some of the answers on the verbal section are incorrect as well. As for the overall score on the exam (math + verbal), I scored only 550 with Kaplan but much much higher with other ones.My recommendation is that do not buy this book unless you have read all other gmat guides and find them not very helpful. The materials covered in this book can be found in any gmat study guides (Princeton, ETS etc.).

Overall, I highly recommend reading this book, following the CD tutorial, and then taking as many practice questions in the Official Guide as possible.I did not take a class because my work schedule would not allow it, so my score is entirely based on self study. But I did go through this book, the CD, and Kaplan Verbal Workbook, the Princeton Review, and the Official Guide. All of which were valuable, but I think the most helpful part of my studying was reading through the Kaplan guide to pick up their tips for dealing with questions and then applying the tips to real problems from the Official Guide.As far as my score history goes, I scored a 590 on the diagnostic, a 550 on my first Kaplan test. I then took an ETS practice test and got a 660. I took the GMAT once and got a 660. Disappointed, I reviewed the material and studied a few hours more, and then took the test again and I scored a 730.Each of the books has value, but I like the Kaplan book better than the Princeton book basically because of differing approaches to the test. Kaplan focuses on helping you solve questions quickly and effectively and guessing if you have to. Princeton helps you figure out how hard a problem is (which is impossible in the real test) and then guess effectively. For me the Kaplan was a much better book overall.Many people complain that the Kaplan tests are too hard, but if you plan to score well you need to be able to complete difficult problems in a short period of time. Practicing hard questions doesn't hurt, as long as you keep you confidence up.

I had bought the usual ETS guide, the Kaplan 2004 with CD Rom, ARCO GMAT 2005 with CD Rom and, to try out something different, Ace the GMAT by Brandon Royal. I'll discuss two of the books I used.1) The Kaplan CD (the irritating toddler level presentation of the CD apart) has the toughest CAT exams. The tests are tough and designed to discourage you.I got 640,580, 600 and 620 in the 4 CAT's, but thanks to previous reviewers of the CD, I didn't lose heart since I knew that my score would be better on the real GMAT.I got a reasonable 710 on the real test.But do practice with these CAT's...the real GMAT is not easy. Practicing with tough questions will really help you think faster over time and not freak out when you see a particularly weird question on the real test.Also, the mini tests and the diagnostics do not give you enough time to finish them..but they are still some of the best questions to practice on.The book however, is not as good as the CD. ARCO does a better job of explaining the strategies and answers.2) Ace the GMAT, by Brandon Royal : This book is great for verbal practice as it breaks down Sentence Correction and Critical Reasoning into \\"problem types' and is very very comprehensive. When I started preparing for the GMAT two months before I was due to take the test, I had no idea about the verbal content.My native language is not English and I had never really learned english grammar at school. I can say that it's this book which put my fears to rest and showed me step by step, that even tricky grammar can be mastered in a short while....at least enough to do well on the GMAT. I got a 96th percentile on verbal and I attribute this score to this book.The other great feature about this book is the Analytical Writing portion.The essay structures are simple and can be easily reproduced and make scoring a 5.0 or better easy on the real test."},{"Title":"Kaplan GMAT 2004 with CD-ROM","review":"In my personal mission to suceede on the GMAT I feel very comfortable with all of the books, and their high and low points. Honestly for me, this book was the best. The Princeston Review is a little too easy, and not quite as though as it should be. The Barron's is a little too difficult and does not seem to focus on what is really at hand.Kaplan book is written in an almost conversational style that will help guide and direct you in the areas that you need to study in. A thorough pretest is given, so you can know where you fall behind. From here you can then practice on the areas that you need.The book gives specific review information in for Reading comprehension, Math Review, Critical Reasoning, and Data Sufficency. The book gives tips, tricks, and ideas for mastering these questions that are easy to remember. The book also gives you some small lists that you should flat out memorize.This book comes with the best CD. The CD alone is well worth the price of the book. The CD comes with a pretest, and once you take the pretest, it comes out with several plans for you: long time to study, cram mode. The CD is interactive with video, games, and much more. Definately worthwhile on this basis alone.Out of all of the prep guides, this is the one you should pick up, best written book, and with the adaptive computer tests, and study guides on the CD you can't go wrong with this test."},{"Title":"Kaplan GMAT 2004 with CD-ROM","review":"Kaplan's \\"GMAT\\" book is good for getting into the right state of mind needed to succeed in the test and learning the powerful strategies for solving the hard questions. The strategies are similar (if not identical) to the strategies given in the Princeton Review book, though the latter explains some of the techniques better (and there lies the strength of the Princeton Review).The CD-ROM is the heart of the bargain.Packed with hundreds of questions and explanations, this CD provides countless hours of invaluable practice. In fact, the CDs of other companies I checked out don't begin to compare to Kaplan's.Nevertheless, there are two things you need to know in advance so that you won't be disheartened once you start working on the CD:The first is Kaplan's motto - \\"no pain no gain\\". Once you begin solving tests you'll discover that they are painfully difficult. The level of the tests' questions sometimes rises above the level of the real GMAT questions, but only sometimes. Bear in mind that the actual test is very hard and is made to challenge everyone, therefore it's mandatory not to be intimidated and to experience as many hard questions as possible.The second important thing is to remember that the test scores they supply are no way near the actual results you will eventually get on test day, probably because they use a different score calculating method from the one ETS uses. The reason for this might be rooted in the book and CD makers' possible goal - though not state out loud - to draw you to enroll in one of their preparation courses. Take my word for it, after seeing results for your first scored test - you WILL want to sign in immediately. Remember to take it in perspective.To sum it all up, keep in mind that as long as you make progress and keep on getting better results in adaptive tests from different sources you're on the road to success."},{"Title":"Kaplan GMAT 2004 with CD-ROM","review":"Like a couple of others who have reviewed this book, I promised that I would write in once I had completed the GMAT. Kaplan is frustrating and misleading.While the tutorials on the CD may have some useful information, they are childish and annoying in the way they are presented. I don't need a cartoon of a pussycat to explain computer adaptive testing to me. I think I'm motivated by a little more than cute graphics. Turning the soundtrack off was definitely a good idea.The main problem with the GMAT itself is that it is oriented towards the US education system. Subsequently, explanations of 'correct idiomatic language' are little more than facile lists that one should commit to memory. I'm a native English speaker from the southern hemisphere and I would never use many of the phraseologies dictated as 'correct'. Neither of the two books I used (Kaplan and the Official Review) sought to compensate for this, but I found Kaplan's answers particularly annoying.The quantative section in Kaplan is also devised to make you learn by rote rather than first principles. The disadvantage is that you don't learn to derive the answers yourself but apply patterns. And yes, it means more rote learning. The Kaplan questions were harder than those in the test and time allowed for the practice tests less than that allowed in the actual GMAT. Everything was geared up to give the impression that the test was harder than it actually was.The verbal questions in Kaplan were also misleading. Many of the 'correct' answers were difficult to justify and some illogical. It was clear that some of the questions were produced on a Friday afternoon and weren't checked well. The main problem was that the distinctions between answers was often very slight and the 'correct' answer asked you to make either a giant assumption or crawl inside the question writer's head to know what they're thinking.The section on the AWA is fairly rudimentary and the help available on this is limited. However, I've yet to find anything better on this other than paying for the computerised assessment on www.mba.com.On the real test I had the common experience of scoring 100 points above the scores I got on the Kaplan CD.Overall, I'd get the official review. If that doesn't have enough practice for you - you have too much time on your hands!!! I think confidence counts for more on the day than anything else."},{"Title":"Kaplan GMAT 2004 with CD-ROM","review":"I had no idea what the GMAT covered, so this book was a good introduction to each section with basic tips to approaching specific question types. The CD-rom was helpful and contains a lot of additional practice material.Don't let your performance on the CD CAT exams discourage you. I only gave this book three stars because the practice questions are so ridiculously hard that you consider signing up for their $1250 class. My Kaplan practice test results were as follows (in chronological order):- Paper 600- Diagnostic 590- CAT 1 550- CAT 2 550 (I was ready to give up at this point.)My scores from the ETS CD:- CAT 1 610- CAT 2 720My actual score was a 700. Do as many practice questions as you can, from this book and the ETS Official Guide to the GMAT. Good luck!"},{"Title":"Kaplan GMAT 2004 with CD-ROM","review":"Unfourtunetely, I was expecting Kaplan's book to help me and develop my scores at GMAT. But this book didn't help me at all.The diagnostic test is the same as the year's 2000 edition. So if you are lucky and find it in some used bookstore don't even hesitate. All the extras added to this revision are usless. The online help that they promote in the cover are the same examples as in teh CD ROM.Added to this, I write a complain to the client service department, and three month later I'm still waiting for a response. Please consider t buy an older version of this book, it will save you money.If I have to highlight one advantage of this book will be the additional GMAT CAT TEST 4. But be aware if you do the paper based test first. You will find that most of the questions are going to be asked to you again in the CD ROM so one point less to KAPLAN 2004 edition."},{"Title":"Kaplan GMAT 2004 with CD-ROM","review":"The Kaplan's and Princeton Review's &quot;main&quot; preparation books are quite similar with each other. Both make the same categorization for the types of problems in each of the areas of GMAT, but I think that in Kaplan's book the approaches to solve the problems are better organized and described. The questions of the Kaplan's book are more difficult than in the Princeton Review's book.The CD that comes with the book is superb. It contains a lot of very difficult questions and strict time limits to answer them. Especially the reading comprehension questions were a lot harder than e.g. in The Official Guide for GMAT. Don't get depressed about your test result scores, you will propably score better in the actual GMAT. By the way, I did not encounter any problems with the CD like some other reviewers. The music of the CD was horrible, but you can live with it.I would recommend this book for the preparation of GMAT."},{"Title":"Kaplan GMAT 2004 with CD-ROM","review":"Even after reading several reviews that warned the Kaplan practice test scores were lower than the actual GMAT scores, I worried about the results. Then, I took the second Official GMAT practice test and scored 100 points higher. When I took the actual GMAT, I scored even a bit higher than that.The CD was silly but helpful, and the more difficult problems forced me to think and work more quickly. I wish I had started with this instead of Barron's!"},{"Title":"Kaplan GMAT 2004 with CD-ROM","review":"The verbal section was thorough, thoughtfull, and very well organized. It really helped me to tackle corresponding questions on actual GMAT test. I'd especially recommend reading verbal section of the book to not native English speakers.The review of math was not regorous but good. I'd say that in order to answer math section, you need to have fundamental knowledge and some creativity, and the book seemed to address math in a straightforward manner. However, I'd strongly suggest those students who once passed Powerprep test and relaxed to review Kaplan math section. Both Kaplan and actual GMAT maths are much harder than that on Powerprep test.CD was very helpful. I'd recommend to pass all practice tests and simulations on it. Don't get frustrated by annoying introes and interface - just click Escape several times and get to real practice.One thing with the book is that instructions and some explanations are written in such childish and conspiratorial language as the one, I remember, my grand-mother was using when she had told me tales at night :) I believe the authors should address this issue in the next edition.Overall impression of the book and CD - good."},{"Title":"Kaplan GMAT 2004 with CD-ROM","review":"Went through the practice sessions, skipped the diagnostic and went for the first Computer test. Got 670 ... wasn't happy but wasn't very disappointed either. Found a bunch of questions ambiguous too. Week later tried computer test 2 ... 600!!Panicked. But then remebered that the same kinda thing happened to me with GRE before (used Barrons that time). So I came to this site and found some solace in that other people found this test unrepresentative.Week later, tried powerprep test 1, got 750 and felt happy and vindicated. Secure in the knowledge that I was better than I thought I was, I decided to keep trying Kaplan tests. Week later... tried diagnostic paper test (was running out of tests by this time)... got 670. Tried Kaplan comp test 3 - 700 (this one has a question that refers to a nonexistent table!!!). Comp test 4 - 640.A week before the real thing tried powerprep test 2 - 770. Felt real good, but thought it would be presumptuous to trash Kaplan before taking the real thing.Today I wrote the real thing - got 760. So... here's what I think about this Kaplan thingie...Questions, especially in the verbal section, are ambiguous and almost always will leave you with two competing alternatives. I dont think that can be characterized as &quot;difficult&quot;, frustrating definitely. Real GMAT questions make you &quot;feel&quot; much better about the questions. Also, I flat out disagreed with some of the Kaplan answers and explanations. Others left me simmering unsurely.In hindsight I fully endorse the strategy I adopted. Take a powerprep test early on, and if you get a good score on that, you can continue taking Kaplan tests (to keep the momentum going) secure in the knowledge that your real GMAT scoring capability is better. Let the second powerprep test be the last mock test you take.However, I am not sure what advice to give you if your first powerprep test bombed. You probably have some areas to improve on, and if those areas happen to be in the verbal section then for sure Kaplan will not help you. Try getting retired GMAT paper tests (GMAC sells them on their website) but beware... these questions are known to be repeated in other powerprep tests, by GMAC's own admission upto 50% of retired test material is repeated in powerprep. Or you could try other vendors like Princeton review etc (dont know how good they are though)."},{"Title":"Heaven's Price","review":"I thought it was a really good book. The plot was excellent the characters caring and romantic and it was just such a good book that I could not put it down. And besides, it was a pretty funny book...many jokes and that totally made the book enjoyable."},{"Title":"Heaven's Price","review":"I disliked this novel. Deeply.The hero is sexist from chapter one to the very end. I found very disgusting that he pretended to be the masseur the heroine was expecting. It wasn't sexy at all.It seems that the novel supports this idea: if you are a woman and love your career passionately, it must be because you have a psychological problem. Apparently, it is great if your dreams get shattered. So you can devote yourself to what seems to be the natural destiny of women, marry and have children.Not to mention the topic of the gay dancer (it is not stated, but it is obvious). Of course, it must be a tragic figure. Really? New York, 1983? And the dancers had to be in the closet?I don't find a good reason to publish again this not-so-golden-oldie. If you have a feminist sensitivity, this novel is not certainly for you. And don't tell me that all 1980s novels were sexist. It's not true. Sandra Brown's are not usually so male chauvinist."},{"Title":"Heaven's Price","review":"This was a short story about seduction. I have nothing against seduction. I like it a lot. BUT, you have to care about the characters in order for the seduction to be touching and moving. Ms Brown writed excellent sex/love scenes, but needs to write a good story around them. Skip this book. There are many good books out there to read. Try Madeline Hunter, Mary Balough, Connie Brockway, Jo Beverley, to name a few, if you want good stories with moving intimacy."},{"Title":"Heaven's Price","review":"Heaven's Price is really a sweet romance. Sure, its almost the same as Adam's Fall (also by Sandra Brown), except for the character conditions and the gender, but its still so good.Sean Garrett is Blair Simpson's landlord, she's living in the place that belongs to Sean now, because she's recovering her knees. (Blair iz a dancer) Blair and Sean has this attraction and...WEll I can't say the whole thing, but trust me, if you readers liked Adam's Fall, then you'll deffinitely like Heaven's Price. Sandra Brown is a great romance writer !!"},{"Title":"Heaven's Price","review":"The book was very good and I would recommed this book to my friends. Sandra Brown is a good writer and story teller and I will continue reading her books"},{"Title":"Heaven's Price","review":"This story is a quick read. I started it noon on a Saturday and finished it Saturday night. I liked the romantic and career dilemmas of the novel but one thing irritated me. The characters fell into it sooooooo quickly. There was NO anticipation or strained anxious moments because they started off in the novel already pretty hot and heavy...even with only knowing each other and hour and some change. If you can get past that little point it's a funny mindless read for a nice afternoon on the deck or on the beach."},{"Title":"Heaven's Price","review":"WOW - this book opens with a massage scene that is incredibly sensual and tantilizing, and the hot and steamy tone continues throughout. Sean is a bit too agressive and Blair is a bit too selfish, yet when they come together, they are a powerhouse who teach each other valuable lessons about life, values and priorities. A short and fast read, this book packs a lot of punch."},{"Title":"Heaven's Price","review":"I found this story to be a bit to predictable for met. It is one of the early romance stories by Sandra Brown. If you are used to her suspense stories this will be a let down.Blair is a dancer who had injured her knees and moves to a small town where a former dancer friend of hers lives. In this town she meets her landlord and a romance blooms....This refers to the abridged audio tape version. It may be better in book form it seemed way to predictable in this form."},{"Title":"Heaven's Price","review":"I'm hooked! This is the first Sandra Brown book I've read but it will not be the last. I loved it! Can't wait to get my hands on another of her books (if I ever stop re-reading this one)!"},{"Title":"Heaven's Price","review":"What can one say? Another good book by Sandra Brown. I now own the entire lot of her books and never fail to enjoy them immensely."},{"Title":"Heaven's Price","review":"Heaven's Price is a very funny love story. Of course, it has a predictable ending, as some reviewers have mentioned, but it's suppose to. It's a romantic comedy. It is really sweet and will keep you laughing if you have a sense of humor."},{"Title":"Heaven's Price","review":"Loveswept #1.

His touch ignited fireworks that lit up the heavens and shamed the star-streaked Long Island skies.
