Shinn has created yet another masterpiece. While not quite as good as any of the books in the Samaria trilogy, this book has its share of qualities that should delight anyone who is a fan of Shinn's work. I have found all of her books a great read and always tough to put down once I start reading. Ms. Shinn cannot write books fast enough for me. As soon as I finish one I want to read another. Definitely one of today's great authors. Deserves much more appreciation and fanfare than she gets."},{"Title":"Wrapt in Crystal","review":"I stayed up all night to finish this book. Not only does she do action and romance well, but she manages to portray people with very different viewpoints in a sympathetic way. I usually don't like romance much, and I usually like more poetic prose -- but this author makes me feel comfortable and warm, using simple, readable prose to portray likeable characters. The only way I can describe the story is to say it is a science fiction space opera detective romance action novel with strong religious overtones. How's that for a combo?Our hero is Drake, a pretty standard stereotypical &quot;private dick&quot; character who is the perfect leading man for a romance novel or action story. He's sort of a gentleman space marine with a keen mind and unearthly competence - the kind of guy that doesn't really exist, but that women dream of. Fortunately the women in the book and the plot are interesting enough that rather than be distracted by the uber-detective you will be constantly wondering which of the ladies he's going to end up with, and whodunnit. The book is fun and suprisingly intelligent while seeming very down-to-earth and accessible.If like her angel stories, you'll like this book, too."},{"Title":"Wrapt in Crystal","review":"This is the first Sharon Shinn book I've ever read, but I've heard good things about her other books (Archangel, Jovah's Angel) so I decided to give it a try.I liked the setting, but I do wish some things had been explained in a bit more detail, like the Moonchildren. I especially liked the use of words from &quot;our&quot; languages, altered to reflect the passage of time. It's a detail many &quot;colony of earth&quot; sci-fi writers ignore or bungle.I can't say the mystery enthralled me, I figured the second biggest mystery about half-way through the book. The &quot;whodunnit&quot; part was weak, but this book is worth reading purely for the philosophy of the Triumphantes.It's a believable world, and the characters are well-drawn. I don't regret buying it."},{"Title":"Wrapt in Crystal","review":"Having read about this book for years I have no idea why it was so hard for me to read it at first. I would pick it up, put it down, and find a new book to read (something I never do) and then try t again. Something just wasn't clicking for me. Finally I decided that I had read too many books by this author and they were too formulaic somehow. All of Sharon Shinn's heroes are noble, hopelessly, selflessly, charmingly, noble. Admittedly if one must have a hero in a book it is good to make that hero a good man, but the profile with this author is too narrow. You could take a hero out of any of her novels and drop into another one and with the exception of some angel wings, never know the difference.Only this book is different. To summarize-\\"Wrapt in Crystal\\" is about a planet that is on the verge on joining a confederation of planets (think Star Trek) and brining with it a much wealthier planet. But this planet has some reservations. So when priestesses of the major religion on the planet, from both sects of the religion, start turning up murdered the planetary forces strike a deal. A Moonchild investigator (the moonchildren are like the space police) will come and solve the serial killings, and then maybe the planet will federate.So we meet Cowen Drake, a man who lost his faith a long time ago. Like all of Shinn's heroes he is selfless, smart, charming, and more than a little bit damaged. He's also puzzled about the murdered because on Semay (the planet) the priestesses are sacred and off limits to any kind of violence. There is no discernable reason anyone would want to kill either a joy worshiping Triumphante or a more solemn Fidele. In fact the only clue he has to this mystery is one that doesn't even fit the puzzle-a young Triumphante priestess who disappeared into thin air after unspeakable tragedy.And as he learns the language and culture of the planet, and becomes friends with two very different amazing priestess (\\"as different as joy and sorrow\\") the murdered is coming closer and closer to what he seeks....I say this book is different because of the spiritual nature of it. Shinn obviously put in a lot of thought to the religion she created and the culture it serves. Not only that but the book raises some interesting issues in and off itself about faith and it is a double edges sword: how easy it is to lose it, or lose yourself in it to avoid life altogether. There's also a current running through this book about light and redemption that is-well, almost spooky because of how appealing it is. I would recommend this book for that aspect along, although the mystery isn't that bad. I figured it out before Drake did, but he was a little distracted, and too be fair I didn't have every element figured out.So in the end this is a book worth reading. Tragic heroes do have their place after all, and Drake is a great example of that. And the ending is amazing.Four stars."},{"Title":"Wrapt in Crystal","review":"While Wrapt in Crystal did not enthrall me the way Archangel did, it was an excellent, suspenseful mystery (but don't read the Kirkus review-- it gives it all away). Shinn's writing, as usual, is lyrical and lovely and the plot moves quickly.I'm really not much for sci-fi, and am the antithesis of religious, but apart from that, I had one major quibble. The language is supposedly a mixture of Spanish, Italian and French. As an avid Spanish student, I noticed many major grammatical errors in noun gender agreement, misuse of the Ud./tu form and inconsistent use of the subjunctive... It annoyed me so much that my enjoyment of the overall book was lowered. So if you speak Spanish, be prepared! All in all though, still a very well-written book."},{"Title":"Wrapt in Crystal","review":"I picked up this book on the off chance when it came into the bookstore that I work at. The title caught my attention. I found the story a little lacking in places, but on the whole it was a wonderful piece of writing. The most lacking part of the story seemed to be the budding romace that was building during the novel. I think that could have been developed a little more to work a bit better with the mystery story line. The blending of fantasy and sci-fi was nice. It is rare when an author can take the idea of the future and combine it nicely with the average aspects of fantasy. I hope that her other books turn out to be as nice of a read as this one was."},{"Title":"Wrapt in Crystal","review":"Lt. Cowen Drake, SAO (Special Agent) for Interfed's Moonchild Forces, has been sent to the desert planet Semay to investigate a series of murders. Priestesses from Semay's two ruling religious factions, Triumphantes and Fideles, are the victims and Drake must find the connections between the two very disparate sects. During his investigation, Cowen must confront his own sad religious history and deal with the fact that he is slipping into love with one of the high priestesses.This was a hard book to finish, the main character is repressed (and depressed) and the entire story sad and dreary. Shinn explores in great detail religious convictions and faith, but there is none of the humor and spark of her Samaria novels. It also didn't help that the solution to the mystery was evident hundreds of pages before the ending."},{"Title":"Wrapt in Crystal","review":"Love mysteries and fantasies so when there's a crossover, I have to buy the book. Purchase is particularly a must when one of my favorite authors has written the novel.This is not the best of Shinn's work. I like \\"Heart of Gold\\" or any of the prior \\"Alleluia Files\\" better.A serial killer is stalking priestesses from two very diverse orders on the planet Semay. The Triumphantes worship the Goddess as joy and live a lavish life, while the Fideles serve the poor and live very spartan lives. The killer's taking women from both septs. Detective Cowan, who has lost his faith, is tasked to charge this mystery and to understand the sisters.The novel definitely breaks ground and it's interesting to read, but doesn't pull you from page to page as a good mystery should. If you're just starting with Shinn's books, pick another. You may want to read this later because her work is very good, but this is not the best first impression."},{"Title":"Wrapt in Crystal","review":"I got this book from the swap website paperbackswap.com.I've started to be into romance books lately. Mostly, I think from this author. This book definitely takes you into the world of Senya, a desert planet with a serial killer. The main character, Cowen, is sent as the person to solve the murders. Along the way he finds the case has more than it's normal twists. He starts to get involved with the locals. I loved the combination of Mystery/Sci-Fi/Romance in this book. I would recommend this for Sci-Fi readers that enjoy a little additional romance to their books."},{"Title":"Wrapt in Crystal","review":"Having read most of Sharon Shinn's novels, and loved them all, (I started with the Samaria trilogy)I have to say this was a bit of a dissapoitment.

I loved the Samaria Trilogy (except for the plethora of &quot;riotous curls&quot;).I could not stand Wrapt in Crystal.The world was minorly interesting, but the religious beliefs did not have the fullness and richness that marks the beliefs of any religion I've encountered before. (...Dogmatic people tend to be dogmatic about more than one thing...)Also...the characters.Her male hero is completely unbelievable. He's supposed to be macho, but the guy waxes poetic about pretty scenery, children, etc., etc. Split personality.As with some of the other readers, the mystery was not something to carry me. Nobody that I cared about was murdered. Until the end, no part of the mystery provided tension. In fact, the &quot;lead&quot; that the hero follows seemed rather weak throughout.And if I read one more word about flowing, golden, riotous, silken hair...Is this worth my meager tuppence? Is it worth spending on a book rather than upon dinner for a few days?"},{"Title":"Wrapt in Crystal","review":"The characters in this book were paperthin and stereotypical for their professions. Every thought and action was predictable, but not necessairly realistic. That the Fidele heroine, Laura, did a lot of walking at all hours of the night and the hero spent a lot of time cruising around in this car at the same time didn't do much to develop their characters, nor was their behaviour credible in view of their action-packed days. The hero's social and diplomatic skills portrayed in the book wouldn't have worked for a pre-schooler, let alone for a clearly delicate interplanetary mission. The obvious analogy between Interfed and The good ole US of A. didn't work for me being the wise, magnanimous and powerful entity until I started to read the book as a parody."},{"Title":"Wrapt in Crystal","review":"I regret spending the money to buy this book.In simple terms, it was not very good-- not fom the likes of a writer of Sharon Shinn's caliber.She has shown her capacity for breathtaking and lyrical writing in the past, but she is sleep-walking through this book.Purely going through the motions.Some might find it unfair to compare two bodies of work, since Shinn's Samaria novels are not related to &quot;Wrapt in Crystal&quot; and has a totally different story concept.True,but it is completely fair to compare the reality of the two cultures and, quite frankly, Samaria seemed like a rich, detailed and fully-realized society to me and Semay did not.The desert planet and the larger galactic society surrounding it is composed of bits and pieces of SF hash that has been seen before in dozens of books.There is nohing unique about any of it.There are also many embarassing flaws in the novel.Although not a language savant like the other reviewer who noticed it, I too saw the grammer errors in the supposed language of Semayse.Shinn also uses laughable anachronisms all through the novel, like &quot;stereo&quot; and &quot;radio&quot;.We probably won't be using these terms fifteen years from now, let alone centuries in the future.&quot;Personal computer&quot; and &quot;compact disc&quot; weren't in the vernacular twenty years ago, remember?It is pure sloppiness for an author not to do the work it takes to render a future society truly futuristic, and that includes uses of language.I was also bothered by the fact that the three main female characters were such sexual stereotypes.I also disliked the fact that Drake seemed treatened and uninterested in the two who were in touch with their own sexuality and fell for the repressed one.What are you trying to say, Ms. Shinn?This is not to say, though, that I liked the behavior of any of the female characters, or any of the characters for that matter.I didn't care about one, single person depicted in the book, and that what is so surprising from a work of Shinn's.In her Samaria novels, whether you liked or hated them, she always made you feel for the characters.I only finished &quot;Wrapt in Crystal&quot; to find out who the killer was, and that, too, was disappointing.Without giving away the conclusion, let me just say that no person would ever go about matters the way the killer did.Stealth and inquiry would have served him much better than brutal murder, which only caused the authorities to put themselves on his trail, of course!Stealth and inquiry will serve you better if you seek out another book to read than this."},{"Title":"Wrapt in Crystal","review":"Imagine getting to write a book about religion and not ticking anybody off. That is what this book does. It uses the story as a vehicle to compare the aesthetic and celebratory aspects of religion. The downside is the lack of true depth that religion really has.

Still it's fun to be able to take this look."},{"Title":"Wrapt in Crystal","review":"Wrapt in Crystal is a deft blend of mystery and social science fiction, with colorful characters and complex world building.

Her stories are, quite frankly, nothing wildly new or unpredictable. But I don't go to them for novelty. I go to them for a kind of literary equivalent of a warm blanket.This novel did more for me than the vast majority of her stories, which really are just...a literary warm blanket. In it, there's an at least moderately interesting discussion of different types of faiths and way of expressing them in a way that is complimentary rather than divisive. It's nice. It's warm and fuzzy. It made me happy.Is it great literature? Probably not. But for a fairly interesting discussion of faith wrapped up in good story telling and a warm and fuzzy narrative, this is a great book."},{"Title":"Wrapt in Crystal","review":"Who is killing the priestesses of two opposing religious orders and why? That is the plot basic and Miss Shinn does an excellent job of following clues and developing the relationships between the characters.I was unsure what to expect from this novel which is a stand alone story unrelated to her other series. It is a very different kind of story from what I usually expect from her. I can't say I enjoyed it as much as her 12 Houses and Archangel series but I did enjoy it on its own merits and thought it was worth a 5 star rating.If you like her other books you will probably like this one. If you're looking for the most exciting, most adventuresome who done it in town this isn't it. If you are on the fence about buying it I would say take the chance.

Harris does a good job describing not only the details of Dorsey's life, but setting him in the musical worlds he inhabited in the early 20th Century. My current research work does not include religious music, and I have been doing a lot of work on ragtime and the origins of the Blues as they related to the five string banjo. This book provided new insights on the nature of the Blues, on the relationship between the vaudveille Blues, Downhome Blues, and jazz in the 1920s that recent reading on Jelly Roll Morton, and the origins of Jazz and the Blues did not. At the same time, the book provides broad and ojective coverage of major trends in the Black church especially the National Baptist Convention in the first thirty years of the 20th Century.Besides that he speaks of Dorsey and the origin of Blues Gospel. Put shortly, Black religious music in the early 20th century was dominated by forces who wanted to squelch African originated forms of religion and worship and impose European and European American models for services and music. In the Chicago of the 1920s, the major churches were dominated by music and choir directors who had been trained in Europe to produce superb classical religious music and any kind of African American singing and praise and testifying was often banned from the church as a whole or from the Sunday service.The pressure of Black migration from the South placed a demand on conservative churches to hold onto their congregations. After a career as a mediocre Blues pianist, more successful arranger and band leader for Ma Rainey, while enjoying success in the Blues as George Tom, well known for his dirty songs, Dorsey crafted gospel songs and more importantly gospel performance patterns modeled after the music and the acts put on by successful Blues singers. He first worked with a former preacher singing his songs and walking in rhythm around churches. When they were first able to perform this way, Dorsey--always the accompaniest--would stand up at the piano, while this preacher danced and strutted as he sang his song. The congregation got wild.Dorsey's goal seemed to be advancing his music publishing business by popularizing his songs with soloists. It was almost an after thought that in accepting a lucrative position as music director at a major Chicago Baptist church that he set up a gospel chorus, a move that was copied and duplicated as the blues-gospel movement swept the country.The blues gospel approach provided a compromise. The old line preachers were fundamentally against African forms of congregational worship, singing by the whole church, the old church rock songs, testifying and other African aspects of religion. Gospel offered the music in a contained form, not done by the whole congregation, but performed by a contained gospel solist or gospel choir, and presenting a limited period in which shouting, testifying, and praising in the old way was possible without transforming the service.Throughout, Dorsey was not shy in judging his success as a commerical venture. He speaks about success in the number of employees and the amount of space he had shipping out sheet music. Since his aims were to give religious music the music feel and performance style of blues entertainment, it is hardly surprising that Blues Gospel especially in the person of Dorsey's great protege Mahalia Jackson became first an informal form of entertainment within the Black church world, and then aform that could be found in night clubs, variety shows, and jazz concert.A lot of thought should be given to the importance of the gospel blues. Post WWII Black popular music began with waning swing singers and older Blues singers leading off R & B. However, the generations of Black R & B singers since the late 1940s have almost exclusively come out of the gospel music industry on the top or the bottom. Soul music beginning with Ray Charles' break into his own voice in the 1950s is not much more than adding the techniques and approaches of the gospel of the 1950s and 1960s to secular music. In this sense it returns to secular music what the religious music had received from Dorsey's Blues.However, if Dorsey had not figured out how to legitimate Blues music style with the establish Black church, the openning to perform this kind of Black music by the religious authorities was important to keeping the music going. One should remember the degree to which Black churches outside the holiness churches, particularly in the South, forbade or condemned secular music and Blues. Now, I believe whether Dorsey or some other individual had done it, African religious and music traditions would have fought their way back into Black churches. Yet, if there hadn't been a Thomas Dorsey, it might have been harder, and more distance might have been made between Black religious and secular music."},{"Title":"The Rise of Gospel Blues: The Music of Thomas Andrew Dorsey in the Urban Church","review":"Such a great talented church composer I've started to read the book It's amazing how he turned his life around to compose strictly for the church:)"},{"Title":"The Rise of Gospel Blues: The Music of Thomas Andrew Dorsey in the Urban Church","review":"A terrific resource on Thomas Dorsey.

I did not realize that Mr. Dorsey had two nervous break downs. It is fascinating to me that that many talented people suffer from some sort of mental illness. However, he was tenacious and continued to sell his gospel blues, though at times succumbing to playing the blues to make money.The main line black churches, in this instance, primarily the Baptist was not having it, though we know the AMEs (African Methodist Episcopal) churches did not support black folk ways either. These so called progressive black churches in Chicago had complete and utter disdain for the southern black worship styles. They were not welcoming to Dorsey at all. They were only interested in proving to the mainstream society that they could be just as dull as them. They played European music and did not tolerate clappin', shoutin', expressive sayins' or nothin', etc. They were desperate to distance themselves from their slave culture and history and blues, shoutin', dancing, clapping, etc. reminded them of their past and they desperately wanted to take on European worship style."},{"Title":"The Heaven Makers","review":"Have you ever seen someone do something senseless, and then heard them say \\"What made me do that?\\" Have you ever seen something you couldn't explain, and wondered if you were the only one who saw it?

David Linvingstone takes us on a journey through her life from the very beginning to when this book was published.

The book breaks down into five sections covering the beginnings of the five greatest ad-man of all time - founders of Lord & Thomas (Lasker), Leo Burnett (Leo Burnett), O&M (Ogilvy), Publicis (Bleustein-Blanchet) and DDB (Bernbach). The book basically covers simple facts about their lives and how the business began, what clients they served and the famous campaigns they did. The book did not however, go into the full details on how the campaigns were conducted, why they did what they did, etc, etc... It's not a heavy read and took me just a few hours... interesting as I did not know much about Lasker, Bleistein-Blanchet and Bernbach. In terms of personal enhancement... the book will not make you a better ad-man nor copywriter... just an interesting read... recommended for the starters..."},{"Title":"Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation and Other Evolutionary Writings","review":"This is one of the most enjoyable books I have read this year. It's a true time travel through pre &quot;Darwin-Wallace&quot; natural history, and even more, since it deals with theories as the Nebular Hypothesis. This was, at his time, an all best-seller, specially if you consider it was a science book and not a novel. Robert Chambers style is exquisite, it certainly was a pleasure reading this book, and as in all books from certain epoch, this one is no exception, you can clearly read between the lines and learn a lot about what victorian society believed and what prejudices did they had. Delightful, but if you don't enjoy classics, please dont' even try this one, this is only for classic lovers."},{"Title":"Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation and Other Evolutionary Writings","review":"Robert Chambers (1802-1871) was a Scottish writer who wrote this work anonymously; its views---while not yet espousing \\"evolution\\" as such---were clearly leading in that direction, and this 1844 work received (and thus deflected) much of the criticism that would have otherwise have gone to Darwin's \\"Origin of Species.\\"Chambers notes that \\"(T)here is not the least appearance of an intention in (the Bible) to give philosophically exact views of nature.\\" Noting the progressive development evident in the fossil record, he asserts that the notion that the Creator \\"interfere personally and specially on every occasion when a new shell-fish or reptile was to be ushered into existence\\" was \\"too ridiculous to be for a moment entertained.\\"He suggests, \\"What is to hinder our supposing that the organic creation is also a result of natural laws, which are in like manner an expression of his will?\\" He argues that \\"I take existing natural means, and shew them to have been capable of producing all the existing organisms, with the simple and easily conceivable aid of a higher generative law, which we perhaps still see operating upon a limited scale.\\"He is not dogmatic, stating, \\"I do not indeed present these ideas as furnishing the true explanation of the progress of organic creation; they are merely thrown out as hints...\\"This is an important work for anyone interested in Natural Theology, or the history of evolutionary thought."},{"Title":"World Almanac and Book of Facts 2004","review":"While there are a few almanacs that purport to be world comprehensive, each one seems to have a particular emphasis or general perspective--subtle as it may be. Thus, the World Almanac 2004 captures in exceptional detail news, statistics, and histories primarily associated with the U.S.The histories included are by themselves a gem of discovery, especially the year-by-year capsules of U.S. history. Also, the biographies of U.S. presidents, the review of the amendments, and the state-by-state geographical summaries are presented with well-organized brevity.Crossing international lines, the almnanac also covers the highlights in astronomy, science and technology, and a fascinating chronology of human spaceflight. The summations of the world's nations are concise and intriguing, including even the official web site for each country.For the sheer numbers of it all, The World Almanac 2004 is quite impressive. Also, I highly recommend the hardcover edition as it contains much larger print and can easily lie open by itself."},{"Title":"World Almanac and Book of Facts 2004","review":"First of all, this will be a great almanac for you if you are focusing only on US studies. This book contains everything from main events to average teacher salaries, and many other useful (and weird) facts of the united states. However, when i tried to look up information on India and Argentina, it contains very few information. I'll guess that 97% of the book focuses only on America and have minor out-of-date information on other countries. Two stars is for the indepth info on united states, and the missing three stars are for naming the book \\"world\\" almanac even though it does not focus on the world. May as well be the United States Almanac for the hunnger-for-weird-facts."},{"Title":"Veterans at Risk: The Health Effects of Mustard Gas and Lewisite","review":"In WWII the US subjected around 60,000 US servicemen to chemical warfare experiments. The objectives of these experiments was two-fold: improve protection and defense against enemy CW, and comprehend the requirements necessary for an Allied CW retaliation.BG Alden Waitt stated in WWII that what the US lacked was something authoratative on CW. These field trials led to the two part report &quot;Tachnical Aspects of Chemical Warfare in the Field&quot; (TACWIF, 1946), and the experience that may have been necessary in response to an Axis CW offensive.Unfortunately, these 60,000 servicement were exposed to chemicals that are now known carcinogens at a time when such latent effects were not appreciated. That, on top of the intense security surrounding CW research has resulted in a large body of veterans that had suffered health consiquences without compensation or assistance.Veteran's at Risk is a technical report on what those health consiquences are by reviewing the toxicology and medical knowledge on Mustard Gas and Lewisite. It also reviews the technical literature resulting from the WWII field trials and experiments. In the end, the NAS concluded that there was cause to believe that veterns had been adversely affected, and that all documentation from these experiments should be made publically available to assist these veterans.The authors do an excellent job of covering the pathology of Mustard Gas and Lewisite. The details of WWII field trials and experiments are also still useful today in comprehending the disposition of vesicant casualties. This book is required reading for anyone anticipating treating vesicant casualties.The only faults to the book that I could discern was poor military posology. The authors did not always calculate dosage correctly, and could have revealed more on unit cancer risk for these vesicants. These faults do not by any means take away from the importance of the book - this is just a word of caution on blindly accepting all the figures reported."},{"Title":"Salvation Is a Homecoming","review":"This is quite a page turner. The author takes us from upstate New York to Africa (and then ...) in an unlikely but intriguing series of events. His descriptions of the settings bring them vividly to life, and his character development is more than sufficient to leave the reader caring about what happens next. Goldthwait does a particularly good job with the main and most intense relationship in the book (in the interest of spoiler avoidance, I'll not reveal more). When I finished the book, my first thought was that it should be made into a movie.My lone criticism is that the book could have used a professional copy editor to cut down on typos and the rare but occasional lame sentence.Finally, readers might wonder why someone is rating a self-published book as highly as this. Full disclosure: I'm not even an acquaintance of the author. I first heard of \\"Salvation is a Homecoming\\" when I received a Christmas letter in which a longtime friend of the author recommended the book. Rather skeptical, I bought it on Amazon and ended up more than pleasantly surprised."},{"Title":"The Walk of the Spirit - The Walk of Power : The Vital Role of Praying in Tongues","review":"Any Christian wanting to get closer to God this is essential!

I prayed and prayed and I believe The Holy Spirit led me to this book. This book helped me understand that Praying in the Spirit is for today because if it wasn't, neither would healings or casting out devils. When Jesus left, he declared that tongues would be a sign that would follow those that believe. We are still in the church age and until Jesus returns, soon, use this end-time weapon now.

If there was a required reading list for believers, this would be on the list. Praying in the Spirit is the gateway for His magnificent work in our lives. Jude wrote in his epistle that believers must not be divided; rather, we must walk in the Spirit, building up ourselves (and one another) in our most holy faith, praying (at all times) in the Holy Spirit. The fullness of the Holy Spirit leads us to pray in the Spirit; praying in the Spirit leads us to Love. Dave's work on the gift of heavenly languages (tongues) is the best I've read to date. Digital versions of \\"The Walk of the Spirit - The Walk of Power\\" are available in multiple languages from his website. Be blessed and pick up a copy today."},{"Title":"The Walk of the Spirit - The Walk of Power : The Vital Role of Praying in Tongues","review":"The most useful Christian book I have ever read.

But The Walk of the Spirit - The Walk of Power : The Vital Role of Praying in Tongues by Dave Roberson has probably had the most profound effect on me outside of the Bible. Delving deeper into the purpose of the ministry of the Holy Spirit is something that every believer in Jesus Christ needs and requires.People, get over your fear of the Holy Spirit's ministry and live the life that God intends for you! Are you tired of having no power, no success, no intimacy with the Holy Spirit? Those of you who want revival in your churches, families and lives will experience it when you understand the reason why tongues is so important to the church and begin to utilize this foundational gift. Romans 8:5 For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit.I used pray in the spirit just a few minutes a day. Now I pray 2 to 3 hours in the spirit every morning. And I intend to increase that because of the effect it's had on my life. Tongues allows the Holy Spirit to pray through you. It is impossible for the Holy Spirit to pray anything but \\"perfect\\" prayer. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Walk of the Spirit - The Walk of Power : The Vital Role of Praying in Tongues","review":"Absolutely Amazing, We have been taught the wrong message about praying in tongues. Satan had deceived me for all of my life - till now. He had robbed me of the \\"free\\" \\"All Powerful Gift\\" of praying in the language of the Holy Spirit. I was taught that it was Satan's language - in my \\"Christian Church\\". \\"If we didn't have control or understand what was being said then God wouldn't agree with anybody speaking this language\\". How wrong they were.This book teaches \\"NOT\\" to be weird with Gods gift of the language of the Holy Spirit. We are to speak quietly not out loud, so people don't think we are crazy. You can speak this language in a whisper - just by your breath - no sound.I have been praying for over 20 years for God to guide me to even begin to understand His gifts. Now I know speaking in Tongues is the foundation or beginning. The path to success.I lived the hard life, mostly living under the old testament laws, not understanding that Jesus gave us freedom from the guilt on sin that Satan weighs you down with.This book is not a money grab - its even free on the internet at [...]. After reading it for months on the net I ordered this book. Its so much easier to read than on the net, I can take it with me anywhere now. It's well worth the money.I speak the truth!! This man Dave Robertson has done all the hard work and research. He quotes scripture and teaches from there. The best thing I like about this man is he gives honest, personal accounts of his journey in beginning to understand this subject - some are very funny. He gives advice on how to's, what to do's, what to not do's, etc.Then after reading the book you can go onto his web site ([...]) and find so many more truths about the bible & its teachings.This book will open your eyes to the hidden mystery of the language of the Holy Spirit. It will change your life forever, and put you on the path to success. But, most importantly - bring you closer to God in ways that you could have ever imagined.God bless you Dave Robertson (we haven't met, but I'll personally thankyou at Jesus's party)With Love & Respect,Peter"},{"Title":"The Walk of the Spirit - The Walk of Power : The Vital Role of Praying in Tongues","review":"This book is a masterful exhortation from the Holy Bible that explains in detail why the gift of Tongues is so important for the body of Christ today.

Roberson,in my opinion, is the best book ever written on the subject of the spiritual gift of speaking in Tongues. Rev.Roberson explains the difference between the two types of tongues \\"public and private\\" and their application in a very systematic yet practical way. Your understanding of this spiritual gift and the benefits that it brings to your life is clearly explained as you read through the pages of this book. The personal stories and experiences of Rev. Roberson will keep you intrigued and build your faith concerning this spiritual gift. I found myself up all night long reading this book to completion I simply could not put it down. And as I implemented what I learned from this book I begin experiencing the same wonderful results that the Author did.This writing is like having an instruction book on Tongues.

Building yourself up on your most holy faith lifts you to heights of wisdom and knowledge not obtainable any other way. Thank God for the strength and courage of Dave Roberson to write a book which is evidence that it could not have been written without achieving the position in prayer that he so acurately identifies.

I'm so grateful to our Lord for leading me to Dave's book! The Holy Spirit knew what was to be in my future..,and by my (quietly but NOT silently) praying so much in tongues whenever I found a chance (in the shower, driving alone in the car, my prayer closet), I was much better equipped to handle the traumatic events that were to take place in my future (surely HE bore my griefs and carried my sorrows). Soooo much I could tell you!Besides preparing me for dangers ahead, praying in the spirit is preparing me to do HIS will. Besides getting this great book, I want to tell you of a student of pastor Dave's.., Gary Carpenter! What a blessing this man of God has been to me through his free ministry materials [...]! There are free audio teachings and articles telling how Gary started praying in the Spirit for hours and hours on end while he was driving a truck. The cab of his truck became the operating room of The Holy Spirit to change and transform Gary (we need a lot of work before we're usuable material). What a difference! Gary Carpenter was just a humble country boy doing whatever he pleased.., now he is a humble servant of Jesus with a joyous life of service that reaches locally and across the globe!When our minds are involved in our prayers we are sooooooooo LIMITED. If you let The Spirit who created you and lives in you take over (by praying in tongues frequently), there will be benefits on earth and in heaven now and forevermore! The comforter ~ my guide, my teacher, my very present help in times of trouble, is pure HOLY agape love and HE IS wisdom, HE IS GOD.., what's not to trust? God's richest and best be yours!"},{"Title":"The Walk of the Spirit - The Walk of Power : The Vital Role of Praying in Tongues","review":"There is no question that Dave Roberson enjoys praying. On the other hand, the Bible clearly states that not everybody is given the gift of speaking (or praying!) in tongues. 1 Corinthians 12 clearly identifies speaking in tongues as a supernatural gift of the Holy Spirit, but ALSO states that not everybody will receive this gift. When Brother Roberson starts to reinterpret the scriptures to say what he wants them to say (all people should be able to pray in tongues if they just ask God long enough), instead of just accepting what the Bible does say, for me he crosses the line between prayer warrior and false teacher. All Christians have been promised gifts of the Holy Spirit, but speaking in tongues is just one of them, and it is clearly identified by Paul as not even the best of them. Let's eagerly desire more of God's presence in our lives, and gratefully accept whatever He, in His mercy and wisdom, chooses to give us. (1 Cor. 12:31)"},{"Title":"The Walk of the Spirit - The Walk of Power : The Vital Role of Praying in Tongues","review":"Excellent book for revelation knowledge about the power of praying in tongues.

I recommend it !"},{"Title":"The Walk of the Spirit - The Walk of Power : The Vital Role of Praying in Tongues","review":"If I had read this book 5 years ago I would have thought the Author was on drugs.I have been a Christian most of my life but depended on my \\"smart\\" reading of the bible and superior intellect to gaurantee I knew everything.Of course I had no Holy Spirit power evident in my life such as tongues, prophecy, miracles, even victory over my vices and flesh nature. I was sure that Christians who spoke in tongues were possessed or so spiritually retarded that they were just making the sounds to try and pretend to be like Jesus' disciples.Everyone who I met who spoke in tongues was definitely not smarter than me. And they read some scriptures weird. Plus I got the highest score in my college phsyics class and am a commercial pilot and computer programmer to boot! How could babbling buffons know more about the bible than me?!!!After about 10 years of this though -- my leaven wore thin and I got sick of \\"knowing\\" so much about the bible but living in defeat to my flesh and fasted for 3 days to see if God would make me like the apostles (or at least not like the Pharisees which is what I felt like) then it happened. After 1 1/2 days of fasting I was baptized in the Holy Spirit and started speaking in tongues and my whole life changed. Then my wife followed suit 3 months later. Our life hasn't been the same since. Dave Roberson's book describes everything EXACTLY as it is with tongues and the baptism and explains the different types of tongues that can manifest for different reasons.I sympathize with Christians who think tongues is optional and not for all and maybe they're right. But I also know from experience that Christians who do speak in tongues are usually on fire for God (even if they are a little wacky sometimes).If I could have read this book 10 years ago I'm sure it would have knocked the spiritual smugness right out of me and got me depending on the Holy Spirit through the Baptism of the Holy Spirit instead of my flesh.In Summary -- if you are living in defeat to the flesh and struggling with addictions to food, drugs, porn, whatever -- don't go to more church meetings, or buy expensive courses, or go see famous preachers -- read this book and see what happens when you make drawing near to God your goal come hell or highwater.And also that the goal of Christianity is not miracles and speaking in tongues but God's love poured out through us into the world.Awesome book."},{"Title":"The Walk of the Spirit - The Walk of Power : The Vital Role of Praying in Tongues","review":"I recommend this book if you are serious about wanting a closer/deeper relationship with the Godhead.

This is the best book I've encountered which explains the differences in praying in tongues for personal edification vs. the gift of tongues, etc. I have read this book numerous times, gleaning additional insight with each reading. The gift of our prayer language is misunderstood. Most Christians do not realize the importance of utilizing what God has so freely given to those who ASK.

Years of struggling and having challenges over certain areas of my life kept me depressed and feeling self condemned to a point where I started giving up. I tried everything, I mean everything. I had people tell me just keep going to church, keep reading the word, but yet still lacked the POWER to overcome the dictates of the flesh. I have read the book TWICE and it changed my life since ... I had receive the gift of the Holy Spirit years ago and had prayed before in tongues but never knews its importance and purpose. I been consistenly praying in tongues and I have been reaping the benefits. Ive prayed for people and they've received their healing from the Lord. I also have been delivered from that addiction of the flesh which had a strong hold on me for years. I feel a greater peace on the inside ever since and can feel the Holy Spirit purging those things in me that is contrary to the will of God. From the beginning to end, the book has given me the answers to my problems, also giving me such a greater understanding of the ministry of the Holy Spirit in the life of the believer and how the Holy Spirit operates within them through speaking in tongues. I come to realize how important the person of the Holy Spirit is in our lives. There are many things we really dont know what to pray for in our own understanding when dealing with our weakness. But the Holy Spirit does the searching within us as He intercedes for us removing anything contrary to the Will of God. He then replaces it with His power to mortify and overcome the deeds of the flesh. It is only THROUGH the SPIRIT we mortify the DEEDs of the flesh. All along Ive been battling these habits of the flesh using my own strength while now Ive learn through this book how to release the Holy Spirit on the inside through praying in our heavenly language to perfect all those things which concerns me. Amazing book!! It also mentions the importance of mediating on God's word and praying in tongues. We must apply both in order to walk in the Spirit and in Power. I gave this book to three of my friends and they agree and testify that this book is practical to where they have been experiencing amazing results. Excellent book and anointed!! I recommend to everyone! This book deals on a personal level with your walk with God. It's all about what I can do to reach and experience the fulness of God and what to do when dealing with the hindrances of my life. There is so many more things I wish I could say but it would be too long to write ..lol.. I pray this inspired you to get this book ... Much Grace in HIM!"},{"Title":"The Walk of the Spirit - The Walk of Power : The Vital Role of Praying in Tongues","review":"This book is very enlightening in the area of praying in the Holy Ghost and why it's so importent. Everytime I read it I just want to stop and pray. There are a few things that may challenge some people's theology in some areas, but I've found it to be mostly right on every time."},{"Title":"The Walk of the Spirit - The Walk of Power : The Vital Role of Praying in Tongues","review":"The author tells us how in his personal walk with God through fasting and prayer how the reader can too experience power from on high through our personal walk with God and how anyone who seeks can pray in tongues. He tells how the tongues are used to pray directly to the Father when we don't know at the moment how to pray. When we pray directly to God through tongues Satan can't understand anything that is being said but God is hearing our plea. The author makes it so simple to understand and talks about the other eight God given gifts. How it doesn't happen overnight but a person cannot become a mighty apostle or prophet five minutes after he is born again even if that is what he is called to be. He first must become qualified, trained, prepared, and seasoned by the Holy Spirit before God will separate him to the office he is called to.How when you pray, you see that through his power, people are set free. Through prayer, fasting and tongues with doubt removed you can have whatyou say with your mouth. Mark 11:24 says I shall have whatever I desire when I pray believing that I have received my answer. Dave Roberson helps the reader to be strong, believe, cast out all doubt, and be an overcomer. This book is a keeper to refer back again and again and read.Dave tells the reader that tongues are for everyone with a desire. Very much needed in the last days.Our Thursday Morning prayer group all read the book and ordered more to give away and had to order the second time."},{"Title":"The Walk of the Spirit - The Walk of Power : The Vital Role of Praying in Tongues","review":"I have been a Christian for 7 years. Recently, it has been put on my heart to seek new ways to increase and grow in my prayer life. I never would have pursued the thought of \\"speaking in tongues\\"....I come from a mainstream Methodist background and speaking in tongues is not widely spoken about. This book was recommended by a Sister in Christ and gives clear and precise information how speaking in tonques, written about in Acts, has a powerful impact in connecting with the Holy Spirit dwelling within you and further openning the lines of communication between yourself and your Heavenly Father. I would highly recommend this book - along with having someone further along in their walk to answer questions as it is packed full of information!"},{"Title":"The Walk of the Spirit - The Walk of Power : The Vital Role of Praying in Tongues","review":"I first met Dave Roberson in 1997 when I was living in Israel for 6 months. He was on his way home from a large crusade in India in which thousands of Hindus received salvation and were healed in miraculous ways. I wanted to know the secret to this sort of power, so when I had the chance I asked him...his answer did not really inspire me much...he said..\\"Well...I pray in tongues a lot.\\" How much is a lot I asked...he said \\"oh...4 hours a day.\\"That was my brief encounter with this humble servant of Jesus. I never forgot it...or his words. Did I begin to pray in tongues? Of course I did! The very next morning I was up early, down the back of the 5 acre block the Mt Zion Fellowship rented in Sheik Jarrah, Jerusalem.I did my 4 hours worth of speaking in tongues...hard work! since I had not gone that long before. But that was it...never lasted that long again....typical of me though...once I ran in a full marathon(42km). I had never run more than 20km before the race...so at the 28km mark, my legs gave way on me, cramps and fatigue stopped me in my tracks!! But I managed to walk and jog the rest of the way. After that, I never ran or jogged for fitness again!Through finally reading his book in 2009...coupled with wonderful teaching from Dr Jim Martin of Grace Ministries Bible College in Ohio, I came to see that praying in tongues will allow the Holy Spirit to access all of the hindrances to faith in my life...so that He can purge me of them through strengthening my inner man, the new nature..to the point where I grow past those things of the flesh. I had tried to run a marathon the day after I heard Dave say 4 hours..The book will encourage you greatly to step into a life of cooperating with the Spirit of God on the inside of you. As you put into practice what Dave shares,ie...begin to spend quality amounts of time speaking in tongues, the truths he teaches will become yours by experience.You will see that before God releases greater power for ministry in your life, you will need to continue in tongues until the blockages and impasses that always take you out of prayer are overcome.The other thing is you will begin to hear the voice of the Holy Spirit more clearly as you yield your spirit to His language.Wonders of love and grace await you....a tip....dont give up!!"},{"Title":"The Walk of the Spirit - The Walk of Power : The Vital Role of Praying in Tongues","review":"The BEST teaching on the biblical application of tongues in the life of a believer I have ever seen.

This book is 100% correct with scripture."},{"Title":"Crop Circles: The Greatest Mystery of Modern Times","review":"The book has numerous photos in color and black &amp; white and easy to understand text. The author covers a variety of aspects of crop circles such as physical and emotional effects, animals reactions to, hoaxes (and how to tell them from the real thing), mechanical failures, missing time and &quot;other dimensional&quot; experiences. There are also many eye witness testimonies which lend even more credence to an unusual phenomenon."},{"Title":"Crop Circles: The Greatest Mystery of Modern Times","review":"The author is an aerial photographer and took some gorgeous pictures of very interesting crop circles. But if you would like to know (as we would) answers to the important questions, this book won't help you. Like: Who made the crop circles? What do they mean? Why are they being made? What does the British Gov't say about these questions? How about the British Army? How about Prince Charles or the Queen? What about top British Phd's and researchers? The problem with this book is that the author has no access to top people in high places who might know something of value.At first, the author did a good job explaining some of the theories. For example, one can tell a real crop circle from a fake, using five variables. Real crop circles have unbroken stems, are stretched and bent at the base of the plants, and leave an electromagnetic signature that can be measured with sophisticated instruments. There are three other variables the experts look for to determine a real circle from a hoax. They materialize out of nowhere in a matter of minutes. Some are 1500 feet in diameter. Unfortunately, Ms. Pringle did not tell us which crop circles pictured in her book were real and which were phony. This left us feeling like she wanted to mislead the public. We know that 80% of all crop circles are manmade (fake). The other 20% are unexplained. Ms. Pringle did not help us to learn which ones pictured in the book were not genuine.For example, there was a photo of the most mysterious crop circle of them all (in our opinion), which is a glyph of ancient Mason Text from the time of Augustus Caesar. I saw this glyph shown on a television show, and some PhD's translated it. The glyph resembled the latin words &quot;Oporto Apsos&quot; which translates roughly into &quot;we opose cunning and deceit.&quot; But Ms. Pringle didn't say a word about this glyph in the book! She had the picture in the book, but didn't confirm if the words were real or a hoax. She didn't give readers the translation either. So this made us feel like she was a bit slopply in her research. One would expect an analysis of each picture. Again, here is an example where we felt like the book was too vague.Real crop circles display sophisticated elements of Euclidian Geometry, and some are related to musical composition. Ms. Pringle did not do an analysis of the Geometry, which really dissappointed us. I have seen Geometry analysis done by other researchers in this field and this is crucial information in understanding the special intelligence and perfection of workmanship displayed in a real crop circle. Lastly, Ms. Pringle devoted a good portion of the book interviewing local witnesses about various phenomenon. We didn't find this very credible. This portion of the book seemed unscientific, and poorly researched. The local witnesses came across as uneducated and superstitious. Their observations were sometimes silly and childlike. Some of the witnesses seemed to exagerate normal occurances. For example, a witness is sitting in the center of a crop circle in the pitch black of night, and suddenly hears footsteps and &quot;strange&quot; noises. The witness firmly believes that the noises are alien crop circle makers. Later on in the book, another witness from the same village speaks about deer, birds and other animals being injured in the crops. If you put two and two together, deer and birds can also sound like &quot;footsteps&quot; and &quot;strange noises&quot; in the night.In summary: The book's photos left us in awe at the simplistic beauty and sophistication of the crop circles. But we wish we could have learned more. We are still as baffled as ever."},{"Title":"Crop Circles: The Greatest Mystery of Modern Times","review":"This is a thorough and well reasoned, and well-balanced examination of a phenomena that has excited strong feelings on both sides. (See the previous review--though its author appears not to be aware that the hoaxers he speaks of were unmasked as having exaggerated the number of sites they created--there are also significant differences in the sites they are known to have created and the &quot;genuine&quot; sites.) This book should be of interest to both believers and skeptics and to my mind presents the most thorough account to date."},{"Title":"Crop Circles: The Greatest Mystery of Modern Times","review":"Lucy Pringle's Crop Circles is a unique collection of stories and anecdotes about peoples' strange experiences with crop formations. Anyone reading this book cannot escape the conclusion that crop circles are a mysterious phenomenon that create nonordinary perceptions and energy effects.There are wonderful accounts of people who witness the spontaneous creation of these crop patterns, very similar to those told by researcher Colin Andrews. Anyone who thinks that crop cirles are merely exotic designs in the field needs to read this book.Pringle discounts the idea, unfairly in my view, that humans might be involved in making many of these patterns. Nonetheless, the book demonstrates that crop circles are truly weird phenomena, not easily explained away.(Simeon Hein is the author of Opening Minds: A Journey of Extraordinary Encounters, Crop Circles, and Resonance (Mount Baldy Press, 2002).)"},{"Title":"Crop Circles: The Greatest Mystery of Modern Times","review":"Researcher and writer Lucy Pringle begins this well-illustrated book of more than 150 black and white and color images with eyewitness reports concerning crop circle creations. One of the most haunting cases involved a couple in 1990 while walking in the early evening near their Hambledon, Surrey home. They were suddenly confronted with a strong gust of wind and felt as if they were being sucked upward. &quot;Looking down we saw a circle being formed around us. It only took a couple of seconds. A spiral appeared anti-clockwise and grew outwards from the centre, about two metres in diameter. In the centre of the circle there was a small pyramid of corn, the stalks stacked up against each other.&quot;Others over the years have reported seeing mysterious lights associated with cereal crops going down in various parts of the world. The lights rarely have structure and have been an enigma since the Warminster, U. K. flap of the 1970s which also involved crop circles.Lucy also documents a variety of effects on animals such as dogs and birds, both of which are known to detour from crop formations as if sensing something to avoid not visible to humans."},{"Title":"Crop Circles: The Greatest Mystery of Modern Times","review":"This is a beautiful introductory book on the subject.

In all, we all need to learn these lessons. I read this book many years ago and have re-read it a number of times in the years since.

The answer is Earl Woods, Tiger's father, friend and confidant. Playing Through is Earl Woods' own biography of what it is like to be the father of one of golf's greatest stars. One would expect a cohesive and comprehensive story about Earl's life and that of his son. Instead you are presented with a man who is uncapable of seperating himself from the persona of his son. Earl Woods spends the majority of the time speaking about his son rather than himself. How strange, since the book is supposed to be about Earl Woods. Unfortunately it ends up as a promotional text about Tiger.Earl Woods is a man who dealt with many obstacles in his life. As a teenager he lost his parents, struggled with a career choice, dealt with the racism in the Army and a failed marriage. Then after his divorce and remarriage a child was born and Earl devotes his life to him even at the expense of his own marriage. At this juncture we hear no more about Earl. Tiger becomes the focus which is a shame since Earl's life is far more interesting.Throughout the work Earl tends to put people on a pedestle to the point where they become unreal ( his mother, his brother-in-law, and the orignial Tiger, his friend). He is defensive about any criticism about his son and doesn't tell us much about his relationship with his other children. Earl is so emeshed in his youngest son's identity that he becomes a bore. Surely he could have told us more about himself rather than going on and on and on about Tiger.Despite his faults Earl Woods raises some interesting questions regarding the role of the NCAA on student athletes. He intimates that the NCAA controls the athletes who make money for their schools but receive nothing in return. Earl also shows the impact that Tiger's status has made on the game. Tiger's presence has made the game more accessible to people, raised the purses, tightened security and inspired more minority children as well as their parents to take up the game. Tiger's impact is immeasurable as he continues his career.If you can tolerate Earl's egotistical meanderings and defensive posture, the book is a good lesson in how not to make the mistakes Earl made and become a better parent. It is filled with Tiger's triumphs and challenges. Earl comes across as your controlling parent of an exceptional and talented player. It is worth the read for those who are Tiger fans and collectors of books written about thim."},{"Title":"Playing Through: Straight Talk on Hard Work, Big Dreams, and Adventures with Tiger","review":"(...)9th English24 March 2006\\"Playing Through\\"In the book \\"Playing Through\\" written by Earl Woods telling how to play through life's challenges, to dream big, and to work hard.\\"Playing Through means getting down to business, not letting anything get in your way, dealing with the task at hand, and accomplishing your goals.\\" Tiger had to go through lots of racial discrimination when he first became a pro golfer. His father Earl Woods went through some of the same things when he was a young man. His father was the first African-American to play in the Big Eight Conference, Which is a Baseball League. So he also had to play through all of the racial discrimination.Dream Big, that is what Tiger Woods has been doing seen he was a little boy. Earl wanted him to be a baseball player like himself, but Tiger had other plans. Tiger wanted to be a golfer; he has been playing golf since he was around the age of three, when he was hitting balls in his garage. Then at the age of eleven he beat his dad for the first time 71 to 72.Work Hard, even though Tiger is a pro at what he does he still has to practice at his game. He really had to work hard at his game when he was younger or he would not be as good as he is now. Working hard also goes into playing through if he could not focus on his own game he could not play as good as he does."},{"Title":"Playing Through: Straight Talk on Hard Work, Big Dreams, and Adventures with Tiger","review":"From this book, I get the feeling that Earl Woods is one of the most egotistical people I have ever come across. He does nothing but talk about how good he is at this, how good he is at that, what he did to bring up Tiger, etc. He even says his separation from his wife Tida is due to affluence, not that they are simply separated. Also, he takes no responsibility for anything that has ever happened to him. Every negative experience in his life was due to him being a minority. Give me a break.He also feels the NCAA was out to get he and his precious Tiger. NCAA rules are rules, just like in golf. Get over it. Tiger was not treated any differently than any other college athlete. Tiger was offered a country club membership at the Olympic Club while he was at Stanford, and Earl can't figure out why the NCAA wouldn't let him take it. Because, believe it, or not...Tiger has to live under the same rules as everyone else on this planet.I do have to say the book is an easy read, and keeps you interested, but only because Earl's &quot;thumb on my back&quot; mentality keeps you laughing."},{"Title":"The Bontempi cookbook (Award books ; A340S)","review":"I found a copy of this book second-hand, and it is delightful.

Generally speaking I don't read histories and one from the early 1600's was a pretty daunting task - or so I thought. In fact, it was a great tale of adventure and faith and an extremely insightful and thought provoking book about how this country was started and what it must have looked like to those who arrived here some 350 years ago.I really did love this book.Bradford is an engaging writer whose prose isn't hard to understand. In places his understatement about the death and hardship faced almost constantly is even amusing. Nothing of the kind of challenges that the Leyden pilgrims faced in Massachusetts will seem familiar to a modern reader. Just the same, the fact that it all happened is fascinating. One can almost imagine being there, looking over the decks of the Mayflower and facing all that December gray and wilderness and wondering what you were doing coming here. Told in first person it reads like an adventure as much as a history.The pilgrims here are also quite human and not at all the diorama characters of a first graders Thanksgiving craft project. They face social challenges and the horrors of death and disease. Attacks by natives actually occured on occasion. The dream of a sort of providence is one that proves difficult in the real world. Bradford mourns the loss of these ideals and the people who imported them. There's something a little sad in his later passages, whether it be age or a truly lost paradise one never really knows. But what Bradford imagined as a sort of religious nirvana clearly doesn't pan out in the end. Nevertheless it is well worth the journey. I highly recommend a read of this American classic."},{"Title":"Of Plymouth Plantation 1620-1647","review":"William Bradford spends the entire first chapter of his book describing the Separatist religious movement--he was NOT a Puritan, contrary to the previous review.Bradford's writing style, while sometimes introspective and monotone, is in many instances the most eloquent of all early American authors, using very thoughtful and beautiful metaphors. To describe the success of the Plymouth Colony after about 20 years, he wrote &quot;Thus out of small beginnings greather things have been produced by His hand that made all things of nothing, and gives being to all things that are; and, as one small candle may light a thousand, so the light here kindled hath shone unto many, yea in some sort to our whole nation&quot;.Bradford describes those small beginnings in his book, from the Pilgrims troubles in England to their departure and life in Holland. After twelve years in Holland, the Pilgrims made a teary departure from their friends to come on the Mayflower to America. As they are about to board the ship that will take them to England and on to America, Bradford in a sentimental outpouring writes &quot;they went aboard and their friends with them, where truely doleful was the sight of that sad and mournful parting, to see what sighs and sobs and prayers did sound . . . But the tide, which stays for no man, calling them away that were thus loath to depart, their reverend pastor falling down on his knees with watery cheeks commended them . . . And then with mutual embrases and many tears they took their leave one of another, which proved to be the last leave to many of them.&quot;It was a &quot;last leave to many&quot;, because after Bradford writes the only existing first-hand account of the Mayflower's voyage, and describes briefly some of the explorations made by the Pilgrims, he then describes the horrible first winter which killed half the Pilgrims: &quot;it pleased God to visit us daily with death, and with so general a disease that the living were scarce able to bury the dead, and the well not in any measure suffiient to tend to the sick&quot;.Written in an English that is easier to read than Shakespeare, yet old enough to remind the reader of the books historical value and place in American history. It's plain style should remind us that Bradford was not an English elitist governor like those that would come later such as Winthrop, Sewell, Winslow, and Cotton, but was in fact a simple subsistence farmer by trade.If you want a fluffy, inaccurate, and childish portrayal of Pilgrim life, read a high school history book. If you want the real thing, read &quot;Of Plymouth Plantation&quot; by William Bradford. It's the first American classic"},{"Title":"Of Plymouth Plantation 1620-1647","review":"Contrary to a previous review, Bradford can in all accuracy be labelled a Puritan, though he himself would not have appreciated the title, it being a word used as a jibe by their opponents. Nowadays, the word has come to refer to a theological standpoint, independent of political positioning. Hence an Anglican might be a Puritan (see Master Alden who came over on the Mayflower), and a Separatist would be even more likely to be one. Puritans might also be called &quot;the hotter sort&quot; of Protestants, for their strictness in matters scriptural, and Puritan theology is entirely in keeping with Bradford's position and beliefs, both political and religious, as a Separatist.Previous reviewers seem to have approached the book with differring expectations. If you want to read about John and Priscilla, go to Longfellow, and if you want to read about Constance of the Mayflower, then you won't find her here (except in the records for the 1623 land division, maybe) - and indeed few of the myths of the Pilgrim Story can be found in Bradford's history. This might dissappoint some people who like to paint their history with honest toil and romance, Plymouth Rocks and Thanksgivings, but to a more attentive reader, Bradford has delights enough to keep anybody satisfied. His style is at times cumbersome, and the language of the 1640s(ish) can often obscure the already confusing legal language of some of the letters and contracts in the book. The language and style, though, are part of the book's character. Bradford's reticence in always referring to himself as either &quot;The Governor&quot; or &quot;Governor Bradford&quot; is not only quaint but also instructive, and to dismiss is as tedious is not to give it its due attention.Overall, Bradford still keeps a sense of adventure and dedication: adventure that the reader may share when confronted with sudden unfamiliar truths of the divisions which separated the Pilgrims, or the decidedly economic flavour to some of the reasons for their departure from Holland. Even to witness on a page before you the first time in any known source that the word &quot;Pilgrims&quot; was used to describe the settlers at Plymouth, is enough to make the reader feel privileged.Morison's notes now look somewhat dated - his anachrinistic mention of Communism sticking particularly in the throat, but the reader might share some of his admiration which obviously emerges for the governor and his people. The Pilgrims at Plymouth can in many ways be regarded as adventurers and even (rather more dubiously) pioneers. Maybe if more people were exposed to Bradford's work they would see that although they weren't quite what popular culture would have us think of them, they were all the same resolute and brave people in most untoward circumstances."},{"Title":"Of Plymouth Plantation 1620-1647","review":"Although this account of the pilgrams of Plymoth Plantation's first few years in the new world may not be entertaining to the student who is unfamiliar with first hand accounts from original source documents; for those of you who cherish these treasure troves, you have found a gold mine!I especially loved the carefull choice of words with which Bradford as well as other pilgrams from this era were known for. It would do our society well if we were to employ thier thoughtful and skillful use of words.I mention the above because it is so foreign to us, but it in no way eclipses the raw content of the book with respect to the first hand accounts of our fledgling country's history.This book will dispell many of the myths which in recent years have surfaced about the pilgrams motives for coming to America.This book is not only well worth the money, but it is also worth the time to read it!"},{"Title":"Of Plymouth Plantation 1620-1647","review":"Excellent book!

We were able to move beyond our stereotyped ideas of the Pilgrims to see an account of them from the perspective of their leader.

So many times they gave the other guy the advantage and did not press their rights, while we moderns were becoming frustrated at their passivity. But in the end we saw the aggregate worth of their \\"long obedience in the same direction,\\" as mocking sailors and the Indians and many others saw that they truly lived out the faith they claimed.The detailed account of anyone's life, personal or corporate, will have tedium and unnecessary (to our thinking) minutiae, and Bradford's account does have a lot of material I might have edited out.

It was so interesting to read about the first Thanksgiving and see more into the mind of those brave pilgrims who settled our land."},{"Title":"Of Plymouth Plantation 1620-1647","review":"\\"In this precious volume...is told the noble, simple story 'of Plimoth Plantation.' In the midst of suffering and privation and anxiety the pious hand of William Bradford here set down in ample detail the history of the enterprise from its inception to the year 1647. From him we may learn 'that all great and honourable actions are accompanied with great difficulties, and must be both enterprised and overcome with answerable courages.'\\" (Roger Wolcott, Governor of Mass., 1897)What American isn't familiar with the story of the Pilgrims? Well, I think MANY Americans don't know the whole story, and some people nowadays talk as if it's nothing but a legend or exaggeration of what really happened. Of Plimoth Plantation is an account that should be required reading in every American high school, as well as one that every American Christian should be familiar with.There are only two primary sources which give firsthand accounts of the landing of the Pilgrims and the first Thanksgiving: Bradford's History (written in 1647) and Mourt's Relation, written by Edward Winslow (published in 1622). Mourt's Relation (named after the publisher) describes only the events of the first year, from the landing at Cape Cod in November 1620 until the following November. Compare the two accounts we have of the first Thanksgiving at Plymouth.William Bradford became the governor of Plymouth Colony after the first governor, John Carver, died during the first winter, and he was the governor for 30 of his remaining 37 years at Plymouth. Bradford's narrative is much more extensive than Winslow's, taking us back to when the band of Non-conformist English believers first decide to take the journey across the Atlantic (and no, it wasn't for a vacation - I hear that's actually what some people believe!). Bradford was about 17 years old when he moved to Holland with the group of Separatists in 1607. In his narrative, Bradford describes the persecution and loss they suffered for their beliefs in England, their decision and plans to leave England, the problems they encountered while trying to get to Holland. Since it was illegal to attend any church except the \\"king's church,\\" this small group of Separatists held secret worship meetings at different times and locations. They experienced loss of property and imprisonment because of their refusal to compromise their beliefs. On one occasion when they had arranged for transportation to Holland, they were betrayed and arrested. Another time, while preparing to leave England, the captain of the ship took off with the men on board who were loading their possessions, leaving their women and children behind on shore. Next Bradford tells of the challenges they faced for the 12 years that they lived in Holland, which led to their decision to come to America. He then describes the voyage to and arrival in Massachusetts, the establishment of their colony, their relationship with the local Wampanoag people and the peace treaty they formed, and their struggles to survive in the new land, covering the first 26 years of the Pilgrims in Plymouth.The key idea that comes through in the reading of Bradford's account is the Pilgrim's belief in the Providence of God - that is His \\"most holy, wise and powerful preserving and governing all of His creatures and all their actions\\" (from The Westminster Catechism). (I discovered the word providence is used almost 50 times.) Whenever things looked grim and discouraging for the Pilgrims, Bradford notes that their hope and trust was always in God. When they decided to move to Holland, they knew there were many difficulties they would face in a foreign land where they would need to learn a new language and lifestyle and find new occupations. Bradford comments,\\"Being thus constrained to leave their native soil and country, their lands and livings, and all their friends and familiar acquaintance, it was much, and thought marvelous by many... But these things did not dismay them (though they did sometimes trouble them) for their desires were set on the ways of God, and to enjoy His ordinances; but they rested on His providence, and knew whom they had believed.\\"Again, in the discussion about moving to America, many fears and objections were raised, but they truly believed they were doing what God was calling them to do and that His blessing would be with them.\\"It was granted the dangers were great, but not desperate; the difficulties were many, but not invincible. For though there were many of them likely, yet they were not certain; it might be sundry of the things feared might never befall; others by provident care and the use of good means, might in a great measure be prevented; and all of them, through the help of God, by fortitude and patience, might either be borne or overcome. True it was that such attempts were not to be made and undertaken without good ground and reason; not rashly or lightly as many have done for curiosity or hope of gain, etc. But their condition was not ordinary; their ends were good and honourable; their calling lawful and urgent; and therefore they might expect the blessing of God in their proceeding. Yea, though they should lose their lives in this action, yet might they have comfort in the same, and their endeavors would be honourable.\\"Towards the end of his narrative, Bradford writes some words of remembrance regarding the death of their pastor, William Brewster, in 1643. He then goes on to observe the amazing fact that many of the Pilgrims enjoyed a long life, in spite of all the trials, difficulties and hardships they endured.On many occasions, this group of believers could have abandoned their plans or given up hope of success. But God's hand of protection, provision and direction can be seen as they continued to trust Him. William Bradford believed that by telling their story, many would see the working of God and would trust Him to work in their life as well.If you've never read the original Pilgrim's story written by William Bradford, I recommend you at least read the first half which would get you to about the year 1625."},{"Title":"Of Plymouth Plantation 1620-1647","review":"I was pleased to find this book about a relative of mine. Hard to believe that it was actually in print"},{"Title":"Of Plymouth Plantation 1620-1647","review":"William Bradford's Of Plymouth Plantation is perhaps the most boring and vexatious book I have ever read. The plain style employed by Bradford is, undoubtably, because of his Puritan backgroud, but that is still no excuse for the tedious and often archaic redition of events. I should think that a high-school text book would give a more lively presentation of life in the &quot;New Jerusalem&quot;, as Bradford calls it. The antidiluvian vocabulary and monotonous recording of events made this a very difficult book to get through.

He told tales about his neighbors and friends and described how the pilgrims constantly bickered with traders and their benefactors over money.

The book was good for general information about preparation for their trip and what they actually did when they got here, but as far as historical fact goes, I was unimpressed. Bradford discusses people who stray from the flock, &quot;outsiders&quot; who get girls pregnant, drunkards, and preachers who were not to his liking. It was more like a &quot;dish&quot; session n the Jenny Jones show than something I would be proud to uphold as historical fact to the rest of the nation."},{"Title":"The Indestructible Man","review":"Jablonsky does not marginalize his characters with abnormalities, but rather illustrates how their ideas, behavior, and aims affect those around them, sometimes to the point that others become involved in their impossible schemes. The abnormalities of the main characters reflect the everyday hopes, dreams, aspirations, burdens, and frustrations of the wider world of normal individuals around them. Henry's friends accept his becoming \\"unhinged\\" from the death of his wife Cora, and \\"have learned to accommodate him.\\" This \\"accommodation\\" broadens to involve helping Henry pilfer steel spikes, empty oil drums, wooden planks, and other materials he needs for a large catapult which he believes will catapult him to the moon.

He does this in all of his works, from the Western Civilization pamphlets he wrote in the late 1970's, to the periodic letters he addresses to the University School Community. Papers from the Headmaster once again fits into the mold of Hawley's better piece's, perhaps his best published work so far. His tales of boys who he has come into contact to during his three decade teaching career are amazing, particularly of the tales of Dave Chollet. Although most of these stories Dr. Hawley shares are recylcled from his speaches he gives during morning assembly at University School, they are still elequently crafted and Pulitzer Prize worthy."},{"Title":"Papers from the Headmaster: Reflection of a World Fit for Children","review":"As an educator and chaplain, which is to say, as one deeply concerned with the moral formation of children in a relativistic, even predatory environment, I had high hopes for this book. Unfortunately, they went begging. First of all, the essays were poorly organized, with few dates attached, so that issues from the '70's, '80's and '90's were all jumbled together -- this from a man who insists that history can be &quot;objectively&quot; known. Second, in the name of moral renewal, the book is really an apologia for American, masculine, rational culture, implying that it possesses an absolute quality. Hawley's warning that marijuana turns boys into girls was quite the limit! I am no fan of drugs, but I am also no fan of scare tactics especially when they have overtones of bigotry. I suppose the book gave itself away in its first essay when Hawley is reflecting on the Aristotelian virtue of courage in the Nichomachean Ethics. All Hawley's examples involve the courage to change the behavior of others. To change the behavior of others without first having the courage to change ones own behavior is just another word for moral imperialism.

It's meant to be read aloud. When read aloud to a child, say, a beloved girl of six, at bedtime, she stops fidgeting, she listens carefully, she asks questions about what this word means or why the family members are all so mean and have to spank the little elephant with the \\"'satiable curtiosity.\\" Most of all, she's not bored and she wants to hear it again. And again. And she gets very excited when she finds out that her daddy got the whole series of \\"Just-So Stories.\\"I don't know how other children experience this. We're starting to teach our daughter about evolution of species; she asks a lot of questions about what elephants used to look like, and did they really once not have the really long noses they have today? I think she's starting to understand that this is a tall tale, but it's a great springboard for talking about the real-life origin of species (I think this statement is true even if you're trying to raise a creationist child).Yes, there is a lot of spanking.

I have never spanked my three year old daughter and I love this story. (So does she.)The first problem I have is the more major one. It has to do with Jack Nicholson's narration. He is a fine actor whom I have admired for a long time but, in this case, he turns in a flat, wooden performance. He reads the story too fast and, with a few momentary exceptions, virtually without expression. In addition to that, he commits the cardinal sin of \\"correcting\\" Kipling's English. Rather than saying \\"satiable curtiosities\\" as Kipling wrote, he says \\"insatiable curiosity.\\" I don't know if that was his own doing or the director's but who had the audacity to meddle with Kipling's entertaining wording? While they were at it, why did they not also change \\"Precession\\" to \\"Procession of the Equinoxes?\\" \\"The Procession had proceeded according to procedent.\\"My second problem is not so much a problem as a warning. This is not an animation. It is a series of cute drawings which illustrate the story well and, in some places, the pictures change fairly quickly, but there is not the fluid movement that could be called animation.

It was one of the most incredable things I had heard. It just came alive. The amazing way in which Kipling describes Africa puts it all in full color and gives an interesting perspective from a curious childs point of view in an adult world that is often busy. It is a time period piece that often adults take far too literal. It is important to keep in mind that these stories are legends and should be seen in that point of view, it is usually the adult mind that strays from the illusionary world while the child sees it for the fantasy.

In this illustrated version of one, a young elephant (equipped with an abbreviated trunk \\"as big as a boot\\") is filled with curiosity, although his family and relations try to drive it out of him through much spanking. He asks endless questions in the manner of small children, receiving many spankings for his trouble, until he hits on a question that provokes a torrent of spanking: \\"What does the crocodile have for dinner?\\" Undeterred with this response, he sets out to find out the answer. What happens when he meets the crocodile is a surprise, but he gets a long trunk as a result. He uses this trunk to spank all of his relations upon his return home, and they head off to the river to get their own trunks lengthened.The young elephant is often confused about why he is being spanked, which provides quite a poor model of adult discipline, since children receiving consequences should always know exactly what standard they have violated. Later, he returns the favor, providing a deliciously naughty fantasy that may be a little too appealing to children inclined to rebellion. Parents will need to be discerning as to whether their child can grasp the story's ridiculous tone. But for a child who can grasp the humor of this pseudo-folktale, it ought to provide an enjoyable flight of imagination.The book is beautifully illustrated by Lorinda Bryan Cauley (who also illustrated Clancy's Coat), with alternating color and black-and-white drawings.

The book has been around since 1983, and still holds its own in style.From time to time, during visits to the zoo, have you wondered why an animal has a certain feature? Giraffes have long necks. Why? Monkeys have feet that are a lot like hands. Why? And, elephants have extraordinarily long noses. What good is that?Kipling knew why and took time to tell us. With the refrain explaining where it all happened, by \\"the banks of the great-green, greasy Limpopo River, all set about with fever-trees,\\" Kipling shows us what fun alliteration can be.While in pursuit of an array of questions, especially what crocodiles eat, a young elephant -- an Elephant's Child, goes on a journey to the Limpopo to find out. His quick to spank him relatives don't encourage him to go so much as force him to, fully geared with little red bananas.Loaded with naivete and his next meal, he heads out. He meets a bi-colored-python-rock-snake and the crocodile who not-so-politely gives him the answer, and the Elephant's Child returns to explain on his own terms what he learned.A generous mix of black and white, and color pen and ink drawings frame the story. As imaginative as Kipling's words, Cauley's pictures will tease readers to wonder about the animals and exotic jungle and river.Versions of \\"The Elephant's Child\\" abound, as the original tale is part of public domain.

I read the story, and thought that it was better than the movie. For me, the movie spoiled the whole story. I did not approve of the way that Jack Nicolson changed \\"insatiable curtiosity\\" to \\"satiable curiosity.\\" I think that since it was Rudyard Kipling's intention that it should be written the way it was, then Nicolson should have kept it the way it was.The animation wasn't really animation but a bunch of pictures that moved around. I did like the music however. I think that the animation should be remade, but the music should stay the way it is.

I love Kipling and own the book of Just So Stories... And while I may not love this one as much as others, on video the idea of a child getting whacked for asking questions comes across just too strong. That's why people object to violence on TV, it's a lot worse to see it than to read it. It's cliched from the old \\"children should be seen and not heard\\" days but taken to another level...acting on it and acting it out.I was appalled at the constant hitting in this movie, it was so pervasive it destroyed it for me. after one viewing I removed it from our library and donated it to the library. I didn't burn it, I don't want it censored. It's just not right for my family.

The kids are excited when I pull it out because they find it fun, especially my 7th grader who has struggled with spelling. I was skeptical that a spelling curriculum that claimed to be for 4th-8th graders would really work for such a diverse age group, but the lessons are straightforward and the presentation of the spelling rules can be understood easily by most children. Best of all, I have seen results already in their written work, because they are understanding and remembering the lessons. While it is expensive for a softcover book, the pages are reproducible and can be used for many students.

People -- much less children -- donot speak as eloquently as the characters inthis novel. The speech has a false ring inmany of the conversations between Cathy andChris, and also in the conversations betweenthe Twins and Cathy. Too often, the dialoguesounds like the author's description andanalysis, rather than a natural conversation.Nevertheless, I was curious enough to buy thesequel, &quot;Petals on the Wind,&quot; just to learnwhat will happen to Cathy, Chris and Carrie.I must admit, I am fascinated."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Why do people think that every novel by Andrews is only based on incest?

Not just Cathy, but Chris, Cory and Carrie as well!I have every single V.C. Andrews book on the market, and out of all of them, the Dollanganger series is my favourite! The others are wonderful, but they can't hold a candle to the Dresden Dolls!I highly recommend this novel, and all other V.C. Andrews books. Once you start reading them, you can't stop! :)"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This novel was the first I ever read of V.C. Andrews collections. This is an excellent book, I didn't want to eat or sleep once I started reading this book. I would suggest that if you want a novel that is going to keep your attention day in and day out you need to try this one. V.C has you wondering what is going to happen next. I can remember times when I would try to skip a few pages just so I could see what the outcome was going to be."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Flowers in the Attic was the first V.C.

All of them seem to keep my interest. I haven't found any other authors that can write like V.C. Andrews. Out of all the books I've read Flowers in the Attic was my favorite. I recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Flowers in the Attic has to be my all-time favorite book, next to Gone With The Wind. The story of four children, imprisoned in a northern bedroom, waiting for their grandfather's death to set them free is heart-wrenching and very realistic. Four children, deprived of the love their mother gave them in abundance before their father's death, turn to each other for the love they desperately need to keep hope alive. Hope is yellow, like the paper flowers they place in the attic to make it more like a garden for the younger twins who are rapidly forgetting what it was like to be outside. The betrayal of their mother, the starvation, torture, beatings, and emotional devastation are easily accepted as reasons for Chris and Cathy to draw closer together, forming a family with the little twins, Cory and Carrie. Only in the context of this book could I find understanding for an incestuous relationship. But locked in that cold, dreary northern bedroom, cut off from their mother and all hope of love and affection, it is natural they would turn to each other. Humans need love, need to be touched and held. To deprive four young children in the midst of their development of these basic necessities is to destroy their ability to look outside of their own circle of love. Trust is a commodity which carries a price too high for them to pay. VC Andrews writes this story so convincingly, it leaves the reader wondering if there might not be a hint of personal experience or knowledge buried somewhere in the pages, or growing beside the &quot;Flowers in the Attic.&quot;"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"The book Flowers in the Attic is fantastic! It is for all ages, for all can enjoy it! You hate to put it down and the sequals are as good as the original! I read this book when I was 13 and keep rereading it!! Read it and you will agree! A lovely, feeling book!"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Having read half of the reviews, little remains that I can add. If you're considering buying this book, you won't be disappointed. Virginia Andrews is a marvelous writer who knew how to captivate your imagination and let you experience an array of feelings through these often beautiful characters trapped in these unfortunate tragedies.I've read this book as a young girl in high school and it managed to keep my attention and interest even while not reading it! Couldn't wait to get back home to continue reading.If you are a young woman/man....this book is a MUST read, it will touch you. If you are not...you will certainly appreciate this book and be captivated by the author's writing style."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"When I was in high school, all of V.C. Andrews books were in my high school library. Flowers in the Attic was like the fifth one that I read, and I've reread it probably 10 times since high school. I understand that some people were put off by the incest between the brother and sister, but it never bothered me to the point where I would never pick up another one of her books. I think that it was genius to add something so taboo into this novel to show how emotionally fragile children can become when they have to survive horrible circumstances. Even though everyone likes to call V.C. Andrews a horror writer, I've never seen her books that way. She delves into the psycology of the human mind and spirit (i'm refering to the books that were actually written by Andrews before her death in 1986) and gives her own accounting of what might happen to someone who is pushed to extreme limits. The Dollanganger series and her Casteel series are the best novels out there that have been written in the last 40 years. I've yet to read other books that have made such and impact on my life. There is not one series in the long line of Andrews, and her ghost writers series that I've forgotten. I could basically retell every single story book by book in each series if I was asked. That's what makes a great storyteller, not the style in which they write, but the content that is within the pages of the books. If you love reading then don't pass up these series: Dollanganger, Casteel Family, Cutler, and Landry. The Dollanganger and the Casteel Families are the only books that V.C. Andrews personally wrote (to the best of my knowledge) and they are the absolute best books you will ever read. So go to the bookstore and pick these books up. You will not regret it for an instant."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I always found the movie to be quite interesting, but after hearing that the book was filled with lots more details, and that there was an entire \\"Flowers In The Attic\\" series, I decided to check it out. From beginning to end, I loved it! It really reels you in from chapter one. Filled with much more suspense then I expected, I found myself reading chapter after chapter at night because I couldn't put it down. I was dying to know what happened next. This is one of those rare special books, because there really is no other story quite like it. It feels like your there right with the characters, I wasn't bored once. Two children, and two teenagers left confused and isolated in an attic, they find themmselves contemplating and thinking about things such as family, religon, sexuality, (the teenagers of course) life, and they are left to wallow in their dreams, fearing they may never come true, stuck in that attic forever. They have all the time in the world to think, and I guarentee, you'll feel like your right there with them."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Rumour has it this book is based on true facts. If such is the case, then it shows the worst side of our nature and how when money enters the picture, it can cloud what was in the beginning a good intention. Narrated by Cathy Dollanganger, the novel is tells the story of four beautiful children who were locked in the attic by their mother. After the death of her father, her mother possessing no skills and no means by which to support the family is forced to turn back to her grandparents who disowned her mother for marrying her half brother. She is accepted, but under one condition, her grandfather must never know about the four of them. In the beginning the plan was that her mother would use her beauty, and winsome charm on the grandfather so he would accept Cathy, her brother and the twins. In the beginning, Cathy says they believed her. As time flew past, frustration set in and finally a loss of hope and faith. Their lives, how they coped, managed in the attic is narrated well by Cathy and through her eyes. Emotions are described well enough that you feel them and can identify with the characters, an essential if the book is to be a good read.It is another one of those books that is disturbing, but makes a good read nevertheless.A note however, to those of you who think that the rest of the books in this series would make a good read, you're mistaken. This is the only book in the series that's worthy of mentioning nevermind reading."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Like lots of others, I first read Flowers in the Attic when I was 13. This book instantly gave me a &quot;love of reading&quot; which I would wish for everyone. I have read literally hundreds of books since, but no other book has been as emotional and memorable to me. I remember each word of the book and probably could recite by memory the entire first chapter. The first sentence grabbed me and had me hooked until the last page. I know many people are put off by some of the content of this book, but I have to wonder if they even really read the book before making this opinion. The characters (especially Cathy) became like family to me--I know that sounds &quot;corny&quot;--but I can't imagine anyone that reads this book not feeling the same way. I hope V.C. Andrews knew how much this book meant to me and so many others. I have re-read this book so many times, and each time I become enthralled in the hopes and dreams and terrors of Cathy, Chris and the twins. This book is definately a &quot;heart pounding&quot; experience. I wish every girl (woman) the joy of reading Flowers in the Attic. And also, have Petals on the Wind (the 2nd in the series) ready to read as soon as you finish this book. You will be desperate to follow their lives."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Ok, ok, you're probably thinking that I'm kidding, but I'm not. I read this book almost three years ago when I was 14 and it is still one of my favorites. Usually I am the more serious reader and I thought that these books would be totally trashy but they aren't at all. This and Petals On The Wind are my favorites but I've read ever Andrews novel. They are so addictive. Once you read one you will never be able to stop. I love Cathy, Chris, Corrie, and Carrie. Read this book!"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"When I first read V.C. Andrews, I felt like I was guilty of reading crimes. I'm usually a Shakespearian-Great Gastby-Jane Austin serious reader. But don't judge this book by it's reputation! Andrews(not the terrible, iditoic, unoriginal GW) captures the totured and haunted youth of Cathy, Chris, Carrie and Cory with such masterfullness, if you aren't crying, you should be dead. I personally do not feel that the Chris-Cathy angle is perverted, it is the most hauntingly bittersweet aspects of the book. If you read this (I finished it in a day), you have to go on to Petals and Thorns, though Seeds does make this great series lose some of it's luster."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I read this novel way back in the 1980's and loved it then. I started reading other novels in the series a couple years ago and reread the flowers in the attic as well. It was no more compelling than the first time I read it. V.C. Andrews really delves into the human syche for damaged or abused children. This novel in particular tears at your heart. The children are torn apart by there love for there mother and freedom. It shows how much children beleive whatever they are told by there parents no matter how wrong or sick they may be. It also shows how warped a person can become in there thinking if it is all they are taught from day one. They beleive in there hearts that everything they do is right because that is all they were taught and know, from there parents. For generations moods and actions can be taught and children will follow, and as they grow into adults it molds them. Then they carry this on to there children and it goes on and on as V.C.Andrews portrays in this novel. From the grandparents , to the mother, then to her children. The book reveals there lives from start to finish and carrys on to the next novel. It is almost like a mystery novel, you will have a very hard time putting it down and can't wait till the next one.All except for the fact that your emotions will get the better of you because of the abuse the children put up with. It is hard to imagine it being a fiction novel when you see the crime and abuse done nowadays, but thank god it is."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I LOVE this book...

I first read this book way back in 6th grade, and 23 years later, I'll still pick it up when I'm looking for something to read. I've lost count of the number of times I've read it. It's such a powerful book, that it makes incest acceptable in this story line. If There be Thorns and the books that followed were good, but have not endeared themselves to me as the first two, probably because after If There be Thorns, we had to wait for the follow-up books back then, and they just weren't the same."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"When I began this book, I thought that it seemed to great to be real, a brother on his way to med school, loving parents, twins on the way, and being 12 years old not a care in the world except dancing. When Cathy's father suddenly dies in a car crash on his birthday, everything gets turned upside down. The mother has a great deal of debt to pay off, and goes to her parents for assistance. Cathy's mother keeps her children locked up in the attic to help win her father and get her inhertience back. Will the children ever see sunlight again? I would recommend this shocking tale to anyone who enjoys the good story every now and then."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"&quot;Flowers In The Attic&quot; will always remain on my top five list of favorite books ever. This enormously popular tale works on so many levels: drama, suspense, horror, mystery, literature.The plight of Christopher, Cathy, Carrie, and Cory is so involving and tragic. The characters are well drawn, and very likeable.This is a classic coming of age story, and though shocking at times, will move you. A must own. A must read. Should be on the top books for the 1990s list."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"V.C. Andrews outdid herself in the book Flowers in the Attic. Cathy Dollanger one of the four Dollanger children narrates the story. Cathy a twelve-year-old must learn to grow up fast. Her father dies and Cathy and her brother Chris who is 14; must raise the children for their mother. They now live in with their grandparents in a huge mansion. In order for their mother to inherit her father's wealth he must not know about his grandchildren. The children must live there because their mother has no skills to obtain a job. The mother starts visiting the children less and less. The kids now rely on themselves. Although times are tough the kids find little things to amuse themselves. The four children go through many tough times. Andrews puts the characters through many different twists and turns. She keeps you wanting to know what happens next. This book was great and I suggest it for the young and old. This book shows how strong the bond can be with brothers and sisters. This is on of the best books I've ever read. It kept me guessing what was going to happen next. I am not much of a reader- and I read this book in less than a week. I strongly suggest this book."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Catherine, Christopher, Carrie, and Cory Dollanganger had the ideal family, until it all changed.

And you feel that your are right in the room with Cathy,Chris and the twins. The setting are very real and I could even see what the attic looked like in my mind. Its engrossing to watch the struggle of love turn to hate and you wonder how would you feel if this was your family.

When I was old enough, my mother gave me the book to read. From the first chapter, &quot;Goodbye Daddy&quot;, I was hooked. I felt the pain, the heart-break, the sorrow of these four children. I must admit this. This book touchd me in a way that only V.C Andrews novels can! I find her writing amazing! &quot;FITA&quot; is the best book I have ever read, and ever will read!"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I cried in all of her series of Flowers in the attic. You enter the character of Cathy and never leave her until the very end of the book. You feel every emotional stab of pain and desperate need for love she feels. You remember again what it was like as a teen and the never ending curiosity of sexual growth. I looked foward to waking up in the morning just to read this book. (I even skipped the wild thing in bed with my husband when I was at the never ending climax of the story)."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Flowers In the Attic, was a wonderfully laid out story that had me so involved that I couldn't put it down until I was finished. The characters are deep and can easily be sympathized with. Cathy is a sweet, but stubborn character that brings most of the life to the story. The moral of the story stays within the mind as Virginia wants it too and you just can't help, but read it again just to experience the tragety once again and be lost in the author's world. It was thrilling, yet moving and well written. Excellent job, V.C(as usual). Your stories will be what keeps you living in our hearts."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Flowers in the Attic was a terrific book, despite the fact that I was around 14 when it came out. I loved it and I have all of her books. Just let me say....My Sweet Audrina is the BEST of all!!!! V.C. Andrews died in 1987, and ever since then, her books have gone downhill!!! Talk about childish!! My 10 year old cousin could read these book!!! V.C. could not possibly have had ALL of these books just lying around her home. Whoever decided to write for her should STOP or get some real material. The Orphans series is the best so far, but poor V.C. must be turning over in her grave about these so called &quot;books&quot;. Ever since HEAVEN someone else has been impersonating a well-loved author."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This book had to be THE best book i have ever read V.C Andrews had such a talent for writing and describing the book as if you the reader were there and I am very excited to read the sequel"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS BOOK.

WHAT HAPPENED TO CHRIS AND CATHERINE WAS TRULY NOT THEIR FAULTS. I BLAME THEIR MOTHER. I GOT THIS BOOK FOR CHRISTMAS ONE YEAR AND DIDM'T TOUCH IT UNTIL LIKE 8 MONTHS LATER. I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN. THIS IS THE FIRST AMONGST THE MANY V.C. ANDREWS BOOKS THAT I'VE READ. I STARTED READING THEM WHEN I WAS 12. I READ THE WHOLE DOOLLGANGER SERIES EXCEPT THE PRE-SEQUEL.

I have read this book several times, and each time, it stirs the emotions, and remains as powerful and extraordinary as the first time. All readers should read this dark, intense novel, which is a story of love, hate, deprivation and contempt, it shows how easily love can be betrayed, and how dreams can be lost."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This is my favorite book.

Had I not picked up Flowers in the Attic at the bookstore, I would have missed out on 20+ great books. It and the rest of the series are my favourite books of all time. I'm sure nothing I read from now on will come close (and believe me, I have read many, many books). To me, Flowers in the attic is a modern classic which should be praised as a great book.

Andrews and her Dollanganger series but after reading this book I couldnt wait to throw each page in a food processor and torture them as much I could, just like they did to me by being in print and unbelievably read by many.Nothing, and I do mean nothing, of interest sustaining value happend in this book. It was all about how four children entertained themselves in an attic for 3 years. One chapter was about playing Checkers. Another was about playing Monopoly. There was even a chapter about making paper flowers... which I'm assuming is where the title came from, this being the highlight of the novel.By the time I had reached page 300 I was reading it as fast as I could to get to the end, because for some ungodly reason when I start a book, no matter how terrible, I have to finish it. I would sooner tear off each of my finger nails whole with bolt cutters than read the remainder of this series. STAY AWAY FROM V.C. ANDREWS."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Yeah, a 'true story' - okay, seriously, those of us with some form of education will understand the concept of a littel something called 'plagerism' and the flowers in the attic series takes readers for gullible fools - um, people locked away in an attic? So Wuthering Heights - in wuthering heights this chick called CATHERINE (a book written 100 years ago by the way) was locked in an attic - okay, the fire in the third book? So very much alike the insane wife of Rochester in Jane Eyre...Yeah, the only revealing truth is that modern 'writers' fail to use this title for talent but instead of sleazy propaganda trash (ie: this novel). If you want to read the original, read Jane Eyre or Wuthering Heights - at least these people don't find their brothers and sisters sexually desirable"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Ugh! I can't believe I actually thought I was going to like this thing! This is one of those books with sick, twisted, demented characters who do sick things. *Do not read this book* under any circumstances! Here's a brief synopsis. The book starts out with the mother getting pregnant, the main character throwing a hissy fit because she thinks she will lose some attention, then the father dying. I can't and won't explain everything going on in the family at this point, but the kids are brought into three rooms to stay until the grandfather dies. From here, it just goes downhill, and the ending violently hits rock bottom. I just wanted to cry when I realized that I had to stick around for 411 pages. I cannot stress my final point enough: DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Trust me that is saying a lot I have read many stupid books. How did this author even get published? How did this book spawn sequel after sequel? I DID read the entire book, I was really bored. I just couldn't get past the crappy plot and idiotic dialog (especially from the kids). If you are even thinking of reading this book please don't. Something, anything is better then this book. Something off the Opera book club list is better, or the bible or even the owners manual from the glove box of your car.Overall-This book should be banned as an insult to the intelligence of every single human being on the face of this planet. In fact the only thing on the planet worse then this book is the movie based on it."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This book is about incest between a brother and sister. The incest occurs because they are locked away in an attic during puberty and have no other outlet for their emerging sexuality. I found it disturbing that this book is so popular, given its taboo topic."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"What a piece of trash....I can see why this woman has so many fans all over the world, since most people, sadly, are reactionary, like to be shocked, and give no thought to important issues. Oh, yeah, and the characters are pretentious upper class cliches much like those found in a soap opera, so consumed with the petty things in their lives that they fail to recognize anything else (I'm speaking here mostly of the mother, since the kids--even in this unbelievable 'story'--can't be anything but consumed with what they're going through). Even the name of the place they're at--Foxworth--reeks of fakeness. And it IS racist, promoting a world view of submissive black women (not that this woman's retarded fans would notice....or care). It even goes on for as long as a soap opera, stretching the preposterous story into more than one book. The author did this with all her stories, and she reached what I bet was her goal--she made a lot of money off the ignorance of people (not me though--a friend loaned me a copy). I'd chuck this in with Lavrle Spencer and the rest of the Harlequin romance trash. Do yourself a favor--read a Barbra Kingsolver novel instead, or something which can at least be called 'literature.' It's bound to be more realistic, more entertaining, and a million times better. Only stupid, bored, disillusioned housewives who used to be cheerleaders and grew up to marry husbands who treat them like dirt and fool around on them because they gained some weight having all those kids who now hate them would find any redeeming quality here whatsoever."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"My title pretty much sums this book up. I read it several times and I can see how it would appeal to younger people. But as an African American, I find the VC Andrews books are so racist, its shocking how so many read it and scary as hell why they dont see it. I mean the author meantions blue eyes and blond hair on every other page! The single black character was not even given an identity! She had no life, no ability to speak...you know, just the typical, 300 pound, fat big black woman that has no life except to take care of dem good ole pretty little white children. Give me a break. The brother and sister are so beautiful and lonely that they fall in love with eachother and screw in the attic...inbreeders!...just like mom and pop!...and the sickest part is that this racist garbage sold millions. What does that say to you about this society? If this book taught me anything it taught me just how in love white people are with themselves."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"The Dollanganger's, have had the biggest change of their life. Cathy, the main character, is the only point of view you see throughout the entire book. She lived a life of happiness with her parents Chris and Coreen, older brother Christopher, and twin brother and sister Cory and Carrie. Until tragically her father was torn from them in an automobile accident. Coreen, was left with only one choice, to move in with her parents. Her parents lived a life of greed, which soon took the 4 children away from their mother. Treated cruelly and left to fend for themselves other than their food in the morning. V.C. Andrews had a powerful story of love lost into greed, and the pain greed causes."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I first read this book when I was ten years old, after a friend did a sixth-grade book report on another V.C. Andrews book, Heaven, and mentioned Flowers In the Attic as a favorite. In retrospect, I think the girl only liked the book because of it's sexual themes, for I don't remember this classmate as being particularly bright enough to really appreciate the book. I recently saw the movie version of the book on cable (which I do not recommend -- very tame and rather silly, though Louise Fletcher is quite good as the grandmother, Olivia. Think Nurse Ratched, but not as nice.), which prompted me to buy a copy of the book and re-read it. It was as I remembered (I found I could recite some passages almost verbatim), but I read it with a renewed interest and captivation for the characters and the originality of the story.The first book of Andrews' best series (though I only read through the Ruby series, I'm quite confident in my appraisal), Flowers In the Attic is, indeed, the horror that other reviewers have claimed. The incestuous theme is quite compelling, and is furthered in the later books of the series.Forgive me for mentioning the rest of the series, but it's difficult to do this book justice without mentioning it. Andrews knew what she was doing by giving us the first four books that tell the tale from the present (relative present, since it begins in 1957, but you know what I mean, I hope), then closing with a &quot;prequel,&quot; that gives the history of the grandmother and Corrine (the children's mother). The &quot;Garden&quot; theme is well substantiated without being overdone throughout the series. The other series' were not nearly so well done, and their plots are predictable.Unpredictability and originality are what make this book (and the series) so intriguing.When I first read Flowers In the Attic, I was ten, as I said, and re-reading it as an adult makes me realize that this is not a children's book (though it was very popular with the pre-teen set in the late 80s, and seems to be still -- seems young people love to read about other young people's misfortune). If you've shied away from V.C. Andrews because of the ghostwriters' lack of creativity and overused plot devices, treat yourself to Flowers In the Attic and the rest of the books in the series."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This is the first V.C. Andrews book I ever read and have read every book ever since. I absolutely love this book and highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"To see what these four innocent children went through because they were being made to pay for what their mother and father did [and who their mother and father REALLY are] is terrible. The children went to Foxworth Hall because they trusted their mother, Corrine and she painted a grand picture of them living a wealthy life, having everything and anything they wanted when she knew all along that that's not how it would be. The things that Olivia did to her grandchildren were totally horrifying. Not to mention how Corrine was allowing it to happen to her children while she was enjoying life and her parents' wealth. The children had to go from a life that seemed almost perfect, when their father was alive to living all in one room and being physically and mentally tortured. Chris and Cathy had to grow up before their time and be father and mother to their siblings Carrie and Cory (the twins). The book has great detail and makes you feel the torment that these children felt. The movie did the story absolutely no justice at all. If you've seen the movie, you must read the book. It's much more detailed and a lot more entertaining."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I think this book was extremley well written"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I love Flowers In The Attic. It was the first V.C. Andrews book I ever read. I'm now hooked to her writing. I don't read alot, but I can't stop reading her books. I could read Flowers In The Attic over and over again!"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I first read this book when I was about 12, it became my favorite V.C. Andrews book. She writes in a way that makes you feel as though you are experiencing her character's hell, but you can't put the book down. At the end of the series I felt like I really knew these people. You really can tell she wrote this novel, not some &quot;ghost writer&quot;. It is dark, hellish, painful, and sweet and enchanting at the same time."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"at first, when i started reading this book, i couldn't put it down. The writing was magnificent and i loved the plot and storyline. when i got to the incest part, i almost barfed at such a disgusting idea. it would have been perfect if not for that incestual part."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Flowers in the Attic was just the beginning to a wonderful Saga about a family filled with horrible secrets and mysterious endings. Cathy and Chris and their twin brother and sister are locked in the attic of their grandmothers mansion. Until a time-or so told by their mother- that they can leave without the knowledge of their grandfather who is on the verge of dying.V.C. Andrews was a wonderful writer she had seen a side to human nature which is not expressed much in modern literature. For people looking for sex, mystery, and deception this and the rest of the books written by her BEFORE her death in 1986 are works of art. All books written by her Ghost Andrew after her death are just money ploys by the publisher and The Andrews estate to make a fortune off a dead womans name.But if we look at the books written by V.C. Andrew before her death we see a genius who wrote what she felt and wrote what only others fantasize about."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"i thought it was a tad trashy, even though it was capitvating with a great storyline. I think five stars is reserved for the likes of the English patient, in the skin of a lion, sacred hunger, alias grace; true pieces of literature excellence."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This book receives 5 stars because I thought it was a classic. The father was killed and the mother is left to raise her 5 children. She asks the help of her wealthy mother who only wants to hide the children in a room with an attic in return. These children live their lives in this room for 3 years and they go through horrifying experiences while they are there. This book is one of the best."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"The first part of the book is o.k. But I have to say I liked the second part of the book better. And in a way it was really boring. I have read better though."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"when i first picked up Flowers in the Attic. i was immediatelywon over. it's interesting title caught my eye and when istarted to read it i couldn't put i down. it tells a wonderfulstory of children caught in a bizzar situation. a book thatwhirls the reader to the last page."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Having heard about this book I was unsure what I was about to read.It turned out to be sad beautiful story about love and greed and selfishness.I cried four times during the caurse of this books and yet i could not stop reading it.It took me exactly two days to finish this book and label it one of my favorites.If you hate this book I fear you have no soul.Its worth every second of effort you put into reading it.Is the author the best writer?No,but the story tells itself inspite of that.You can feel the childrens pain and you want so much to help them.This book is not for the week of heart."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"When I read this book for the first time, my heart stopped for a while. The kids had to rely on their creativity to make something out of nothing. When you have nothing, all you can do is to make something out of nothing. As for Corinne, I was totally disgusted with her. She could have stood up for her kids and herself at some point if she had any gumption to do anything. For instance she could have looked up her childhood buddies and asked them for help to get the kids away from the attic and into school ASAP. Cory had a right to live. He didn't deserve to be poisoned at all. Neither did the other children. Chris, Jr. was very smart. He helped Cathy save her hair when Olivia put tar in it. He even made a wooden key. That is how Chris, Cathy and Carrie got out of the attic."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This book grabbed my attention from the very beginning. Four children are locked in a large attic away from their family. The mother does not want them messing up her latest marriage to a wealthy man. So, the inevitable happens: the oldest brother and sister who care for the younger children, acting as parents, begin an incestuous relationship. They are teenagers when this begins and have no contact with the outside world -- no friends, no romantic prospects.The topic of incest is so bothersome that it's hard to read the book, yet you don't want to put it down. You really want to know what happens to these people in the end (and truly hope for a happy ending).But let me warn you: getting through one book on incest was tolerable, but to continue the series is to put yourself through this again and again.Bottom line: Great book. I suggest you read it and then stop. Don't bother with the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I read these books in high school in 1980 and I couldn't wait for the next new book to come out. I was mesmerized while reading them. Could not put them down."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I first read this book many years ago and have since, reread it many times. This book makes my heart ache. Having children myself and then reading how a mother, with the grandmothers help, locks her 4 children in the attic so her father (the childrens grandfather) will not know about them. It's a real tearjerker at times. When one of the twins dies from arsenic poisoning, courtesy of their grandmother sprinkling arsenic on their pancakes! The two oldest of the children, begin to experience teenage feelings and don't understand what is happening to their bodies. This book is truly exceptional. It's a thriller, tearjerker, funny (rarely), sad story rolled into one and it'll keep you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. I recommend everyone read this one."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This book was recomended to me by a friend. The beginning of the book was so sad and it made me cry alot. Then the middle was just a bit dragged out and at the end, it became really good and interesting. The book was good overall, but I was so disappointed at the ending!!! I wanted it to go on and I wanted to know what had happened to them and their mother and the grandmother and I just finished reading it and I want to rip my hair out!! I might be overreacting because its pretty late at night. So overall it was a good book and i would recomend it to my friends. Now I want to see the movie!"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"well i started this book today and figured out that it was a little too adult for me it is a wonderfully well written book but i think it needs to wait untill i am a little older. i sugetst that other younger readers wait also"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I cannot even begin to express my love of this book. I'm totally speechless. Well, not really, so, here it goes. From the moment I picked up this book, I literally could not put this book down. I stayed up until 3 am for half a week reading Flowers in the Attic and Petals on the Wind. I was so in love with Cathy. My papaw had to force the book out of my hands. I absolutely loved it. How anyone could think this book was trash, I don't know. But I think it was probably the best book I have ever read and is right up there with Anne of Green Gables and Little Women. The plot is just so disturbing, yet it hads so much suspence to the rest of V.C. Andrews's books. To think someone of that much love, could lock her children away for 2 years, 5 months, and 16 days. I gave it to my friend and that's all we did while she was over at my house was read. I intend to give it to my other friends as soon as Lacey gets through with it. I have all the sequels except for If There Be Thorns, which I've already ordered. I just cannot believe how great this book is. You have to read it. It's worth all the stars in the galaxy. And I know my writing, considering I'm a writer myself, so believe me. Go out and buy it,(not rent it), buy it, because you will want to read the story of Cathy, Chris, Cory, and Carrie over and over again. I love this book and it definitly gets my approval. If any young readers out there share my opinion of this book, please email me, I would love to talk to some readers of this book and it's sequels."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"What can I say about this book that hasn't already been said? When I was in junior high, every girl I knew was reading this book and its sequals. I had dismissed them as trivial schlock but the more I saw people reading them, I just had to see what all the fuss was about. I was not disappointed. From the opening prologue to the haunting epilogue I was hooked. I've read this series so many times I practically know each book by heart. The prequel, Garden Of Shadows, I didn't find all that interesting. For one thing, no matter how good that book was, it was never going to make me have ANY sympathy for that witch of a Grandmother. She was evil.Anyway, here it is 2005 and I'm reading this sereis again for the first time in 10 years. The story is just as captivating now as it was in junior high. Even though this series was marketed to teenage girls, and it is told from the point of view of a girl, being a guy I still found it to be a great read. I just can't put it down once I start it.The story is haunting, creepy, exciting and beautiful all at the same time. The incest that everyone makes such a big deal out of is usually taken totally out of context. While I do find it to be disturbing and creepy, within the context of the novel and the circumstances in which the kids grow up, it is certainly understandable. People just make too big of a deal out of it. I do admire V.C Andrews for having the courage to write about a very taboo subject. She writes about it in such a convincing and delicate manner that you just totally believe in the story and the characters. While reading the book, I challenge anyone not to cry during the chapter 'Color All The Days Blue, But Save One For Black.' It's just not possible. And if you can read that chapter and not cry then you just have no heart at all.This book will always be one of my all time favorite books. Just as good as it was 25 years ago. I don't recomend the entire series of five novels, but the first two are just great. After Flowers In The Attic, you have to go on to Petals On The Wind. For me the story just goes down hill starting with the third book, If There Be Thorns. I enjoy the entire series, but the story does get rather old after the second book."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This book was excellent! I couldn't put it down. I was truly shocked when I read this thrilling story of a mother's betrayal to her children when she locks them in the attic of Foxworth Hall for her own selfish reasons. Corine, their mother, is forced to depend on her parents when their father dies and they are left with little money to live off of. She must win over the heart of their cruel grandfather before she can take her children out of the attic and give them the many riches she constantly promises. As they wait for their mother to break the news to &quot;the grandfather&quot; they are forced to live with the many rules of their grandmother and her watching eyes. This book was V.C. Andrews first published book, and to my opinion one of her best. I was dissapointed at the end when they didn't give both their mother and grandmother exactly what they deserved! (They do in the next book Petals on the Wind) But I would definatly recommend this thrilling novel to anyone."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I have to echo the 5 star reviewers here - most of whom are probably my age and younger. This book hit a *nerve* in many young girls at the time. Chalk me up too as one who read this several times in my life. Don't laugh - and I know many of you are right now - but I can still quote from memory some of Cathy's lines. Those quotes have never left me. Cathy was a REAL and STRONG character - wherever V.C. Andrews got her from I don't think I'd like to go.Just a book that got itself in your imagination and didn't let go. IMO, that is the sign of a classic. Maybe not in the vein of say Proust (wink) or Faulkner or Hemingway, but still...an American classic.When will HBO or Showtime do the miniseries of the entire collection? The movie - albeit with memorable actors (with a horrid script) was totally subpar."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"The Dollanganger children are part of a fully functioning family, as narrated by the second-oldest child Cathy, with bright futures ahead -- until their perfect dream lives quickly become one solid nightmare when their father is suddenly killed in a car accident, leaving them to their loving mother and grandparents. Thrown suddenly into a dark world of terror and incredible suffering, the four - Chris, Cathy, and the two little twins Carrie and Cory are on their own. Surely Mother will rescue them from their hellish lives someday, right? Little do the children know how much their wonderful mother is hiding, and how this could ruin all of their lives forever. And although the children are not yet aware, the horror has already begun...Flowers in the Attic is a great, great read. I raced right through it (which for me takes like a week) and hated to put it down every time. Just the way the book is paced - so thoughtfully, as things go from great, to weird, to pretty bad to extremely terrible and finally horror-movie unimaginable. Small moments of hope and suspenseful periods interrupt an otherwise bleak look at the \\"perfect\\" world of American suburbia. Mostly, I felt physically ill, as if I were going through some of these terrible things. It'll make you wonder about the power of children's love for their parents, unfailing, unconditional and everlasting, in the face of extreme tests and surrounded by hatred and betrayal.Highly recommended. I hope to eventually pick up the next three in the series, but something tells me no sequel in this genre could be as good as this first installment."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This book was as intriguing to me now as it was the first time I read it 25 years ago!! Of course, I read this for the first time as a teen so all I really remembered was that Chris and Cathy slept together!Now as a parent, I can't imagine locking my dear child up in a room for three years regardless of the amount of money I may inherit.V.C. Andrews does a great job of relating the jow and pain the four Dollanganger children feel while trapped in one room with only an attic to entertain them. You can also vividly picture the grandmother and her evilness that she constantly exuded. It repeatedly makes you grateful for the wonderful, loving family that you were born in to!I can't wait to get through the rest of the series and re-live the stories that so intrigued me so many years ago."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Flowers in the Attic is a novel with limited resources - it's characters were few, and they seldom leave the property in which they are confined to. However, it was captivating, and absolutely held my attention. I felt the children's desperation for their mother to understand what they were going through, and the grandmother was an absolutely evil character that I detested until the very end. The book was vivid and descriptive, and I feel that the author did very much with so little - she made a book about four children trapped in a room for years actually interesting. Watching how things progress from the siblings receiving expensive gifts from their mother to having to almost eat rats from the attic when they are starved was written very well.As for the negatives, I found the characters to be very unbelievable in both their actions and their dialogue. I understand this is a \\"fairy tale\\", but the way they spoke was so exaggerated and melodramatic it became irritating. They switched from sounding very childish (\\"Oh, golly day, Chris was ever so smart!\\") to sounding as if they were reading from a text book or lines from a very dramatic soap opera. Also, I was disappointed in the ending - I thought the twist was excellent; however, I wanted revenge, and I was disappointed when that didn't happen. I understand this is a series, but I wished it would have been wrapped up in one novel rather than being dragged on.The incest did not bother me (maybe because I'm an only child? Ha ha), but at times it did seem very far-fetched that it only took three years of confinement for two siblings to have consensual sex. Despite this I thought it was written in good taste, without being too explicit. It did not stray away from the real disturbing story about four children kept hidden away from the rest of the world. A highly recommended read."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Flowers in the Attic is one of those books that everyone you know seems to have read when they were a teenager. The book was pretty slow going for me in the beginning. Once the children get locked in the attic, they wanted out. So did I. I put the book down repeatedly. It just wasn't working for me, but once I sat down and really pushed myself, the pages started flying.Flowers in the Attic is horror in the scariest sense, the horror that could truly happen. The terror that occurred was not perpetrated by some supernatural bogeyman, but human beings being inhuman to each other. There has been a lot of talk about the incest portrayed in this book, as it was the only thing I had heard about before reading it. It was there and it was graphic, but not overtly so. It was important to the storyline and as tastefully done as possible given the topic. It didn't seem to be written for shock value, but to help the deeper meaning of the story emerge.The ending of the book threw me. Everything was resolved and satisfying, in a sense, but it wasn't the way I wanted or expected the story to end. I wanted I wanted vengeance, revenge, retribution, but, in the end, V.C. Andrews stayed true to the personalities of the characters she created and the ending made more sense because of it. I don't think I would have appreciated Flowers in the Attic if I had read it as a teenager, but as an adult it was definitely a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"When Flowers in the Attic came out in the late 70's, my best friend in high school read it, so I did too. I normally cannot read horror books (that's what Borders classifies these books under), but these are on the mild side compared to Steven King and others.There are no blood and guts or supernatural elements. The story of the Dollanganger kids is heartbreaking, but compelling. Normally, I am too sensitive for horror, but I found myself buying the whole series 30 years later and devouring each one. They are easy to read and leave you wanting more.There are some mature elements, so parents are cautioned and certainly some with extra high moral values will be put off, but I think there is worse being written, said, sang and telecast every day in 2006. At least this is fiction!A very enjoyable \\"Mild Horror\\" read."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Imagine four kids struggling to live in an attic.After their father died and things started to go a little bad for their mother she decided to move in with her mother,promising her kids that things would be better.But when their grandmother looks them in the basement to avoid their grandfather from seeing them(the reason the grandmother is so cruel is not understood until reading Garden of Shadows),things turn bad.The food which was initially good,starts to turn to crumbs,sometimes they weren't even fed.One of the kid died.One of the other who escaped death remained short.(her growth was stunded by lack of proper nutrition).The elder brother and sister played the relevant \\"parental\\" roles toward the younger ones,learning all they can about life from the books stocked in the attic.They even tried to escape once,but things didn't turn out once.Their mother kept making promises that weren't kept.She was a selfish bitch.In this book the author mixes horror,suspense,and lust in a way never that is unique.I don't want to give away the whole story.But all I can say is that it is a great book and after seeing how sad and great the ending is,you definitely would have or want to read the second book in the series...Enjoy...Nigel."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I remember seeing this movie when I was young and decided to see how the book was. Well it was way better than the movie and now I am hooked. I am onto the next book Petals on the Wind and I can't wait to read the rest in this series. I don't want to give anything away, but you defiently have to read this book."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I was recently having a discussion with a friend about how time changes your perspective... things that once seemed relatively simple can wind up being deeper and more complex than you realized, and things that once seemed very profound can wind up looking downright silly. The recordings of The Moody Blues are an example of the latter - in my early to mid-teens, they seemed timeless and full of wisdom, whereas now (I'm in my late 20's), they seem rather hair-brained (though still catchy in spots). Likewise, I remember reading _Flowers in th Attic_ at age 16 and being quite deeply moved by the story of children who lose their father, are forced into seclusion, and ultimately abandoned. The description of their struggle to stay sane and maintain hope while growing up behind closed doors seemed very real, as though the author were writing from experience of some sort (literal or figurative).Then, a year or so ago, I happened upon a book entitled _Petals on the Wind_, which identified itself as a sequel. On a lark, I decided to check it out and bring it home. You can imagine my shock to find I was reading, in essence, a soap opera, filled with wretched plot contrivances and gaily waving around the topic of incest as if it were just another card to be played. I only got a few chapters in before returning it to the library.So where does that leave me... ? I haven't gone back and re-examined _Flowers in the Attic_, and I probably won't. It's probably best to hang on to the vantage point that I have, which was that of its intended audience (a teenager). So, if you are a teen, I do recommend this book. It's a fast read, and you may get something out of it. Just make sure that this kind of book isn't all you read, and should you choose to pursue its sequels, do not take them too seriously."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I'm 14, and I read this book a year ago. It is the BEST book I have EVER read in my LIFE! I reccomend it to EVERYONE who wants to be intreuged and likes to read GOOD BOOKS! This review will probably not help you in anyway, I just had to give honour to V.C Andrews for producing the best books ever published. RIP."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"READ THIS BOOK FIRST OF THE SERIES!! I just finished reading the Dollanganger series. This was one of the better ones. There were 5 in the series : 1) Flowers in the Attic 2)Petals on the Wind 3)If there be thorns 4)Seeds of yesterday 5)garden of shadows. The best books were #1, 2, 5. I did not care for the 3rd book, but you should read it if you are going to read the whole series!! HAPPY READING! This book is shocking and eye opening, i reccomend it!"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This is by far the best book that I have ever read!!! It is absolutely amazing! I have never ever EVER read a book as amazing as this one! It is just so great!! It starts out with these four siblings. They have the perfect life. Everything is happy. Then the father is killed in an accident and that is when everything takes a turn for the worse!! The mother takes her children to live at her mother's house. The are forced to live in the attic for certain reasons. From here on, the web of lies and betrayal begins. Have you ever seen the movie &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; with Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment? This book reminded me of it a little, because after you finish reading it, you look back and you understand why everything happened in the story. You understand why the characters did what they did, because they did everything for a reason. When I finished reading it I was &quot;Damn!&quot;. It has a very intricate story. Yes, I know that some think that it drags in the middle, but it is very interesting. And you have to pay attention, because that is when a lot of the things that makes the story so great occur. This is by far the best book that I have ever read. I read the next book &quot;Petals in the Wind&quot; and that one was also very amazing, but nothing can top the first one. I will be extremely happy if I ever read a book that was half as good as this one. Some people may think that it is not realistic, but I disagree. They may think that it would be unreal for a mother to leave her children in that attic so long and starve. But if you think of what is at stake, then hell yeah it is realistic. As sad as it may seem, but this book made me realize that although we really wish that love makes the world go 'round, it isn't necessarily true. It made me realize that greed and money makes the world go 'round. I know that it is a little depressing, but this is an absolutely amazing book. Order it! It is totally awesome!! You will like it! Some may not like certain parts of it and decide that they hate the book because of some parts of immorality, but it is still a great story. The characters who commited to immoral act weren't exposed to that sort of thing, because their lives were wated away in that lowly attic. You will see when you get there. You have to read this book. It is the greatest!! I just hope that VC Andrews other books are as good as this one. But once again, I would be very impressed if any were half as amazing as this one. I also started her other series &quot;Melody&quot;. It wasn't as good as &quot;Flowers&quot;. It is a good book, and I do often think about Melody and her situation from time to time, but the Dollanganger series is the best so far. Another thing that you must remember is that VC Andrews herself didn't write that series. She died, and they got someone else to continue writing books of her style in her name so her legacy could go on, but it ust isn't the same. I am going to read some of her other books that she did write to see if they are as good. Well, I better shut my mouth. I'll let you read it and find out for yourself how great it is. Order now! You'll dig it!"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"The book is a very dark story about four children who are secretly locked away for years in their grandparents's attic with the idea that in doing so it will help their poor, widowed mother gain her father's vast fortune. The story explores many of the issues that adolescents face: isolation, loneliness, betrayal, and questioning authority and family.Loved this book as an adolescent. I could relate to the character's feeling trapped and stifled in a situation, wanting to break free, but not knowing how. The book is well written and keeps you in suspense. Be forewarned: some of the content is risque, to say the least."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Out of all the novels I have read over the years, and that is a lot!, this classic from V.C. Andrews ranks still as my number one favorite! The whole series is excellent but this one shines as the best! Most of the people I have recommended this book to say, &quot;Oh I saw the movie already.&quot;, and showed no interest in the book. What a travesty! If you have not read the book go out and buy it NOW!"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I read this book a while ago, and lemme just give you some background. I'm just not easily interested by books, but if it's a really good book, I'll read it like that &lt;snap&gt;. And this book took me two days to read. It was really weird how the grandmother and mother could do uch a horrible thing, to lock four kids in a bedroom for 4 years! And I liked how Andrews twisted around the mother's character to be really nice and caring in the beginning and then basically a mean, evil woman in the end. I was glad that Andrews was able to tap into their state of mind, and realize what the kids would do in that situation. It was a very surreal book, and I could not believe how something like this could actually happen, but the more I thought about it, I realized it could. I was awestricken when Cathy was staring at herself in the mirror and the grandmother walked in and did such awful things to her. And I was so amazed when Cory died from arsenic on the donuts. I started reading Petals on the wind immediately after, and can't wait to see what happens between that nice doctor in it and beautiful Cathy..... Anyone with a half a brain can enjoy this book. I reccomend it highly."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"this book got me started loving V.C. Andrews. I get her books everytime a new one comes out! I feel like I can understand these children."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I first read this book when I was fourteen years old, and six years later it is still my all-time favorite book.

Perhaps more.Just not this particular item.Why? Because it is only satisfying as to one of my four criteria, despite my having been led to believe otherwise by reputation and the book jacket.1) Ridiculous: It certainly is. In real life, one of these children would have got on the blower and rang for the fuzz at some point in time, at the very least.2) Gothic: Not so much. Four unlikeable, bratty, suburban children with unbelievable expectations of life get locked in an attic by their rotten selfish mother and religious monkey nut grandmother. Not gothic. The fact that it takes place in a creepy old house doesn't make it any less a swoony melodrama.3) Pornographic: Are you kidding? Didn't anybody tell these nice white people that it's not okay to pork your relatives? The only good thing I can say about the whole incest theme is that in the book it is just about as disgusting and un-sexy as I'm sure incest is in real life. That said, there's no other dirty bits included, just the disgusting incest plots. Worse, the incestuous couples fall in love with each other in this revolting, romantic, sloshy sort of way. Ick.4) Twaddle: This book is not entertaining enough to be twaddle. It's not so bad it's good, it's so bad you cant believe people like it so much.Okay, maybe as someone who enjoys Lovecraft, Poe, and Basil Copper on werewolves on one hand, and Christopher Lee putting the bite on various sundry bints and Oliver Reed made up (minimally) as a werewolf on the other, I'm not the intended audience for VC Andrews. But, when something is marketed as horror, even if its not up to the standards of Lovecraft or Poe, or even Stephen King and Clive Barker, one does expected a bloody good time and some decent dirty bits.This stuff should be shelved in the Romance section where it belongs."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I have a feeling I will probably be in the minority regarding my review of this book. I had read it in middle school many years ago. I read the entire series mostly for a laugh, and I did laugh and become disgusted with the author at the same time. I'm glad I had the opportunity to realize what real writing talent is or else I might have been reading trash like this for the rest of my life. There are so many better books out there that deserve a five star rating...this one, however, is not one of them..."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This is where the whole series began for some odd reason the author chose this as the starting point. I guess because it was her first novel, and I guess she wannted to see if it would sell. It sold beyond her wildest dreams. This actually left off from the \\"Garden Of Shadows\\" saga. It begins as Cathy's story left off from the Grandmother's story of \\"Garden Of Shadows\\". It talks of the marriage of brother and sister Christopher and Corrine, and how they would have 4 beautiful children, but then tragedy strikes when Christopher is killed by a drunk driver, and Corrine feels the only way to survive is to go home to Foxworth Hall. I'm sure that the kids wished there'd be another way, but it shows that Corrine is in a hurry to get back to life as usual, and assumes that the kids will adjust quickly, but as we notice that's far from the truth, and there's a hint of prophecy that Corrine is fully aware of what lies ahead of them as she snaps at Cathy to \\"wake up the twins, and make them walk....because they'd better get used to walking outdoors while they can.\\" The kids had every right to be upset with thier mother because they had no idea of what lay ahead at Foxworth Hall, and are shocked to come to a cold impersonal welcome by an elderly woman with steel blue hair. They are all the more shocked when they find out that boys and girls are not to sleep together. There's alot of rules of do's and don'ts as well, and they see their mother alot in the beginning, but as time passes on the reconciliation is slow, and at times it seems as though the mother is just giving them a little bit just to let them know they're hungry, and why shouldn't they be? They're children, and need love, and space to grow not to be in an attic. Unfortunately, the mother learns to be cold and impersonal as she brings them gifts thinking that can buy the silence a little while longer, but after a long while without a visit, and alot torture by the grandmother of putting tar in Cathy's hair, deprivation of food to where they resort to eating rats, and Chris slashing his wrist to make the kids drink his blood, and the beatings she shows up, and is shocked at the kids anger. Unfortunately, the high road only makes it only more muddled I feel if the kids told her what they had to endure at the hands of the grandmother perhaps that would've woken up the mother, and made her do the right thing, but as they looked at the big picture, and confronted her with that it put the mother on the defensive, and drove her away all the more. Pretty much the mother remarries, and now she spends a longer time away, and then mysteriously children start to get sick. This would've gone unnoticed had it not been for Cory's violent illness. Unfortunately, he dies while Cathy and Chris are trying to steal money to get themselves out as they feel that their mother has all but abandoned them. Something else dies during this time, and that's Cathy and Chris's virginity as one night after Cathy stole a kiss from her mother's new husband Chris is angry at her, and in a moment of anger, and lust crying out he sexually assults her, but she didn't put up much of a fight. If only their mother knew what had just happened....would she be mad, or not care either way? However, more innocence is lost when they find out that the grandfather was dead for over a year, and thier mother never let them know. What's more they were poisoned with arsenic on the donuts, and it was not the grandmother, but the mother who did this. It would be the high road again that would cause the wounds to not heal as in the end of this story Cathy throws the evidence in the trash can in order to keep them together as they were afraid that if they went to the police they would be separated, and put into the foster care system besides the publicity. Let's face it the high road is good in one way, but in others it's not worth the paper it's written on. The moral of this story is to tell the truth even if it does hurt, and keep telling the truth until someone believes."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I wish I could rate this no stars because it is singularly atrocious. What mother in her right mind would willingly allow her children to be locked away for three years in an attic, terrorized and brutalized by their evil grandmother? And what mother would stand back, doing nothing to find her children once they fly the coop?Implausible story and sickening plot. Evil grandmother puts tar on Cathy's hair, beats the children, threatens and starves them. How's THAT for a loving household?I've heard of skeletons in the closet, but not the attic. Chris rapes his sister, Cathy allows Chris to maintain an incestuous relationship with her and of course we have twins. Standard V.C. Andrews fare is an incestuous or quasi-incestuous relationship among siblings and more often than not we can count on twins being added to the mix. This installment was the first to feature a villainess named Olivia. V.C.

The moment I started reading it, I couldn't put the book down!! Reading the book itself has made me think more maturely. The book may be a fiction but I know that characters in that book exist in the real world. I feel that every character in that book reflects some part of our own lives. We often think we are better than the rest and holier than other people, selfish, arrogant and lust..I guess we are just deceiving ourselves if we say we do not have that sin. In short, this book is just awesome!!"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I have recently read many of the reviews, and I can agree that they are right. I was recommended to read this book when I was ten years old by my babysitter, now, three years later I still weep when the little boy Cory dies, and the mother Corinne shows no emmotion. It really hit home for me then, and always will, for I was in a simular state of mind ~no my mother did not lock me in an attic~. The truth about this story is nobody can say it was horrible. I mean it is, but it's the kind of story that you can easily believe. I mean ask yourself, and be honest, what are four children when compared to the riches that only can be harbored in your wildest dreams? Would you pass up that kind of money just stay with your children? Honestly, although many will say of course not, I can be honest and say I would. Call it dispicable but it's true....greed lives very popularly in human nature. In this novel V.C Andrews knew this and tried to capture that story I believe, having Cathy, the sucpicious one, the likely smartest one in this story, serve as the the one who was lauged at and ignored somewhat by Chris, Carrie, and Cory, who where optimist and who must have known deep down that Cathy was right."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"A mother filled with greed, a grandmother filled with hate and jealousey, and an attic full of imagination. These are the only things that Cathy, Chris, Cory and Carrie had that reamined true during their most percious years of life, childhood. After the death of their beloved father, they were taken by their mother, and brought to their evil, hateful, grandmothers house. There, they were locked up in a small room, with a door leading to the attic. They were locked up there &quot;temporarily.&quot; In that attic, the children played, somewhat happily. Chris being 14, Carrie and Cory being 5 year old twins, and Cathy being 12, were robbed of many things growing up in this attic. Another thing to deal with was their cruel grandmother. This life was very hard for all of the children, but it mad for a very interesting story. I would reccommend the book &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot; to anyone who likes suspensful stories that you simply cannot put down. This novel, by V.C. Andrews, is an amazing work of literature, that is well written and creative. It is a very powerful story that causes you to think about situations you never realized existed."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This is the second of a magnificent series of five books. Never, has a novel haunted me like this one. It will stay with you years after you read it. The story is deeply touching and sad. I have never wanted a villian to pay so much for her actions as much as I did in this book. I find myself rereading these books at night when I cannot sleep and I am once again awed and bewildered by the tale of four children alone in an attic. Many people are turned off by the incest. I find it realistic, sad and intriguing. Books are supposed to explore the dark, complicated, intense desires of humans. If they didn't, the book would lack power and would fall flat on its face. Don't let that aspect turn you off. This book is priceless. I will be lucky to read another story even half as beautiful."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This was the first book written by Virginia Cleo Andrews that got published. Alright all the characters are great. Cathy is a very powerful herione,Chris is the intelligent one,Carrie and Corey are imseperable. This book is about survival. After their father dies Corrine(their mother) tells the children that they are to move in with their grandfather who is filthy rich and they will live a wonderful life. However to their horror they are to stay in the attic where there grandfather will never know about them. Because they were born out of sin,incest. They stay in that attic for over 3 years. It deals with starvation,abuse,murder,and incest."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"It was a very good book.

Intrigued by the story about the love and strength between siblings. The book like many others was by far better."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I absolutely love this book. It is such a dark beautifully written series. It started off a little slow for me but it was well worth it. I love the way these characters were developed!"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"My mom always talked about this book. I could never find it out it was always checked out. So I found it on here and I'm so glad I did. My mom was right this book out is one to read.

It is very sinister and it's hard to put the book down."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This Book is awesome for anyone who loves mystery and being shocked through out the whole book. It's sad in some parts but you never put the book down. Enjoy!!!!"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"So many thoughts for this book! The things that happen to these children are so horrific and disgusting, I just wanted to stop listening (I had an audiobook) but I couldn't. I wanted the children to fight back, to wise up, to get the heck out of the attic! But it was so insidious how this story is unfolded. It's idyllic at first, with a loving mother and father and four loving, beautiful children - such a perfect family. But then the father dies, and it's just the start of an utterly uncontrollable nightmare for these children. The mother has promises and keeps the children complacent with hope and trades on their ignorance. And gradually each layer of gilded gold is stripped away and the children as well as the reader becomes aware of the horror of what these children have to endure. I think what is so compelling about the story is how much helplessness is imbued in the characters and in their actions. They are forced to comply with their Mother and their Grandmother's plan, and having everything the reader knows filtered through the the preteen narrator Cathy, keeps the reader handicapped as well. So much is going on outside the attic that with each visit and small revelation made by their Mother and Grandmother, the sense of foreboding grows.Cathy as the narrator is easy to empathize with. She's innocent and naive, but strong-willed and intuitive. And her older brother is equally admirable (so when certain things happen with him, it's a pretty big blow) but all the Dollanganger children are so likable and sweet - it makes it doubly horrific to see everything stripped away from them. Grandmother's antagonist role as the religiously fanatical, cold-hearted attic-prison keeper is strikingly villainous and yet complex to define because with the complicity of the children's Mother it's hard to see who truly is at fault.This is certainly a strange story yet sensational, so it's understandable that it was so popular when it was first released. It's very poignant and earnest, yet there was such a sense of oppressiveness when I listened to this book because of how these horrible things were so inevitable. It was so brilliantly crafted by the author, yet so difficult to bear sometimes. It's like this book isn't just a story, it's an experience. And one that I think is going to stick with me for a very long time."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"one of the best stories I've ever read. I'm on the second in the series and I literally cannot put these books down."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Great read. Emotional story. The whole series is great. V.C. Andrews is an awesome author. I recommend all books by her. Especially the early ones that were actually written by her before her death."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This is in my opinion one of the greatest works of fiction that I've ever read. I read it the first time when I was 16. I'll admit it sent chills down my back and the story itself disturbed me. I fell in love with Cathy, how she had to care for her two younger siblings, and learn about love, sex, and devotion from the only person available, her brother. The cruel grandmother and even crueler mother will make you wonder if there really are women this evil. If you've only seen the movie, you missed three quarters of the story. READ THE BOOK! It can bring a tear to even the most cold-hearted person you know."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This novel still keeps me engrossed and mezmerized whenever I read it,or any of its sequels. I am attracted to its originality,and its frightening means to tantalize,and at the same time scare the conscience mind. V.C Andrews sophisticated yet bold unrealisticness keeps you enchanted with &quot;Cathy&quot;,&quot;Chris&quot;,&quot;Cory&quot;,and&quot;Carrie&quot;,because of their vulnerability due to the horrific trauma,and betrayal their mother has given them. V.C Andrew's shocking description,and portrayal of the oldest childrens' lude sexuality,and the defying characteristics of the guilt-ridden grandmother, and her religious redemption is both horrifying, and exciting.Her unrelenting passing on of curousity, and intrigue is pure genious."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This was a great start of the Dollanganger series and I recommend this book to anyone. True, most of the other books repeat the pattern of incest, but still they are wonderful books. I can't see how a mother could leave her children locked in an attic, and especially the sugared donuts (I can't spoil it - read the book and find out what I'm talking about if you don't know). I read the book before I saw the movie (luckily). The movie was horrible, and if I hadn't already read the book, I wouldn't have. Based on the movie, the book would be awful. I guess, based on the book, the movie is awful. But this book is really very good, you can see right into Cathy's world, feel every pain and heart-wrenching moment. I cried when she did and I laughed when she did. I felt I was her while reading the book. I could see every detail of the small room and attic. Over all it was the best!"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"My main problem with this novel was, WHY? I wanted more about the mother - how could she do it? And what was she feeling? And how could she possibly PRETEND to love her children for ten year then try to kill them for money when her husband died? And what did the Grandmother think? At least the Grandmother's character had some death - the contrast between her saying her prayers at night and the megalomaniac she was during the day was quite interesting. But how could the mother kill her son? And how did Cathy survive it all, without going insane. It was a good story, but it made no sense. It was believeable. You just had to accept that things happened, and as a reader I find that difficult unless there is some pychological study undertaken by the novelist. And what did Chris feel? As a chracter, he disgusted me and yet I felt sorry for him. But I didn't understand him. It's vintage Virgina Andrews, but My Sweet Audrina was the best. (And even that wasn't particularly good!)"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"If I had not been raised in the crazy atmosphere of a typical southern Gothic environment, I likely would have put the book down after the first few chapters. I would call this book and the author sophomoric if I didn't carry the baggage that I carry. I loved the book as it allowed me to vicariously experience my desire for revenge against a mother who is a child. This mother and my mother could have been twins even though I doubt that my mother would have been able to kill her children. The theme of incest could turn some readers off, but I suggest plodding through it -- the book is wonderful in its own way. I am now reading the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I read this because of two things: Stephen King's insistence that this book was bad and my childhood friend's insistance that it was good. With all due respect to my childhood friend, I'm going with Mr. King.The concept of this book is actually pretty cool and there were times in this book that were genuinely exciting. Unfortunately, V.C. Andrews couldn't pull her idea off. Her story is bland and the characters are one-dimensional. The grandmother is a bible-thumping stereotype. The mother is a silly, selfish nit. Carrie and Cory are whiny, annoying brats and Chris... well, Chris was just unbelievable. Especially his dialogue, which was incredibly, incredibly high-flown. I also hated Cathy. She's a small, callow, selfish person who never changes or admits that she's wrong.The opening chapter was one of the most sacchrine things I've ever read and the finale made no sense at all. Why oh WHY did she throw away the donuts? Forget not wanting to \\"sink to the Grandmother's/Mother's level.\\" She killed her son! Shouldn't she by law be obliged to send her to prison?Oh well. Two things I do want to put in perspective before I send this out: 1.) I didn't really mind the incest. I guess growing up in the Jerry Springer generation has jaded me and 2.) Yes, there are actually mothers out there who would do things like this to their children. It's sad, but they're out there, and I say that because in reality it's dangerous for us to turn a blind eye to that just because we want to envision mothers to be perfect.Okay, I'm off my soapbox. Anyway, skip this novel. There's better stuff out there."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"when my mom first gave me this book to read, i was like- uh, thx. I thought it would be boring and stupid. But boy, was a totally wrong. The more i kept reading, the more interested about it I was. I just wanted to keep reading more and more! When I finished the book, reading the last 5 chapters of Part 2 nonstop all day, i didnt know if i was happy, sad, scared, excited, and so on. I was just was glad i read it, it changed my view and feelings about a lot of things.Even though this book is fiction, all the while I was reading it... i felt like i was there with Cathy, Chris, Carrie, and Cory. Through all of there troubles and horrible life changing experences. I can feel the anger, sadness, and cofusion in these children's lives, and I think anyone who readds this book can. I can just imagine what all the people and all the rooms look like in this book.And yes, i have to admit some of the content in the book is a little hard to take in all at once, like the abuse, whippings, starvation, death and so on... but in a wierd way it didnt bother me, none of it did. It just showed me the reality of what can happen in life.Even though I dont really have so much of an urge now to read the next book in the series, I still want to keep reading more of THIS book. It captivates the reality of life and the selfishness one person can have. But also shows the love and caring these four children have for eachother.I am 13 and I just finished this book, and i believe any person of any age will enjoy it. It is one that will change the way you think about life.This is my favorite book, ever!"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This amazing, chilling yet touching book is one of the best that I have ever read. It tells the story of 4 kids that are brutalized by a heartless mother and grandmother, trapped by the coldness of greed. As you read this book you will laugh with the kids and feel their pain. You will come to admire the strength that it takes for these children to deal with the tragedy that their lives have become. You will come to love the compelling and suspenseful writing style of a talented author that was taken too soon from this world. Read this book. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"It's been labeled everything from trash to great literature. It's neither of these, of course. If you go in looking to denounce the bad syntax, the one-dimensionality of the characters, and above all the incest, that's exactly how you'll come out: disgusted, and itching to write a scathing review so everybody else will know how much this book sucks. Likewise if you're eager to escape into V. C. Andrew's dark fantasy world and fall under the spell of one of the most enthralling gothic fairy tales of all time, you'll come out with your eyes glazed over (or teared over). You get whatever you want out of it. So if you think this isn't something you'd be into, you're probably right and you should move onto more challenging/more realistic/less disturbing fiction.That being said, you shouldn't let it deter you that most of V. C. Andrews' fans - past and present - are teenage girls whose number one priorities include snagging somebody else's boyfriend and hiding their zits. Yes, this comes to you from a sixteen-year-old. There is something real and gripping and heartrendingly TRUE beneath the awkward language and the implausible plot twists, and it's because of that gem of truth that I'm giving it five stars. Unfortunately, there's a reason this book is the most popular of the 5-book Dollanganger series: It's the best one. Like pretty much every author before her, Andrews made the mistake of chipping away at her rare gem of truth with each subsequent sequel, until by Seeds of Yesterday I found there was nothing left except the skeleton of a setting. Really, the same general story framework is all the other books have in common with this one. If you want to know what happens next, read them. If you want to binge only on \\"good\\" trash, stop right here."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I read V.C.Andrews' books when I was 13/14 and I remember finishing one and running to the library to get the next. I also remember being interrupted in the middle of one of the books and looking up, realizing that I had become so engrossed in the book that I WAS the character. And at that moment relief flooded me that I was at home, and I was me. That is how intense and well written these books are (I'm talking about the ones VCAndrews actually wrote, not the new ones written by someone else in her name). I would recommend these books to anyone around that age. They are on that level. I've read a lot and I remember that I enjoyed all her works immensely. They are very deep with wonderful plotting and characterization. And as I've said, VCAndrews singular talent was being able to capture the read COMPLETELY. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I haven't read this book, but i have a coomment to the African American person. I have many friends who are black, and i am white. I see no reason why you should discriminate against white people unless you want them to discriminate against you."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"You know...it's books like this that make me understand why some men think women are stupid and inferior. The stilted writing, contrived plotline and complete lack of logical progression from one event to another just made my head hurt.

Puh-leeze."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"v.c. andrews recieves my award for worst writer(s) of all time. i forced myself to read several of her books just to teach myself how not to write. i might understand someone getting some pleasure out of reading her books, but fail to see how anyone could give her a ten. 'course, thats just my opinion"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"this is the first V. C. andrews book i'v read and im somewhat disapointed. in most of the other reviews for this book they go on and on about how great this book was. well in my opinion i feel it had NO POINT. in the begining it starts out good then in the middle it completley slows down. (i mean come on do we really care when color each flower being painted or made is?) at the end it speeds back up and becomes more interesting. i wished it had more so now i am going to have to read the rest of the series because i want to know what happened and because i'm the kind of person that finishes whats been started.but this book also was very unrealistic. i find it very hard to believe any mother would willingly let her 4 children be starved and beaten, while being locked in an attic. also whats with all the incest? i really doubt no matter how un-satisfied you are, that you would &quot;fall in love&quot; with your sister/brother. thats just plain wrong.if you enjoy books that are somewhat pointless and have nothing better to do then go ahead and read it. but if you want to read a really good book i suggest finding another one, cuz this isnt it."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I first read the entire saga as a teenager in Edinburgh. I was enthralled by all the 'naughty' issues raised &amp; felt deeply adult dealing with the concept of incest. However, even as a 14 year old I became increasingly aware that I was reading unmitigated rubbish as the series went on. Oh look: She's a world famous ballerina without a Gulag training. Chris: MY didn't you do well. I seem to remember some strange Bart creature who couldn't feel pain, although there was no explanation how he became a rich &amp; handsome stud. I don't remember much more, but I 'm glad I've grown up. By 16. One review states 'I recommend this to anyone who can read'. Read at your own risk. Anne Frank anyone?"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This book will hold your interest, somewhat, but it will also make you sick, somewhat. In some ways, it's like eating arsenic, if you catch my drift.You know it's fiction, because Momma is so hung up on money, to the exclusion of her children. Do you know any mothers like that?Yes, there may be mothers like that, but I don't know any.Life in the attic with Chris and Cathy is not always exciting, and how could it be, it's just life in the attic.That's one of the good points about the book: it makes you wonder how you would react in such confinement. This might be a good book for incarcerated people to read.There's a lot of hatred floating around through this book, and even Chris and Cathy finally learn to hate. Cathy seems to learn long before her older brother. Chris seems to always keep his balance, except when he falls in love with his sister.Is this a reflection of the real world?It's fiction. If it were the real world, it would be in the newspaper.\\"The grandmother\\" has a mixed-up notion of what the Bible is telling her.Anyway, I could never have stayed up in an attic as long as these people did.Cathy, as the second-born, could not act on her impulses to escape without Chris giving her support and going along with the idea.The author repeats several times that Chris loves his Momma and he doesn't want to cross her.But stay in an attic? I doubt it. But then I'm not sixteen with three younger siblings.So, although this book is older now and the ghost writer, old whats-his-name, has flooded the book reading public with sequel after sequel, this book is still interesting.I intend to continue with book two in the trilogy, but only after I get the taste if sugar donuts out of my mouth, and that might take a while.Diximus."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This is a stupid story and a disillusioning one. How can any mother justify having her children locked away for three and a half years in an attic? How can any mother justify letting her children be ill treated by their evil grandmother? How can any mother poison her children's food? How can any mother be so consumed with greed for money as to be party to this?This was real VC Andrews and not the ghostwriter. I'm sick of brothers and sisters in these stories becoming lovers. This book is bad."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"A horrible warped book which rationalizes incest and promotes the idea that love of anyone or anything is okay if you desire it. Don't read this. It's poisonous."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"It is probably because I read Seeds of Yesterday, first. I totally understand her personality flaws, not of her own doing.I can also understand why she hated her spoiled daughter and her inbred incestious grandchildren. Why did she have to put up with them? They proved her to be right in the latter books, they were selfish, mentally imbalanced and evil."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"One sick book! Tells of brother, sister sex, starving small children, with a disgusting plot. I would suggest a Danielle Steel book as V.C Andrew's books have the same dull thread... dead parents, kids end up with an evil care taker along with some incest to thicken the plot. Very dull read."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Okay, I realize that this novel is nothing resembling great literature. But that just doesn't matter nor does it affect my pure enjoyment of this series, as it is a well-written, completely engrossing story.Flowers in the Attic is a *fairy tale*. A dark, twisted fairy tale, but a fairy tale all the same. This means that the characters and situations within the story should NOT be expected to be realistic in any form. Anyone complaining about the lack of realism is not seeing it as it should be seen. It takes place in some strange, imagined land that almost mirrors our world but not quite. It starts out all shiny and happy, describing the perfect, blessed existence of this beautiful family, and then it descends into a nightmare. Many of the complaints about the shallow characters are accurate but in my opinion it fits with the theme. The characters here can be silly and melodramatic and stereotypical. Nobody in this book talks like a real person would. Some of the older male characters are never developed at all but just kept shadowy, sometimes sinister figures who want to prey on Cathy and other women. And Cathy...she is the ultimate fragile blond-haired fairy tale princess. Only the twisted, upside-down version. Others have pointed out that she is not a likeable character. This is true, especially if you have read the rest of the series. But I don't believe that she was meant to be likeable. The abuse she has suffered has made her too messed up to be likeable, and her increasingly selfish, cruel behavior makes it very hard to have any sypmathy for her. So how did the author manage to make me care so much about a character's story when I so dislike the character? It all lies in the telling of it, the subject matter, the horror that goes beyond evil villains and straight into the human psyche. The incest, for example, lends a deeply unnerving, disturbing, and tragic element to the series that no fairy tale monster could have inspired. I can't believe some people think this book would have been better off without it? Some need to gain a wider perspective.I've read this series countless times and I hope VC Andrews knew how much her stories touched people. That ghostwriter tries pathetically to copy her style and fails. His novels are all the exact same, and they are boring and tame to boot. He is scared or just unwilling to go to the places she explored. At my local bookstore they still keep his novels under Horror which is quite laughable. Andrews' books belonged there; his would be more at home under general young adult fiction.FitA is a story meant to get under your skin. It has been condemned in churches and to this day still brings about strong reactions in people, whether they are positive or negative, and so I think the story succeeded in its purpose. Love it or hate it, I doubt you'll ever forget it."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This is not fine literature, nor will anyone ever mistake is as such. The plot is better than that of the average bodice-ripper, with some interesting twists and a hint of mystery. The characters are a little one-dimensional, but Andrews throws in just enough lust, smut and violence to keep it interesting.If books were foods this book would be a big bag of potato chips. You really should eat better, but sometimes you just have to cut loose and indulge."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I was introduced to this spellbinding saga when I hired the film Flowers in the Attic (about 5 years ago). When I learned that there existed a book about this story, I just went to look for it and bought it. It is a shockingly true book, a pure example of greed and selfishness. When I read it for the first time I could not stop thinking that I might turn out to be a bad parent since the mother in the story was so normal in the beginning but then she changed... But to understand the whole reason of such cruelty one has to read the whole series starting with Flowers in the Attic, then Petals on the Wind, If there be Thorns, Seeds of Yesterday and finally the prequel of all the series: Garden of Shadows (the start of all the deceit) When I read Garden of Shadows, dealing with the early misfortunate life of Olivia, I thought that after all she was not as bad as she turned out to be. Ill treatment from her husband and the death of her two sons made her search for something to console herself into, which unfortunately turned out to be hypocritical religious teachings by the horrible and perverse John Amos, a distant cousin of Olivia and butler of the Foxworths. Unfortunately, the creator of such vile actions (the grandfather) suffers the least whilst the mostly innocent (the children) suffer the most. After reading this book, whenever I happened to pass by a large mansion, I used to ask myself if there might be someone hidden in one of the rooms of the uppermost floor, waiting to come out... My only regret is that this story is based on a true story."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I read this novel several years ago-when I was about 15 or 16-for the first time. It has remained my favorite since then. I have often thought that this story, more than any other, exemplified the dark shadows in the human heart. The story speaks volumes-if the reader can put aside their own paranoia about incest and abuse and the other things that go on in society that most people want to sweep under the rug and pretend it doesn't exist. The story speaks to the vulnerability of children, how every child is really at the mercy of their parents. What happens in childhood reverberates throughout one's life. I thought Cathy was the most painfully real heroine-all of her emotions poured out on the pages-enough to fill your eyes with tears for all she could have been and what, you knewm she would become. She is full of justifiable hate, yet racked by guilt, desperate for love, consumed with desire, but at heart a good person. The incest was disturbing, but written so well, that even the most cold-hearted reader couldn't help but pity Chris and Cathy. Circumstances forced them to make choices that they might otherwise not have made. The story is haunting, the kind of thing that keeps you thinking long after the book is finished. Wondering if the children's horror were yours, how would you have turned out?"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Flowers in the Attic is about four children (Chris, Cathy, Cory, Carrie) who are locked away in their grandparent's northern room and attic to secure their mother's (Corrine) chance at inheriting her dying father's fortune. You see, her father's will states Corrine must not have had any children from her first marriage (which recently ended when Corrine's husband died in a car accident, leaving them penniless and heartbroken), or she would be disinherited. The reason for the grandfather's disdain of Corrine's marriage: Corrine had eloped with her half-uncle (who is actually not her half-uncle; read Garden of Shadows and you'll find out who he really is). Now, the grandparents are highly religious people and they believe any children that would result from that marriage would surely be deformed and evil. Therefore, Corrine creates a plan to hide her children &quot;safely&quot; away in her parent's enormous mansion (Foxworth Hall)--with the help of the grandmother--and sets out to win back her father's love and acceptance and, in short, his money.The book is told from the point of view of Cathy Dollanganger, who is probably one of my favorite heroines in all of V. C. Andrews' books. She is a strong, smart 12-year-old whose main focus is to become a world-famous ballerina. Her older brother Chris is more intellectual and eventually wants to become a doctor. They are tolerant, at first, of being kept in a room with no sun or friends, but the days soon begin to drag on and still no word of their grandfather's death. Yet they hold on for their mother and try to rationalize their sacrifice of freedom for those millions of dollars.Before long, the abuse starts: the grandmother's cruel punishments begin with whippings and escalates to starvation. The children have nobody to turn to since they've been alienated from the world and even their mother has grown more absent from their lives, too busy traveling all over Europe and flirting with a man who will eventually become her second husband. So, they turn to each other instead for solace, which soon becomes complicated when Chris and Cathy hit puberty and start experiencing unsettling yearnings for each other. This attraction is obvious to the grandmother and gives her more reason to punish the grandchildren she believes are the spawn of Satan.By the end of the book, one of the Dollanganger children dies from food poisoning and the remaining three promise to somehow escape Foxworth Hall. Also, the mystery of who poisoned the children's food is discovered--and it's not who you would immediately assume.Flowers in the Attic is V. C. Andrews' first and most popular book. It's also the first in the Dollanganger series; Petals on the Wind, If There Be Thorns, Seeds of Yesterday, and Garden of Shadows follow.The book was later made into a movie in 1987 and starred Kristy Swanson, Louise Fletcher, Victoria Tennant, and Jeb Stuart Adams. V. C. Andrews even had a small cameo as the window washer/maid. The movie isn't exactly like the book (which is true for most movie adaptations), but it's still one of my favorite movies. I strongly recommend anyone who read the book to see the movie, if not to at least say you have seen and read both. If you saw the movie without reading Flowers in the Attic, you'll probably like the book much better. There are more things that are revealed in the book that were excluded from the movie, like several intimate moments between Cathy and Chris, which weren't included for obvious reasons. Plus, the ending of the movie is very different from the book. It would have been nice if it had ended appropriately so a possible sequel could have been made.In short, I loved Flowers in the Attic and I would recommend it to anyone who can read. There are certain topics, such as incest and child abuse, which might be offensive to more sensitive readers, but for those that it doesn't offend: definitely find a copy of this book and read it."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I was first introduced to &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot; through the 1987 film starring Kristy Swanson. Now, these many years later I have finally read the book. I started out of order, reading &quot;Garden of Shadows&quot; the last book in the series, but prequel to &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot; first. I have to say that this book is very good! You will be glued to the book from start to finish.The story revolves around the Dollanganger family. One evening Christopher Dollanganger dies in a car crash and his family, consisting of his wife and four children, must go back and live with their family in Foxworth Hall. Both Christopher and his wife, Corrine, grew up in this mansion. It is because of their incestuous marriage that they were both banished from their home and their family.Wanting to recapture her father's adoration and love, Corrine comes home and hides her children, so that she may inherit his vast fortune. She asks her mother to watch over the children, who are confined to the North wing of the house. They are not allowed to leave this area and can only go up into the attic. Soon their mother pretty much abandons them and leaves them to rot in the attic while she lives her life without them. Their evil grandmother does everything in her power to make them feel as bad, horrible, and dirty as possible, wanting to punish them for what their parents had done nearly 20 years prior. Soon the children discover that they are slowly being poisoned and why they are trying to be killed.This book is an excellent tale of deceit, love, hate, pain, and triumph. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone! You won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This book is one of the best books that I have ever read, it kept my attention the whole way through and I never wanted to put it down. &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot; is the story of a selfish mother who locks her four children in an attic with the hope that they will be let out in less than a month. Corrine, the mother,loses her husband and can barely support her four kids so she moves in with her parents. Her parents are rich and her father is very sick, but Corrine was written out of his will when she disgraced the family, so her goal is to please her father so she can be written back into the will and inherit everything. Cathy and Chris, the two eldest children are supportive until the months turn into years, and their mother stops visiting, and the younger children become sick. The kids find out the mother has been planning to leave the children in the attic forever and all hell breaks loose. Even with the hardships that the children face, the eldest are heroic in standing up to their mom and being parents to their younger siblings. This book is extremely exciting even though it takes place in only a attic. With a little bit of incest and a evil grandmother looming, this book will definately grab your attention."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"\\"Flowers in the Attic\\" was one of those books I read in high school when it was relatively new and an underground (so to speak as it was a major seller!) guilty pleasure for a teenager to read. How does it hold up with time? Does it matter? This book has everything that a teenager - both boys and girls - crave in a book: sex, evil parents, violence, wicked grandmothers, and a deep dark attics. This book was so disturbing to my 15 year old brain...but a pleasure as well.If you don't know the story, here is what you need to know...Dad dies, mom picks up and returns to the mansion of her rich parents with her kids. Mom was disowned when she married her dad, and now must get back into their good graces. Grandma hates the kids and locks them in the attic. Mom rediscovers her local social life. The kids must entertain themselves and take care of themselves. Anything more would give away meat and the juice of book - which you have to read for yourself.Come on...you know you want to...hide with a copy of it back in a dark corner of Barnes & Noble...give into your dark side and read this guilty pleasure. But, don't bother with the rest of the series.>>>>>>>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;A Guide to my Book Rating System:1 star = The wood pulp would have been better utilized as toilet paper.2 stars = Don't bother, clean your bathroom instead.3 stars = Wasn't a waste of time, but it was time wasted.4 stars = Good book, but not life altering.5 stars = This book changed my world in at least some small way."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Bottom line, I've been alive 28 years on this earth and I've seen thousands and thousands of stories in the mediums of film, television, anime, books, and comic books, but they all pale in comparison to this. And I do not say that lightly.I enjoy horror and thought nothing more could scare me. Nothing has in years but \`Flowers In The Attic' caused me to lose two full weeks of sleep. I never thought a book could affect me so much. VC Andrews' writing style in very emotional. I really believed I was one of those children being tormented in that attic.Most of what I knew about \`Flowers In The Attic' was from the fans reminiscing on how they first read it as a teenager and it was their first \\"trashy book\\". A guilty pleasure of vulgarity.\`Flowers In The Attic' is vulgar, but far too disturbing to be classified as a \\"pleasure\\" or \\"trash.\\" \\"Sick, depraved, disgusting, depressing, vile, and horrific,\\" are better words. I could never have even envisioned that the darkest demon in hell could concoct such an atrocity. Were these the missing chapters of \`The Necrnomicon' Satan removed because they were too offensive?What's truly scary about the book is the way the children are tortured and destroyed mentally not just physically. The physical would be just a mere description of pain. The mental is evident in 12 year old Cathy's narration. We are not just seeing her pain we are feeling her emotions. Feeling her mind become twisted.VC Andrews really gets into the reader's mind and soul so that like Cathy we share her insanity of thinking. When people think of incest they are typically disgusted and or amused. \\"Ewww West Virginia.\\" \\"Ha ha, Jerry Springer.\\" Instead we end up cheering them on! Andrews makes us feel such empathy for the children that we are thrilled that anything (no matter what) has put a smile on their faces. The romance between the two is so intense.The drama of their love comes not from sex, that could simply be attributed to the raging hormones of teenagers, but rather the romance and how they are truly in love with each other. Cathy and Chris holding hands and staring into each others eyes is far more powerful and demented than anything they could have done in bed.In the sequel \`Pedals In The Wind', Cathy and Chris agree that their love is no doubt only a result of the trauma they suffered. The reality is that they did suffer the trauma and they do feel this way.How did this come to rate as my ALL TIME FAVORITE EPIC? First and foremost is undoubtedly VC Andrews' writing style. She can make paint drying seem fascinating. The conflict between good and evil could not be more intense. Children make the best heroes because they are innocents and when they achieve courage it is more rewarding. The villains being adults is effective. They are far more evil than any dictator on a throne because they are victimizing their own children simply for sadistic pleasure. There is no logic to it.In the attic the children experience everything, pain, the struggle to survive, exploration, and forbidden love which of course is the sweetest fruit in the garden.\`Flowers In The Attic' is not a guilty pleasure or a \\"hard read\\". I would recommend it because I was truly enthralled by the characters and really cared about what would happen to them next.I highly recommend the sequel, \`Pedals In The Wind', where we see how their bodies have left the attic but their minds still remain.My depression from reading this book still remains weeks later. I feel at every moment of my life in the verge of tears. All I can ever think about is the horror of the attic just like the characters must feel. The story was so powerful, the drama is very very real."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Much has been said of V.C. Andrews' controversial novel \\"Flowers in the Attic\\", though I feel a majority of this discussion takes away from the most important part of this novel: the daring storytelling.Let's face it, before \\"Flowers in the Attic\\" went into print, Young Adult literature was hardly anything special. For better or worse, Andrews forever changed the nature of the genre, enabling authors to take great risks with their characters and still find the kind of commercial success that would keep them writing.The plot is quite startling from the very beginning. The Dollanganger family, Chris, Cathy, Carrie and Corrie, are shattered upon their father's death. Taken by their mother Corrine to her grandparents' estate in Virginia, the children are told that they may remain in the home as long as their ill grandfather doesn't know of their presence, for their mother was banished from the family years ago for marrying their father.To make a long story short: The Dollanganger children discover their parents were related; half-niece and half-uncle. Looked upon by their grandmother as demon spawn, they are locked in the attic for what promises to be only a little while, but soon sprawls into years before they finally make a plea to escape.And yes, while in the attic, Chris and Cathy come of age, watch their bodies develop, and desperately try to conceal a relationship that has far surpassed anything that a brother and sister would share.Andrews' gift is her ability to create worlds of atmosphere so thick you practically feel that you're right there with her characters. The pain shared by the Dollanganger children is very real; pain that is mixed with the false light of hope that they will be released from their attic-prison and reemerge into the world.So, if you're a young adult who has never read \\"Flowers in the Attic\\", or are someone who's eager to relive a part of their adolescence, by all means buy the book and see what the fuss is about.Oh, and don't forget about the sequel, \\"Petals on the Wind\\"."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"When I first heard about Flowers In The Attic, in seventh grade, I thought it sounded like a trashy romance novel, exactly the kind of story I tended to stray from. But there I was, more than a year later, buying the entire Dollanganger series from a not-so-local library. The tragedy and horror that four naive children suffered alone in an attic was not what drew me into the story; rather, it was the way I felt as much a part of Cathy's world as Cory or Carrie. V.C. Andrews' writing was so deep and thought-provoking that I found myself in vintage clothing stores thinking &quot;Oh, that looks exactly like Cathy's dress would have when....&quot; and things like that. Of course, I had to finish the series. I found the prequel, Garden Of Shadows, shortly after starting the second book, Petals On The Wind (which, in my opinion, was the best in the series) at a used book store. But when I finished Seeds Of Yesterday, the final book, I found myself crying uncontrollably for these characters whom I had known for their entire lives. I couldn't read Garden Of Shadows, not after such a moving experience. I am glad I did not read it first, either. Such pre-knowledge would have ruined much of the books' suspenseful moments. Maybe, someday, when my visions of the Foxworth clan are not so clear as they are now, I will return again to dear old Malcolm..."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Although this isn't the best work of fiction I've ever read, it remains one of my favorites. I read it on a yearly basis almost, and every single time, it's as if I'm reading it with new eyes. This is the ONE and ONLY of Ms. Andrews's books that I found comepletely original. After her death, everything else released under her name was written by a ghost author, and none of it was half as good as Flowers In The Attic. The rest of the series is well written too, but keep in mind, she only wrote about 3 of the sequels. Her Casteel series is half wriiten by her own hand as well. But sadly, after either the 2nd or 3rd novel in that series, she died. I don't understand why her family permits these 'ghost' novels to be published under her name, unless they are doing it for the money. It's a disgrace, and they are beginning to make a mockery of her great talent as a writer. Because every single new book that comes out under her name is the same old thing! And I think all V.C. Andrews fans are getting tired of the same old thing. Let the woman and her marvelous work rest in peace"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"When I was in High School just about every one of my female classmates read FLOWERS IN THE ATTIC and its sequels. Recently I took the plunge and found out why, it's a great read! With its young, sexually and emotionally frustrated teen heroine held captive by a selfish, emotionally childish and manipulative mother and a stern, hateful grandmother, it is easy to see why this novel resonates so powerfully with female teen readers. The horrorific themes of abuse (both phsycial and mental) and incest are handled well and the book packs a surprising emotional wallop. The writing is very uneven and immature, but whether this is a stylistic choice or simply the author's own bad writing is hard to tell. Just be forewarned, the reader may want to have the sequel Petals on the Wind close at hand. Flowers in the Attic ends on a cliffhanger and you might want to read the next volume ASAP."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"OMG I loved this book!!

The book gives a great story line and plot.In Flowers In The Attic a family goes through and oercomes death, money, greed, and love. They then use these struggles to come closer as a family.Everyone calls this family the perfect family and the children the Dollanger dolls. Cathy, cory, chris, and carie were the Dollanger dolls but when their father dies in a auto accident they are forced to find some way to suport themselves. The only way they can do this is by refering to their mothers past relatives who does not care about or know about the children.

There is a lot more to the story that will leaved you shocked and amazed.Flowers in The Attic is a great book i highly recommend it to anyone who loves a great story!!"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I usually don't read books that were written many years ago, but I decided to read this 'cause I've heard about it, I've seen people in high school reading it for classes, and I know it's a classic. It was so beautifully written from the first page to the last. I was a little worried that it was part of a series. I didn't realize that when I first started the book. I usually just read books that aren't a part of the series 'cause it makes it easier for me. But series aren't so bad, and thanks to this book, I plan to read more (as well as the rest of the books in the Dollanganger series). The characters are wonderfully described and you feel like you know them yourself personally. It's a wonderful read, and although it deals with sad subjects, it really makes you think and wonder just how far some people will go when money is involved. This book won't disappoint you. I can't wait to start reading the next Dollanganger story."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Now in my mid-20s, I finally read the book that was all the rage back in middle school. Who knows why I never read it back then...probably because the girls I thought too popular and too stupid were the ones toting it around. Who knew my intuition was so good?This book is [bad]. I work in a Library, and if we had a section dedicated to [bad], this book would absolutely go on the directional sign. As it is, this book stands atop the display for Young Adult fiction, and I think that also speaks volumes.The characters in Flowers in the Attic are completely one-dimensional and despite what the author would have you think, they do not grow. There's no sympathy for or doubts about the villans. The \\"surprise\\" betrayals are only surprises for those who were in a coma for the first few hundred pages. The dialog is completely unrealistic (and having listened to the book on audio tape, I can assure you this is true). Even as a middle schooler, I think I would have known that this book was glorified Charmin.However, if you are ever looking for a brain-rotting reading experience that will cause cavities in your cranium and not stress your intellect at all, this is for you. I admit that I listened to the whole thing - even after the first 20 minutes signaled that I was in for a doozy of a ride. The reason rational adults stick with this book is also the same reason they stare at traffic accidents. And it is because of this book's \\"traffic fatality attration\\" that I award it with two stars rather than the one star that its literary value warrants."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I also have a comment for the African American reader. Perhaps the reason there weren't many Black people in the book was because the book was all about a family locked up away from everything and everyone. A white family. I really don't think that the author was trying to be offensive or racist. And I think you missed the point of the book."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"The four Dollanganger children have perfect suburban lives--until their father is killed in a car accident and, unable to support her children alone, their mother returns to her abusive parents. Their grandmother orders the children kept secret, locked away in a single abandoned room with access to the attic. As their seclusion builds from day into years, the older children must become parents for their younger siblings even while they go through their own turbulent, unaided adolescence. This contrived isolation also leads the older siblings into incest, and for both the isolation and incest Flowers in the Attic is something of a guilty pleasure: a fairy-tale world of children without parents, fending for themselves and falling innocently into society's sins. However, the writing style, concept, and plot are so painfully unskilled, predictable, and clich&eacute;d that they suck even the guiltiest pleasure out of the book and, instead, render it just plain bad. The concept is intriguing, but the book itself is a waste of time, and I don't recommend it.So many of the concepts of this book are secretly intriguing: the sequestered isolation of the children, haunted by the presence of their forbidding grandmother, creates a fairy-tale world where children take the place of adults, play house, and build their own private society; the slowly developing romance between the older siblings Chris and Cathy, who have no one else to turn to for support or for love, is forbidden and at the same time genuinely sympathetic. As such there is the barest bit of pleasure in the concepts of the book and in reading to the next page, the next chapter, to see how the story unfolds and how the characters come together. For these reasons, a number of reviews call Flowers in the Attic a guilty pleasure.I would take no issue with the book if it were a titillating novel with no redeemable value, just as long as the book were still fun to read. However, Flowers in the Attic is far from an enjoyable read--instead, Andrews's writing style and storytelling verge on painfully bad. Cathy, second child and oldest sister, is the narrator; although intended to be the voice of an adult reflecting back on her early adolescence, the narrator sounds like she is still a child. She approaches her story with wide-eyed exclamation points and italics, redundant obvious statements, and exclamations like \\"golly gee!\\", and this immature narration becomes quite annoying--and strips the character of the premature aging that she is supposed to undergo. Preceded by blatant foreshadowing, most pieces of the plot are visible from a long way off. Rather than creating a tense journey to their revelation, the style renders the book's \\"dark secrets\\" laughably predictable. Combined with simplistic clich&eacute;s such as an entire family with great beauty, flaxen blond hair, and names beginning with C, the novel's construction and writing style strip it of any joy. Guilty pleasure or no, redeeming value or no, the book is horribly written. It's not impossible to read, but it is an unenjoyable waste of time.Novels about incest intrigue me, sometimes for the thought and sympathy they provoke, sometimes for the sympathy and guilty pleasure. But even as an interested reader I still have standards--although not always high, I at least prefer a book whose writing does not make me grimace or inadvertently laugh. Flowers in the Attic has intriguing premise, and the plot twists are interesting if not skillful, but I can't get past the horrible writing. Some readers may not dislike Andrews's style quite as much as I did, but I still don't recommend this book. There are better novels out there--even frivolous ones--that don't bog down their potential by skilless writing."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This book was quite disturbing in a psychological way. I was only 12 years old when I had first read this book. However I think it was more disturbing to me because I was considered gifted (I excelled in academics) and was an avid reader. The book was so good though I went and read all the other Dollanganger Series. What the mother did to her children and the history of that family was so weird. I am not judging the book in a bad way.

My fears are founded in this unabashed statement: &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot; is analogous to &quot;The Diary of a Young Girl.&quot; This analogy stems from one glaring similarity: a group of people forced into hiding. I know what you're thinking: &quot;How does one similarity, which may be incidental, make an analogy?&quot; If you read like I do, you'll undoubtedly see the comparison between the &quot;Diary&quot; and &quot;Flowers.&quot; The grandfather symbolizes WWII. Corrine promises her children that her father will die any day. The Allied nations of WWII promised a swift end to tyranny. After the grandfather's death, the children continue to suffer. Thousands of people were killed after the Axis conceded. In the grandmother, I see Hitler. True, V.C. Andrews' Hitler is a large woman rather than a short man. Still, the grandmother controls the lives of her grandchildren, her family, like Hitler controlled the lives of the Jews that once contributed so much to German society. The grandmother preached racial purity, just like her nonfictitious counterpart. Corrine, the children's mother, symbolizes Hitler's henchmen. She devises the psychotic plans to eliminate her children; plans she is able to carry out as long as the children are held captive by the war (the grandfather) and Hitler (the grandmother). Foxworth Hall symbolizes the German Empire. Of course, differences are present to make &quot;Flowers&quot; its own literary entity. Namely, three of the four Foxworth children (a majority) escape by train instead of a majority of a race travelling by train to meet their deaths. Still, one can not help thinking of the Holocaust while reaching &quot;Flowers.&quot; The world is not compelled to make sure the destruction of a race never happens again, and because truth is more poignant than fiction, one is not compelled to read the remaining four books in Andrews' Dollanganger series.

I found it disturbing to read how a parent would purposely locked her children up in an attic for years instead of sending them off to a boarding school, which I found much better if she did, just because she wanted the inheritance from her father.Overall it is one of the best book out there, and I'm pretty much appalled to know in some places this book was actually being banned because of a certain chapter. If they have taken the time to actually read what lead to that, it's is much more af an educating novel to parents out there to not repeat what the adults in this book did in the first place. I pretty much hate the ending though, cause i would like to see the adults getting what they deserved after what they did to the kids, but i guess they have better judgement."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I didn't enjoying reading this book even though it is very well written.

It involves incest and other things that I think are inappropriate for a certain age, maybe up to age 15 or so. Although, I am finding more and more that kids of all ages are reading this. I still think it is a bit strong for the younger audience.The book is timeless in it's heart-wrenching story, very unique setting and characters that are easy to become attached to. There really is no other story I have ever read like it, while there are some other stories that try to be like it. This is definitely a book that fires up your imagination while at the same time it is packed with chilling, believable (and at the same time, fantastical) drama. Almost immediately after finishing this book, I immersed myself into the prequel and sequels, unable to put them down and still wanting more to this day. It is a story that you want to continue forever without being cheapened. I also wish there were movies for some of the other books of the series, even if they are cheesy like the first one. The movie quality/plot wasn't exact or the best, but I still love to watch it because I'm very visual and it gives something a little more tangible to the book, like a haunting soundtrack. I also thought it was interesting to find out that VC Andrews makes a cameo appearance in the movie.Flowers in the attic has made a permanent mark with me. It is a haunting, magical story with an author who seems to be almost as mysterious and intriguing as some of her characters. It has left me craving for more stories with the special, magical quality this one has, without ripping it off. I just finished a pretty good book which is a bit similar and indirectly borrows things (in my opnion) from Flowers in the Attic. It is called Josie and Jack, by Kelly Braffet and is a shorter, easier read. Other than that, my search continues for other similarly captivating stories!"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I don't think I've ever been so impressed by a novel that would be considered \\"pulp fiction,\\" the stuff you buy at the drugstore, supermarket, or airport. That said, having read this first novel in the \\"Dollanganger\\" series, I would absolutely try the rest, as well as V.C. Andrews' other output.This noval covers topics such as incest, psychological torture, abandonement, illness, fantasy, anger, hatred, deceit, manipulation, sex, love, childhood, and family. The range of topics available in a story about a family is truly remarkable, and makes this book dense with meaning, interest, and suspense.This book is creepy, psychologically complex, nerve-wracking, and moves at such a ferocious pace that it I was NEVER bored reading it. The author is a master at characterization, and you will feel like you KNOW the characters inside and out after having read this book. V.C. Andrews' writing style is clear and strong, while remaining rather simple and straight-forward. Perhaps this is one reason these series of books were so hugely popular with junior high school girls when they first came out. But don't let that stop you! The author's style is good for any level of reader, will not bore the more advanced, and will not intimidate the less well-read.If you're looking for a tightly-written, fast-paced, psychologically intense and at times, jaw-dropping read peppered with bits of sex, intrigue, fashion, and secrets so thick you could cut them with a knife, this is a great book to try!"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This is probably the 4th book I've ever read in full. I first read Oliver Twist, Hook, the To Kill a Mockingbird. After reading them, I started getting hooked to novels where children or teenagers were the main characters because it deals with more drama and adventure especially when they overcome the obstacles and conflicts of the story. There is more glory there, than with adult main characters.I was captivated by the book, first time I saw it in Walmart in 1998. The front page was intriguing, coz i thought it was a ghost novel. I read the writeup at the back of the book, and I was already held enthralled by that alone, so I bought it straight away. Once I started reading it, i read it through my vacation. And read it over twice before I bought the sequel petals in the wind.The horror it promised wasn't what I expected. But it opened a newer view in me. The drama of the young ones, in a teenage girl's point of view was what caught me so addicted to it. I think the psyche of a young girl who was growing was put in words, and in a way I experienced it...the growing pains, the pangs, and internal struggle, the raging hormones, and the desire of heterosexual relationships.Although the love story in it is sick, it still is for me, one of the best love stories I've ever read. And it is brought down throughout the series, but this first book is superior above all in dealing with everything, and most especially the love story between the two main characters.I'd say the characters were well-developed, all of them. and the plot is interesting...and interesting as it grows, as the themes grow with it. the themes range from the growth and maturity of the main characters, lovestory between brother-sister, the conflict with the mother, their life inside the locked room and attic, and how they made life out of it. Each them growing and rising in action and excitement, I really couldn't keep the book down for more than a day."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I will say that this book took me awhile to get into it. It begins slow but picks up steam so to speak midway through the middle on up into the end and I beleive the reason might have been because I already knew what would happen for I had seen the movie which does no justice at all to the book yes there is a incestous relationship between the brother and sister but you have to understand they stayed locked up for 3 years they turned to the only people they trusted and that was themselves of course this book is nothing but tragedy through and through everything the kids endured from the arsenic to haveing to eat mice in order to survive V.C. Andrews was able to make me feel the pain and the sorrow that Carrie Chris and Cathy went through to get out of there own private hell I would recommend this book to anyone 15 or older"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"There isnt a book out there quite like this one! Flowers in the Attic is a dark, horrifying and mysterious book about four children locked away in a secret room while the await their mother's re-inheritance. These are normal children growing up in highly unusual and horrible circumstances. Although quite a bizzare novel, it deals with many real life conflicts and feelings such as love, incest,jealousy, and especially greed. The mystery of this book will keep you turning pages all night long; when you finish you'll be dying for more, so dont forget to check out the sequals!"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This book is one of the best books I have ever read! It is the first book written by the late V. C. Andrews and not by the ghostwriter who writes all the books put on the shelves under her name today. Imagine, four children, locked away in the attic of their grandparent's massive mansion becuase their existance must never be known to their highly religious and extremely wealthy grandfather. They will spend the following three years wishing for a life filled with sunshine and human contact and planning what they will do when they are set free. But, before this happens, they will undergo the biggest betrayel possible from the mother they thought loved them more than anything in the world. Once you pick it up, you won't we able to put it down."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I first read this book when I was entering the seventh grade, and while I had seen the movie previously, I was not prepared for the experience. The only proper word for it is &quot;harrowing&quot;. There is something in this book--this tale of four children locked away and at the mercy of a demonic grandmother--that echoes through the heart and mind and refuses to let go. I myself have gone back numerous times to re-read portions of the novel.Is the book well-written? Yes, although some of the dialogue is less than realistic. The characters are all well-drawn and interesting, and the proof of this lies in the fact that the reader truly cares what happens to them. While Cory's death was a wrench, I found Cathy and Chris's situation--their incestuous love for each other--even more heartbreaking. At this point, at 23, I still cannot read the book again straight through because of it. Also, it is disturbing to think that such events (i.e.,the children's imprisonment, the abuse), really could have, and probably do, happen.This is a grim novel, an ominous indication of the trouble our world is in, but I would recommend it for the simple reason that it does what all good books are supposed to do--it makes one forget one's own problems in light of the problems being dealt with in its story."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This book is not trash (if you're looking for trash, pick up a Harlequin romance novel, the hardcore ones. They're called Blaze). In fact, I consider this book a literary work of art. One woman's trash is another woman's treasure, and this (along with its first sequel, \\"Petals on the Wind\\") are beautiful novels (though, unlike Shakespeare, the dialogue is not always eloquent, and why? Because the dialogue is written realistically. Shakespeare may be considered high culture, but few people care to read it, so is that supposed to make him a genius? I say the more people you reach, the more people you get to read your work by choice, and enjoy it, that makes you a genius). This isn't just a sensationalistic story about a consensual, incestual relationship between a brother and a sister, it's about four innocent children locked away by the mother they loved and trusted. It's about a loss of innocence. The brief sex scene isn't until the very end of the book, so if you're looking for a book to read about two people hopping in bed all the time, look elsewhere. I hate the word c*ck in reference to a man's sex organ, along with the p-word for the female, very raunchy indeed, and V.C. never stoops to this. She doesn't even come close. All her love scenes are very tastefully done, detailed just enough to be enticing, but not gratuitous.If there was an award for a book I could literally not put down, and a haunting story filled with intense, emotional characters that stay with me long after the last page has been read, then V.C. should win it. If I seem like a cretin for thinking this, I don't care. I am not ashamed to say I think this is one of the greatest books ever written. Maybe it will never be considered a classic (though I consider it so), but then, I've actually read many that are considered classics (most of which bored me to tears), and I wasn't impressed. \\"Gone with the Wind\\", a modern classic, is a \\"great\\" book, Margaret Mitchell definitely did her homework, but Scarlett O'Hara, while an interesting character, didn't make me feel for her like V.C. made me feel for Cathy. \\"Gone with the Wind\\" is a good, one-time read (I prefer the film, does that make me any less smart?), whereas \\"Flowers in the Attic\\" is a great read many times over.This book brought me to tears and isn't that what a great book is? A story that can make you feel something, characters that you care about, even love? Cathy is so much like me, perhaps that is why.This book comes with my highest recommendations."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I remember when I first heard about this book. People told me that they couldn't put it down. Now mind you, I really wasn't into reading novels, but I figured that I'd read some of it to see what all the hype was about. Well, needless to say, I, too, couldn't put it down! The story of a \\"perfect\\" american family gripped by tragedy, going to live with a twisted, \\"Holier-than-thou\\" Grandmother, to try to win the love of a dying Grandfather, only to have the lives of four innocent children destroyed by the one person they trusted the most.I do have to warn you, if you are disgusted by certain acts (i.e. incest), then you may want to think about it before reading it, however, this book is still great, in my opinion. You feel as if you are in that house, with those poor children. It made me appreciate my life and the lives of MY children a whole lot more.This book is very well written, and after reading this book, I had to go out and get all of the other books in the series. I HIGHLY suggest that you get this book and all the others (Petals On The Wind, and so on..)by V. C. Andrews.

Her books make you feel an assortment of emotions for the characters. This book made me cry and in the end happy. Evil people always get what they deserve in the end."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I first read Flowers in the Attic when I was 13. I thought then, and still do, that it was a fabuous book. V.C. Andrews brings the four Dollangager children to life, so much so that I felt myself almost believing they were real. I cried for what these fictional children endured at the hands of a fanatical and sadistic grandmother and at the thought of what a once loving mother would do to her own flesh and blood for money (and while some of it may be a bit far fetched, you don't have to look much farther than the nightly news to know a lot of this could happen). There are most defintiely some disturbing situations in this book and it is defintitely not appropriate for any younger than early teens. But it is a great read, a real attention getter and holder."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Flowers in the Attic is a captivating story about a family and its greed, love, and tragedies. After Cathy Dollanganger's father dies in a car crash, her mother has no choice but to return to the home from which she is scorned. Along with her older brother and younger twin brother and sister, Cathy trusts her loving mother when she tells them they must hide in the attic of her parents mansion until she 'falls from grace'. At first it is for a night or two, but the days become weeks, and weeks become months, as the four beautiful children stay prisoners. Forced to grow up to take care of the twins, Cathy learns about her mothers greed, and hopes to find a way out.This book is written by a skillful author, and has gotten me captivated in all the other books in her abundant collection. I would recommend this book to anybody. It is an amazing series that you will not want to put down."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Flowers in the Attic is one of the best books I have ever read. It goes into depth about everything. That\`s the reason I choose to write a review about this book. The story is about a family who has to go live with there grandparents because the Father dies. The grandmother thinks they are spawns of the devil.(It will tell you why in the book). The problem is they can not let the Grandfather know that they even exist. So they are put up in the west wing of the mantion, which is a place where knowbody goes. There are four kids in this little room, the big brother, sister, and boy and girl twins in that order. The brothers and sisters under go alot of preblems in the attic They eventually go find a door and behind the door is a stairway to an attic. They make the attic a school room, a play room, and dancing room, and whatever else they need. The Grandmother locks the door of their room so they can never get out. She makes a very long and cruel list of rules and punishments. They have to abide by the rules or else. The point is that the Mother has to win the love of her father back. So he can never know that there are kids to. I would definatly recomend this book to everyone. It defenaltly is my favorite book, so go read it if you want."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I loved this book. It was a strange story of a family broken apart by the death of their father and the tragic tale of the four children who paid the consequenses of their mother's greed and their grandmother and grandfather's cruelty. I didn't really think of it as a horror novel, though, and it wasn't suspensful, just frustrating. The incest in the book makes it more interesting and you can definately see it coming. Over all, though, it was interesting and very hard to put down because you wanted to see what would happen!"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This book was introduced to me whilst on holiday in teneriff. All I wanted to do was sunbathe, relax and have no hefty tasks to endure. But then my older sister suggested I try reading the novel. At first I had a pessimistic view, and I thought why oh why am I even bothering. After reading the back, I was reeled in. Everybody probably says the same thing in these reviews but it is true! I am aware that Virginia Andrews other series of books are supposedley predictable, typical etc, but this series of the Dollanganger family is such of a master piece, and not to be over-looked. The book has quality plus quantity and shows real depth of the terror these poor children went through. I could write much more then I have and give away the plot. But all I can say is- you will cry and cry, then run out to the book store (not the library cause you will want your own copy,lol) and buy the whole series. Its a classic and I would definitely reccommend."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I could not put this book down! There are some parts that are slow reading but the other parts make up for that. It is interesting to read how the children kept themselves busy while locked away in a room for years. Also, it shows how money can change people and V.C. Andrews showed this well in the mother of the children. I enjoyed the ending because it had a little twist that was just enough to make you go &quot;holy crap!&quot;. I look forward to reading the other books by V.C. Andrews."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I think Flowers in the Attic is a very good book. The ending kind of left me hanging there, but I can't wait until I read the next book. If I were with the kids in the attic, I probably couldn't have survived. If you like V.C.Andrew's books, I would definately recommend this book to you. It is probably one of her best books, because it makes you feel like you're one of them, and it's really interesting."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"with a depressing start, this book starts off with a bang!it captures you from the beginning. being told by cathy through the book about how her mother betrays the children by locking them in a terrible prison... an attic, with only themselves for company they create a pretend family to rely on when a member of the family is upset. and as cathy and her older brother are going through their teenage years you can imagine what will happen.the depressing start ends up reflecting the end of the book as a member of the family dies.this book has as much drama as the second so i recomend anyone who reads this first to read the second, petals on the wind, as it has as much romance as the first if not more and a lot more drama.this book is not recomended by me for younger readers as it is not suitable.i give this book 4 stars because it captures you from the very start and you will not e able to put it down until the very end of the series.happy reading!!"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This book was great!

I can't even count the times I've read this book .. and each time I can never put it down. I recommend this book to any teen OR adult who is looking for a truly great book!!"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I read this nearly sixth months ago but have re-read it many times since. I'm sure many people would consider me too young to read the book, while some would think i am the perfect age, and i think i was mature enough to read the book.This is a masterpiece of literature, no book i have read has had such a twisted, harsh, yet in the same way inspiring plot. I fyou havn't read this book i suggest you read i w/someone you cn talk about it w/, because if you are sensitive you will probably need just a bit of closure.I think mostly this book appeals to the teenage girl audience, but not so much so for men. This is not, i repeat NOT a fairytale to be read to your youngster before bed, but i do think you should let your child read this book if she/he is twelve or mature.(don't shield your child from everything, its not healthy 4 when they are finally exposed, but i'm not here to lecture)The book had a deep impact on me, mostly how a brother could do something so brutal to his sister, but he did it out of love.If there was anything wrong w/this book i think it was how perfect she played out Cathy and how innocent Cathy was. Especially when describing how she spreads her hair out on her pillow so she could &quot;breath in my strong,healthy hair,&quot; a little too pure for me. And also i think Cathy could have and should have done more. (if you don't know what i'm talking about just read the book)This is my last bit of rambling, the sequels tremendously er... well they don't compare to the origingal, Petals on the Wind was alright except that everything bad that ever happened to anyone happened to Catherine Dollanganger(Dahl/Marquet/Sheffield) happened in theat book. And If There be Thorns and Seeds of Yesterday had no plot whatsoever, they weren't stories. It would be better if you kept this book frozen in memory and not the other No offense i love her writing but thats what i think."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"My mother picked this book up for me a long time ago, saying that she read it when she was about my age. Thinking that it would be a sappy romance or a self-help book in disguise, I turned to page one. I couldn't put the book down, and I have reread the book many times. It my favorite by V.C. Andrews, and it is up with the ranks of classics like Angela's Ashes, Lord of the Rings, and To Kill a Mockingbird for my favorite book.It is a very sad, tragic, unforgettable book; the children are betrayed time and time again by their mother and grandmother, and face years in a dark and gloomy attic, waiting for their grandfather to die. It is an adult book with adult situations, so if someone is considering purchasing this for a kid, consider his or her maturity level before you buy this book!"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This book was suspensful, entertaining, and dark. You saw the world through the eyes of a young girl growing up in one of the most tragic and horrible enviroments.The relationship between Cathy and Chris is well written and interesting. Yes, it is incest, and in many aspects.... But, seeing in the perspective that he was a young man, growing up..and the only 'women' he knew was his betraying mother and his sister...who continually supported him and needed his support.The twists were ineteresting and kept you captivated. it was truly an interesting and through provoking book."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I read this book when i was fourteen. I still like it. In fact, I read all of V.C. Andrew's books. This book was interesting, but kind of messed up. I mean, it was all about incest! It's about an evil mother who locks her four kids in an attic for 3 year, and one kid dies. the older two, Chris and Cathy, fall in love, and Chris once rapes her. It's really corrupted, but other than that, it's got a good story line, and good characters. I would reccomend this book to most people my age."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"As a young teen, I was a fan of this book, and it's taken years to figure out why. It's a pulp version of &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot;, crossed with every Grimm's fairy tale that came down the pike. That this book is actually on recommended reading lists at some schools never ceases to amaze me.First of all, the protagonists are flaxen-haired beauties, starting with Chris (Prince Charming), Cathy (Rapunzel), and the cutesy twins Carrie and Cory (Hansel and Gretel). A family tragedy leads to their being imprisoned in the attic of a fabulous mansion in Virginia, which happens to be run by the evil Grandmother (Hitler or the Cruel Stepmother, take your pick). Momma (the Wicked Queen) is also complicit in this crime, reassuring her children of future wealth and happiness, while gallivanting off to parties and vacations on her own.As a story, these obvious derivations might be tolerable, were it not for Andrews' treatment of her subject matter. The text is liberally sprinkled with exclamation points (&quot;Golly Lolly&quot; being a favorite expression). It is probably not possible for this book to have the poignancy or insight of Anne Frank's true-to-life diary, but with some effort, a truly over-the-top Gothic soap opera could have been made with this material. Unfortunately, the only point of view we get is Cathy's, and Cathy is no Anne Frank, nor is she Lolita. Her &quot;blossoming love&quot; with her brother is portrayed with all the sophistication of &quot;The Blue Lagoon&quot;. Indeed, the scene where Cathy and Chris, playing Peter Van Daan, briefly steal a forbidden moment in a nearby lake seems to be lifted directly from that movie. The horror in the book, while graphic, occasionally verges on the ridiculous. Cathy, playing Rapunzel (and Marcia Brady) to the hilt, would literally rather starve or cut herself than cut off her beautiful, long blonde locks. The fact that the kids remain in the attic throughout most of the book doesn't exactly render it a page-turner, since this is, after all, a THINLY DISGUISED FICTIONAL effort with all the tension of a limp noodle. This definitely would have been more interesting if we had been allowed to see more than a glimpse of the Evil Grandmother. Her story, in &quot;Garden of Shadows&quot;, makes for much more riveting reading. Corinne, the mother, was the most interesting character in my opinion, and never once were we given enough clues to her motives. Had the story been in the third person, we could have witnessed the scenes between her and her rigid, controlling parents, as well as her scenes away from the house. In the third novel, &quot;If There Be Thorns&quot;, Corinne's point of view was briefly glossed over, but not resolved in any satisfactory way. V. C. Andrews would have been better off to pull out all the stops and introduce ALL the characters in the book, instead of having Chris and Cathy narrate it in their overly flowery language."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"As the days, months and years pass for the four Dresdon Dolls, I became a member of the attic also...I could visualize the setting, and I FELT the romance grow between Chris and Cathy...

Still, my heart bled for Cathy, Chris, and especially poor Carrie when her twin brother Cory died. It will make you cry and it will definitely make you hate their mother and their grandmother.

You will get SO caught up in this story,you will not want to put it down. You feel like you actually would love to kill the mother!!!! While I was reading it I actually said things out loud in shock of what an unloving mother would do!!! This is a MUST have!!!!"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"ONE DAY, MY AUNT JUDY LET ME BORROW SOME OF HER BOOKS. WHEN I SAW THOSE V.C. ANDREWS BOOKS SHE HAD, I KNEW I HAD TO READ THEM. AND I DID I AM ONLY 14 AND I READ FLOWERS IN THE ATTIC, GARDEN OF SHADOWS, PETALS IN THE WIND, AND IF THERE BE THORNS. THESE ARE THE COOLEST BOOKS IN THE WORLD. I READ THEM OVER AND OVER THAT'S HOW MUCH I LOVE THEM. I THINK THE BOOK WAS WAY SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE MOVIE. THE BOOK IS MORE DESCRIPTIVE AND DESCRIBES MORE DETAIL. I THINK THE MOVIE WAS GREAT, BUT THE BOOK WAS MARVELOUS! IT WAS SO MARVELOUS, THAT I WENT OUT AND BOUGHT THE COPIES MYSELF."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"My mother read this book, as an adult, and one day while in a used bookstore, she found an old copy of Flowers in the Attic. I wasn't thrilled about reading it, and it sat on my bookshelf, untouched, for ages. But one day, I decided to give the book a chance. Let me tell you, I couldn't put it down.....it was truly amazing! I have never read a book so in tune with the somewhat harsh ways of reality. I reccomend this book to booklovers everywhere.....you will definately not be dissapointed!"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"My opinoin of this book is that it is a very good book. The reason it is a good book is due to a couple of differnet factors. One reason is that to me, it seems that the author actually took a lot of time and planned out the book.I can tell there was a lot of thought put into the book, because everything is described in such great detail.When you read this book, you actually feel like you are there. Everything seems so real. Another reason it is a good book is because the reader can relate to what is happening. For those reasons and others, I think tis was a great book."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I have read this book so many times I practically know it by heart. It is so well written, the way it tells of the lives of four innocent children, who are denied the right to a healthy, normal life. I recommend this book to everyone!"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"VC Andrews first book is also her best. The dark twisted tale of four kids locked up in an attic by a uncaring mother and insane grandmother is one of my favourite books. It's almost haunting in it's horror, but has moments of intense beauty. The relationship between Cathy and Chris is SO wacko, but it is also, at the same crazy time, sweet. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll love the book."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I read this book at the age of 13 and I couldn't put it down for one second. I just kept reading and reading and reading.... It was the first book that I had ever read by V.C. Andrews and I am now collecting them all. If you are looking for a book that is not only realistic but is suspenseful, I would definately recommend this to anyone that is 13 and up!"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I read this book at least 10 years ago. I was hooked and couldn't get enough of the Dollanganger Series. I devoured them thoroughly, then re-read them all countless times. Just a wonderful, thought-provoking read. You will be drained from the roller coaster of emotions you'll experience in the books and the characters will become very real to you. I so wish there were many more volumes! Truly a wonderful series. I give the books my highest recommendation!"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"V.C.Andrews books have kept me up half the night more than once reading when I SHOULD have been asleep... lures you in to where you can't wait to see what happens next to this family.. GREAT series of a book.. the movie SUCKED in comparison to the book!! Bought this book because I couldn't find the one I'd bought years ago and wanted my granddaughter to read it.. SO worth the read."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I read this when I was only ten years old now I'm 21. I decided to go through a box of old books one day and to my shock and delight I found the Dollanganger series. Of course they are the original print but sadly I'm missing one of the most important books in the series Flowers in the Attic. It's not a story for everyone. But what a story it is. If you don't mind a little smut, horror and angst you'll enjoy praying and hoping for sunlight along with the four little dolls."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I first read this book when I was 13 and have read it about once a year since. I am now 30. It is haunting and sad and it's still one of my favorite books of all time. I recommend it highly to anyone of any age."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I enjoyed this book very much!! I liked the movie so I figured I would like the book just as well. However it was depressing at times. The change in the mother's attitude was the most frightening! I can't understand how she could be so selfish! She was willing to kill her children for her father's inheritance. Overall the book was amazing and I can't wait to read the next book in the series!!!!"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"i love all of v.c. andrews books. this is by far the best series. it's just something about andrews books, and her stories, that captivates you, and pulls you in. such a talented author, and knew how to spin a story, to make it the worst it could be. she's definitely my favorite, as all her books are as well. my whole collection is very treasured. back to the book. this is the beginning of a nightmare, that seems to never end. four innocent children thrust into the world of greed, revenge, and dishonesty. their mother being the only person in the world in who to believe, but all that is lost. they must learn to fend for themselves while being locked away, to be forgotten. their only recluse is the attic. there they find comfort, and their make believe version of the outside world. while slowly fading away, seeing less of their mother, and depending more on themselves than ever. chris and kathy's love grows, but it is forbidden. they must overcome tragedy, abandonment, and the loss of the person they most trusted. they will learn secrets never imagined, and the reason why their gramdmother sees them as evil. four young children forced to grow up without nurture, guidance, and love. it's impossible not to love this book. the series after is also great. i do encourage you read it."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I started out just seeing the end of the Flowers in the Attic movie and was so enraged by how it ended I wanted to read the book. I bought the book and I loved it. I felt like i was sitting there while it all happened. I finished the book in 2 days and wanted the rest so i went to the book store and bought all the V.C. Andrew books i could I even ordered them. about a month and a half after i first read Flowers in the Attic I owned all of V.C. Andrew's books and had read them all. I became so obsessed with reading them my dad threatened to take them away but it didn't matter i had finished them anyway but Flowers in the Attic was my favorite book and the rest of the series was just as amazing as the first book. V.C. Andrews uses such detail in all her books it brings out all of the characters and how they suffered, how and what they feel. I actually wanted to become a ballet dancer just like Cathy just by reading her feelings. I cried throughout the series because i became connected to all of the characters and could picture the attic with all the paper flowers in my mind. I loved this book and all of the books that are out and they made my love for reading just by the first book."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I first heard of this series when I was a kid, and my sister had these books. I first read one years later, picking it up while at someone else's house, waiting on some friends I was giving a ride home to. Truly a gripping tale, as the Dollanganger children's father dies in a tragic accident.This picture-perfect family now must come crawling back to the house of their grandparents, whom their mother had moved away from years ago, as their late father never worried about saving money, thinking he would have time to do it later. However, their grandfather never forgave their mother for marrying her half-uncle, and in order to court his favor in the hopes of inheriting his vast fortune upon his death as he is in ill health, mother Corrine locks her four children in the attic until such time as she can publicly reveal their existence.The four are locked up for over three years in the attic, waiting for their grandfather to die so they can come down from the attic when they learn the true nature of their mother and grandparents.In the attic, the children grow and mature in front of each other, and with no freedom or anything else to guide them in their emotional, physical, and mental growth, it is up to these children to learn for themselves what is \\"right\\" and \\"wrong\\"."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This is an absolutely wonderful book that will have you trapped right from the first page.It's about four children who are locked away in the attic for four years by there selfish mother and wicked grandmother. Once you read this captivating novel you'll want to read the other three. This book had me thinking about it for weeks. I never wanted their story to end..."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This is my favorite book i've ever read! The most shocking story i've read! i didn't suspect the ending!"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Great book. I didn't expect it to be a good read and was astonished that it was. Sure, there is consensual incest, but given the story line, it makes sense. It makes the reader want Chris and Cathy to be together \\"in that way\\". There are some readers that call this book a \\"fluff\\". I don't agree at all."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Can you imagine we live like the kids went through.. Oh it is hard to put the book down! It was so excellent book! Thanks."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I am not familiar with V.C. Andrew's work, but \\"Flowers in the Attic\\" is one of her legendary and controversial novels, so I decided to check it out. Is \\"Flowers in the Attic\\" a good novel? No. Is it is a good read? More or less. It's not without flaws, it drags in places and somehow (even though we live with the same 4 characters in one spot for 400 pages) they aren't fully fleshed out...But, it's interesting and, at times, disturbing. Cathy, Chris, Carrie, and Cory Dollanganger are 4 siblings (with Carrie & Cory being twins) whose father tragically passes away. This leaves their mother in a rut, for she does not know how to provide for her children. Her father is rich and dying and she decides that she will rekindle her relationship with her father so he'll leave her money. Problem is, she doesn't want her father to know about her offspring and decides to lock her children in the attic until her father dies. Their mother promises that their imprisonment will only last a few days...Of course, those few days turn into a few weeks and into a few months and so on. The novel is a very trashy novel that deals with the taboo subject of incest and there is the Grandmother character which brings to mind Nurse Ratched from \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,\\" (ironically, I think Louise Fletcher played the Grandmother in the film version). Essentially, what I'm getting at is that the Grandmother character is pretty familiar...But the novel is disturbing and tends to be well written. It's readable.GRADE: B-"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"The movie and the book was so different. I actually enjoyed the book better than the movie. The movie touches on some parts about sexual relations between the children but the book actually goes into detail. The book is more factual than the book."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book - I believe it appeals to people who can identify with sadness and melancholia.It is beautifully written with awesome descriptions - it is as though the author was attempting to make you feel as though you were there.Aside from the great writing style, the story itself is really imaginative and keeps you interested.Also the author shows great insight into behaviour patterns and relates the behaviour of the \\"mother\\" as a narcissistic personality.If you are wondering whether or not to buy this book I think you should go for it because you may enjoy it a lot or even love it.Although some people hate this book with a passion at least they are not indifferent - not many could be indifferent regarding this book... Now THAT sums it up."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"'Flowers in the Attic' is one of the best books I've ever read! I may only be a student, but I've read many books and this would probably be about #2 on my list. It keeps you reading on and on...until it's done and then you read the next ones. I'm so in love with V. C. Andrews books that I'm just about ready to read the new Gemini series. I can't wait, knowing how good this series was."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Flowers in the Attic is the best book I think I have ever read. The plot was very clever and I just couldn't put it down for even a second. I wont read anything not written by V.C. Andrews. Her books are great."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Chris, Cathy, Carrie, and Cory were shut in an attic by their mother and grandmother. They have been waiting for their grandfather to die, so they'll be free. They were kept there even after their grandfather died, locked up for three years and five months. The grandmother was cruel and did horrible things to them. She put tar in Cathy's hair, severely whipped her and Chris, and starved them. After Cory died from arsenic poisoning, Chris and Cathy knew they had to get out with Carrie quickly, for she was pining away for the lost of her twin, Cory. Pale, weak, and thin, they escape to freedom though their journey to safety will be long."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Ironic as this may seem, I started reading this book in my grandmother's attic. I was bored and the title caught my attention. I kept reading it until my eyes could not stand it any longer. After that book I was hooked and ended up reading the whole series. I loved them all but I think &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot; was by far, the best one."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"The only word for this book is stunning! I have never read a book like it before or since. It is sad, disgusting, weird, strange, scary, suspenseful, intriguing, corrupt, perverse, shocking...on and on. You have to read this book, you'll be missing out on something if you don't. Then it's on to the next book in this series for more twists & turns."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"V.C.Andrew's Flowers in the Attic thrusts innocent children who lead story book lives into an existence of beliefs, betrayed loyalties, and heartless cruelty. As I relate to Christopher Young's score reflects the naivete of the children, utilizing an orchestra of strings, woodwinds, percussion and solo soprano. The beauty and innocence of the main motifs, contrasted with the extreme loss of innocence in the film, creates a terrifying musical contradiciton, which is the essence of this overall melancholy score that focusses on the sad existence of the children, rather than the surface dramam. I think this novel is the contribution of so gifted a composer."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Flowers in the Attic is one of the best books I have read along with all the others that Andrews has written. A friend of mine let me borrow her copy of it even though I was not a big book reader. I started to read it and I couldn't put it down and now I like to read. I recomment this book to all you people who find it hard to keep intrested in books because I've been there."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Never have I read a book more complelling more mind-boggling than V.C. ANDREW'S FLOWERS IN THE ATTIC. For the very first time i couldn&quot;t put down the book. I discovered her book when i was doing my homework in the library and then I picked it up and started reading it. I felt like them. Like I was there with them experiencing what they are experiencing. Because of that I bought all of her books and even got the chance to tape the movie in the cable. Until now i still read it. And its still like reading it for the first time again and again."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I think that &quot;Flowers.....&quot; has so much depth and creativity to it. There is so much scandal and mystery in the story, that I have no idea where V.C. Andrews could have gotten all her descriptive ideas from. The novel is set in Virginia in the late 1950's and ends in the early '60s. It's about 4 children who are sent to their wealthy grandparents' mansion and there they discover a terrible secret about their mother, father, and eachother. You can't put it down! A must read for a person who loves horror. But, understand that it has a lot of mature subject matter, almost disturbing even. Including abuse, rape, incest, etc. Even though, it is still good and entertaining. Better than all those trashy soap operas and talk shows. A must-read!!!!! You'll feel like you're in their world. Cathy (the narrator) will soon be your favorite heroine. Read it A.S.A.P!"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Flowers in the Attic is one of those books that a person gets lost in. I am proud to say that of all the V.C. Andrews books, the Flowers in the Attic series is by far the best. I just wish that V.C. Andrews was still alive to see how her legacy has continued through the years."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I LOVED THE BOOK! IT KEPT ME IN SUSPENCE THE WHOLE TIME. THE MOVIE, WAS KIND OF DUMB, BECAUSE AT THE END THE MOTHER DIES. I WISH IT WOULD HAVE WENT ON TO THE NEXT BOOK, SO CATHY COULD HAVE TORTURED HER MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER. I WISH THEY COULD HAVE HAD A SEQUEL TO THE MOVIE!!!"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I read this book for the first time when I was in 8th grade. I think I have read it at least twenty times since. The story sweeps you from your living room into the attic of an enormous house. Your family now consists of a cold-hearted mother, an evil grand-mother, the twins, and Cathy and Chris. With vivd and detailed description, you finsish this novel feeling as though you have woken from a horrific dream. Anguish fills your heart over the children that &quot;mom&quot; forgot, and over the complete loss of innocence. It gives 'Feral children' a frighteningly real picture, and keeps you turning pages. Romance, horror, murder, and deciet, this book fills your heart, and your mind, with respect for the author, and elation, because it didn't happen to you."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"My friend loves this book and told me to read it and so I did. It's the best I've ever read. The plot has so many twists and turns it makes you dizzy, the writing is truely brilliant (plot unfolds quickly and does not linger on) and the caracters are so well discribed that you know exactly what they're like and how they look. I saw the film and was amazed to see how much it's different from the book (my friend counted 47 differences!). I'm 13 and an avid reader and I must say nothing I've read beats VC Andrews. It's got everything: drama, romance and terror. Everything you need in a good book. Flowers in the Attic is my fav book and I know I'll never forget the horrifying tale of the four Dresden Dolls."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This book is incredible! It tells a story of the physical abuse of four innocent children locked up, living in their own world. Most importantly, the book tells you the experiences of these children and the life long traumas that affect them in every aspect of their lives. The book is incredible, you can't NOT read the sequels! You can't put this book down! It is an awesome story written with incredible talent. READ IT AND SEE WHAT I MEAN!"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"It's an extravagant, sweeping, terrifying novel. The idea of a mother so coldhearted that she could lock her children away for years on end is chilling in itself....and then the plot twists itself around you, making you more shocked, more angry, more horrified with every new development. I really don't know how I feel about _Flowers_, to be honest; reading it is like being caught up in a mad whirlwind: you can only think about it after it's over, and after it's over you're just glad that it didn't hurt YOU. The plot may seem drastically melodramatic to a person who is not reading the book, but while you are, it is every bit as believable as any factual story - that's a big part of its horror. Cathy is a realistic portrayal of time and circumstance - if you were a '50's twelve-year-old female, you too would say golly-lolly, you too would believe that adults knew everything. If you were a child in Cathy's position - well, I don't even want to think about that. Let's just say that although I do not enjoy horror, I found myself somehow compelled to read her story, which is also that of her siblings, and to continue it in the following novels, horrified or not - it's like you have a duty to her, like she represents all the children that have been deprived of anything, especially love. What can I say? It's an amazing, original, personally terrifying work, and I don't know how the writer wrote it. Amazing."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This book was excellent! I could not put it down once I started. To think of a mother denying her own children the joys of life(and light), is so sad. I read and re-read this book so many times to count. These books get to you and you end up going out to find the next one! publish faster!!!"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I found this book very interesting. Once I started reading it I couldn't put it down. It was as if I was actually locked up in the attic with Cathy, Chris, Carrie, and Cory. I felt the same pains they did and I cried many times. I also found myself hating the grandmother, especially the mother. At one point in the book I got so mad at the mother I screamed out &quot;WITCH&quot; and sent the book soaring across my room. This is a remarkable book, and has touched me. Everyone should have a chance to read it."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"As one of Andrew's first novels, Flowers in the Attic is definetely the most exciting and captivating novel of any of her series novels. The well-developed characters jump off the page at the same time as pulling you in to make you a part of the story. The contrast in the characters of the four children are well-explored, as are the changes that they indure during the novel. The characters are well-rounded and realistic and their emotions positively reach out and touch the reader. The changing nature of the relationship between Cathy and Chris is a realistic and fascinating look at the changes wrought in adolescence and the way that these changes can manifest themselves in such horrifying circumstances. All in all this is a fantatic book, original, insightful into the human spirit and into human greed and desire. Definetely a must-read!"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"i like their thoughts and it explained almost everything of what they been through and i felt like i am part of their world and going through with them."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This book was wonderful. I have read it more than any of the other books that I own. You just can't put it down, even after you have read it more than once. It keeps you guessing. Just what is going to happen to them kids."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This book was the best book i've ever gotten my hands on. I just couldn't put it down. It makes me shutter every time I think about the horror and hell that went on in one attic. Shut up by a horrible grandmother and a selfish mother. But there is a dark secret that the mother is hiding. Read and find out!"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"All these reviews are so long, that's why I'll just say what I want straight away: Virginia Andrews is a fabulous author and I love her books!!!!"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I was obsessed for a week, spending all my time reading this amazingly touching, real, shocking, deeply disturbing book. Definitely, definitely, definitely, definitely buy this book! Buy it, borrow it, steal it; do whatever you have to, then sit down somewhere with food, water and shelter and read until you're all the way through! Wow.:)"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This was the first book that I had ever read in the series. I love horror stories, and this seemed a better one to me. Since then I have read the entire line of V.C Andrews books and they are all great."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I think it's a great story, full of suspense. A good book for teenagers to begin with."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I found this book and its sequels to be worthless trash! All of VC Andrews books are about incest! How can anyone think the relationship between Cathy and Christopher is beautiful...its gross!!! As another reader pointed out, how many normal people would actually sleep with his/her sibling after seeing him/her 24/7. I am ashamed to say I have even read this book! If you want a book that is beautiful and worthwhile to read, don't look at books by VC Andrews...before and after her death!"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This was the teenage cultural book of the 80's but unfortunately it is a sick book. I read it when I was about 14 or 15 and did enjoy it at the time. However, much of the book is too influential on teens. I would not recommend this book. Sex is taken too lightly (especially later in the series) and the story is rather grotesque."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This is a terrible book for readers of any age, yet morbid curiosity prompted me to read the whole thing and write a chapter-by-chapter synopsis on my web site (eugene.hopelessloser.com).A very excellent book by the most talented writer of her generation."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Yes, I mean that. I really hate to have to give this book ANY stars at all! My awesome friend thought that I should read it, and I did, and the whole time I was going through the pages, I kept reminding myself of my vow to finish it. I kept hoping that it would get better on the next page, and then on the next page, and then on the next page, BUT IT NEVER DID. The story was ridiculous, too far out there, and it was very poorly written. And there was even one part that was just downright OFFENSIVE, and anyone who knows me knows that I do NOT offend easily at all. I just... hated. this. book. So much. It took me eight weeks to read (literally), because it was that downright AWFUL. Alright, I'm done ranting now. Just, I highly recommend that no one else ever read this book. You will desperately cry and scream for the last [however long it takes you] of your life back. The end."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I read this book at the recommendation of a co-worker. It did have potentially redeeming shock value, but the story is not even well-enough conceived or plausible enough to be shocking or offensive. It's just unspeakably bad. I can say in great confidence that it's the stupidest, most useless piece of garbage I have ever read, and that anyone who enjoyed it -let alone considers it a &quot;modern classic&quot;, as I was assured it was- should avoid holding political office or any position requiring intelligence and good judgment. In fact, you should just lock yourself in an attic (preferably without relatives) to prevent procreation."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I picked up this book because I had seen the movie years ago, and it is sick. But the book is ponderous and pretentious and reads like a bad workshop fiction. I had great hopes, but they were dashed like a... you get the point."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"What is wrong with American society that people enjoy reading such a sick and twisted novel. It is well-written, I'll admit. Andrews had talent, if only she could have devoted her talent to something worthwhile, rather than cruelty, incest, murder, etc.For those of you who are now so interested you can't wait to get copy and find out WHAT incest, WHAT cruelty.... shame on you.What would Freud have to say about this???"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"More proof that African Americans are the most racist group in America."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Yeah, ok, so this book was a little far from my tastes. I mean, I am not really into this stuff. Actually, male/on/male stuff is my personal favorite.But this was not bad. Kathy and Chris had no choice really, being locked up like that for years, and teenage boys can get horny and girls can get lonely and there you have it. BOOM! Full blown incest. Being young and gulible can have great consequences but I never thought that it could be this serious.Throuhout the book sometimes you get the feeling that they should get together, even if it's just to spit in the face of their retarded aunt/grandma. Nevermind morality; let's go screw our own relatives. Interesting concept. Doesn't agree with my views, but what the hell? It was food for thought."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"this is the firt V. C. andrews book i'v read and im somewhat dissapointed. in most of the other reviews for this book they go on and on about how great this book was. well in my opinion i feel it had NO POINT. in the begining it starts out good then in the middle it completley slows down. (i mean come on do we really care when color each flower being painted or made is?) at the end it speeds back up and becomes more interesting. i wished it had more so now i am going to have to read the rest of the series because i want to know what happened and because i'm the kind of person that finishes whats been started.but this book also was very unrealistic. i find it very hard to believe any mother would willingly let her 4 children be starved and beaten, while being locked in an attic. also whats with all the incest? i really doubt no matter how un-satisfied you are, that you would &quot;fall in love&quot; with your sister/brother. thats just plain wrong.if you enjoy books that are somewhat pointless and have nothing better to do then go ahead and read it. but if you want to read a really good book i suggest finding another one, cuz this isnt it."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I recall seeing the movie version of this book many years ago, and have been curious about the book for some time. As is usually the case, the book goes far beyond the scope of the movie. So many gray areas are colored to create a more complete and moving story. Certainly those that were moved by the movie will enjoy the novel.After the death of their father, mother is left destitude and financially crippled. Seeing no alternative, she returns to the parents she left for a forbidden marrige all those years ago. As the mother returns home with her four children shocking family secrets are revealed at regular intervals. Many of the secrets were omitted from the movie version. As their mother atones in order to inherit her dying father's fortune, Cathy, Chris, and the twins are imprisoned in the attic. Their only contact with the outside word is the cruel grandmother that brings their daily meals each morning.Their mother's visits become less frequent as the story develops, forcing the children to change in ways which their grandmother predicted. However, it also causes them to develop independence, realizing they can no longer depend on their mother. In effect, Chris and Cathy become their parents.So many aspects of the novel are haunting that some readers may be unabe to continue. Despite their flaws, one can not help but pull for the children. Even as the story ends, so many questions remain unanswered. With the bar set so high with this book, it is difficult to project other books in the series that follows meeting anticipation."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This novel truly makes you think. How would you have turned out if you had lived Cathy's life? Would you have turned out any differently? Confined in a dark attic, no sunlight, only contact with you three siblings, god-obsessed grandmother, and negligent mother? They did what they had to do and Cathy's hatred is completely justifiable. The incest with her brother was disturbing, but V. C. new what she was doing. In her capable hands you could not help but be moved. Dark and twisted the novel makes you think about the human mind and what happens when you are put into such an unimaginable situation. It is sad to think about what the characters could have been, had they never gone to the attic, and what they were turned into. It's unnerving. This is one of the best novels I have read in a long time."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"this is my absolute favorite book of all time! I will not give a summary of the book its kinda complicated and I think others have already given a good synopsis. I can tell you how it made me feel. I never wanted the book to end and couldnt wait to read the sequels! The characters are lovable, desiarable and haunting. You pity them celebrate them and can see them in your mind . I have a perfect image of cathy, carrie , chris and corrie and unfortunately the movie did it NO JUSTICE! I have read not only the book but the series at least 3 times since I was 11 or 12 and each time fall in love with the dfferent stages of their lives , it's a beautifully written book and series and at the end I always cry because the saga ends and theirs no more to know to read to learn about these beautiful, innocent beings. Books like Flowers in the Attic are why I love reading"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I read this book for the first time when I was 14. I read it at least a dozen times throughout high school. I am 33 now and thought I'd buy it for my daughter, but wanted to read it again first. I was amazed that, though I have matured immensely, I found the story even more spellbinding than when I was a teen. V.C. Andrews knows how to make it all flow so well that I couldn't put the book down!"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I had heard much speculation about this book and even caught a few bits of the movie before finally giving this book a try. I mainly decided to read it because it was supposedly based on true occurrences, though I've found little about which parts might have been true or what it might have been based on. I'm left with some mixed emotions on it.It was a good story, though it did drag a bit. The main complaint I have is with the characters. I really wanted to strangle both the twins and Cathy with her Golly Days and Golly Lollys. I understand it was set in the 50's and that she was young... but it was annoying. The twins incessant whining and tantrums were unsettling as well, especially Carrie. I enjoyed Chris the most and found the story very sad. I especially wanted to strangle the mother. The ending was also fairly unpredictable.A lot of the controversy of this book stemmed from the incest between Cathy and Chris, which was really pretty tame in my opinion. There were only 3 parts which were actually incestuous and there was very little detail, so I think teen readers would be pretty safe.In short, I agree with what most others have said - Its good if you want to indulge in something a little sadistic, but I doubt it will be a life changing read."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"\\"Flowers in the Attic\\" was the first adult fiction-series book that I remember reading. It was on the bestseller shelf of every bookstore and most girls in my high school were reading it, so I decided to give it a try. I was hooked from the first page.\\"Flowers\\" is the story of Cathy, Chris, Cory and Carrie - - four children living the \\"perfect\\" life with their golden parents, until their father is killed in a car accident and, penniless, their mother is forced to return home to the parents that disowned her years ago for marrying the children's father. The twist? The parents, particularly the Grandmother, are bitter, zealously religious and glad that their daughter's husband is dead. While the Grandmother knows about the children, the grandfather apparently does not, and in order for their mother to inherit her family's estate (the monstruous Foxworth Hall) and riches, she must pretend that she is childless. Hence, the plan - - the children will stay in the attic of one wing of the massive Foxworth Hall, in hiding, waiting for the ill grandfather to die and leave their mother everything.As with most well-intentioned plans, everything goes awry. What was originally going to be just for a few days, a few weeks or a few months turns into three years. The mother changes before her children's eyes - - becoming materialistic, selfish and gradually distancing herself from them. The Grandmother despises them and employs harsh corporal punishment on them, simply for existing, and reminds them daily that they were brought about by sin, according to the Bible, and are evil.Most importantly, Chris and Cathy are allowed to grow up together, with only each other, in a single room. Not surprisingly, they fall in love with each other.How long will they have to wait for the grandfather to die before they are freed? Will the Grandmother ever love them? Accept them? Why won't their mother just leave, with them? Do they have to inherit the money? What is going to happen to them, if Chris is in love with Cathy?\\"Flowers\\" is not a masterpiece of literature, nor is it a trashy dime-store novel. The story is engrossing, the main characters endearing. The pain and suffering of the children, particularly Chris and Cathy, and their longings jump off every page. The horror of what greed and materialism can do is shocking.\\"Flowers\\" is a great beach or vacation read -- be prepared to invest in the other books in the series, which focus on the Dollanganger/Foxworth family.Recommended."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Some people are taking this great read too literally. The thing is, I don't actually think that the details of the story are as important as what it evokes: the terror and uncertainty of being a teenager. The bizarre horror of maturing physically and yet being powerless before adult authority. It's all a metaphor for feeling trapped, which all teenagers feel. If you think about it, that's what all Andrews' books are actually about, and the ghostwriter carries on this tradition, if not as well as Andrews, than competently.Yes, some of the details are hard for an adult reader to accept as credible, but why do you think we loved this books as teenagers? Because many teenage girls-and I stress girls, because I most of what Andrews' covers doesn't apply to boys-go through all the things Cathy goes through-testing sexual attractiveness for the first time, looking at our changing bodies in the mirror, first period, challenging parental authority,the trauma of first sexual experiences, etc. All those changes are scary and weird. Of course the added elements are demented and perverse but that just adds to the fun.Andrews just takes common female adolescence, scary enough on its own, and projects it onto a melodramatic stage we can emotionally act it out on. Most of us don't have incredibly wealthy families, haunted by legacies of \\"sin\\", possess nearly supernatural physical perfecton or get locked up in the attic, but many a girl can project their uncontrollably blossoming self onto Cathy; many a pretty girl can remember what it's like to first have people comment on your beauty, many an abused child can remember the powerlessness of childhood, etc.The perverse details of this Andrews' books, as with all of such as brother-sister incest (easier to stomach when, like me, you don't have a brother!), abuse of small children, much older men with teenage girls (see Petals on the Wind for this, yuck), rape, starvation, whippings, etc, etc., are not for everyone, so be warned. If my mom knew everything in here I don't think I would've been allowed to read it! Recently we talked about the book and she laughed at the premise, and so did my husband, and I think adults do have a hard time understanding how someone would keep four intelligent kids locked up in an attic-but the fact that the premise is credible to kids is precisely why kids could be kept in the attic! You tell them to stay there, and they do! They were locked in, and one of their only alternatives would have been to attack their mother or grandmother and take their key when they came in. Adults would have thought of such an alternative, which most children would never entertain.That's why they're so easily emotionally abused. Besides, they eventually left.Also, the melodramatic prose might turn some people off, but Andrews has a real skill for creating mood and an engrossing read and that is as much of a legitimate talent as the high-brow literary giants I also love. I'm 29 but I'll never remember when I first picked up this book at 12 and couldn't stop reading and felt like someone connected with all my confusion. V.C. Andrews is like Judy Blume if she was crazy, perverted, and obsessed with sexual deviancy! God I miss that woman."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This is the book that started it all for me. I read this book for the very first time when I was in 6th grade (12 years old), and like many others it led to the reading of hundreds of other books. I am now 24, with a 3 year old daughter, and cannot wait until she is old enough for me to hand her my copy and hope she develops a love for reading as I have. I always did exceedingly well in reading in school, but I did not enjoy it. But all that changed when a friend of mine finished reading this book, and she passed it along to me.I will never forget the day when I cracked open the book to the first page. I remember that I saw the movie that was based on this book, and I thought it was totally creepy and just had to give the book a try. I remember my mom wouldn't buy it for me b/c she didn't think I was old enough for it at the time, but fate eventually interceded and I was given the opportunity of a lifetime.This book is fabulous. Read it yourself or give it as a gift to someone that doesn't typically like to read. All that will change and they too will become addicted and have to read all of her series. All are great with the exception of the new series'. You can definitely tell the new ones were not written by VC. VC Andrews has a pattern and that's what makes them so good. The new ones unfortunately do not.So, if you want to start a new author, or are just reliving the experience of a great book, pick up Flowers in the Attic. You will not be disappointed. And, of course, continue on thru Petals on the Wind, If There Be Thorns, Seeds of Yesterday, and Garden of Shadows. You will never be left hanging because the series tie up all the loose ends within the 5 books. And when you are done, move on to the Cutler series and all the others. They are great as well."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I first read this book about six years ago, and it still never fails to draw me in. It is one of the few books that V.C. Andrews actually wrote before she died, and shows you what a great storyteller she was.Christopher and Cathy are the perfect blond-haired, blue-eyed children of Chris and Corrine Dollanganger. They are upper-middle class, and have everything they could possibly need. Their family is soon expanded when Corrine has twins: Cory and Carrie. But soon their perfect life is marred with tragedy when their father dies in a horrible car accident.Corrine reveals to her children that they cannot afford to live here anymore and must go stay with her rich parents in their mansion in Virginia. They will have money to do whatever they want--as soon as Corrine gets back into her father's graces. The children are locked up in a room that has stairs leading to the spacious attic, while their mother tries to convince her parents that she is worthy of their love once again. But as the days, months, and years pass the children soon realize that their mother hasn't been as trustworthy as they had believed. They are flowers in the attic, left there to survive on their own.&quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot; will leave you horrified, touched, sad, and happy all at the same time."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"A truly amazing book and my very favorite of all time!

They have four children together, but then he unexpectedly dies. As a result, she returns home and falls at her parents' feet, begging forgiveness. Her stern father beats her as punishment, which she submits to so that she will appease his wrath and get his love for her back, and get written back into the will. But the existence of her four children must be kept a secret, since her father would never accept them. This shameful incestuous secret is kept locked away up in the attic--that's where the children are kept hidden and out of sight. Their mother visits them and keeps promising that soon they'll be let out of the attic and everything will be just fine. In time, however, her love grows cold and she visits them less and less, selfishly preoccupied with her happy new lavish lifestyle and the new man in her life, while her children start to get sick. Two of them die. Their food is being poisoned. The two eldest surviving children begin to realize that their mother has been slowly, methodically, and calculatingly killing them off!

Their parents committed incest themselves, so I see why those two ended up following their parents' footsteps. I really, really felt sorry for the twins.

The tale is haunting and tragic, and though a bit far-fetched (though who ever said it wasn't?) it is not the insane crazy mess some make it out to be. It's brilliant, if you ask me.So you know, Cathy speaks in tones like \\"Good golly day!\\" because the book is set in the 1950's. Believe it or not, people spoke like that. I found it entertaining to listen to the dialogue myself.The characters in the story are rich and three-dimensional. Even the main characters are not portrayed as perfect, such as Cathy and Chris (unlike in the GW's stories later on).Everyone seems to focus on the incest as though it's the theme of the story. It's not. It's one part of it, an undertone, if you will. The plot is much, much more than that. The incest only adds to the horror and trauma of it all.I saw the movie for the first time years and years ago, and it wasn't until I read the book that I got hooked.

BE SURE TO READ THIS BOOK, FLOWERS IN THE ATTIC."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Being 12 years old. at first I thought the book was going to be boring and too mature for my unprepared hands, but, I was soon to find wrong. I found the book was very interesting and I enjoyed it. The book starts up as a simple story and I was almost turned away, but, the story of four children locked away by a greedy mother and a heartless grandmother, took it's toll on me. I was swept away. As the four children learn the real reason why they are in the dark and dismal attic, they plan to strike back. But they soon learn that their widowed mother remarries and fear that all hpe for their return to civilization is long gone. I really didn't have a favorite part in this book. It's hard to pick one written by such an author as V.C. Andrews. I loved the ending also because it continues to the second book, &quot;Petals on the Wind&quot;, wich is just as enjoyable as the first(book)."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I just got finished reading &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot; for a reading project at my school, Franklin Learning Center. The first book in all of Virgina C. Andrews' series was very shocking. I got so into this book, it was as if I was in the attic with the children, experiencing what they were experiencing. This book is about a cruel mother who locked her children away in a dingy, dusty attic for almost four years, because of her selfishness. Corrine (the mother) brought her four children to the manor where she lived as a child, Foxworth Hall, after her husband died. Corrine's mother ordered that the children be condemmed to the attic. The children were only supposed to be there for no longer than a week. The days turned into weeks, weeks into months, months into years. In the attic, the children, who were only fourteen, twelve and five year old twins were negleted of what all children need: sunlight. Because of Corrine's selfishness and cruelty, one of her children died. This book is very spellbinding and it is a page turner. This is one of the most marvelous books by anyone I have ever read."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"My mom is not as selfish as Corrine(the mother in the book). I could not imagine my mother locking up in the upstairs bedroom and the attic to fulfill her own selfish desires. I can not also imagine her poisoning me like what Corrine did! I could not believe the lap of luxury that she had while her kids were starving upstairs!"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This is the best book (and best series) i have ever read. I feel like I was Cathy reading the book. It seems that i was in that book! What was done to Chris, Cathy and their twins is despicable. They didnt deserve what they did. The sins of their parents are not their sins (so, okay, in the later books, they did commit the same sin, knowing they're full brother and sisters).But in a way, i was glad they were in the attic. Attic taught them much, much more than they would have learn outside the attic. They learned that money is not everything. They (Chris and Cathy) also discovered that they love each other. Chris already said so, although Cathy did not admit it to him). I think their love for each other is very romantic yet unfortunate, because they're brother and sisters. But, even knowing that, i couldnt fault them. Their love seems so natural and its nothing perverted. Chris' love for Cathy was pure (not brotherly, though), its not just a sex thing, like most incest relationships are. This love is based on trust and they deserve to be together. Cathy had 3 other men, julian, bart and paul but none of them are her soul mate because her soul mate is chris, like she always says all through the series. Chris was Cathy's &quot;other-half&quot; and vice versa."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"After reading the first in the Dollenganger series, I discovered what a prolific and fantastic writer Andrews is. This book takes the reader(s) on a journey of love, hate, incest and betrayal. Edgy and very controversial, this book, in it's simply written, undisguised voice, explains how four innocent, but disturbingly adult children are taken away from their home in Gladstone PA and locking into an attic, a scheme divised by their 'trusting', beautiful mother and thier evil and discrepid grandmother. This tale begins with the children locked away for a night, a few weeks, and then slowly, into a few years. When lies at the end of their journey is vengence, incest, and even death. A page-turner; beware of sleepless nights!"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"It was a pretty good book. I'm a big V.C Andrews fan. My mom said that that book gave her nightmares. I thought it was really good. It's about 4 innocent, young children who live in this small bedroom in they're grandmother's house. They're exisitance is kept a secret because of their mother's greed, and growing up is hard for them."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Flowers in the Attic has twisted characters and a twisted story of incest and dark family secrets. I think the movie &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; borrowed from this book the thing about feeding poison to the daughter. I read this book over 10 years ago and I still remember the thing about those powdered donuts. Read this book for the pure entertainment value of the disturbing and interesting story but don't expect to get anything out of it. It's a quick read. If you get hooked on the story, there's a whole Dollanganger series. It's fun and better than TV."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I just finished Flowers in the Attic by VC Andrews. I know I'm late here, but this book deserves all the acclaim it has gotten and will get in the future. What a smooth, moving flow in the writing! The characterizations are brilliantly developed, and except for an ending that lags more than the rest of the text, the plot development is consistently engaging.If you haven't read it, you should!!! (Don't see the 1987 movie afterward.)And check out the heroine, Catherine, whose bitterness and path to vengeance--through to the sequel, Petals in the Wind--will rock your world."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Three stars for the crazy, gothic, incestuous story, no stars at all for the faux YA cover.

Andrews is such a compelling author I read Flowers in the Attic in 12 hours, I simply couldn't put the book down."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"The Dollanger series is the best I have ever read. You can tell that VCA knew what she was doing. Nobody else is as talented as she was. There will never be a series this wonderful again. It is one of a kind and the suspense keeps the reader on the edge of their seat. The Dollananger series can't be beat."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Needed this, and another book for my child's summer reading. Not available in the local library.

It keeps you on the edge of your seat and will make you cry"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This falls under the category of Awesomely Bad!Flowers in the Attic was the first adult (well it seemed adult to me) book that I read. I remember it vividly. I was in 7th grade ( I know right!?!) all of my friends and I would just devour these books. At that age V.C. Andrews was spinning yarns that were both scandalous and delicious! We thought we were so naughty and bad ass for reading these tales.Little did I know, it was just the beginning of my never ending love for young adult fiction....duhn,duhn,duuuuuhhh.I was so enthralled with reading a story (which turned into a 5 book series) about a family of teenagers/young children locked away in an attic and the horrible physical and psychological horrors they had to endure. I loved the protagonist's means of escapism; that she could retreat into the world of ballet. It was the only thing from her old life that kept her somewhat grounded and sane. Being that I too was in Ballet during that time made the book more fantastical.Oh, I will not spoil this sweet gem by giving away any major plot twists. You will have to go and read it yourself. The whole Dollanganger series is great! It's not Bronte, but it has it's own certain pedestrian charm."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"What is the book about?Their father has just been killed in a fatal car accident and their mother decides to move them back to their religious fanatic grandmother who has never approved of their lifestyle their mother, Corrine has lived. Cathy, Chris, Cory and Carrie are all locked in the attic at their grandparents but they aren't sure why. Read this book to find out how the 4 siblings cope with being imprisoned in an attic.What did I think of the book?I have read this book many many times and every time I find it a little bit more disturbing than the last time I read it. The pain. The agony. The confusion.

As well as the rest in this series!!"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This book was one that was hard for me to put down, and it made me angry as I read it. I was incredibly upset with the mother by the end, and very hopeful for the kids. I read this book within a few months of the Casey Anthony trial, and it was something we talked about quite a bit at work. It shocks how a mother could do something like this."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This book touched my heart, because i had the same thing happen to me. My heart went out to Cathy, i so felt like her. I could totally understand her and her actions. I went through the ordeal of an older, selfish, cruel brother using the younger sister for pleasures only for the sinners. I cry everytime i read that book; in fact i'm crying right now.

The story itself is very unique, and I recently bought Petals on the Wind and I am anxious to read it. I was left with a few questions though, like How could the Mother do it?, etc. This book, to me, was so great, you feel like you are with the children and you can feel their grief and pain.

Bye~!READ THE BOOK~"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I was a precocious child- I read this book at at age 9. This book is brilliant. It presents strife and misery, yet at the end, the characters have found hope and love. It is an extremely unusual plot, even though in her later (as in, posthumous) books, VC Andrews recycled many of the same plotlines. This book will stay with you for all your life. The characters are drawn so vividly, the setting so realistically, and the plot so hauntingly, you will not be able to shake this reading experience for a long, long time"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"V.C.Andrews stooped to repulsion for a moment then brought me back to the overwhelming elation of impending hope. Every emotion I have ever felt was presented to me at the turn of each page. This book is an absolute, &quot;Can't put it down&quot;! I started reading it at a friends house in one town and had to let someone else drive, while I read in the car on the way back home. I had never read any book in the car before and haven't since.

I saw part of the movie &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot; several years ago, and recently decided to see just what all the hubub is about.I just finished this book, and am blown away! This tale of greed, deception, love and hate will send you on an emotional rollercoaster right along with all the main characters. The characters truly come to life, as you sympathize with them some times, and get annoyed with them at others - just like your own friends or family. I highly recommend this book, particularly if you want to start (as I now am) a mission to &quot;catch up&quot; with all the VC fans and read all of her books in chronological order."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This book sure makes you thankful for your parents.

This book is about a lady named corrine,she comes from a wealthy family she marries her half-uncle.Corrines parents did not approve of their marriage yet they still got married and had four children.They had two twins their names were Carie and Corey one was a boy and one was a girl.The other two were chris and cathy.After Corrines dad found out that she married christopher he said that if she ever had children with him she will not inherit anything.Corrines husband worked out of state and he went to visit his family only once a week. His family had planned a surprise party for him because it was going to be his birthday. That day when he was going on his way home he sadly had a car accident and he died. After his death Corrine could not keep up with the bills of the house because she spend a lot of money on herself and they began to have too many debts.

Corrine gets married again and she leaves her house to go to her honeymoon.She leaves her mother in charge of the four children. She does not like her grandchildren so she starts giving them doughnuts with arsenic. They eat them not knowing that they are being poisoned. The ending I leave it for you to find out. I basically already summarized the whole book but I leave the ending for you guys to read.I know that you would enjoy the ending so go get your book and start reading it. All I tell you is that at the end it's kind of sad. I called this review selfish life because the mother sacrifices her kids for her own good."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I have been reading VC Andrews' books since I was 14 years old. I guess I picked this up to read for the third time recently because I was feeling a little nostalgic. I had read My Sweet Audrina recently, too, and was surprised at how much my perspective had changed.I admire Andrews because she always writes about forbidden romance. Also, the men in her book are typically abusive and sex-crazed. This, of course, makes for interesting reading. I love the fact that Chris and Cathy seem to have such a loving and innocent relationship when first they are sequestered in that despicable attic. Also, I love how Ms. Andrews appeals to our human senses...she really makes it abundantly clear that these children suffered when she describes the food, fresh air, summer romances, thrilling social lives and other basic freedoms that they dream about daily (and which we as readers tend to take for granted).What grows tiresome after about the 20th episode is the fact that the children are constantly expelling emotional energy by fighting with the grandmother, the mother and each other in such a way that it tends to be overdramatic. Also, her depiction of the men in the book tends to make them seem barbaric in every way (which is fine from a fictional standpoint) yet emotionally fragile at the same time. I suppose this is possible in the real world, but how realistic?Flowers is a gem. I like it because it stands out from the rest of the books in the library. Ms. Andrews really struck a chord when she wrote about all these forbidden topics. I highly recommend reading the entire series. Her books are fast, simply written and contain no frills. You can put it down for a few days and then come back to it and still know what is going on without having to re-flip. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I love Flowers in the Attic.

Twelve-year old Cathy who is a talented dancer, fourteen-year-old Chris is a aspiring doctor. Then there is the beautiful little five-year-old twins, Carrie and Cory. Their mother, the beautiful and poised Corrine, and their handsome, warm loving father Christopher. But one horrific night, everything changes when Christopher dies in a car accident. Leaving Corrine, a unskilled beauty, left alone with her four children. She writes to her parents, religious zealots who disowned her for marrying Christopher, (who turns out to be her half-uncle/half-brother). Her rich father is dying, and she wants to move back and win his affection. But there's one condition. The children must stay in the attic until he is dead. The children do so, thinking they'll only be in there a week. But the week turns into two, and the two turns into a month, and...This is a shocking tale of love and betrayal.

This story is a real page turner. The story is about a perfect family, but that all changes when something horrible happens to one of the memebers of the family. The mother is forced to lock her children in her mother's attic. V.C. Andrews describes everything that happens to the children in perfect detail. Andrews descibes everything just right so it feels like you are apart of the story. Flowers in the Attic is a great story of horror, suspense, and romance. Flowers in the Attic is the first book I've read by V.C. Andrews. I thought it was such a good book, so I went out and bought more books written by V.C. Andrews."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I thought it was a wonderful book. It started off telling how Corrine changed from the brat in Garden of Shadows to a sweet loving girl and how she and her half-Uncle have four wonderful children. Christopher Jr. Cathy and twins Carrie and Cory. Then one day a tragedy happens and they go to live with their grandmother who locks them up in a room for near to three years, there mother keeps saying she'll bring them down when their grandfather dies. and it goes on to explain how their mother tries to kill them and how they escape. They all four showed up, Chris, Cathy, Carrie, and Cory. But only three got out alive. I loved the book and I suggest to all of you who haven't read Garden of Shadows or Flowers in the Attic to read them. They seem like big books and they'll take forever, but the time just flies bye when you read them. the story was very touching you felt sorry for all of them. You hated the Grandmother, Grandfather, and Corrine cause once she got written back in her father's will and inherited all the money she goes from a sweet girl right back to the brat she started out as."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This book is wonderful, one of the greatest out there. I would just like to say that this book is not racist. They are a white family with blonde hair and blue eyes, and they never go out into the world so that is really all they know. I suggest that everyone with a problem with that sould get over it and just not read the book. If you don't like it don't look at it, you know? I think it is ridiculous that race is being dragged into every aspect of our lives."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Flowers in the Attic was one of the best books i have ever read. It had a very original storyline and i could not put it down. my favorite part in the book was the end when they finally get out of the attic they have been living in for almost four years. i really felt bad for the twins, who had to endure so much at such a young age-it was heartbreaking. Cathy and Chris had to grow up so quickly and act as parents to Carrie and Cory. the relationship that develops between chris and cathy is very warm and sincere. it is very easy to see that they really did love eachother, and needed eachother. chris was my favorite character. cathy described him so well, he was a very good looking boy that grew into a handsome young man. he was the smart and sensible character that always knew what to do when things got tuff. he was brave and admirable, especially when he had to slash his wrists to feed the twins some nourishment when the grandmother starved them for three days. when reading this book you begin to fall in love with chris' looks and personality. the thing i hated in the novel was how she made it seem that chris raped cathy, when she could have easily stopped him. he was a very good brother and was the reason they stayed alive in the prison they were forced to live in. there is some incest in the novel but it only shows the love chris and cathy shared. they are real soulmates and are truly meant to be together forever. it was very sad when cory died and it made me hate their mother even more. this novel has to do with horror, suspense, love, betrayel, lust and survival. i enjoyed it very much and recommend it to someone who is 12 or older. i am fourteen and thought it was a great book and couldnt stop reading it. you should definetly read the book!! i loved it, and loved CHRIS!!"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I picked this book up at a used book sale the other day for $0.25. I heard about it from a girl in my English class, and wow, am I glad I did pick it up.The story is very emotional, depressing and all-around just darn good.The sexual tension between Cathy and Chris was great -- I'm actually a fan of forbidden romances.Carrie and Cory seemed to me, to be the embodiment of the innocence that Chris and Carrie lost when they were forced to be adults and take care of their younger siblings.I believe that V.C. Andrews accurately portrays teenagers coming into their sexuality and becoming adults.As much as I hate picking apart books and looking for the &quot;deeper meaning&quot; of a book, I found myself understanding and liking what V.C. Andrews was saying to the readers through the book.I loved it. Anyone who doesn't like this book should have their heads examined."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This book is a classic and none of the others that followed ever held up as well.

Only then do they find out that her mother's family is wealthy and that something had happened that caused her father to cast her from his home. Upon arriving to their destination, the children are shocked to realize that their grandfather does not know of their existance and that they must remain hidden in a remote part of the house and the attic until their mother can work her way back into his good graces. Thrilling and horrifying this book tells how Cathy and Christopher care for themselves and the twins, relying only on each other while they wait for their freedom."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Flowers in the Attic is the most controversial and classic novel of V.C. Andrews career. It explores how far a young, widowed mother will go in order to inherit the millions left to her by her estranged father. Her children are all locked in one room with only an adjoining attic to play. The days become years and while the oldest son still believes whole heartedly that their mother will provide, the eldest daughter begins to lose faith. This book is not for the offended or easily upset it explores incest and child abuse and the dark side of human anture. But if you are game this is one amazing book."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This is a really good book. I was about 12 or 13 when I first read it, and to be honest, it sickened me. I was crying in the middle of this book at how a mother and grandmother could do this to children. I am 16 now and about to read it again. It is a very good, well written story about 4 kids being locked in the attic with only themselves to keep each other sane. I especially found the incest part of the book disgusting, but it was there to add to what the kids felt and what they were going through.

I read Garden of Shadows, then Flowers In the Attic. This is a wonderful, but horrific tale of four children confined in an attic by their greedy mother and evil grandmother. I am THERE with them, during the entire book, feeling their misery, their hunger, their pain. A wonderful book that I continue to come back to. The best V.C. Andrews novel that was ever written."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This was an awesome book.It was chilling about what the grandmother did and how the mother could let this happen to Chris,Cathy,Carrie,and Cory.I recomend this book to everyone.It will hook you too."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I have read every book V.C. Andrews has ever written. She was a genius! Never in my life, did I enjoy reading until the day I bought &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot; at a garage sale for $.50. I have no idea what possessed me to buy it being that I hated reading. I was about 15 years old at the time. But I did and now I am a loyal fan of hers. I am so sorry she has passed on but I hope that her work will continue. I just pray that whomever has taken on the task of completing her work will not butcher it. So far I am pleased. I fully recommend ANYTHING V.C. Andrews has written."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I read this as an adult, and I must say it is the creepiest book I've ever read. This was the work of a potent imagination, on par with the elite of horror literature (The Haunting of Hill House, Dracula, Rebecca, The Body Snatchers). Sure, the writing's a little crude at times--as crude as say, To Kill A Mockingbird--but Andrew's skillful imagination more than makes up for it. She writes significantly better in the fluffy sequel."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"i thought that this book was good but i was really mad at ... never mind don't want to wreck the storry for anyone who hasn't read it . i think that this is a ggood story . it has a lot of action . you should read it if you haven't ."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Back in junior high school (15 years ago), more often than not one would see a girl toting a VC Andrews paperback along with her schoolbooks. Ever since I was made aware of her existence I managed to avoid her titles because I just was not into &quot;horror fiction&quot;. Recently, though, I moved to Hampton Roads, which encompasses VC's hometown of Portsmouth, and what can I say: I was curious to know exactly what it was that had so many young women hooked all those years ago.The core of the story, I admit, has some appeal. Four children, devestated at the loss of their father, are promised hope and a future of luxury when their mother reveals she has wealthy relatives. So eager are the children for this lifestyle that they willingly subject themselves to being isolated in a forbidding wing of a lonely mansion, away from curious eyes, while their mother tries to reconcile with her monster of a father before his pending death.Here is the true horror of the story: the mother's good faith slowly peels away to reveal a woman consumed by greed who distances herself from her children, leaving them to the mercy of a disapproving grandmother and ill nutrition while she lives the life of luxury she promised them. The younger children are stunted in growth, while the older children are ultimately pressed into a relationship the grandmother constantly lambasts. The mother, depending on the wealth, goes so far as to commit an unspeakable deed.Abuse and neglect are the focus of this horror story, rather than blood and gore. This is a story that should make you more angry than scared. I've heard FitA was based upon a true story, but I have yet to find any information substantiating this claim. Either way, I've satisifed my curiosity of Ms. Andrews by reading the four books of this series (the only series I believe she wrote on her own), and can say undoubtably this is the best one, though Cathy's narrative is at times immature. I don't expect I'll read any other titles."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Somewhere in my adolescence, I appear to have missed the memo about V.C. Andrews. It was only after a discussion on Goodreads that two friends pointed me in the direction of Flowers in the Attic, and it was only then I realised it was a book read by many tween/teen girls in the 1980s, which should have (almost) included me. I was immediately intrigued - after all, how explicit and creepy could this book really be?It was only after I finished reading that I realised what the attraction here actually was - all those taboo topics that were rarely spoken about during my teen years, along with one huge one that's rarely spoken about now culminate into a book that although it appears to have been written for readers of a certain age, is the reading equivalent of watching a car crash for hormone-ridden teenagers.To be honest, the writing is, well, crap. The language and dialogue is cringe-worthy and extremely outdated - the word 'golly' is used a whopping nineteen times, and often combined with 'day'. The characters are either blindingly naive or so nasty I wanted to throw them down the stairs, there are generous lashings of innuendo and the story itself borders on the ridiculous. How a bunch of children can live in an attic for a long period of time without a household full of servants even guessing that something other than 'hundreds of mice' was living upstairs, how the mothers friends and family don't guess that she'd popped out four kids and how the grandmothers crackpot religiousness both discouraged and yet in a way encouraged the inevitable really pushes the limits of believably, but in the end it was so engrossing I really didn't care.And yet, I found this incredibly readable simply because it was like watching that car crash. It's creepy and controversial yet appallingly written, but I went straight out and bought the next book, Petals on the Wind.This is a hard book to rate - on one hand I rolled my eyes so hard they hurt, on the other I was completely captivated."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Hands down the best book I've ever read. I am, however, biased, because I read this book during a time that I really needed it. Kept it on my bedside table for years, out of pleasure, out of comfort, and reread it whenever needed. Don't give in to all the smut that has been published under this great author's name, who left us way too soon. Take this novel and the rest of the Dollanganger series as how it was meant to be: a great tale narrated by a great story-teller. A tempting, complex, more often than not dark, inspiring journey of two persons trying to grow up in a world that is not theirs; a world they try to make as their own, with the scraps of morality they still possess and the restrictions with which these come with. The Dollanganger series is a first-account witness to an incomparable, unheard-of, absolute kind of love. V.C Andrews didn't write to become the queen of the incest genre, she wrote this story only because it needed to be told. Everything published after her death, in my opinion, is an insult to the art, the universe she successfully created through Catherine and Christopher Doll, the Casteel series, and in My Sweet Audrina. Don't read this if your mind is still closed to the world and its mysteries around you. It'll shock you out of your innocent, little mind. There are Disney books that are much cheaper. Read the real V.C Andrews, only if you dare."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I grew up with a love of books (now 42), and this was a book my mother's sister gave to me out of the blue one day when I was 14. I could not put this book down and that Christmas, I asked my mother for the entire series (not all of the books in the series had been written yet). My mother bought all of the books I wanted that year, and I finished 14 novels before returning to school from winter break. The story is intense, emotional and all-encompassing (too bad the movie they made from the book was truly awful.). One of the things I noticed about the author, after reading her next series, is that she writes of truly wronged children, and I wonder why this is her niche. Her writings are of deep, dark family secrets of betrayal and even incest. You will be hooked on her original works, not so for some of her postmortem novels."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"V.C. Andrews (the real woman, not the ghostwriter) was an incredibly talented woman with a flair for telling a good story. It is about four children whose father dies in a car accident, and their lives are almost literally turned upside down. Before this, they had the perfect childhood - a nice house, a loving mommy and daddy, and so on. However, the children do not have any family - no aunties, uncles, grandparents, cousins, etc.After their father's death, the children learn why this is when their mother packs them off in the middle of the night, leaving their old lives behind to go to their grandfather's house.We only learn the story in bits, so there is no info-dump here. In fact, the whole story behind what happened with Mom and the grandparents is not revealed here, we learn more and more through the five-book series that was started off with this book. But I will not spoil anything here by revealing plot points from later books.Anyway, the kids are put in the attic and a upper room connecting to it to hide them from Grandfather. Apparently if it is discovered that Mom had these kids, she would lose everything she stands to inherit from her parents, as she is the only surviving child out of three. Why? Well, she married the children's father against her father's wishes. Why was Grandpa so against the marriage? This book reveals why. It doesn't matter that the children are innocent and didn't have anything to do with this, their grandfather hates them with a passion.However, as the story moves along, we learn that Grandpa is not the only villain in this book... greed can lead people to do nasty things to their own children!"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I am not a woman, so I am not suposed to like this book. But guess what????? I DO!!!!!!!!!!!! It is one of the best books I've ever read. Realy!!!You all know the plot no need to re hash it. Chris, Cathy Carrie and Corry from a family unit when they go into the attic. The plot is strangly believable in that this is a horror story where, if someome is evil enough, everything in this book could really happen (it's based on a true story). You hate the Grandmother from the first time she appears in the book all the way to the end.The incest here is well handeled and I felt it was important to the story and not put in to add shock value to sell books. The plot twist at the end of the book sets up the other books and will make you want to read the next one. Get it you won't be sorry!"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This was one of the craziest twisted books I've ever read. It was so dark and yet so intriguing. What hooked me was knowing that it's based on a true story. That part is still unbelievable. The very thought scares me. It was very well written. The story itself haunted me long after I read the book. The other series about other families did not compare at all to the Dollanganger series."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"My sister and our friends and I all devoured these books when they were first published, which has been eons ago. Despite the many years that have passed, the story was still pretty fresh in my mind when I picked it up to reread, and I kept anticipating scenes coming up.Our narrator is Cathy, age twelve when the story begins. Her brother Christopher is fourteen, and the twins, Carrie and Corrie, are five. They live a happy, idyllic life with their beloved parents. Then one day their lives are shattered when their father is killed in a car accident.Corinne, their mother, takes them to her childhood home, where she has told them they are going to live with her parents. However, when she was young, she angered her father, and he disowned her. Now she must ingratiate herself to him to earn his forgiveness and get him to love her again, and put her back in his will. He is very ill and will die any day now. She tells her children this is their only hope for the future, as she has no skills and cannot possibly support them on her own.When they arrive in the dead of night, their grandmother meets them and ushers them quickly through the house to a room on the top floor, where the children find themselves locked in and left alone. Thus begins their lives as the Flowers in the Attic. The grandmother brings them food every morning. Their mother visits often, bringing gifts and telling them stories about her exploits in secretarial school, and her attempts to get her grandfather to love her again. Then she comes less often. The children, especially Cathy and Chris, grow older, begin to mature into young adults. Sexually aware young adults.The book is a compelling and quick read, and was much better written than I expected or remembered. Twisted, incestuous, and yet highly enjoyable."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I read this for the first time when I was just 17.

I particularly like the devolpment of the children through a &quot;normal&quot; lifestyle and watch it transform into a &quot;nightmare&quot; lifestyle. The children's gullibility is exploited with the reader questioning how these poor kids could be treated this way. I disliked some of the Chapters which seemed to basically fill space serving no real purpose to the overall story(i.e. Holiday's Chapter, etc). Despite my dislike, I have quickly started reading the next book in the series. I found this book difficult to put down."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"If ever there was a book more deserving of high acclaim, it is &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot;.

With nowhere else to turn, Corrine writes to her parents in hopes that they will take her and her four children in. Upon arriving at the glourious house in Virginia, the children learn they are to share one room without opening the window shades,or making loud noises or messes. But the room has hellish pictures on the walls, a list of rules a mile long, and a demonic grandmother to intimidate them. And to top it all off, they learn a that their mother has a deep dark secret that could change their lives forever. This is the horrifying tale of Christopher, Cathy, Carrie, And Cory &quot;Doll&quot;. A story of love, hate, deception, and trust.

But I loved it. I couldn't put it down, and when I did, all I wanted to do was pick it back up again. This book was wonderful, in a sick twisted way. But that's why we read it. I think it attracted me most because you know it could be true, but in a very far off place where the mother would have to be physically and mentally sick. Just that it could happen to some poor children somewhere made it scary. I can't imangine what it would be like to live in a room for three years with your siblings. And then Chris and Cathy are growing up and experiencing sexual desires and so on. It was just twisted. I just feel sorry for those four children that they had to go through all that. They definitley grew in that time. It shows you what can really happen when you don't let kids be kids. This is the only book I've read so far of this series, but I'm definitley planning on reading more. I don't think I could not read anymore after reading this twisted book.

The 'Dresden' Dollangangers may be made gorgeous beyond cynical belief, but the intensity of Cathy's ability to love, hate, and her never-ending struggle for her feelings towards 'Momma' and Chris is not. It's so real, it hurts, and those who can see the situation as well as through Cathy's eyes will feel her wound as surely as if it happened to you.It's not for light reading, but good for pondering, wondering about rights and wrongs, wondering about what kind of love people have towards each other, and yes, after so many years, it still haunts me."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Flowers in the Attic is a book that will grip you and not let go. It is the story of four children, hidden away in a cold, dark attic by their selfish mother who will stop at nothing to win back her father's affection and fortune. It is a spellbinding tale of deceit, love, adventure, and intrigue. V.C Andrews wrote this extraordinary book that you won't be able to put down.

I just wich that That the Dollandger family would come alive and i could exspress my opinions with Cathy.

So naturally I was intrigued to finally read the novel to learn exactly how all of those elements played out. V.C. Andrews' \\"Flowers in the Attic\\" is a thoroughly engaging and entirely readable novel, a disturbing and twisted gothic fairy tale of sorts that will keep readers wondering long after they have finished the book.Chris and Cathy Dollanger, along with their twin siblings Cory and Carrie, have led the perfect life. They have a beautiful mother and father who love and dote on them, buying them pretty much anything their little hearts could desire. Yet when a terrible accident kills their father, Chris and Cathy's world is shattered forever. They quickly learn that their mother cannot take care of them and that she has a whole side to her that they have never known. Her only hope for keeping her children is to return to the mansion where her mother and father reside; cold, brutal parents who disowned her eighteen years ago. In the hopes of insinuating herself into her father's good graces, the four children are snuck into the house and hidden in the attic (supposedly only for a short time) until their grandfather dies and their mother can reclaim her inheritance. The children, bewildered and grieving at first, go along with their mother's plan because they believe in her. But as the days turn to weeks to months to years, the children desperately want out of their prison ruled by an abusive grandmother and a mother who no longer seems to want to be troubled with them.\\"Flowers in the Attic\\" is written from Cathy's perspective after they have escaped from their prison, so readers know from the start that things turn out somewhat \\"good\\" for the children. Yet Andrews manages to create suspense that keeps readers turning the pages desperate to know the extent of abuse and treachery these defenseless children experience. Andrews ably captures Cathy's 12-15 year-old voice, yet the narration sometimes gets annoying due to certain sytlistic choices. It is an intriguing, disturbing read - one that is good enough to stand on its own - and also an excellent start to the ones that have followed it."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I met a girl days ago, we both love reading and one of the things I asked first was of a recommendation of a good book to read. At first I thought it was just another book to read, but believe me when I tell you this; this book is really good.The writer gives a lot of the details on the situations and the characters, sends you to the attic and almost make you live the situation of the main characters. Maybe you may not like some parts or think you already may now which is the end, I was wrong, the end will give you a new perspective.I cannot give you more details, you just need to read it.Easy to read, easy to understand and you'll have a good time at it."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I was told about these books by a high school friend.

It touches on some sensitive issues (child abandonment, insest, death, child abuse) so this is not a \\"happy, hugs and smiles\\" novel. Nevertheless it is a hell of a story. VC Andrews had a twisted mind but hey, people enjoy reading twisted stories. If you enjoy this book check out the other books by her or her ghost writer (most of the other VC Andrews book out there were done by a ghost writer)."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"The Dollanganger children have it all: a house, security, happiness and two wonderful parents who go out of their way to make them happy. Cathy, the second oldest, has to get used to the fact that she is no longer the baby when her mother gives birth to twins, a boy and a girl, but both she and older brother Chris fall for their younger siblings right away. They are all blonde, blue-eyed and beautiful. Everyone calls them the \\"Dresden Dolls,\\" because all of them, including husband and wife, look so much alike. Everything is perfect as always -- until a fatal car crash takes away their father. Not only do they have to mourn their father, but are now forced to move out of their home. The Dollangangers had gathered many debts and have no money to pay them off. So Corrine, their mother, whisks them away and into her parents' home in Virginia. Foxworth Hall is a grand house, and her parents are rich, very rich. But her father disowned Corrine years ago and doesn't know her four children exist. She has to win him over again. In the meantime, the kids can stay locked in a room, with a large attic to play around in. It'll only be for a short while, nothing will go wrong. Cathy and Chris, ages twelve and fourteen, could look after the younger siblings. They also have to follow their religious fanatic of a grandmother's rules. Everything will be fine, just as long as they have a little bit of patience...I was twelve years old when I first read Flowers in the Attic. I thought the story was dark and spooky, but didn't get it that much. That is why I decided to reread it as an adult. And as I read it for the second time, the more I realized that the bits I didn't get as a child were the parts centered on incest. The relationship between Corrine and Christopher and the reasons why they married and were disowned and disinherited were what puzzled me the most. Also, the rather close relationship between Cathy and Chris has lots of sexual undertones to it. Their closeness begs the questions: is it because they are the only two people around the same age in the attic, or could their upbringing have something to do with it? The story is quite depressing. Grandparents from hell; a selfish and materialistic mother; four beautiful children withering away in an attic, suffering from lack of attention, fresh air and freedom. Flowers in the Attic is the only book I've read in the Dollanganger series. Having loved this novel for the second time, I have ordered Petals on the Wind and have every intention of reading the whole series. V.C. Andrews was a wonderful writer of gothic suspense, and I hope she got to write all of Dollanganger books before she died and a ghostwriter took over her work."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"As an [...] I was entranced with VC Andrews- all of the books were dark, myseterious, enough sex to pique a child's interest and pretty good character development...however as an adult rereading these books, the ONLY one I can recommend is Flowers in the Attic. It is a psychological thriller in a good way (if you do not know the ending). The movie based on the book destroyed what made the book thrilling- it elminated the sexual tension, made the mother into a one-dimensional character and changed the ending (in an unbelievable way).Why do I not recommend the other VC Andrews books? Even the ones written by Andrews were never up to par with her first. Also, the rest of the Dollanger series is like watching a bad sequel to a great film- some things are better left to the imagination if it can't be done right. Also, doesn't anyone wonder why the theme of incest permeates her other books? Personally the theme was unnecessarily repetitive and killed the \\"shock value\\" of the first book. As for the ghostwriter books- they are mindless, smutty and could be written by a teenager. That being said, I wish the film was as good as the book- I am still hoping another (more talented) director will take a shot at it."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I finally read this book at the age of 36, years after my mom read it but said that I was too young to read such a horrifying story. I found the story of four young children locked in an attic to be haunting, mesmerizing, incredible, and sad - all at the same time. Two of the children come of age during the story, and the other two begin the story as 5 year-old twins. The story is easy to read, but the many tiny details the author includes allows you to initmately know the main characters: what they feel, what they think, and why they do what they do. While reading this book I couldn't stop thinking about the characters and what was going to happen to them next, and I couldn't wait to pick up the book again! Long after this book was finished, I found myself thinking about these characters and what they experienced. Many of the images from this book have stayed with me long since I have read this book, and it has make me look at my parenting in a new light. Of course, since I loved reading this book, I had to press forward and read the other books in this series (5 total). While some were better than others, \\"Flowers In the Attic\\" was the best by far, with imagery, emotion, cruelty, and tenderness."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I kinda like the way virginia writes, its very emotional and raw.

The mother and children were forced to go live with their grandparents, whom they have never heard of before. Apoun their arrival of fox worth hall their mother tells the children that their grandmother considers them devils span that should never have been born. The mother wishes to inherit her father's large fourtion, so the children are to be hid away and be seen or heard by nobody.

The mother said that they would only be up there for the night, but that turns into days and day's turns into weeks and pretty soon they have three calendars filled out with xs. This story is told by a twelve year old girl named Cathy. The story she tells is about her and her siblings adventures they have while at foxworth hall. The worst of all is the grandmother.

Many things happen up in the northern wing of foxworth hall where the four siblings are located. To find out their fate in foxworth hall you'll to read the book Flowers in the attic. You will feel as if you have known the characters your whole life and will want to cont the series with Petals on the Wind. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Yes its true, this book is extremely dark and twisted, depressing, gross at certain parts (incest seems to be a common theme V.C.'s books), and just downright disturbing and creepy. But as horrified as you may be while reading it, you also can't but be fascinated at the same time. To even think that such a family could be so screwed up is enough to keep you thinking about their stories for days, which is exactly what has made me re-read this novel and the following ones time and time again.I first read this book several years ago, due in large part to my mom, since this had been her favorite book growing up. I read it and immediately devoured the rest of the series, and ill admit, I have read them more times than I can count.The book is about a mother who brings her four children (chris and cathy, the two older children; and carrie and corrie the two youngest who are twins) to live at their grandparents house after their father is killed in a car accident. The mother brings them to that house to live, In hopes of winning back her parents love and affection, and ultimately hoping to once again be written into her fathers will, and at the demands of the cruel grandmother, the children are forced to stay in one room, having only the attic as their escape from her watchful eye. Because the mother had married her half-uncle, she tells the children that her father won't approve of them and claims that they must only stay in the room for one night at the most, until she can get back into his good graces. But one night turns into days, which turns into weeks, which turns into months, and ultimately they end up locked in that room for years. It probably would have turned into even longer if the two older children hadn't finally brought it upon themselves to escape.During their time of being locked away, isolated from the world, they are neglected, and they are treated horribly by their grandmother, who at one point starves the children for weeks in order to teach them a lesson.You cant help but feel heartbroken for the kids, not only because of being locked away, but because their mother goes from a kind, loving mother, to a cruel, heartless woman who cares more about money than her own children, even going so far as to poison them as you get further into the book. And you can't help but feel angry at Chris, who continually defends his mother, despite all her wrong doings. The most heartbreaking part is reading about the twins, who suffer the most. You see them go from bright, happy, healthy children, to sickly children who eventually stop growing due to lack of sunlight, lack of nutrients, and lack of love. Their bodies become thin and weak, their skin pale, and their eyes forever haunted. They feel that they are devils spawn, due to the sins of their parents, which is nailed into their heads again and again by the grandmother.And yes ill warn you once again: this book does include incest. For some reason, V.C. Seems to have a fixation with incest, although it is unknown why. Maybe it has something to do with her own personal experiences? But who knows.Anyways, I give this book 5 stars because despite what others say, its a damn good book, and there's no other book out there like it. I strongly urge you to atleast pick it up and give it a chance!"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I first read this book when I was 12. At that time, FITA was the most amazing book I had ever read. It felt naughty and evil and oh so grown up and wonderful. Going back and reading it as an adult it seems a little more like it was written exclusivly for it's shock value aimed at teens. I have to say though I still enjoyed it but in a different way than I did as an adolecent. If you have never read it, give it a shot. It's a decent story with interesting characters, and a plot where you would never guess the twists and turns. I would suggest the sequels and prequel as well, to help you better understand the characters and where they come from."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This book was as disturbing as it was poetic. It is one of those few stories that make you look inside yourself. What is right and wrong? This book explores the idea of selfish revenge disguised as God's work. And the limit of family bonds.

Having started out by first reading one written by the ghostwriter(Secrets of the Morning---book 2 in the Cutler series,)I finally came upon Andrews' originals. I must say that nothing compares to the Dollanganger and Casteel series, and My Sweet Audrina. With Flowers in the Attic, Andrews truly demonstrates the power of her writing. The novel contains such vivid, heartwrenching scenes of innocence, betrayal, maturity, and the struggle for hope by four kids just trying to survive against the odds. The book also addresses the issues of adolescence, which adds a sense of realism and truth to the novel. I'm 15 and I found a lot of the issues discussed in the book to be relevant to what I'm going through now. The subject matter is certainly a topic of interest in itself. The whole story idea, of four kids, locked away because of forces beyond their control, is so creative and original. The idea of using children and young teenagers for main characters is what truly distinguishes Flowers in the Attic from Andrews' later novels, especially the ghostwriter's. This novel is a true treat for anyone interested in reading not just gothic horror or another one of Andrews' terrific books, but also anyone who wants to read about the experiences of growing up and life. A great book for people of all ages, but especially for teens."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Wow, you really better follow the advice of not judging a book by its cover, because if you did with this one you would probably think you are getting some lighthearted Sarah Dessen type book. I hope whoever buys this reads the description, because the photo is VERY misleading. lol"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"First off, I would not consider this to be a horror book, but I see how the story is horrific. It's more fitting to say it's southern Gothic-ish. I'm 18 and just discovered these books and fell in love with them - I know I'm super late. I picked this book up and finished it within two whole days give or take a few hours. I ABSO-FRIKIN-LUTELY loved this book. I had read other reviews on FITA that criticized the writing and subject matter and whatnot. I can certainly see this raising riots with certain groups of people in it's time of release and even today.*May contain some spoilers*Basic premise, I guess to say is that the Dollanganger (strange foreign unheard of name no idea how to pronounce) is a normal, average (anything but), middle-class family of the Pennsylvania suburbs - the American Dream, right? haha. Quite an introduction and the first chapter is filled with anecdotes that just wheel you in. Then it all falls apart when the father, Chris D. Sr. dies in a car crash. The kids are packed up and forced to move with their mother to her childhood home of Foxworth Manor and they were really in for it...for this is where the bulk of the story and tragedies take place.I found the characters to be amazing in their own right like Cathy, Chris, and the twins Carrie and Cory from their dialogue to their actions. There were of course many heartbreaking moments and tear-jerkers. This contributes to the realism of the story - which makes for great reading might I add. I'm into dark stuff so I happened to really enjoy this and I winced while reading here and there but I really was on the brink of tears at the scene where The Grandmother whipped Chris and Cathy and that whole moment. You may ask why didn't they try and escape at when the opportunity came (i still believe the four of them together could have taken down that witch of a grandmother) but we have to remember that they are kids who adored their mother and clung to false hopes. I happened to enjoy the writing and found it well-written and it appealed more since it was in first-person; so I inevitably identified with the protagonist being that teen girl with stubbornness and animosity and being as cynical as I am. The bond between the children is one that can't be missed and it was such an interesting contrast between the characters though they are related in the most biological way possible and then some.The children are the focus of the story and it is a coming-of-age story among the horrible and unthinkable acts of violence and suffering. Although incest is an unspeakable taboo in our society, you can't help but feel for Chris and Cathy (and even their parents) throughout the book. \\"The Dresden Dolls\\" are so perfect that maybe they are too perfect with their looks, brains, and many talents; since there isn't much diversity in the \\"Foxworth\\" gene pool, could Carrie and Cory's stunt growth manifest that very relationship of half-uncle and half-niece/half-brother and half-sister (spoiler). You also have to wonder if what transpired between this pair of brother and sister was inevitable since there is obviously a cycle that cannot be broken (as witnessed throughout the rest of the series). Everything seems to shift in part 2 of the book when the teenage hormones and curiosity and frustration boils over the surface and Chris and Cathy act out on their URGES (although it is violently initiated by Chris and ironically Bart W. was the catalyst of sorts). V.C. Andrews dared to touch on taboo themes like incest (especially of such close relations) and then there is that underlying psychological nature of Freudisms: every girl ultimately wants to marry her father (by that i mean find that guy that is akin to him, so to speak) - Daddy's Girl and every boy ultimately wants to marry his mother [obviously Chris demonstrates this in the book on many occasions] - Momma's Boy. Although three of the four kids escape their prison, it will forever stay with them and haunt them for the rest of their lives because they had to pay the price for the \\"sins\\" of their predecessors - and that is what is so sad.If you have any emotions and a heart, no matter your stance, you have to feel for these two main characters doomed to end up as their parents for it is the circle or cycle of life - we kinda are our parents, though you can make your destiny if you believe to. But do to the circumstances the children are put understand created such characters that made for a hell of a story (that continued on...in a cycle). Which may be another hidden theme, that clever V.C. Andrews.Over zealous religious hypocrisy that drives rebellion, a mother broken down by humiliation and made antagonistic by greed, innocence lost, evil doings, wealth, abhorrence, corruption by power, the unthinkable, and a battle of wills all makes for this spell-bounding tale."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"The first V.C. Andrews book I ever read was &quot;Heaven&quot;. But when I read Flowers in the Attic when I was 14, I couldn't believe how enthralling it was. Every word drew me into a deep spell, that I wished the book would continue on forever! The characters of Cathy and Chris are so heroic, yet so sad. It's amazing what being shut up in an attic for four years can do. Chris and Cathy were locked up during a person's most vital years, when one is a teenager. Their incestuous relationship is not a thing to be disgusted about in a sense. They had no choice but to love eachother. Chris did not rape Cathy. She even said afterwards that she could have stopped him if she really wanted to. I was cast into such a spell by this book that I really thought that I was in that attic with them. The grandmother is a truly powerful, complex, and interesting character. I have read all of her books, except for the Orphans series which I intend to read soon. I am in love with every book she has written and am so happy to find others who share in my love. V.C. Andrews was a writer that should never be forgotten."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Flowers in the Attic is the story of four siblings locked up in an attic room by their selfish mother after the death of their father. They must remain a secret from their grandfather who never forgave their parents for marrying each other. It's the only way he will consider ever rewriting his daughter back into his will. Over the years, they are neglected, abused and starved by their bigoted grandmother. It's a story about love and hate. It's a story about greed, lust and betrayal. And it's a story, primarily, about survival. It is popular with young girls, but it is very mature, so be warned about that. The way sexuality is handled will be offensive to many.I really think that V.C. Andrews came up with some brilliant stories. I think she was attuned to a deeper part of the human psyche that allowed her to write about the darker aspects of life, and in ways that, like an onion, you could keep pulling back layers, picking up on things you never really noticed before. Her stories often get dismissed as trash, at worst, and even many who like her regard her stories as trivial guilty pleasures. I think that if you go into them with that frame of mind, you will only get out of them what you put in. But trust me, there's more there. That is my opinion, of course. I find myself picking up on nuances ten years later that I never could have appreciated as a teen (maybe not even as recent as a year ago). I'm not trying to encourage anyone to become obsessed or anything. Certainly there are better ways to spend your time than trying to analyze a book such as this. There are better books out there to read. But I have to give credit where I honestly feel credit is due.That being said, she was, technically, a very flawed writer. Her prose is so purple you fear for its life. The characters---while a little more complex than mere cut out dolls---are described in near perfect terms as far as beauty goes. They're all gorgeous specimens of male and female perfection. Then there's V.C. Andrews' approach to sexuality which is, at times intriguing, but more often than not, completely juvenile. I kid you not, there's a passage in the book that actually goes like this: \\"There was something about a man's strong, well-shaped thighs that excited me (263).\\" And that's not even the worst of it. She uses words like \\"maleness\\" and \\"male part\\" combined with adjectives such as \\"rigid\\" and \\"swollen\\" and \\"swell\\". She probably could have benefited from Elizabeth Benedict's book \\"The Joys of Writing Sex,\\" had that book been released at the time she was writing all these poorly written sex scenes. And trust me, the sex scenes only get worse as the series goes on.As for the rest of the writing, it is not very good. The characters repeatedly say stuff that make me cringe in horror. It's just such appallingly bad dialogue. They do stuff, at times, that I find extraordinarily unrealistic. It almost seems as if she forced stuff in there to make the book seem more shocking (and trust me, she didn't need to make it shocking, the concept alone already is!) Not to say that it's all badly written. I did find parts of it amusing in a good way. And there were parts of it that were written in a way that I found emotionally affecting.She's a very gifted storyteller, but no matter how strong your story is, it can't compensate for poor writing. I hear she wrote this novel really fast. Maybe if she'd taken more time with it, she could have done a lot of much needed editing. Maybe it would have been better. Maybe not. I don't know.I will say, though, that this is an enjoyable read if you go into it expecting nothing more than a shocking, heartbreaking, compelling story about the tragedy of child abuse in all of its horror. The humanity is there, buried deep, if you look for it beneath all the frills of silly, childish language. The story is certainly relevant. Child abuse like this does happen. Just look at the fairly recent incest case in Austria where the father turned his daughter into his sex slave. This story can't even compete with that in terms of sheer horror.Also, I think it's pretty amazing that this book has been reviewed so many times when it's about 30 years old. And a majority of them are five star reviews.One more thing.SPOILERS IF YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE CONTROVERSY SURROUNDING THE BOOKThis book is notorious for the incest, but I will say this---the incest is not the most sickening part of the story. I think it may well be the most troublesome aspect of the book because it's pretty much the only part of the story that is not conveyed in comfortable black and white terms. There's no mistaking that incest is wrong, but let's not forget that this story is told from the protagonist's point of view, as she lived it. In this book, at least, we are not asked to judge or to condone, only to listen and make up our own minds. I will say that I believe the story is too much for young readers, though they seem to make up a large portion of its audience. I think it's more appropriate for older teens and up. At the very least, I think a reader needs to have more background knowledge regarding rape, date-rape, marital rape, statutory rape, domestic abuse, sexual abuse, incestuous abuse and its many layers of trauma, Stockholm Syndrome and the victim mentality, etc. before they can handle this series because, if you don't have much knowledge about those things beforehand, it will be easy to misunderstand a lot of what happens to these characters. I don't agree that reading is always a harmless experience. I think that, regardless of age, readers need to be prepared ahead of time for material like this so that they can make their own informed judgments without being swayed by the protagonist who may or may not be reliable. To parents, maybe a good solution would be to read this book with your kids and discuss it with them because, if they really want to read it, they'll find a way to read it anyway.END SPOILERSI'd give it 3 to 3 1/2 stars----This review includes some edits near the end, but it remains mostly the same----"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This is the first V C Andrews book I've ever read, and it definitely lives up to its reputation. Without giving away ANY of the plot, because it's honestly best that way, I can say that this book is heartfelt and tender, yet incredibly dark and disturbing. It does not shy away from startlingly twisted occurences, and the fact that this story is very rated-R makes it just that much more satisfying.The strangely stylised dialogue feels fake and somewhat distracting at first, but I found I got used to it after a few chapters. It is also gradually toned down, I believe. Even aside from the dialogue, this book generally gets better the further you read.And, best of all, there are almost NO distracting plot holes like the ones that ruin most emotionally-driven novels. Very impressive!Oh, and I'm a 21 year old honours English major... so don't listen to the people who recommend this book to 14 year olds only! It doesn't tackle big intellectual issues or anything, but it's highly moving, disturbing, involving, and generally the sort of book that leaves one with a creepy feeling for weeks after finishing it. Anyone inclined to appreciate the gothic will probably love this novel."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Sadly, this wasn't the first VCA book I ever read (I started off with the Cutler family series) but when I finally got around to this, I was not disappointed. It is easily one of the best books I have ever read. The drama, the intrigue, the suspense... I have read this book several times and never get tired of it.You can't help but feel bad for the poor kids, especially with their harsh treatment by their grandmother and the blatant selfishness of their mother. One might wonder why the events in this book have transpired as they have, but this book is simply the first in a fascinating five-book series, and the rest of the series explains why this book was the way it was, especially the fifth, which serves as a prequel. The entire saga is riveting!"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Boy, this book probably one of the most twisted ones that I've ever read (and believe me, considering that whacked out books are my basic genere, I've read a lot of books you could call &quot;twisted&quot;. This one takes the cake.) It's one of those that you don't forget; that keeps you up at night months after you've finished reading it. I must admire V.C. Andrew's courage, however, on putting out such a controversial book.When you read this, prepared to be - shocked - a lot - to say the least. When I read this, my jaw dropped to the floor so often that it finally just stayed there. I mean, in the beggining, I thought the way Cathy and Chris acted towards eachother was kind of wierd, but then, I thought &quot;Well, I haven't got an older brother, so I'm in no position to judge them, right?&quot; I gave them the benefit of the doubt, until it became painfully obvious that . . . something wasn't right. It's heartbreaking; the way that the Grandmother, in her own backwards style, practically shoves them into each other's arms; and how they come to depend upon each other so much. If you'd seen this scenario presented in any other way, you would have brushed Chris and Cathy off as a pair of incestious perverts. But the way V.C. Andrews makes you see it, you just . . . can't; you feel so sorry for them.What really scared ME about this book, was that this COULD still happen; even right now as I type this. I couldn't believe the transformation of their mother's character; the way she was the perfect mother in the beginning, and then she started to slide down and down and down. . .that scared me too. I thought: What if that happens to MY mother?You might wanna read this book, but be forewarned: if you're not prepared to be totally shocked, disgusted, hearbroken, etc. , then DON'T read it."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I hate this book!! That being said, you're probably wondering why I gave it five stars. The answer: it is so well-written that I might read it again, even as I ever-so loathe its contents.V.C. Andrews does a fantastic job of thrusting the horror of this spine-tingling tale right into the reader's head -- atleast that's the effect it had on me! As the four children were kept locked away in a room for over four years, I kept wanting the terror to end, but I couldn't put the book down. I almost felt as if I were there too, suffering with them under the wrath of their wicked grandmother and the betrayal of their slowly-demoralizing mother. At the same time, the book was engrossing to a level I might never have seen before. I only wish V.C. could write with such electrifying power of a much more cheerful tale."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This was the first V.C.Andrews book I read, I was probably around 12 years old the same age as Cathy is in the story. I had no idea what I was getting myself into. I devoured this book, because it took me to a world I had never experienced. Books are supposed to transport you, stimulate your imagination, and endear you to their characters and places this one does just that and more. I wanted to be a Dollanganger, I had the blonde hair and blue eyes but I wanted the fierceness in their souls also.This book is about a family and I warn everyone that loves a saga, this one is a doozy. It has a mom and dad, two boys and two girls. Innocent enough right, but wait there's more! The father tragically dies, and the mom reveals that they are grossly in debt, that nothing is paid for so she wrote her mother for help. Her parents, it turns out, are rich as Rockefellers but there is a catch. The mom explains that she needs to get back into her parents \\"good graces\\" so the kids wont be sipping champagne by the pool until she does. They pack their belongings and in the dead of night travel to the grandparents grand estate. Quickly they are stewarded up to a secluded wing of the house, to a room that is 16 x 16, where they are to stay until the grandfather forgives their mothers sins. The grandmother is terrifying. She doesn't knit, or bake pies; she doles out scripture and says funny things like \\"your kids look normal\\" and \\"abominations\\". You feel for the kids, locked away in dark rooms, cold food to eat, always having to be quiet, their only playground is a huge dusty attic. The mother promises \\"a few days\\" but it turns into weeks, and months and years.We are right there with Cathy and Chris and Carrie and Cory, children that are forced to grow up quickly in their minds, while some of their bodies don't grow at all. Kids need to be outside and they need the sunlight, without it they will whither away into wispy husks. This book is about their struggle to remain a family, and the journey into finding out the truth about their parents. It's about the cruelty of imprisonment and biblical damnation. Do the sins of the father revisit the son? Is the past destined to repeat itself? I have probably read this book 25+ times, it's engraved into my psyche. I don't know how to explain the fascination, other than that they characters themselves are so powerfully written, that you have to go back again and again to \\"visit\\".An interesting note V.C. Andrews was born in 1923 and died of breast cancer in 1986. She herself wrote all of the Dollanganger series, My Sweet Audrina, and the first two in the Heaven series. After her death, her family hired a ghost writer named Andrew Neiderman to write more stories to be published under V.C. Andrews's name; he has since written 58 (!!!) novels that are supposedly \\"inspired\\" by the original writer's works. I have read a couple of his stories, and they are weak watered down insipid skeletal rip-offs of V.C. Andrews's genius. I think it's disgusting that her estate decided to keep cashing in on her name. I would think that any writer would want to be remembered for their work, their stories, and their characters. V.C. Andrews wrote from her heart and soul and she lives eternally through them forever."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I liked this book.

I read it on a recommendation from an avid reader I trust, and I'm sorry I did.No, I couldn't stop reading it. And no, I didn't enjoy it. I'm in my late twenties now, and wanted to call my mother and make her promise she'd never have done that to me (it was 3.30am). It disturbed me so deeply and seemed to be about an evil so much more horrible than the serial killers, mad dictators and supernatural beasts that fiction is filled with nowadays.I loved it while I was reading it only because I was anticipating the delicious revenge I knew they must visit on the mother and grandmother. But without spoiling the ending, suffice it to say that there is no satisfaction by the end of the book if you're spending the whole time waiting for the mother to get her just desserts.It was made worse by the boy, Chris, and his refusal to stand up to either woman in his blind faith that their mother was on their side. I hoped because of that that his revenge would be sudden and murderous.I closed the book after reading it very unhappy and disturbed, no matter how much they decided to let the past go and get on with their own lives, and I'm too frightened to read the sequel and go through it all again in case they don't find their mother and mutilate or torture her to death like I wanted to."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Overall I like this book, however some of the things that happen in the book are not of any importance, nor are the good in any way. I do appreciate the way the children kept their composure after many terrible events while they were locked away, and I also approve of the way they stuck together. I don't like the way the mother lied to the children, tried to bribe the children, and mistreated them; nor do I like the way the grandmother abused the children or their mother. She had a dirty mind to be so religous and holy. Also there are parts of the book that promote incest. I don't approve of things of that nature, nor do I promote those sort of activities."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I enjoy reading V.C. Andrews - for a laugh. Please. All of the Andrews writing is a crock, I mean Dawn and Ruby had exactly the same plot except one was staged in Louisiana and the other was in Virginia. I liked Flowers in the Attic when I was thirteen. Then I discovered real writing talent. This has got to be the worst novel ever written. How many of you would have romantic feelings for your brother after spending three years 24/7 in the same room with him? None? I didn't think so."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I've always loved V.C. Andrews books because she's very good at describing how \\"the other half\\" lives. Greatly exaggerated in some ways, but she's very good at depicting those families who aren't the Waltons or the Brady Bunch.I read this story for the first time when I was about twelve or thirteen and I loved it because, for the first time in my short, sorry life, I had found a book and family that I could relate to. As a veteran of foster care, and long term inhabitant of numerous children's homes, it was unbelievable to finally read about a family that was just as sick and demented as my own. That's what's so fantastic about this book.V.C. Andrews does such a great job of capturing the greed, self-righteousness, and self-centeredness of the Mother in this story. She also captures perfectly the daughter Cathy's feelings, as she goes from loving her mother, to quickly learning to distrust her, the rage, resentment and bitterness she feels at being so grossly betrayed by her own flesh and blood.For me personally, and for a lot of children, especially girls growing up, this book wasn't just a fantastic story to read. It was also an anchor, something to turn to, that reassured us, that we weren't freaks, that there were families just as screwed up as our own.Twenty years later, I can still remember sitting around with a group of girls at one of the children's homes I lived at. We were all reading V.C. Andrews books and giggling through our tears because they were proof that were weren't all crazy or different. That we weren't the only thirteen year old girls out there who were being beaten and abused by our parents, being raped by our own relatives.That's why I'd recommend this book, Flowers in the Attic, or any of V.C. Andrews other books. Because, while her stories are exaggerated to a degree, there are also lots of lessons about having internal strength, assurances that no matter how hideous life is treating you, one day the hell is going to be over, that if it doesn't end up killing you, you will survive it somehow and find ways to move on.I know some religious groups and people have complained about her books, criticized the violence or immorality in them, but they can just get over it. In one sense her books reflect reality, the reality of the millions of kids in this country who don't grow up in some perfect Little House on the Prairie environment."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This was a wonderful book!! I couldnt put it down. Ignore what the other person said about rasism cause that is total Bull. I agree with Ms.Parkinson. I myself am Hispanic and African American and i saw nothing wrong with the book. So if you are looking for a good read, this is it!!!"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I read this book when I was 14 &amp; I still remember much of it (though not all) upto these days. The 'Dresden dolls' experience was totally horrific &amp; I couldn't imagine any mother would do that to her children in exchange for her OWN comfort (physical &amp; financial). At age 14, I was fully aware what an incestuous relationship was, but I couldn't help but feel sorry for Chris &amp; Cathy &amp; wished them a happier life.After this book, I became a V.C. Andrews fan &amp; read all sequels to this novel. The subsequent books are not as great as the original but the last, which tells the end of it all, has history repeating itself...it still has the tragic elements of the &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot; but it has a peaceful &amp; happy ending for all the surviving characters.Also read the 'prequel' to this story which centers on the grandmother &amp; pretty much explains why she's so sinister in the &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot;."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I read Flowers in the Attic a number of years ago now and I still re-read all five in the series every so often. These books drew me in and kept me in until the very last moment. When Cathy's heart broke so did mine. When she cried, I cried. She is a character without compare, she's fragile, cruel, vulnerable, ironwilled, hard-hearted, emotional, defensive, disturbed, traumatized, beautiful, graceful and violent. There just aren't enough adjectives out there. She's so well-developed, with her mannerisms and her figures of speech...You hate what she hates. And you love what she loves and for just a few hours and a few hundred pages, you can get into the mind of a person you would have dismissed as bad and you can feel what she feels. This is the mark of a fabulous book: taking away a realization about the world and about the nature of human emotion. You find out that Cathy's sins are not only her fault her relationship with Chris is heartwrenching. The plot is well done, haunting and full. Characters, I think I've said how wonderful they are. This book is so powerful and anyone who can should read it. And the sequels. Especially Petals on the Wind and Garden of Shadows. You won't ever forget them. (I don't recommend the movie, though :-))"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Flowers In the Attic is my favorite book by VC Andrews! It's genuinely creepy and emotional!

I can hardly remember any details from the trip, but I remember the way that this book thoroughly changed my life.

Yes, it is true that its not the best piece of writing but the storyline totally makes up for it. very shocking, slightly disgusting, yet very entertaining! Not recommended for younger readers!"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"The book \\"Flowers in the Attic\\" by V. C. Andrews is a magnificent and engaging book. This book will captivate you into reading on and on about these four kid's lives. It was written in 1979 and the time setting is from 1970-1980. By the way the characters talk, you can tell it's an earlier time frame. The plot is about a family with four kids who just lost their father in a car accident who are forced to move in with the mother's parents who have no idea the kids exist and were hidden from their mother's dying father. I would recommend this book to people who are into dramatic novels. I don't recommend this novel to kids under the age of 14 because they might not understand the content of the book.-review by Shanice"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Flowers in the Attic by V.C. Andrews, Cathy was in the perfect family she had an intelligent older brother Christopher and two younger siblings that are fraternal twins Carrie and Cory. But when a terrible accident happens and her family is forced to move out of their beloved home to live with their mother's parents. The question is will they survive or fall to their grandparent's cruelty? Well, I think you should read this book to find out because I'm really glad I did. It was way better than I expected and there are a lot of twists and turns all the way through the book. So check it out. You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This was an enthralling read. I really couldn't put it down--read it in two days (and it took that long only because I had to go to work). It was chilling and spellbinding. I'd recommend everyone to read it. After reading this, I bought all the other books in the same series and am currently on the third one."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Have you ever read book that just puts knots in your stomach? This one will do it to you. After I read this story, I wanted to run in a marathon, climb a tree, plant a garden, hug my kids. All the things that Cris, Cathy, Corrie and Carrie were not allowed to do for over three years. You wished parents wouldn't hurt kids the way these were hurt, but bad things happen to real children every day. They were siblings and all they wanted was someone to love them and they had no one -- expecially not there mother! Each child learned to cope with the deceit. Each child learned how to live with the pain infliced on them. They escaped their prison in the attic but the scars were there, never to go away."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"Aaah this book was the first i've read by V.C Andrews. Talk about totally horrifying! It made me want to smack that grandmother and that awful mom at the same time. Like i wanted to stop reading it, but then i wanted to keep reading on. This is one of those stories that i know will be forever engraved in my memory. Just thinking that there's more in this series gives me the heebee jeebees. How worse can it get, i guess there's only one way to find out..but still, it was a great read"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I first read this when i was in the 7th grade. A couple of years ago I read it again, from the perspective of a 24 year old. The book had the same affect on me. I remember thinking about how wonderful their lives would have been if the father had not died, how tramatic moving to the big house was, how much faith I even had in Corrinne, how scary it was when the twins started getting sick, when cory was taken away, when chris and cathy had the accident with the scissors, everything comes back so vividly. Is this book a great work of literary fiction? No, but it is great escapism, it is something that when you read it, it will stay in your memory forever. The whole series was excellent. Being at the age that I was, Garden of Shadows came out AFTER the first 4, which I found to be much more interesting. Readers my age were given no motivation to the evil grandmother and mother's behavior, that made it much more frusterating. Highly recommend - but beware! It will stay with you forever.

The twisted plot changed frequenly keeping your hands glued to the pages. Wow. The characters are believable and bounce off each other extremely well. I, however, got too attached and ended up crying during the last 4 chapters constantly. My mom read it long ago and I picked it up and never put it down. I strongly suggest it for any reader over the age of 13. Some lines are very innappropreate for younger readers."},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"I think that my review of the book is different from the others because it was a book I read after many of the Ghostwriter's. Stylistically, it's not hat great. Chris does not speak like a boy his age, and I understand he's brilliant but come on. The timing and pace was a little rough too. But if you want think and be influenced by things you wouln't have dreamed of wondering about read this. Batrayal, incest, the book has it all. It's not really a novel as much as it a diary of one's emotions, but it's still enjoyable.

It keeps you on the edge of your seat because you can never tell what will happen next. The book starts off with a little family where the father is gone all week, due to work, but is home on weekends. One weekend the father did not show up and there was a surprise birthday party for him. Everybody heard a car pull up and thought it was him. Instead, it was a police officer telling everybody that their father died in a car accident. So,the family had to move to their grandmother's house because they had no more money. Their grandmother ended up being evil and locked all the children in an an attic upstairs. Throughout the story, the children try to escape. Their mother visits them once a month and their grandmother would starve them. The littlest boy Cory died and the gramdmother buried him out back and told the kids that he died from Pneumonmia. The grand mother said nothing but lies. I dont want to reveal the end because it would be better for you to pick up the book and find out for youself. I think you should read this novel because the end is unexpected. The reason i like the story is bacause i am always ready for novels that have spooky parts.

Lately I saw this book marketed with the \\"Classics\\" along with Catcher in the Rye etc...Well I decided I would finally read it.I was not to be disappointed. This story touched me, disturbed me, and kept me enthralled until its end. I was riveted to the page and suffered every indignation right along with Chris and Cathy. Their mother's betrayals made me rage and I almost couldn't continue to read when they decided not to have her put in jail. Anyways...this is an awesome book and you MUST read.Just a quick word on writing style...VC Andrews has it. The punctuation is such perfection the words just glide from the page..Sentence structure is superb and it doesn't leave you sputtering along trying to make sense. Excellent and so easy to read.I've decided to edit this review and add this footnote for the \\"day after\\" reflections. I still feel trapped in the attic.

I realize that V.C. Andrews' work will probably not be regarded as classic and will not become part of the canon. It's not meant to be. But that hasn't stopped me from enjoying and appreciating her work.These books are for fun. Uncomfortable, awkward fun, but fun. To read them requires willing suspension of belief. That's what fiction is for. Okay, Flowers in the Attic has a slow beginning, a predictible middle, and an unrealistic ending. But that's okay once in a while. Really.Read Flowers in the Attic if you're looking for a quick, suspenseful, entertaining read--it's all of those things. Take it to the beach, on a road trip, or to the doctor's waiting room. However, if you're looking for something more realistic and every bit as disturbing, read Sybil.Don't be afraid to have fun with books once in a while, and everything needn't be taken seriously--V.C. Andrews is one of those authors to enjoy guiltily but not solemnly.ktm"},{"Title":"Flowers In The Attic","review":"This book was a very good book to read, although you need to be pretty mature to understand the themes in this book- it's still a very good book.

Heavy issues are doubt with openly in the book which did shock me a little and i am glad that the author touched many subjects in which we do not openly talk about in life. The realism of the plot is errie which added to the suspense.And after reading the book i took great pity on chris and cathy feeling that i had connected with these characters.i do feel that christopher genuingly fell in love with cathy obviously this love was spurred on by the constant separation from the outside world and girls his age. But in the end i feel he could not help falling in love with her as in that attic they had bonded so close that it grew to the bond of 2 lovers.Dispite the fact they were brother and sister i felt content with their relationship as i read the book.

Although this was the first book that I have read by V.C. Andrews, it took me by surprise. It will make you fall in love with reading even if it is your first time. The book covers a mixture of feelings. It is a drama and suspenseful. It is also filled with betrayal, lies, deceit, greed, child abuse, sorrow and emotional. This book will make you shed a tear for the children having to hide away from the outside world, fresh air and sunlight. Fill you with angry to hear a mother risking the lives of her own children for a little money. The children's grandmother Olivia is an evil, diabolical and cruel woman. She wears only gray and treats the children like animals, referring to them as the \\"devils spawn.\\" Flowers in the Attic is a powerful book.

The information about Pyramids being built to align with star constellations, archaeological discoveries and artic expeditions fill out the book nicely and give students an idea of how people lived.

Warren","review":"\\"Happiness Is Not My Companion\\" The Life of Gouverneur K Warren by David M. Jordan (Insiana University Press, 2001) is a welcome addition to Civil War literature, filling a void in the biographies of key players in the North's bid for victory.G. K. Warren, a graduate of West point, served in the Corps of Topographical Engineers and then taught mathematics at the Point until he was named lieutenant colonel of volunteers of the Fifth New York regiment. The high point of his career occurred on July 2, 1863, at Gettysburg, when he recognized that the unoccupied Little Round Top was the key to the Federal's defense and quickly positiond troops on its summit and backside to prevent the Confederates from taking that hill and possibly destroying the entire Federal line.As Jordan tells the rest of the story, Warren's subsequent service was characterized by arrogance, depression, a quick, sulphurous temper, and a bad habit of second-guessing his superior's orders. Just days before Lee's surrender, Warren's superior, General Phil Sheridan, relieved him of duty, casting a shadow of disgrace upon Warren's career and courage.Unable to persuade General U S Gant to give him a court of hearing, Warren had to wait 15 years before the commanding general William T Sherman approved his application. By the time the inquiry was completed and the findings released (findings which at least partially exonerated him)Warren was dead.The only other significant biography of Warren was published by his family in 1932, an apology vindicating the General and arguing his place in Civil War history.Jordan's research includes the vast collection of papers which the General himself had arranged for his defense, but it is not for that reason one-sided or uncritical in its presentation of the General's personality, career, or place in history.Everyone who today climbs to the crest of Little Round Top sees the larger than life statue of G. K. Warren, erected by the survivors of his first command. Few visitors, however, know that he was wounded there on that hot July afternoon, that he later was responsible for a meticulously exact map of the battlefield, that in spite of his success in Pennsylvania he was relieved of duty at Five Forks, Virginia, less than two years later and spent the remainder of his life trying to salvage his good name.Jordan's book is an honest and revealing look at one of the lesser known but nonetheless significant military leaders of the war. The author's background as an attorney does influence his presentation,providing some analysis that readers may or may not accept. But this book does sit well along side his other Civil war biography on General Winfield Scott Hancock."},{"Title":"\\"Happiness Is Not My Companion\\": The Life of General G. K. Warren","review":"This biography has the ring of truth and the happy tone of justice done at last. G.K.Warren, born upstate New York 1830, West Point class of '50, brevet Major General in the Union Army, brilliant strategist at Gettysburg, later commander of the Fifth Corps, died in 1883 awaiting the results of hearings he had instigated to clear his reputation. Following one of the last Civil War battles, a Union victory at Five Forks, VA to which he had contributed, Warren was fired by General Sheridan with U. S. Grant's prior approval. With little else of interest to do for the next 18 years, Warren focussed ever more intently on restoring his good name , marching in place while his personal demon, Grant, occupied the White House. Shaara (Killer Angels) did most of the heavy lifting to unearth Warren and Joshua L. Chamberlain, letting Chamberlain stand as The Hero of Little Roundtop. Jordan, more subtle, leaves him as A Hero of Little Roundtop. (Moreover, Jordan's narrative recital of this and other battles is exceptionally coherent.) Warren is a puzzle: was he a depressive personality? an adult-onset diabetic? a Democrat-for-McClellan sore loser? just one more brilliant, touchy, odd-ball Civil War general? Jordan wisely declines any one conclusive answer and gives detailed evidence for several. The hearing commission's report published after Warren's death &quot;cut both ways&quot;, as a lawyer (such as the author) might say. To his credit, Jordan lets the report pretty much speak for itself. If you have no stomach for ambiguity, stop with Killer Angels. Otherwise, read &quot;Happiness is Not My Companion....&quot;"},{"Title":"\\"Happiness Is Not My Companion\\": The Life of General G. K. Warren","review":"Having just finished David M. Jordan's \\"Happiness in Not My Companion\\", a well researched biography of General G. K. Warren, I wish to congratulate the author for his thorough and readable account of the general's life, and to recommend this book to anyone interested in civil war history, american military history, or biography of an individual who should be remembered in human as well as historical terms. The first half of Warren's story, describing his civil and military achievements, including his significant role at Gettysburg, through the Army of the Potamac's campaign of 1864, describes a man of ability and leadership, although Mr. Jordan plants the seeds of his future tangles with those in military authority. His relief from command by Sheridan near the end of the war and subsequent history is described with honesty and compassion, ending with Warren's death while attempting to clear his name via a military Court of Inquiry some 18 years after the fact. Mr. Jordan's research is exhaustive and heretofore unplumbed. His extensive use of quotations advances the narrative in an organized and readable style that had this reader unable to put the book down, especially after the battle at Five Forks. The author is to be commended for his research, his objectivity, and his highly readable style."},{"Title":"\\"Happiness Is Not My Companion\\": The Life of General G. K. Warren","review":"For Civil War readers, Gouverneur Kemble Warren is not an unfamiliar name. He is most associated for his slow response in the Wilderness campaign where he was dismissed without, as we read, justifiable cause. This action was driven more by spite and the ego issues of Phil Sheridan, who failed to understand the issues causing Warren's delay at Five Forks. And then there was U.S. Grant's rigid blind faith in Sheridan that led him to summarily dismiss Warren, also without knowing all the facts. Jordan does a good job of showing the many facets of a general who was not only competent but ethical in his conduct of the war. While admittedly cautious and slow at times, he was still able to win battles and not needlessly compromise his men's lives. As a psychotherapist, it was personally interesting to see the psychology of this complex man, from his highs to his rages and deep depression. He was without question, intelligent and with great courage. He did have issues that could compromise his \\"generalship\\" at times but then shine at others. Yet, his leadership of men was done with character and ethical responsibility and discipline. I highly recommend this book as not only a means to understanding an excellent civil war general but also as a way to see how circumstances create decisions, both good and bad. To see how incompetent leaders can manage to survive and highly competent ones fall, all in a flash. The book, from the early days of Warren, through his Civil War battles, court of inquiry trial and, ultimately, his lonely and sad death, is well written, easy to read and, like a complex movie, shows us pieces of the war and its many unseen still frames that are so easily missed. The reader will come away with a greater understanding of G.K. Warren as well as the civil war. David L Mazzola"},{"Title":"\\"Happiness Is Not My Companion\\": The Life of General G. K. Warren","review":"Before I review this one, let me admit that I've never been into book length biographies, even when they concern Civil War era figures, so this is a bit of a new experience. Keep this is mind when reading these early attempts at reviewing biographies. I picked up this bio of Gouverneur Kemble Warren for two reasons. First, Indiana University Press was having an unbelievable sale, and I managed to find this one as a brand new hardback for only $6. Second, I'd been looking to get into the biography arena by looking at men who commanded at division level or higher during the siege of Petersburg.\\"Happiness Is Not My Companion\\" takes a look at the checkered career of Gouverneur Kemble Warren, a man who was stripped of his command at the moment of his greatest triumph at Five Forks. Author David Jordan covers Warren's life in some detail, though I thought that a closer and more definitive work can probably be penned at some point in the future. With that said, I enjoyed this biography, especially the section dealing with the Petersburg Campaign. Jordan keeps the reader interested while moving the story along. The author argues that Warren was wronged by Sheridan at Five Forks, but he does candidly admit many of Warren's flaws, though I suspect he may not have gone far enough in revealing these.Gouverneur Warren was an extremely intelligent man, but his main faults, according to author David Jordan, were his difficulty in following orders given to him while at the same time giving frequent unwanted \\"suggestions\\" to his superior officers. Jordan downplays somewhat Warren's nature to frequently act with great condescension, which is to me his greatest flaw. Warren was born on January 8, 1830 in upstate New York in the little town of Cold Spring, just a short distance from West Point. That Warren ended up at the Military Academy is hardly surprising given his birthplace and his prominent family. He graduated second in his class, and was awarded a spot in the coveted Corps of Engineers. In this role, Warren spent the better part of the 1850's on expeditions to the west, where he encountered friendly and hostile Native Americans, including the Sioux, and participated in his first military actions. Warren had accepted a position to teach mathematics at West Point by the time war broke out, but he soon became Lt. Colonel and then Colonel of the famous 5th New York, Duryea's Zouaves. He led the men of this regiment as a brigade commander in the Seven Days and at Second Bull Run, and was afterward promoted to Chief Topographical Engineer and then Chief Engineer of the Army of the Potomac. It was in this position at Gettysburg that Warren perhaps gave his greatest contribution to his country. Warren, while out scouting on the Union far left, noticed the importance of the Round Tops and the fact that Confederate infantry were approaching. He immediately found the nearest Union troops, the brigade of Colonel Strong Vincent, and sent them scurrying for the crest of Little Round Top. They barely beat the Confederates to the crest and managed to secure this vital area for the Union. Warren was promoted to Major General after the battle, and he was temporarily placed in command of the II Corps while Winfield Hancock recovered from his severe Gettysburg wound. In the Mine Run Campaign of November 1863, Warren called off an attack that he deemed suicidal on his own responsibility. Meade was at first furious that Warren had disobeyed, but he agreed with Warren's decision after taking a look at the Confederate entrenchments. This first instance of Warren questioning his orders as a corps commander was only the beginning. Meade and Grant would grow exasperated with Warren on more than one occasion during the Overland and Petersburg Campaigns. It was during this time frame, while commander of the V Corps of the Army of the Potomac, that Warren had his greatest problems as a commander. Meade and Grant were on the verge of relieving him several times for his continued questioning of orders, or in some cases, his outright disobedience of these orders. Jordan quotes the diary of Charles Wainwright, the V Corps Artillery Chief, quite often during this time period. Apparently Wainwright did not much like Warren and was constantly critical of his commander. All of this was leading up to Warren's greatest triumph...and his greatest disappointment. Warren was placed under Phil Sheridan during the attack on Five Forks. Grant, apparently having grown tired of Warren's tendency to question his orders, gave Sheridan the right to sack the v Corps commander at any point and replace him with any of the V Corps division commanders. Although Warren moved his men up in a satisfactory manner, and although the V Corps was able to flank and drive off the Confederates guarding Five Forks, Sheridan relieved Warren and sent him back to Grant. Jordan discusses Warren's unceasing efforts after the war in his quest to see a court of inquiry convened. It wasn't until the early 1880's that Warren was able to make this possible. He had known that while Grant or member of his circle were in power that his request would never be granted, so he had waited until Rutherford B. Hayes was President to press home his request. In my mind, Jordan demonstrates pretty conclusively that Warren was not at fault in any way at Five Forks, though Warren's peers who oversaw the court were rather ambivalent in their findings, perhaps to appease Sheridan, who now commanded the entire United States Army. Warren died before the findings of the court were made public. He deserved better, from Sheridan on April 1, 1865, to Grant in the intervening years concerning the granting of a court of inquiry, to the men who finally made judgments on his behavior.As I stated in the introduction, this is a good but not great book. Jordan goes into considerable detail, but I couldn't help feeling that even more could have been done. He also seems to go a little easy on Warren in some cases, especially when it concerns Warren's difficulty in dealing with subordinates and superiors who he felt were not as intelligent as he was. One trait I dislike more than most in my fellow human beings is condescension. Warren was filled to overflowing with condescension for quite a few people, and I would have liked to see the author get into this in more detail. Other than that, I thought he tried to be impartial, as a good biographer always should. The maps that accompanied the text were solid, and really a bit of an unexpected bonus as far as a biography goes. Anyone interested in biographies of Civil War generals will not be disappointed in this one. Those interested in G. K. Warren or in the later campaigns of the Army of the Potomac will also want to give this one a look."},{"Title":"\\"Happiness Is Not My Companion\\": The Life of General G. K. Warren","review":"Having had little information on the life of my great, great, great grandfather this book was facinating. I had no idea he had participated critically in so much of the civil war. Not only Warren's genius of analysis of conditions in battle, but his engineering skills were also very notable, indeed his accomplishment in cartography and engineering of the Rock Island bridge some could say eclipsed anything he did during the war between the states. The book is a facinating inside look at relationships between men of high rank and served to show that patriotism was not the sole factor in their decisions and exploits. Great leaders, sadly, usually have great egos and Warren was no exception. I also thought the final analysis of why Warren, though brillant, failed to achieve the greatness he was surely capable of achieving, to be profoundly accurate, in light of previous chapters of each battle. His broad understanding of the big picture came into direct conflict with men of lesser intellect, but higher rank, who had the \\"tunnel\\" vision to stay the course and simply overwhelm the enemy with shear numbers. I applaud this work of David Jordan and for taking so much time to research and write about a man the world did it's best to defame and hide in obscurity."},{"Title":"\\"Happiness Is Not My Companion\\": The Life of General G. K. Warren","review":"In \\"Happiness is Not My Companion,\\" David M. Jordan performs his usual solid job in assembling a biography. Jordan is, as always, excellent when it comes to digging in primary sources and he does breathe a good deal of life into the rather obscure G. K. Warren. Best known for his role at Little Round Top, Warren led the 5th Corps of the Army of the Potomac during most of the Overland campaign before his removal at Five Forks. He also held a number of important staff assignments under Joe Hooker and George Meade. Jordan is able to offer an excellent account of Warren's Civil War career as well as his quest for vindication from being removed from command. Jordan also offers an excellent look at Warren's morose and often overly critical personality. There remain some problems in the book. Warren's role as an explorer is covered too quickly. The same can be said of his role as an engineer in the West after the war. Still, Jordan is excellent on Warren and the war. Anyone interested in the Union effort in the east would profit from this book about a leading and very unique general."},{"Title":"\\"Happiness Is Not My Companion\\": The Life of General G. K. Warren","review":"I'm coming to the conclusion that engineers do not make very good field generals - at least not in the Civil War. They are too careful, too conservative to seize opportunities when quick action is needed. This seems to be an overall problem with Gouverneur Kemble Warren (as it was with William B. Franklin, another engineer promoted to field command), though ironically it's for a prompt (some might say even impulsive) decision at Gettysburg that he is best remembered.Warren saw action throughout the eastern theatre. He was wounded at Gaines Mills and fought at Antietam and Fredericksburg. At Gettysburg he noticed that Little Round Top at the extreme Union left was unoccupied; he ordered troops to form a defensive line there, just in time to thwart an attack by Longstreet. It was the high point of his military career. At the Wilderness in May 1864, he had his first run-in with Phil Sheridan when he criticized the cavalry and then possibly suffered \\"something like a nervous breakdown\\" (according to Sheridan's biographer, Roy Morris). Both Sheridan and Grant, who had been tipped off about Warren by Sheridan, were suspicious of him at Five Forks in April 1865, and Sheridan found him \\"despondent\\" and slow to respond to orders. For this he relieved Warren of his command after the battle. For years after the war Warren made requests to have his dismissal at Five Forks investigated; finally in 1879 a court of inquiry was held and Warren was exonerated.Apparently, Jordan believes, Warren suffered from chronic depression. He was always quick-tempered and often criticized orders. He also saw disaster wherever he looked. But he was intelligent and brave, and looked out for his men. Jordan's account of Warren's life is excellent. It's scholarly but not pedantic, and he writes clearly and with style. The book is a joy to read and I recommend it highly to all Civil War enthusiasts."},{"Title":"\\"Happiness Is Not My Companion\\": The Life of General G. K. Warren","review":"Solid bio on General Warren, like George Picket, known for Gettysburg and Five Forks, the latter in his casea great controversy. Warren was the opposite of the Confederacy's impetuous A. P. Hill, Warren was brave but detailed and thorough in his planning. Often thinking of his men's welfare, he frequently clashed with not only Meade but by war's end Grant and Sheridan. The author provides a healthy history of Warren's family and his time at West Point and his gallant service mapping the Black Hills among the Sioux before the war. The reader may be a little impatient to get to the Civil War and the controversy but you get there relatively quickly. Warren serves on McClellan's staff and stays as a staff officer as a topographic engineer through his famed role at Little Round Top. Warren then becomes a corps commander, although he seems ill suited personality wise for the task. His dispatches to Meade naively offer too much advice and seemimg less action than his superiors expect, which he never seems to fully appreciate. Jordan utilizes many primary resources such as reports and letters by Warren, his bombastic artillery Officer, close military friends, commanders and many other witnesses to give you a first hand perception of the man. Warren's was notable in refusing to attack Lee's fortifications at Mine Run, a little written about campaign that establishes Warren as a man considerate of his men yet suffering in the eyes of his his commander. Here the author could have offered more maps as the Mine Run campaign starts questions about Warrens propensity to inform and perhaps lecture. During the overland campaign, Warren alternately hesitates and attacks and the author describes the reasons for each, particularly the Confederate fortifications. Rhea, in his great series of books on the 1864 campaigns, probably describes best Grant and Meade's frustration with Warren but Jordan does well here in this 320 page book. Although aquiting himself well during the Petersburg siege, with some question at the Crater, Warren's 5th corps continues to actively pivot late in 1864 alternately with Hancock's 2nd to the western outside edges of Petersburg. A question worth asking here is why, if Grant and Meade already question Warren's timely ability to attack, did they not keep his corps east of Petersburg in a static position? This is not answered by Jordan but should have been explored. By late March 1865, he is ordered to maneuver around Lee's far right to support Sheridan that culminates in the battles of Dinwiddie Court House (a setback for Sheridan) and then Five Forks. This unusual collaboration between two Generals that mutually dislike each other is immediately antagonized by too many confusing orders from both Sheridan and Meade to Warren compunded by Grants independent control of Sheridan. Jordan points out well that Warren is succesful in his dificult manuevers in the face of the enemy yet Warren fails to report timely to Sheridan. Jordan covers the battle of Five Forks well, ironically Warren's best and most succesful attack, and the controversy of Sheridan sacking Warren after the battle was won. Jordan's reserach also notes Warren's colorful charge across the final breastworks with his troops happens just before his sack notice reaches him as opposed to what some historians describe as happening only after he learned he was sacked. Ed Bearss book \\"Five Forks\\" in the VA. series probably describes the battle best with an excellent map but Jordan does a fine job describing the battle. The latter parts of the book follow Warren's post war career and his unusual dedication as an military engineer refusing to leave the army for much needed income as a private engineer as he waits his day in court. Warren comes across as a festidious egineer more suited for that kind of work but his extended military career and his desire for a trial seem to aggravate his sensitive health. The trial, 16 long years later, is well covered as well as the political difficulties as Sherman, Sheridan and Grant act as roadblocks. Jordan paints Warren appropriately as a man of talent but lacking in perception that the war changed and that Grant and Sheridan were trying to bring the war to an end in a hurry, which contributed to the abrupt and disasterous decision by Sheridan ironically after the day at Five Forks was won. At Five Forks Warren was relieved not for his actions that were unknown to Sheridan at the time but for the reputation that preceded and sterotyped him in Sheridan's eyes. One of the last ranking officers who served with McClellan, it is unfortunate that Warren did not leave when Hancock did or at least recognize that Grant and Meade required less opinions but timely reports of action as did Sheridan. A sad end with a final victory, reversed court finding, coming too late as the book's title aptly professes, happiness was not be his his post war companion."},{"Title":"\\"Happiness Is Not My Companion\\": The Life of General G. K. Warren","review":"Happiness Is Not My Companion is an apt title for David Jordan's 2001 biography of General Gouverneur K. Warren, hero of Little Round Top at Gettysburg, commander of the II and V Corps for the Army of the Potomac, and most famously relieved of command by Major General Philip Sheridan following the Battle of Five Forks in April of 1865. That relief, coming scant days before the surrender of Robert E. Lee at Appomattox, sparked controversy and an eventual court of inquiry into the appropriateness of the relief.This biography, long overdue and very much needed, goes far towards painting a picture of the enigma that was G.K. Warren. Get two Civil War buffs together, and you will likely have conflicting thoughts about what made the man tick. Author Jordan does a very nice job of culling the extensive Warren papers and presenting the various sides of \\"Gouv,\\" and further includes snippets from the letter of his wife to flesh out his subject.Warren himself is often treated by historians as something of a loaner for whom the trials of war drove him more and more towards despondency and depression. This is much of what Jordan presents, although I found the work somewhat lacking in analysis of the subject's character. For example, one could fairly easily extrapolate that Gouverneur Warren may well have suffered from bi-polar disorder, a malady not uncommon to brilliant men. Jordan's descriptions of Warren's seeming inability to complete after the war his Midwest mapping projects from the antebellum period, and the seeming mountains of work associated with the projects, allows us to see the loaner sitting in his work area with mounds of paper strewn about. That Warren spent most of his life away from his wife speaks volumes.Jordan does an excellent job presenting Warren's mood swings. Periods of inactivity seemed to drive the downward spiral for Warren's moods, although almost any pretense of activity could perk the general up. What also comes through beautifully is the somewhat odd love affair between Warren and his wife Emily, one that lasted through his lifetime, yet saw the two living apart for so much of their time together.Jordan further does a good job of chronicling the Warren Court of Inquiry, presenting what is most likely a more balanced side of the Court than Phil Sheridan probably deserved.Like many military biographies, Jordan spends more time filling in the military history surrounding Warren than looking at the man himself - not too unusual for Civil War biography - but still leaving so much interpretation open to the reader. And that, in and of itself, is not too large a problem, for the reader can draw his or her own conclusions regarding what drove Gouverneur K. Warren, and what led to his premature death at the age of 53.All-in-all, an excellent work, and well worth the purchase and read."},{"Title":"\\"Happiness Is Not My Companion\\": The Life of General G. K. Warren","review":"Gouverneur K. Warren was a controversial character indeed: a great and competent general, but not above mistakes and hubris. An unsung hero of the CW, really. This book is quite well-written, and seeing G.K. Warren's complex personality and his accomplishments, triumphs, and failures up to, during, and after the war is invaluable to understanding the man.Most people have never heard of G. K. Warren, but many believe G-burg wouldn't have been so decisively won by the union had he not sprung into action as he did (Not that it was entirely 'decisively' won, either. I suppose relative to other battles it was....).A whopping thanks to David M. Jordan for illuminating the saga of G. K. Warren--an oft overlooked personage--with such sensitivity, fairness, and insight!"},{"Title":"\\"Happiness Is Not My Companion\\": The Life of General G. K. Warren","review":"I first learned about Warren while I was researching the civil war records of my great grandfather, a private who served with the 187th NY Regiment from the summer of 1864 through Appomattox. This was part of the 2nd Brigade of the 1st Division of the 5th Corps of the Army of The Potomac. At this time the Brigade was under the Command of both Gregory and Joshua Chamberlain, the Division was commanded by General Griffith, and the Corps. for the most part by Warren. I was very fortunate to be able to read the extensive writings of Joshua Chamberlain who described in detail the movement of the Brigades, the Divisions, and the Corps. during the many battles from late 1864 through Appomattox. He wrote very highly of General Warren. From Chamberlain's books I formed a very high opinion of the officers, including Warren, that my Great-Grandfather served under.Like the author I have also noticed that the mention of Warren appears in all the Civil War Books that dealt with Eastern battles. To me Warren had a peculiar genius that even his enemies in both the Union and Confederate Armies recognized. He could spot danger at an instance on a battlefield. When I visited Gettysburg and looked at the little knob in a distance called Little Round Top I was not that impressed. When I was on it I was astounded as to the commanding view it had of the battlefield. I am convinced that Warren, due to his engineering background looked at terrain in three D. He had the gift of seeing more than just what the eye could see which gave him the ability to continually question what lay behind terrain features.Recently I was researching some Nelson ancestors who had settled in Duchess County across from present day West Point. I was reading a section on the Nelson/Warren families included in The Journal Of The Reverend Silas Constant which was written by an Emily Warren in 1903. I then came across a mention of General Warren and was surprised to find that both I and the General share Nelson ancestors from the Colonial Times. I decided to read more about General Warren which led me to this Biography.Focusing just on Warren the book gives an amazing description of his accomplishments as an explorer and map maker, collector of artifacts, his many accomplishments in the Civil War, and the tremendous Engineering feats he did after the war. His Civil War exploits are what readers will likely be interested in. Actually I learned a lot of Civil War history reading this book as I was unaware Warren was in the war from the start until ten days before its end. The author does a good job of capturing the key points of each battle, and the circumstances which led to the final results. Whether Warren would have been more valuable to the Army of The Potomac as the Chief of Staff for Meade as Chamberlain argues or as a Corps Commander is not that significant to me. Warren saved the Union Army's rear end so many times in this war it is incredible. His finding Little Round Top at Gettysburg unoccupied and the actions that he took to secure it makes Warren spot in history secure. This is just one of many such occurrences. Personally I don't think the author or other historians give Warren and the 5th Corps the proper credit for what they did at North Anne in 1864. This battlefield had the potential to have delivered a fatal blow to the Union Army, but Warren and the 5th Corps smelled out the now famous trap Lee had set for the Union Army and they were able to sneak away before they were hit.In my opinion Warren was destined for failure under Grant. Grant's strategy of picking the worst of all terrain to fight his battles, waiting for the enemy to entrench, and then mounting frontal attacks was effective but atrocious for running up casualties. The more I read about Grant the less impressed I am with his military abilities. I might change my mind after reading more about Vicksburg. However by 1864 the public just wanted the war over and Grant and Meade ended the war. Grant secured his place in history as the victorious General of the Union Army. As a descendant from one of their privates I appreciate the actions of the Fifth Corps Generals like Warren who tried to take their objectives with the least possible loss of life. There are a lot of people not alive today because Sheridan's Calvary blocked Warren's race to Spotsylvania. In this book the author thoroughly examines Sheridan's relief of Warren at Five Oaks, describes in detail all facets of this battle based on the facts established in the Warren Court of Inquiry, discusses the animosity that existed between the Union Armies of the West and East and the political forces that shaped the command structure of the Union Army.Irony surrounds the history of the characters in this book. Warren secured his honor and glory spot in history not from the Warren Court but from the Statue erected of him at the top of Little Round Top in Gettysburg. Millions of visitors to Gettysburg can see and are told that it was \\"the eye of Warren\\" which saw that this hill was unoccupied, took steps to secure it, and this as much as anything led to the Union Army winning arguably the most important battle ever fought by the US Military. Warren and the 5th Corps are also treated very favorably in the writings of Joshua Chamberlain, whose Civil War stature has been lionized by his writings and heroic portrayal made of him in movie classics such as Gettysburg. Grant, Warren's nemesis is more remembered as one of the more ineffective Presidents of the US than then the Great Northern Civil War General. Sheridan, if remembered or not confused with Sherman has arguably less recognition to the public as a Civil War leader than the Brigade Commander Chamberlain he met the day of the Battle at Five Forks. The cruelest history goes to General Custer. A true Civil War Hero and responsible for many of Sheridan's successes such as the killing of Confederate Calvary Leader Jeb Stuart, he will always remembered by the fiasco of Little Big Horn. Perhaps Sheridan was remiss in not properly training his prot&eacute;g&eacute; with Warren like traits of caution on the battlefield such as continuing evaluating the strength and location of the enemy, and paying attention to critical details of protecting your flanks in battle.I recommend this book for anyone interested in reading about the personalities and feuds among the Leaders of the Union Army, someone who is interested in gaining a summary of the major battles of the Civil War, or someone who is interested in the military history and can appreciate Warren's ability to sence danger on a battlefield. Spotting the weakness of an unoccupied Little Round Top was just one of Warren's many accomplishments during the Civil War. He was in it from start to ten days from its finish and was continuingly spotting weaknesses and dangers which saved the Union Army from disaster. The author sides with Grant and Meade, but covers in detail Warren's many accomplishments."},{"Title":"Dead West","review":"The book was absolutely genius in so many ways...my favorite being: Rob G...as usual, he has pulled off the stunning artwork that brings this book together.

The survivors take refuge where they can and try to fight off the living dead as a mysterious man, looking remarkably like Clint Eastwood from one of his spaghetti westerns, comes to town in search of a man with a price on his head, and finds himself caught up in this hellish struggle with the dead.I am always a sucker for a good zombie story and Dead West certainly was that. The black & white art, while not remarkable, was very reminiscent of the kind of art in the old Warren horror magazines like Creepy or Eerie back in the day. In fact the art somewhat reminded me of Pat Boyette's work on those same magazines from the 60's and 70's. I also like the fact that dialog was kept to a minimum as Spears and Goodridge let the visuals tell the story. There's nothing worse than a story that gets too \\"talky\\", especially a horror story. They have a very good handle on the zombie concept and a good flair for the dramatic as well. A very well done story and I look forward to seeing more from this pair.Reviewed by Tim Janson"},{"Title":"Dead West","review":"This simply-drawn graphic novel achieves everything it sets out to do. It tells a frightening and exciting story with a classic western anti-hero combined with the classic elements of the zombie-horror story. It is a perfect combination which leads you to wonder \\"Why have we never seen this before?\\""},{"Title":"Dead West","review":"I have read a lot of graphic novels, am a big fan of Spaghetti Westerns, and Zombie flicks. I'm also a huge fan of the RPG \\"Deadlands.\\" This books has certain similarities to the world of \\"Deadlands\\" but is no where near as detailed and creative. Even the bulls head logo bears a striking similarity to Deadlands. The story is simple, the characters stereotypical, and the plot underwhelming.I feel like the tone is also trying to strike that of the popular \\"Preacher\\" comics. But the humor and bravado are no where near as textured. It just falls flat.The graphics themselves are ok, a little messy at times, but nothing spectacular.I will say however, that the quality of he book itself is top of the line. Nice matte paper and good binding.I feel like this is the start of something really good, but it's just not there yet, and probably not worth more than 10 bucks, tops. It's a quick 1 hour read."},{"Title":"Dead West","review":"In the west, in an unnamed territory in the desert, an unnamed native Indian tribe lives peacefully. Then a white man comes to the tribe, and despite being treated well and with dignity, he informs them that their land is now his and they have to leave. The concept of owning land is alien to them, and not understanding they dismiss the white man's claim. And because of this they will all die, as the white man brings in some murderers and the tribe is slaughtered almost down to the last man. The chief manages to save his son before his own death.In an unnamed number of years later the town of Lazarus has been established on the dead tribe's land, and making a low-key entrance into Lazarus comes the slaughtered tribe's lone survivor, the chief's son, now a man hell bent on vengeance. Vengeance at any price. To have his vengeance there must be a sacrifice, and that sacrifice will be himself. He heads up to the town graveyard and after creating a magic circle around the town, kills his horse and commits Seppuku. The sacrifice having been made, the dead rise, and march on Lazarus.He is initially able to do all of this because the town's personnel are occupied with the hanging of a cowboy and thief, and his hanging will leave behind the pregnant whore Lucy, who loved him.Life may go on, but after the dead come back, life ends, and the living dead will kill, and the killed will live again.Soon afterwards a fat bandito comes to Lazarus and discovers that it is mostly deserted, and while exploring the mostly deserted town a mysterious stranger, a bounty hunter, has followed him into town. Neither realizes that the walking dead have infested the town, and while each man wants to kill the other, they discover, at the same time at different parts of the town, that the dead want to kill them even more than they want to kill each other.Rick Spears and Rob Goodridge marry George Romero's original zombie siege novel with Lucio Fulci's horror and Sergio Leone's westerns to give us a gory, although at times humorous, melodramatic graphic western horror novel. The fat man is clearly Eli Wallace and the unnamed mysterious gunfighter is just as clearly Clint Eastwood. And like the three directors mentioned above, Spears & Goodridge populate their story with life's lower classes, the criminals, whores, drunks, and opportunists, all which seem ill-prepared to fight cohesively together against a common enemy, like zombies. And really, not all of them will be up to the challenge.On the positive, the story itself is fairly interesting, even if totally clich&eacute;, there's even a cavalry-to-the-rescue scene! The authors give us a nifty sub-plot about the tribe's chief returning (but no other Indians?) and communicating with his son, although not much is done with this sub-plot. The chief can do this because, like his son, he is the only sentient zombie. Unresolved is that the Indians may have been a tribe of Skinwalkers, as is the mysterious gunman, although this may have been more symbolic than literal, as the authors never really do much with this novel's sub-plot either. I liked the odd bits of obvious humor; check out customer images for an example.On the negative side is that none of the characters here have any depth or individuality, nor are many of them likable in any way. Another thing is that, as have been previously mentioned, the story is all clich&eacute;, there seems to be not one thing here that doesn't seem to have been lifted from someplace else. And there are plot holes and loose ends all over the place.Honestly, the worst thing is the artwork. It has that type of blocky, sketchy, raw, unfinished, and amateurish look that seem more like rough pencil breakdowns than a finished inked product, and it really doesn't do anything for me. It looks especially muddy and sketchy in black-'n'-white, at times you just literally can't make out anything that is going on in the panel. The art is also off-kilter, and seems rarely centered. However, I will admit that at times it works, see customer images for a couple of good examples, but the silent series of panels where Lucy come to a epiphany about the power that a gun gives her is near classic, even if it also shows some of Goodridge's poor composition as none of the panels has Lucy centered in them. I have reproduced this scene in customer images, check it out.All in all though, I found myself entertained by this graphic novel, even if the underdeveloped plot and the sketchy artwork give this novella an amateurish direct-to-DVD movie feel to it. I can't give it more than a three. It's fan fiction, but with a proper editor, it just could have been so much better.I've also reviewed this horror western for this site:Skin Medicineby Tim Curran."},{"Title":"Dead West","review":"really coo.l VERY WELL DONE, in terms of art and story. very creative and original idea. a tribe of indians-killed by whites, then years later return as zombies to get revenge against a small western town. the tribe is brought back by a ritual preformed by the son of the chief the only surviving indian, who is now grown, and features a clint eastwood type guy (man with no name) who is a bounty hunter, and some really cool artwork . it is in b/w, but is amazing! I have a million zombie comics and this ones definitely one to check out!"},{"Title":"Dead West","review":"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!WARNING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Spoilers below!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Dead West is a comic that blends together two great genres: Zombie Horror and Westerns. The results are surprisingly great. The plot is is typical of Westerns. An Indian tribe is whipped out by a group of settlers who claim their land, with one of the survivors vowing revenge. From here, the story takes a different twist. The revenge comes in the form of a ritual to bring back the dead, who then seek retribution on the settlers who have built up a town on the stolen land.The graphics are quite good, and the black and white color serves the story quite well. The dialog is minimal, in keeping with elements of the Western genre. This further serves to keep the action and suspense as the focus.Overall, a really great comic, and truly a classic. Highly recommended if you enjoy Westerns and Zombie films, comics, and books."},{"Title":"Dead West","review":"We have a pretty straight forward tale of supernatural intervention here. A Native American, the last survivor of his village, which was annihilated by a group of white men who have come to take the land, comes to the town of Lazarus to extract some revenge. He kills himself while doing magic in the local graveyard, bringing all the dead, including himself, back to life.We are introduced to a mysterious stranger who has come to town chasing down a bandito. Instead, he ends up facing off against a town full of zombies and just a few remaining living souls, including the bandito he was looking for.A pretty simple story that took me twenty minutes or so to complete. The drawing is raw (which is not to say bad) and the entire story is extremely straight forward. I have started to look at enough zombie graphic novels to peg this one as just another one that does not stand out for any reasons. It felt as if the author chose to use a template of the old west and a template of a zombie invasion, lay them on top of each other, and poof! There's your story. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't at all fascinating in anyway...there was nothing that made it at all compelling."},{"Title":"Concrete Jungle : A Pop Media Investigation of Death and Survival in Urban Ecosystems","review":"A great book, with a general overview of the urban dwellers and the habitat they transform by interactions beetween species, space, history and the human perpective of the life in the cities.Its real achivement is the explorations in to urban ecosystems, with an accesible language for everyone."},{"Title":"Concrete Jungle : A Pop Media Investigation of Death and Survival in Urban Ecosystems","review":"Dion, Rockman, and Ross show us what is in front of most of us, the dwellers of the urban landscape, in a way we all might like to think about looking at the world.

I loved it."},{"Title":"Finistere","review":"At the opening of this novel, set in the 1920s, after the breakdown of his parents' marriage, 12 year old Matthew is taken to live in Paris by his mother. His inexplicable adoration of an older, male family friend becomes clearer to Matthew when he is sent to a French boarding school and experiences his sexual awakening with another boy - who at 13 is a year older, and is everything Matthew is not. Such hero-worship is later replaced when, at 15, Matthew falls in love with one of his teachers, Michel, who is in his late-20s. Inevitably the pair then face their own internal struggles as well as the external ones against a hostile society.Fritz Peters' characterisation beautifully captures the nave, isolated Matthew, and the somewhat bitter, cynical Michel, along with exquisite three-dimensional portraits of the members of Matthew's family. And in Finist&egrave;re, the father of most contemporary coming-of-age novels, the author expounds those timeless sensations of burgeoning gay self-awareness: Matthew's love for Michel \\"had made him come to life\\"...\\"The sense of guilt that had formed questions inside him, pointing an angry finger at him, vanished\\".Lest this simple exposition suggest that Finist&egrave;re is a 'typical' gay coming-of-age novel, it should be stressed that it was originally published as a mainstream novel in 1951 - clearly a bold move by the author in that era. This is reflected in the content of the novel, which, unsurprisingly, portrays the life of a gay man as a dangerous one, and since two men could not constitute a 'family', the only thing left was for homosexuality to be equated with furtive, underground sex and ultimately, loneliness. What is surprising for a novel of its time is the sympathetic portrayal of the two lovers, Matthew and Michel. Undoubtedly this imbues the novel with a particular historical significance, and it is fortunate that it has been revived by a collaboration between Arsenal Pulp Press and the Little Sister's bookstore.Much more can (and no doubt will) be said by readers about the importance of this novel in its historical context and how it sheds light on the lives of gay people in our past. Indeed, the eminent Michael Bronski ('Pulp Friction' etc) introduces this new edition with fascinating insight into this aspect of the work. However, it may reasonably be asked why it is important to revive novels such as this, when contemporary gay coming-of-age literature abounds on our bookshelves. Leaving aside the fact that Finist&egrave;re is a beautifully written and poignant novel in its own right, clearly historical literature is important as a yardstick by which we can assess how society has evolved over the years, and it is for this reason, even if no other, that Finist&egrave;re - and other works of its era - need to be kept alive. While one can point to many changes in the treatment of gay men since the 1950s, Finist&egrave;re - as with other coming-of-age novels, is ultimately about the internal struggle that a young gay person goes through in trying to find his place in a hostile society. It thus serves as a necessary reminder that the torment that Matthew undergoes in the novel still exists, more than half a century later, for the young gay person struggling to \\"arrive at the only place where he has ever really belonged\\" - and this is one reason why Finist&egrave;re remains as pertinent today as it was in 1951.Moreover, it is illuminative that the 'shock value' of the novel when first published was its sympathetic portrayal of gay characters - not their respective ages. Disturbingly, the novel still has potential 'shock value' today - precisely because the relationship involved is that of a 15 year old adolescent and a late-20s man. It is therefore apparent that persecution and hatred have not disappeared in the 50-odd years since Finist&egrave;re was published - they have merely found a new, more convenient, target. Clearly Matthew's consensual relationship with Michel was highly significant (\\"What had happened to him was an end to all fear...Michel had brought him back to life\\") - and yet the Matthews of today are still legally denied such life-altering salvation.Ultimately, therefore, Finist&egrave;re remains a work of importance and deserves to be read - not only for the beautiful sorrow and passionate emotions that the novel itself engenders, but because it provides a milestone from which the evolution of our society since 1951 (or regression, indeed) can be measured - and accordingly evokes the legitimate question of whether the persecution of minorities for their nature has really abated, or whether in fact the oppression and demonization suggested in the era of Finist&egrave;re is still being perpetrated today."},{"Title":"Finistere","review":"A Timeless Masterpiece, this book should be mandatory reading for all High School Graduates. The ability with which the author Fritz Peters has captured life, and conveyed it with his pen, is stunning. Beyond being excellent reading for all, this book sheds light on what it is like for many people you know, but don't really know, to live here upon this earth amongst YOU! A million words could not explain it better than Fritz Peters's FINISTERE does. For Humanities sake and your own - read the book!"},{"Title":"Finistere","review":"It is tempting to write too long of a review here -- I wont -- simply because you deserve to get this book and read it on your own and not be given too many expectations. I will address, however, some complaints from other reviewers that seem to have forgotten the time in which the book was originally written and who seem to feel those issues are far behind us.I know young men still go through the emotional debate that Matthew has with himself throughout the story. I know young men, who have relationships with older men, have to face the same sort of scrutiny and speculation that Matthew and Michel faced in the book as well.The good fortune is that today we are, as a society, more capable of being accepting of gay love and of relationships between men in general. These things needn't be closeted or hidden -- they needn't be judged and looked down upon -- we needn't live in fear or fear to live.I loved this book and I think anyone reading it with an open mind will love it also -- I hope you'll be the next!"},{"Title":"Finistere","review":"\\"Finist&egrave;re\\" is a classic must-read for anyone interested in queer history, specifically in France, and queer literature with its keen insights into gay love (and lust), as well as intergenerational and intercultural (American-French) relationships in the first half of the 20th century, between the world wars. It is a coming-of-age/coming out novel with many additional levels. This edition has a fine introduction by Michael Bronski and splendid appendices by poet Edward Field about Fritz Peters himself."},{"Title":"Finistere","review":"Melodramatic to a fault, this book allows some of the typical early stereotypes to stand, especially that of the lead gay character dying (suicide) in the end. However, its historical value as one of the first explicitly 'gay' novels (despite the author, Arthur Anderson Peters, using a pseudonymn) is undiminished. It also offers a small slice of Paris's postwar gay nightlife during one sequence, and features an extremely sympathetic portrayal of its two gay characters, one a twenty-something French schoolteacher, the other a teenaged English student he saves from drowning.Their tenderly drawn love affair and the strong character portrayals all-around make the book what it is. This deserves a wide audience, and even manages mostly to avoid its potential status as a period-piece."},{"Title":"Finistere","review":"I suppose the book is interesting from a historical point of view - how gay life was portrayed during a certain period, etc. Unfortunately it's a great example of the \\"nothing good comes to you if you're gay\\" type of literature.

It's great for teaching you how to use the underground and the double decker buses. The text sections are quick overviews, not reviews, but the strong suite here is brevity, not depth. I strongly recommend this for your first few times learning your way around the classic tourist sites and experiences. MapGuide is excellent as long as you are staying pretty much in the city centre. When you get to be an old London hand, remember that the classic Londoners guide will always be an A to Z (zed) map and guide. If you want to go a bit beyond the central core of the city (perhaps to Windsor, Hampton, or further away) you really need the proper AtoZ to be able to find exact routes and streets.Time OutThe Time Out guides are very good. Easy reading, short reviews of restaurants, hotels, and other sites, with good public transport maps that go beyond the city centre. Many people who buy more than one guidebook end up liking this one best!Blue GuidesWithout doubt, the best of the walks guides.... the Blue Guide has been around since 1918 and has extremely well designed walks with lots of unique little side stops to hit on just about any interest you have. If you want to pick up the feel of the city, this is the best book to do that for you. This is one that you end up packing on your 10th trip, by which time it is well worn.MichelinFamous for their quality reviews, the Red Michelin Guides are for hotels & Restaurants, the Green Michelin Guides are for main tourist destinations. However, the English language Green guide is the one most people use and it has now been supplemented with hotel and restaurant information. These are the serious review guides as the famous Michelin ratings are issued via these books.Let's GoLet's Go is a great guide series that specializes in the niche interest details that turn a trip into a great and memorable experience. Started by and for college students, these guides are famous for the details provided by people who used the book the previous year. They continue to focus on providing a great experience inexpensively. If you want to know about the top restaurants, this is not for you (use Fodor's or Michelin). Let's Go does have a bewildering array of different guides though. Here's which is what:Budget Guide is the main guide with incredibly detailed information and reviews on everything you can think of.City Guide is just as intense but restricted to the single city.PocketGuide is even smaller and features condensed informationMapGuide's are very good maps with public transportation and some other information (like museum hours, etc.)Lonely PlanetLonely Planet has City and Out To Eat Guides. They are all about the experience so they focus on doing, being, getting there, and this means they have the best detailed information, including both inexpensive and really spectacular restaurants and hotels, out-of-the-way places, weird things to see and do, the list is endless."},{"Title":"Violin Making: A Practical Guide","review":"If you've read some of the Strobel books and feel a bit puzzled or lost, this book may help you some, especially if you are a beginner. The photographs are plentiful and in color. There is some confusing language and glossing-over of points that may be mundane and obvious to an experienced luthier but are baffling yet critical to a beginner, just as in the Strobel books. So, my search continues for more complete and exhaustively illustrated books describing the violin-making process for a complete beginner."},{"Title":"Violin Making: A Practical Guide","review":"I think that if a book cannot stand on its own, the reader deserves to be provided with that information. If a book cannot be deciphered by a novice, then the novice deserves that information up front, perhaps included in the title of the book. This book is so thoroughly filled, page after page, with undefined terms and assumptions of existing knowledge, that if you don't already know what it intends to teach you, you may as well give up on learning from it. It will certainly not teach a beginner to make a violin! I got through medical school, yet I can't read this book - I lacked the hidden prerequisites. This book needs a title like &quot;Violin-making for people who know how to make violins.&quot; I was very disappointed.Consider these instructions: &quot;The top of the fingerboard should line up with the tail of the scroll, or the top of the hen's tail on cellos. Allow the width of the nut above this point and draw a line across square to the sides of the block.&quot; Nut? What nut? And silly me, I didn't even know that cellos had hens tails! Or this, from a section on rib structure: &quot;The linings may be made from a similar wood to the blocks and a strip of wood can be planed, as the ribs were, to the correct thickness.&quot; I wish I knew what the correct thickness was, but since I didn't know that violins had linings, or what a lining is - and I certainly didn't find out here - I will likely have a beast of a time figuring it out.If you don't know the component parts of a violin, inside and out, and if you don't have a pretty good idea of how to make a violin, I suggest you avoid this book. However, the color pictures are excellent; the descriptions of the maker's weight in stones, rather than pounds, is very charming, but I'm afraid the charm will come as a surprise to the author, who may not yet suspect that many of us have come to use pounds or even kilograms to measure our weight or mass.I think I am familiar with ignorance, since I have so much of it, especially on this topic, but I had hoped and expected the book would help correct that, rather than simply emphasize its degree. The author looks like a very nice lady, however, and I doubt that she did this just to make her readers feel stupid, although that will be the effect on many, especially those who haven't learned that starting out not knowing anything is the usual situation."},{"Title":"Violin Making: A Practical Guide","review":"The author juliet Barker has spent more than 50 years as a violin maker. Her book is an excellent introduction to violin making using inexpensive , and available tools. I particularly like her english low tech approach to viiolin construction , as this can help aspiring luthiers to build hand tool skills, before moving on to larger power tools. I was highly amused at one remark about the sound of a rasp being too noisy for quiet work like violin making, she might be horrified at the plethora of industrial sized power tools in my shop.She also gently takes the reader step by step through the various processes of violin making. Cutting a scroll, back and top archings, and carving, varnishing, set ups, sound post setting,, a brief history on violin making. I particularly liked the section , on using alternative woods. Something not seen too often in violin books . Most authors chose maple and spruce, but there are a anumber of alternative woods that have been successfully used. I also liked the chapter on exploring other small instruments ,viola/s, violins and hardanger fiddles. This is an excellent informative book, that will help aspiring luthiers. I would recommend this book be read with roy courtnall/s book on violin making."},{"Title":"Violin Making: A Practical Guide","review":"This book is full of color pictures that show how the tools are used, by a well respected teacher of the craft. It is not designed to be a stand alone manual to make a violin. The book is well written and is a great addition to a violin makers library or someone interested in how a violin is made. I highly recommend this book, it is well worth the price."},{"Title":"Violin Making: A Practical Guide","review":"I bought this book because of the title, expecting full-well to find the measured drawings of both the templets and fixtures nessary for making a violin. What I got doesn't even come close, all I see is a person showing their skills in the art of violin making without so much as telling me how to get there. If I were already making violins and saw this book I wouldn't buy it. So for those who are looking for a place to start, this book is useless.It isn't worth the paper it's printed on. The measurements must be a secret that only those few chosen ones possess. As far as learning these secrets, I'll just keep looking, hoping that I don't end up with a library of useless books like this one. As Dory says \\"Just keep swiming\\""},{"Title":"Violin Making: A Practical Guide","review":"This is a book with plenty of pictures and detailed instructions.

Wake you will remember the plans for a stradivarius violin in a normal size(i.e.: 1:1)the inevitability of a comparison emerges. Moreover, in the introduction(page 8, second column)the author complains that have written the book took her time for making violins(!)Maybe she considered a waste of time to add a decent plan for a violin.

When I first purchased this book I thought that it was from a person in the north east part of the U.S.. To my surprise I found out differently. It is well worth the cost for the information that you will recieve. The book is small but it is a practical guide which leaves out much useless information which a maker may not need. I hope that anyone buying this book enjoys it as much as I have already and finds it useful."},{"Title":"Violin Making: A Practical Guide","review":"no one violin building book can stand alone but this one does a good job of trying,it was written by a person who has been building high quality instruments for 40 years so it will at least put you on the right track on where you should direct your efforts on accuireing tools and that in itself will save you a ton of money not buying what you dont need,there are many color photos to help with some of the language barriers as some of the european words used are different than ours,i do believe though that anyone with good woodworking skills could use this as a stand alone book,but would still reccomend it to a novice as a companion to other violin building books to have a more thorough understanding before attempting to build,wood is high for a decent peice,as the supply for decent wood is severly declineing,i would reccomend that if you are serious about building in the future to buy the wood u need now and put it up,it will only skyrocket in the years to come ,best wishes to you as my fist violin is drying now !"},{"Title":"Violin Making: A Practical Guide","review":"This is a super book having some of the finest color prints of violin making I've seen to date.

I had done a little jewelry work in the distant past and wanted to set up my own workshop and do some more advanced work. After much research I picked these two books and think it was the right choice.

But Goldberg has four times the content and is four times as useful as McGrath.Considering some of McGrath's former work it seems like this latest book was ghost written by someone who had no idea what information was valuable to people trying to learn to make jewelry. Also, in McGrath, there is undefined UK jewelry terminology that is so arcane it doesn't get any hits on Google; and some of the content is so banal and obvious it seems like it was placed in the book just to fill space between the pictures.

This book looked perfect. It has sections for all that stuff and more. The production values of the book and the quality of illustration photographs are excellent. Sections are organized alphabetically with a an inspirations sections at the back with lots of lovely pics of nicely finished pieces that were made with concepts in the book.The problem is with the actual content. Each section is just a couple or a few pages long. Concepts are introduced, given just a paragraph or two - and then that's it. Step by step photo illustrated instructions are not referenced in the text per se and almost always lack a picture of the finished piece or effect, leaving you sometimes scratching your head as to what you are supposed to end up with. For example, the section on Mokume Gane gives great step by step instructions and illustrations about how to sandwich, solder, cut and layer - and then dent up to file off and show the layers. But there's no picture of the front of the mokume gane after the filing so you can see what all that work achieved. There's a single picture of a pave setting, but no instructions on how to get there or what a beading tool looks like or how it is used. For gem setting there's a great step by step of making and setting a bezel, but for facet stones there's only a brief step by step on making a basket. There's no specific instruction on how to notch prongs or how to bend them to set - just the phrase \\"bend prongs over the stone to set\\". This isn't sufficient to actually help you do it. The section on sawing shows you what a saw looks like and how to saw a right angle, but lacks a table instructing you which saw blade works with which thickness of metal. Every area of this book suffers from too much brevity and a lack of useful details.I'm not going to say that this book was worthless. The section on bending and the section on catches are great. I learned a few great tips too - like the use of a spitstick to clean up the top of a bezel setting. I benefited from seeing the step by step illustrations of many techniques I didn't know. But I did not get enough information to actually execute any of these unknown techniques. I'd say that this book is a good visual orientation on what these techniques are, what tools are used, and what it looks like doing these techniques. It's too brief, however, to give you enough instruction to really execute the illustrated techniques. This book just isn't enough - it's an illustrated introduction that requires additional more in depth texts to actually help you get that stuff done.Follow-up (May 2008): Am I just hard to please? Perhaps, but I have subsequently found a similar book of introduction that I do feel gives enough detail to actually do the projects: James Codina's \\"The Complete Art of Jewelry Making\\". Although I'll grant the aesthetics of the examples in McGrath are better, as a guide to technique I consider Codina to be superior."},{"Title":"The Encyclopedia of Jewelry-Making Techniques: A Comprehensive Visual Guide to Traditional and Contemporary Techniques","review":"This book is a very useful guide for those who wish to set up at home or in a small retail business since it provides the reader with enough information to confidently tackle all but the most difficult jobs.This book can also help the adventuresome to expand their scope by providing a lot of technical info which allows one to expand one's range of thinking."},{"Title":"The Encyclopedia of Jewelry-Making Techniques: A Comprehensive Visual Guide to Traditional and Contemporary Techniques","review":"With easy understand and step-by-step instruction, this is a great book for a beginner in jewelry design.

The 8:00 O'Clock Pick-Up described on pages 127-129 is my favorite. But these authors desperately needed a good editor and they didn't have one. There is way too much fluff, way too much shallow psychologizing, too many unfocused anecdotes, etc. The book is full of l---o---n---g paragraphs that ramble and stumble through way too many different thoughts. If bad writing irritates you, this is not the book for you.

However, Mulgan is no Pollyanna. He concludes with an optimistic view of the future tempered with a dash of realism. &quot;The classical idea of progress as the unfolding of a grand plan or the expression of a higher intelligence is as doubtful as the much more recent faith that the world might have immanent properties that drive it towards complexity, integration, and self-organization. [...] There may be no destiny, and no certainty, nothing determined, only choices and chances. But life is all the better for that, because that is what leaves room for people to make their own history.&quot;Mulgan's explanation of how we arrived at this point in the history of the world makes his analysis of the future more credible. For most of human history, a few traders linked the great trade centers but most economic life was local, face-to-face, and small scale. Larger social units were broadly defined and self-contained. Each unit could be mapped as a series of concentric circles of decreasing power radiating from the centers. Citizens at the centers of power were more cosmopolitan by virtue of their connectivity with other centers of power while residents of the distant regions were provincial.The rise of rapid, economical, and global travel and digital communication (connexity) has reduced the hold of provincialism upon the outlying citizens and enabled a more cosmopolitan attitude to permeate throughout society. The trade networks and free-flowing information that liberated people f! rom the previous bonds of settled agriculture and industry produced a modern nomadic mobility. On the downside, connectivity promotes a sense of timeless time and of spaceless space that favors economic transactions over relationships and withdrawal from communities rather than staying engaged.Mulgan contends that our freedom is intimately linked with that of the State. Fortunately, the State's very success in delivering both external and internal security has made new forms of government possible. Much of the baggage of sovereignty and power that that we have inherited from the days when the main role of government was to protect us from danger is now obsolete. Mulgan explores the impact of discarding this baggage (taxation, social order and control, and bureaucracy) in discussion of the rise of the city-state, assumption of pseudo-governmental roles for global corporations, and the relegation of national governments to figurehead status. Whatever form the new social order takes, it will require an environment where individuals define strength as the capacity to internalize interdependence and freedom as the achievement of individual well being in the context of attaining shared goals."},{"Title":"Connexity: How to Live in a Connected World","review":"This is yet another tome on how and why it's best for us all to live together on the fragile planet. His ancient thesis articulated, Mulgan (part of the Blair Braintrust in Britain) takes the scatter-gun approach to, well, just about everything--and nothing in detail. Mulgan's book comes off as more a Statist Apologia than an interpretation and explanation of &quot;connexity.&quot; He grapples little with the forces of &quot;connexity,&quot; such as the Internet, and what they'll make of decidedly Modern inventions (such as the welfare state). Instead, Mulgan argues that some governments really can have positive effects on their people. No argument there, but how does &quot;connexity&quot; impact the role of government? That seems to be what Mulgan is trying to answer amid the pretensions to technological and sociological expertise. &quot;Connexity&quot; comes off as well in some ways as Mulgan's greatest fear: in one place he declares that too much freedom is a very bad thing. Again, no argument, but it begs numerous questions--apparently too many for Mulgan to answer. If you really want to know what's going on in the connected world, read Wacker and Taylor's &quot;500-Year Delta.&quot; It takes nothing as given."},{"Title":"Connexity: How to Live in a Connected World","review":"Connexity presents invaluable and different tastes from the windows of Mulgan.

With this book as a guide it brought to life the events of July 1863.I would recommend this to anyone interested in this particular portion of the Iron Brigade."},{"Title":"Hoosiers' Honor: The Iron Brigade's 19th Indiana Regiment","review":"Author William Venner has assembled a useful book in relating to the history of the 19th Indiana. Venner has worked hard to back up his information offering many pages of footnotes that are handy in reenforcing his writing. This book is a fast read and chronologically follows the 19th from 1861 muster to final discharge as the unit is blended with the 20th Indiana. This book follows the hard fought history of a tough group of individuals that faced many conflicts such as Gainesville, Antietam, Gettysburg, The Wilderness and Petersburg. Venner does an excellent job covering the manpower involved in the regiment and how they survived with ever-dwindling numbers. Venner's writing is easy to read and not ever complex. This book is an excellent source for reading about the 19th Indiana as much is not written about this hard fighting group. 5 STARS!"},{"Title":"The age of reconnaissance","review":"I found this book because of the favorable review it got in the American Historical Association's Guide to Historical Literature. It is definitely a serious academic work (published by University of California Press) but accessible to the general reader. It makes no attempt to offer interesting anecdotes or historical tidbits but gives an insightful look at early European voyages of \\"discovery, exploration, and settlement\\" through 1650.Part I details the technological, social, political, and economic factors that led to the explosion of Europe onto the world scene with lots of space being dedicated to technologies of sailing, mapping, navigation and (not least of all) fighting. The second part is straight narrative outlining the history of the voyages themselves with a chapter for each destination region: Africa and the Indian Ocean, Atlantic and South Sea, America, etc... The final part discusses the empires of each of the European powers in turn: Spain, Portugal and Holland. There are also comparative chapters outlining differences in administration and economies between the empires."},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"This book is old-fashioned in its multiple-story structure, modern in its subject matter, and accomplished in conveying a funny yet human voice. I laughed out loud many times and could hardly put the book down for the last third of it. It is an upbeat read with a great sense of place and endearing, quirky characters. I can't wait for Steve Amick's second book!"},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"I don't usually take the time to post my opinion online, but Steve Amick's first novel was such an intriguing, captivating read that I wanted to recommend it to anyone who might be interested. In this era of celebrity watching, and reality television mania, Amick's novel grabs the reader's attention not with glamour and glitz, but with the unusual everyday life of a small Michigan community. The reader does not need to have summered on a lake in the Midwest to easily become interested in the lives of Amick's characters.I just read a negative review of this book on the Amazon website which criticizes Amick's character development, and I strongly disagree with that reviewer's opinion. The characters in this story are anything but two-dimensional. One of the reasons I enjoyed this novel is because Amick really made me feel for the people of Weneshkeen. I couldn't put the book down because I wanted to know what was going to happen next. Also, I developed compassion for the characters in this story. I wanted their lives to improve. I wanted them to face their problems and fears, and overcome their struggles. I was also impressed with the humor in the novel. At times I found myself laughing outloud.In short, buy and read the book! I am sure you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"I really cannot say that this book is for everyone, but I did enjoy it even though parts of it did disturbe me. Having read the other reviews posted here, it is quite evident that this is one of those books that people either really like, or they really do not. My first suggestion would be that you read the thing and make up your own mind. I did enjoy the author's line up of characters. I personally thought that most of them were pretty well developed. There were parts of the book that did have me laughing out loud. The book did hold my interest from cover to cover. The one aspect of the book that did trouble me was the retired pastor who became quite hung up on cyber porn and then sunk into pedaphilia. To be honest, I find this subject rather disturbing and down right disgusting. Now I realize that this sort of thing does go on, more than most would like to admit, but I get a daily dose of it with the media of the real world and can do without it in my fiction. On the other hand, the author was able to nail the personalities of his characters of all ages, something difficult for one so young, i.e. the author. This is a quick and easy read. Even if you do not like it, not much of your reading time will be wasted. I do recommend this one even though there are some dark areas which might be upsetting to some."},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"This book is as slow moving and dull as the Michigan vacation town it takes place in. I was only able to tolerate a couple of chapters before I gave up. The author tries to jazz it up with somewhat explicit sexual encounters, but it's just not enough. The writing wasn't horrible, but the character building and plot were pretty thin and uneventful."},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"This lyrical novel turns the simple sublime. Mr. Amick's rich painting of this region and the individuals in it is beautifully written. (If you don't believe me, take time to see the fantastic review in the _San Francisco Chronicle_!) Amick brings his characters to life in quirky, charming, heart-breaking dimension -- this includes the biggest character of all, the Michigan vacation town.I'm not one to reread novels often, but this one will definitely be added to my short list. Until Amick's next masterpiece is made public, I'll be content to return to _The Lake, the River & the Other Lake_ again and again."},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"An enormously slow start gives way to a hilarious middle section, followed by a very dark last third that is probably not the destination a reader has in mind. Though I was laughing out loud at many of the characterizations in this book, the slow and steady pace and the (never really knit together) separation of the characters left me frustrated. Maybe life really is all about sex, but when books are, I get bored. Maybe I lack sufficient prurient interest. Still, so many parts of this book are so hilarious that they should be framed."},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"When I started this book I thought I'd be able to recommend it as a light, fun read about the goings-on in a small town. It pulls you in and makes you want to find out what will happen to each of the people who have a storyline of their own. But by the end, the light, fun tone gives way to darker truths about each person, often involving explicit, and in some cases, disturbing sex acts. By the time I had finished the book I decided that I wouldn't want to be next-door neighbors with the author, who apparently creates sordid fantasies behind every person that he meets, or at least every person he sees fit to write about. I was disappointed by this book and would not recommend it to others."},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"I was thrilled to read a novel devoted to one of my favorite parts of the world, but Steve Amick's debut novel was an extreme disappointment.The novel starts off promising, with interesting characters in a quirky tourist town, but it soon derails. At the end it completely falls apart.Amick seems to have taken several separate stories and just stuck them all together. Several of the major story lines have no connection to one another and it seems very disjointed.When I finished the book, I thought had hallucinated. It just...ends. Several plots are never finished, several mysteries never explained or revisited.

I look forward to another."},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"What was the Washington Post thinking? THE LAKE, THE RIVER, AND THE OTHER LAKE, by Steve Amick, was a Washington Post Best Book of the Year, for 2005, I believe. As I have stated in other reviews, when I read a book (or watch a movie), I want to be entertained, to learn something, or to have cause to think. THE LAKE, THE RIVER, AND THE OTHER LAKE does none of these things.THE LAKE, THE RIVER, AND THE OTHER LAKE does not tell a story, per se. Instead, it is the chronicles of the city of Weneshkeen and surrounding environs during the summer tourist season of 2001. The individual threads of this book, of which there are far too many, just start at the beginning of Summer and end at Fall. There is no resolution or completion for any of the threads. At the end, I was left hanging, saying \\"What?\\"There are 6 basic streams of consciousness in THE LAKE, THE RIVER, AND THE OTHER LAKE: 1. the summer sexual escapades of a 16 year old boy and his danger-seeking, over-sexed, screwed-up girlfriend; 2. the Native American, Vietnam vet and his private war with jet skiers; 3. the retired minister and his descent into internet porn and pedophilia; 4. the local cherry farmer and his bigotry toward the spouses chosen by his children; 5. the young, burned-out internet whiz kid, and his search for his next for fortune; 6. the home-town deputy and the jerk of new sheriff from the big city. An over abundance of complicated caricatures, none of whom I connected with or cared about. Mainly, I was just plain bored, but I was also frequently disturbed. THE LAKE, THE RIVER, AND THE OTHER LAKE seems to have been written for shock value, rather than for entertainment. I struggled to finish this book, hoping that there would be a payoff. But that payoff never came.I must say, however, that Steve Amick is very talented and has a very pleasant writing style - easy, comfortable, and engaging. Because of this obvious talent, I wanted to be drawn into this book. Unfortunately, the lack of distinct story and choice of topics prevented that from happening. I was left wanting that part of my life back...the same feeling I had after viewing NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN. Perhaps his next choice of subject will be an improvement."},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"It is difficult to believe that this is Steve Amick's first novel. His development of character and sense of place is supurb. Anyone who has ever lived in a tourist destination or summer retreat will appreciate the us VS them culture which arises between the locals and the visitors. Weneshkeen is the small town tourist destination in upper Michigan which caters to a seasonal invasion of \\"fudgies\\". Amick's characters span the breadth of locals and seasonals. He does a great job of developing sympathetic characters including their flaws. Roger Drinkwwater's war against noisy jet skis and rude tourists, the downstate young teen who is visiting with her father for the summer and is embarassed by his feud with the neighbors, the recently widowed and retired Reverend Reecher who finds himself drawn into a web of pornography, the crusty fruit orchard farmer who must make adjustments to his world of who belongs and who doesn't, including his new Guatamalan daughter-in-law and soon to be Japanese son-in-law. Particularly sympathetic is young Mark, the sex-starved teen who is given more than he can handle.All in all, Amick has written a wonderful novel of time and place, both comic and tragic, but compelling nonetheless."},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"I cannot remember the last book of this kind that I enjoyed so much.\\"The Lake, The River, and the Other Lake\\" reads like the author's memory of a boyhood home or retreat, where he really, really got to know the denizens. I'm sure he drew on experiences of people he knew; the characters are so richly drawn, their thoughts so clearly spoken, I felt I knew them myself. And in fact, in any small community, there are representations of most of these people; the Barney Fife-ish cop, the feuding neighbours, the bored teens enduring yet another summer in a pretty-but-boring place that has lost its allure for them.The author, Steven Amick, starts it out in a traveloguey manner, establishing for us the location of this small, fading resort community. He creates a history for the place, Weneshkeen, and provides it with a lot of connections to a vanished Native American presence, represented now only in a single Indian member, who figures heavily in the activities in the book. The rest of the story is told in monthly installments, all during one particular summer (2001), through the eyes of year-rounders, weekenders (called \\"Fudgies\\", because of a tourist interest in locally-made fudge), and the indolent rich who own palatial homes around the inner lake and who hire river guides to pilot their behemoth yachts from the inner lake to Lake Michigan and back.The very colorful characters of the book include the aforementioned 7/8 Ojibwe Indian, Roger Drinkwater(the other 1/8 is Polish), who has an ongoing campaign against jetskiers, whom he sees as an abomination on the inner lake, his home; a lonely, still-grieving widowed retired minister, befriended by a local summering teen; the teen's townie father, waging his own campaign against the rich next-door neighbours over a petty boundary dispute; the son of the next-door neighbours, who has become entangled with a rich-but-bored hottie looking for excitement; and various other town members, all adding their own style and interest to the storylines followed. A continuing thread is the rumour that David Letterman is considering buying property nearby; of course everyone is anxious to get a glimpse of him, and the rumours grow as the book progresses.I hated to put the book down, and did in fact carry it with me almost everywhere I went, to steal a few moments with it when I had the chance. It felt like a vacation in a book; I was enchanted with the characters, including also a local orchard owner, an old-schooler who learns an important life lesson in humanity; and, Northern-Exposure-ishly, brought me into the lives of a small community so that I wanted to go there and visit a while. With each new chapter, it was as though Mr Amick had foreseen exactly whose story I wanted to see more of; more than once, as I began a new chapter, I thought to myself, \\"Oh good! I was hoping he'd get back to them soon!\\"The book could have gone on much longer, although it reasonably followed the course of one summer season, with all its diverse components. It certainly did not outstay its welcome. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to immerse themselves in a small-town story, with the caveat that there are some sexual storylines that would be offensive to some. If you can read it with an open mind and see it as a story, then this book will make the hours fly by."},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"This book as a series of interwoven stories about the \\"ordinary\\" small town folks, an Indian ex-Seal swimming coach, a female deputy passed over for sheriff, the passive teen and his nympho girlfriend, and the depressed, widower pastor and his teen companion, plus more. The adventures take place over the summer. A great comedic examination of tolerance for others, hypocrisy, the need for love, sex and forgiveness. Great one liners...and then the dark ending. May not be the most satisfying way to end the book. Some of the characterizations may be inconsistent, like Kimberly, who starts out as the smart, ambitious teen, then morphs into the sunbathing bimbo, clueless that some old guy could be oogling her. Overall good read, with sexual situations, so not for everyone."},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"\\"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake\\" by Steve Amick is a pretty good book that is a semi- mystery set in a small town. I liked the way Mr Amick drew a picture of the town and lake with words.I'd like to add I was from Michigan; however this book could have been set in any state. I enjoyed the journey to Michigan and I saw it. I think that this was very enjoyable read, just don't take it serious."},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"I am a little torn on how to review \\"A Lake, a River, and the Other Lake\\". I enjoyed the amount of detail that was given to Northern Michigan; however, I am from Michigan so I understand many of the inside type jokes (like referring to the \\"Mystery Spot\\" in Irish Hills). I think some non-Michiganders will find it charming, but I bet others will think \\"who cares?\\"Next we have the story itself - much I enjoyed, however other parts were disturbing, and in many cases unnecessary. The story is much to profane, and the author doesn't seem to get that sometimes \\"less is more\\". Next we have the characters.... And the fact that most are unlikeable. Every work needs to have flawed characters, but Amick paints characters that are unbelievable in their nonchalance to societal norms.So is \\"A Lake, a River, and the Other Lake\\" flawed? Yes. Did I enjoy it? Yes. While I am a little concerned that non-Michiganders will miss the small town charm - I for one did find the charm. The story was well-paced and maintained my interest throughout.3 stars"},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"The Lake the River and the Other Lake is a relatively strong first novel that, although it doesn't set you on fire, pulls along its many narrative strands pretty effortlessly and enjoyably. Set in a fictional lake resort in northern Michigan, the novel divides itself into relating several conflicts mostly involving middle-class locals and richer summer folk: Roger Drinkwater, a local native (and 7/8ths Native American) versus the summer jet skiers polluting \\"his\\" lake; a pair of neighbors (one local, one \\"summer\\") involved in a legal dispute over the clearing of some trees; a sixteen-year-old local whose seemingly ideal nympho summer girlfriend turns out perhaps not so ideal; a local deputy passed over for sheriff walking a thin line of insubordination with her outsider boss; an orchard owner trying to come to terms with the love lives of his grown children, each of whom is involved with lovers who are more outsiders than the summer folk; and a recently widowed minister in conflict with himself, a conflict sparked by the near-constant presence of a young teen girl hired to tutor him in computer usage. There are a few other sideline stories but this gives an idea of the ground Amick covers.On the one hand, the ground covered does a nice job of conveying a full sense of place, a sense furthered by Amick's natural dialogue and strong physical detail. On the other hand, there are so many stories that are in some ways so similar that they threaten to bleed one into the other, leaving them a bit flat. At times as well, the stories seem a bit too neatly set up--the local vs. outsider angle repeated again and again; the owner with not one international marrying into the family but two; and so on. And they are all handled in much the same tone, a sort of breezy, cheery voice that carries the reader along utterly smoothly, even in places where the subject matter gets a bit darker. Even though I enjoyed the smooth ride, I found myself wishing now and then for a bit more turbulence, a bit more bite or edge to the tone and narrative. The strongest story involves the minister, partially because it's the most internal, partially because it has the potential for the most darkness, but it never really sharpens its edges on the reader's conscience. The other stories resolve themselves a bit too neatly, a bit too quickly cheerily. Maybe if there had been one or two fewer story lines, some of those could have been dragged out a bit more, conveying more of a sense of a difficult journey toward resolution. One story especially, involving a dot-com millionaire huddled in his newly built palace trying to weather the economic storm battering his finances, seems especially tangential and could easily have been dropped at little loss to the book as a whole.Even if it doesn't quite meet its potential, however, Lake as mentioned is a wholly enjoyable read, with only a few lagging moments, some gentle humor, strong dialogue, and a full set of mostly full-blooded characters interacting in interesting, if not compelling, ways. Recommended though I look forward more to Amick's second novel."},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"This was a great, quick read. Think \\"Tales of the City\\" set in the Mid-West. Very entertaining, likeable characters and great sense of place. Only complaint -- the last chapter was a little too cute, which threw me off. Hopefully, this will be the first in a series. I'm hooked."},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"The town is called Weneshkeen, near Lake Michigan. The \\"big lake\\" is connected by the Oh-John-Ninny-River, known as the Oh-John, to the \\"little lake\\", Lake Meenigeesis. Enter the lives of small town America, the daily trials and reflections of a community close knit by legacy. Include the \\"fudgies\\", what the Weneshkeen local call the summer residents who relentlessly consume the town's local fudge, brauts, and jerky.Roger Drinkwater, a seven-eighths Ojibwe Indian and one-eighth Polish, has lived on Lake Meenigeesis for most of his life. He hates the new technology of, specifically, jet-skis; and wages a private war against the intrusive machines. He's the ex-High-School swim Coach, an ex-Vietnam Vet and Navy SEAL, and sells jerky by the combined Indian-Polish name of \\"Schmatzna-Gaskiwag\\". Janey Struska, the town's local police officer (turned down from being Sheriff in favor of Outsider Jon Hatchert) stands guard over her town and Roger's shenanigans. Janey dreams of being recognized by David Letterman and whisked away to New York where she would write comedy for his show.There's the vonBushberger family, headed by Hubert \\"Von\\" vonBushberger, who owns the cherry orchards and the little roadside fruit stands, engages seasonal migrant workers, and upholds his family traditions religiously. Until his son Jack marries Guatemalan migrant worker Marita, who's expecting his first child; and his daughter Brenda becomes engaged to Miki, a Japanese scientist at the orchards to study the trees and blossoms.Eugene Reecher, the Presbyterian minister who's recently retired after his wife Mary's death, becomes involved for the first time with the internet, starting with innocent email but finding the teen porn sites hard to resist; and comparing them to his young computer tutor Kimberly Lasco. Kimberly's father Kurt is involved with a landscaping dispute with their neighbor Scott Starkey. Scott's son Mark is spending his first summer as a river pilot on the Oh-John, and meets another \\"fudgie\\" Courtney Banes, a hyper, malicious girl who wants him for his services rather than his personality. Lastly there's Noah Yoder, outcast \\"fudgie\\" once-billionaire search engine designer who's washed up at the tender age of twenty-four.Heartwarming, invigorating, breathtaking, and awe-inspiring, 'The Lake, The River, And The Other Lake' is nothing less than a masterpiece. The writing is effortless and efficient, bring the entire town of Weneshkeen straight into your life and your heart. The characters are real people you honestly care about, though some of the scenes you live through with them are absolutely shocking (the poor confused Reverend, who's utterly alone without his lifetime partner and wife, Mary). There's vengefulness and forgiveness, racism and acceptance, harmony and discord; all brought together with phenomenal talent by author Steve Amick.I will mention that there must be a sequel to this book. Though the book is as complete as a summer visit to Weneshkeen, I'd like to spend more time with the residents. I believe you'll find yourself in the same situation, wanting more and more. Steve Amick has, in my opinion, produced a masterpiece with 'The Lake, The River, And The Other Lake', and I'm ready to follow him to the next level. I highly recommend this incredible, homey, interesting venture into small town America.

Amick's characters are sincere and endearing as they suffer the pains of growing and learning in a small Michigan resort town.[...]That's how good this book is."},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"Meet this widely varied cast of townspeople and tourists in Weneshkeen Michigan, fictional resort town on Lake Michigan. Roger Drinkwater, high school swimmming coach, Vietnam Vet and rabid hater of jetskis, determined to foil their attack on his senses each summer. Or Hubert VonBushberger, owner of the VonBushberger cherry farm, having to accept his daughter's relationship with some grad student from Japan. Or the newly widowed pastor of the town's First Presbyterian Church, Eugene Reecher, who spends his summer discovering the darker side of the Internet.These are just a few of the wildly varied characters whose stories weave together throughout a fictional summer in this fictional town. All are navigating through relationships of one kind or the other; old flames, teenage summer romances, making peace with the tourists. This interweaving of the various characters and their wild plotlines pulls the reader along, just to see where this ride is going to end up.The storylines move from tender and sad to crazed with lust, but in the final analysis, they all bring together a common theme of acceptance. The pastor's story in particular seems to bring both ends of the spectrum together, as he seeks friendship with the local girl staying with her dad for the summer who helps him understand his computer, while she seeks refuge from her own confusing life in his company. Rev. Reecher struggles with his darkside from the safety of the Internet, all the while simply wanting nothing more than another human voice to hear. His story arc seems to travel the greatest highs and lows, with a rather strange and unexpected resolution.Anyone who has ever spent time in a funky northwoods resort town will smile in recognition at some of the events or characters Mr. Amick creates. While certainly not high art, I found this book to be a little meatier than the usual \\"beach read.\\""},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"This book was very unique. The storyline was so strange and perplexing that I am not sure what to say. Many unexpected things happened in the small town where this book is set, but in the end, nothing of impact ever actually occurred. It was obvious at the end of the book that the lives of the characters would more or less continue as they had... possibly this is the point the author is trying to convey? In small towns like this one, things happen but nothing every really changes. Overall, I am not able to say that I liked or disliked this book -- it just leaves you with an unsettled feeling of continuity."},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"This is a book that keeps you thinking, even after you've finished reading it. I've been contemplating how I was going to write this review for a couple of days now - trying to figure out how to explain my reaction to a dozen or so dysfunctional characters. So many characters that at times my head was spinning trying to keep them all straight.It took me awhile to get into The Lake, The River and the Other Lake - in fact I didn't know if I could. So many complex characters introduced so quickly. The more I read, the more I got to know them and began understanding and even liking a few of them. About half way into the book, I couldn't put it down.I think it helped that I'm from Michigan and could appreciate the innuendos and subtleties. Who in Michigan doesn't like a great cherry pie or homemade fudge?This isn't a casual read - you have to give it time and attention. Be ready to study each character and keep up with the quickly evolving story lines.Steve Amick is a good storyteller. He's skilled in getting the reader to believe they know the characters as acquaintances or even as friends. He's also a great student of human nature. The author was able to get into the mind of a teenager and a senior citizen with equal psychological skill.The character that stands out for me is Roger Drinkwater and his distain(or should I say hatred) for jet skiers. As the book ends, Drinkwater is no longer bothered by the noise of the jet skiers. He got what he wanted, peace and quiet.I'll recommend this book only if you are willing to make quiet time to sit and read - almost without distraction. To me, it's filled with complex characters and complex storylines - not exactly relaxing reading."},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"The book meshes several stories into one, with the characters blending into each other's lives. Some are quirky, some young, some old. There are laughs, there's tragedy, there are love stories, there's a feeling of 'I understand why they did that'! It's a great book, with a lot of insight in people and how they respond to each other and change because of the interaction.Well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"A good comedy. Living all my life in Michigan and the past twenty a transplant from the big city to a small town the story really clicks. Each page has the idiosyncrasies that abound in a small town. Each person is a work of their own and the difference is you see them everyday. His characters are well positioned and all come together to make this a very good novel portraying small town life perfectly. A good book to read no matter where you may live."},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"Xenophobia in the modern world of summer people.The book has 5 parallel stories:1) Mark and the rich bitch2) Roger, the Polish Indian, and his war on jet skis3) The Reverend and his computer girl4) Von, the cherry orchard guy, and his xenophobic family problems5) the internet millionaire and his lemonade stand.I think maybe the hero of the story is the Indian Roger Drinkwaterwho is an ex-Navy seal demolishions expert.I liked the story and the humor involved.The novel reminds me ofGarrison Keillor and \\"Lake Wobegon Summer 1956\\".Mark Starkey's problem with the rich bad girl Courtneyreminds me of strange experiences with wrong girls.Not every pretty girl has her head on right?The tragedy of Reverend Gene is probably the worse part of the book.We are left wondering if Mark will get together in the future with the fudge store computer girl?"},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"At first glance, this novel seemed exactly the kind of thing I'd like to read. I'm a huge fan of the small-town vibe and the quirky characters, but this drama/sex fest falls sadly short of the Northern Exposure/Gilmore Girls/Mitford/etc standards to be little more than a hit-and-miss with more misses than hits.Which is sad, because this was not a bad idea. Again, I like small towns and quirky characters, and this has both. What's sad is that Amick never did anything amazing or even nice enough with it. To be fair, I loved the story of the jet ski-destroying Veteran and his love affair with the sassy-and-strong deputy. Cute stuff. However, all the other storylines were sadly lacking in enjoyment. Not bad ideas, but Amick was either trying too hard or simply did not have enough creative fodder. So he then decides to make up for it by having every other character have some sort of emotional issue. I'm sorry, but I don't need another \\"One Tree Hill\\" with nymphomaniacs and pediaphiles.So, despite some nice writing and good characters, \\"The Lake, the River, & the Other Lake\\" starts off strong and promising before falling into a puddle of melodrama, pointless and tasteless sexuality, and confusion. I still can't even figure out the ending.Sorry, Amick, it was a good try and a good idea, but this is one small town I have no desire to visit."},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"As a lifelong Michigan resident, I am pleased with the way Steve's book rings true to northwestern lower Michigan, though the terrain he creates could be drawn from several in-coast lakes along the Lake Michigan coast. As a narrative, it is a \\"hoot\\"; the implausibilities are really part of the fun, the politics of the deputy sheriff's position is well-drawn, as is the earthy pathos of the retired minister's discoveries about life. In 36 years of college teaching I could well imagine the aggressive \\"girl fatale\\" and the outcome of her story. Nice work by an author from whom we can expect much in the future."},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"This book included great characterizations, quirky twists and turns and a lot of funny scenes.

I recommend it."},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"This was our monthly book club recommendation since the person thought it would be comical and similar other literary essays.

I read for relaxation, not dirt. I didn't finish this piece of junk"},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"I am a fan of books with lots of interesting characters, and this book delivers in that realm. Steve Amick's smooth style of writing caught me up from the 1st chapter, and whereas this is not really a laugh-out-loud book, I found myself smiling and chuckling at many points as he describes and follows the lives of residents and visitors to the fictional, but believable, town of Weneshkeen, Michigan. I had to get the most attached to the 1st character the reader is introduced to, the rather grumpy, no-nonsense, disgruntled Roger Drinkwater who is part Indian, as this tapped into my own Indian heritage.This book gets deeply into these characters, including descriptions of sexual activity, and lots of profane language, so it's not for the faint of heart. I think the book would have been just as entertaining without so much of this kind of detail, but then, he's writing about \\"real\\" people and real life.I found myself seldom having to go back a few pages (or even a few lines) and re-read because I lost track of a character or situation, so, for this reason, I give the book high marks for just plain readability. I actually had a hard time putting it down, so I will be reading other works by Amick with anticipation."},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"I read first two chapters and this book was going nowhere, very boring and very slow. Don't waste your time one this one."},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"I read this book and found it an okay read. It was mildly entertaining and amusing in places, but left me uncomfortable in others. As noted elsewhere, the end left me flat. It wasn't the best book I've ever read, nor was it the worst.As for the war of reviews taking place here, well, the last I heard, we in this country still have a right to express our opinions, and reviews are just that... opinions. Anyone should have the freedom to express an opinion in this forum without being slandered or called names. As for those reviews that scream BUY THIS BOOK!, they come across as street mountebanks selling hair elixir made from p-ss water mixed with goat's milk."},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"Pros: The introduction of the quirky characters in the first 10 chapters was amusing and well-written.Cons: I found myself increasingly troubled by all the praise the author is receiving for creating a \\"fictional\\" town, when his town is, in fact, a thinly veiled version of Elk Rapids, Michigan. The author's map of his fictional town of Weneshkeen (featured on the cover, no less) is a virtual overlay of the map of Elk Rapids, right down to the names of key streets (US-31, River Street, Bridge Street) and landmarks (water tower, welcome center, Spartan Store, \\"old hall\\", high school -- almost everything but the VFW Hall and the characters' houses).The author then adds a signpost indicating that Weneshkeen is south of Traverse City, when Elk Rapids is north of Traverse City. Why? Is this to throw people off the scent from realizing that he essentially cribbed the entire map of an actual town to use as his \\"fictional\\" town?Granted, this is a character-driven book, not a book driven by the town's layout or names of the streets. (Then again, the very name of the book DOES derive from the natural layout of the town, on a river between two lakes.) Furthermore, I have no problem with the idea of a piece of fiction being based on an actual place or a slightly modified version of such a place -- that happens all the time.But why not just say as much? In interviews, the author has claimed that Weneshkeen is an amalgam of Charlevoix, Elk Rapids, Leland, and some other small cities of Michigan. Why not just state that it's Elk Rapids, with Charlevoix's VFW Hall and drawbridge thrown in?Am I overreacting? Perhaps. But in my eyes to author is accepting a little too much credit for creating something that already existed."},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"Amick seems, throughout this book, to have his characters obssessed with sex. His portrayel of \\"Up North\\" Michigan is certainly not completely accurate - I live in Michigan and have experienced \\"Up North\\" for many years. Really, Mr. Amick, more goes on in small Michigan towns during the summer than just sex!The reader is also left hanging in the end - conclusions of story lines never happen. Perhaps he wants the reader to draw his/her own conclusion, but good writing usually requires an ending."},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"[...]The copyright page of Steve Amick's first novel The Lake, the River and the Other Lake identifies it as identity (psychology), while Publishers Weekly portrays the contents as a sort of Northern Exposure (the popular TV series of the mid-80s) with quirky characters living a soap opera in Weneshkeen, the fictional name given a small town on Lake Michigan's Gold Coast to perhaps protect the inhabitants from the outside world. As a fan of character-driven fiction I had high hopes for this novel; unfortunately I found Amick's novel failed on a number of levels.I found all of the characters fell short of reality, shown as two-dimensional, caricatures that never really evolved. All of the male characters fare poorly, overshadowed by their female counterparts. Courtney, the teen who is obviously the victim of child abuse, in turn inflicts her own special brand of abuse, mercilessly manipulating and humiliating her young suitor, Mark, who seems powerless against his own sexual obsession of the object of his lust. Yet young Mark is a victim for whom little sympathy can be given in the face of his willingness to allow himself to be treated so poorly - in the end it is Courtney who fingers authority and not Mark himself who gives the finger to Courtney, losing her (not that she is a prize worthy of loss) only through circumstances, not by his own strength of character.Brenda Vonbushberger is the voice of reason to her bigoted husband who goes through a Scrooge-like transformation mid-book with little character introspection as to his thought process. The reader is left to accept the catalyst for this change as reason enough, and so much of the drama is missing.Roger Drinkwater, the Ojibwa/Polish local and Viet Nam vet who wages war against the seasonal jet skiers who inhabit the lake on which he lives vandalizes, in increasingly spectacular fashion, the property of others while Janey, his romantic interest and the local law enforcement officer, turns her head even as she fights her own battle against outsider Sheriff Hatchert who, as another male character, is depicted as a \\"jackass.\\"Kimmy, the young sixteen-year-old who tutors Gene, a recently widowed and retired reverend of the local church, on use of the Internet, is nave yet shows more wisdom than her father who, in his fight against his neighbor's lawsuit against him for cutting down a row of trees on his property line to improve his sightline of the lake, suddenly gives up his battle in the face of his own guilt for causing his neighbor's wife's allergic reaction to sausages he placed in her shopping cart at the local grocery. While Gene, the reverend, shows man at his worst. Initially depicted as a man of God who had a happy if somewhat mundane marriage, Gene too quickly becomes addicted to Internet teen porn and, as a result, becomes obsessed with his young tutor, Kimmy, who seems all too eager (or nave) to forgive his transgressions when she discovers that he has become a full-fledged pedophile. I shudder, perhaps in my own naivety, to think that her character is an accurate depiction of our youth today.In short order The Lake touches upon vandalism, bigotry, teen sex and pedophilia. While I understand that, no, life's circumstances don't always end happily ever after, overall, The Lake fails to culminate in any real satisfactory conclusion. Indeed, the epilogue, which seems a half-hearted attempt, perhaps at the publisher's urging, to leave the reader on an upbeat note, only manages to belittle the tragic endings of several characters.The book has its moments, but far too few, and I was left wondering of Amick's intent for writing such a book. A literary Northern Exposure? Hardly, as I found few of the characters likeable or sympathetic. An exploration of the human psyche? Again, no, for he failed to explore deep enough, in the manner of a Philip Roth, the angst behind these character's dark sides, nor show the light. An editorial of our society's decline? If so, where is the message, the warning? If one exists it is far too subtle to be noticed. Simple fiction, mere escapism, a fun summer read? No, for the subject matter is far too deep, far too disturbing, to be treated so lightly."},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"One of the ways many readers judge a good book is by the degree of reluctance we feel in leaving it once the last page has been turned. I felt no reluctance at turning the last page of Amick's first novel, The Lake, The River & The Other Lake. Indeed, I couldn't wait to leave this fictional little Michigan town and all its inhabitants far behind.I recently came across a quote by author Alice Walker: \\"If art doesn't make us better, then what on earth is it for.\\" I do believe art, in any medium, is to bring to our greater awareness and understanding both the light and the shadow side of human nature. Indeed, anything less, anything focusing too heavily on either the light or the dark side, and a story sinks to something maudlin, loses touch with reality, and does little to enlighten us. Balance is key.Amick's novel opens with skillful writing, soon capturing my interest with one, then another promisingly quirky character. I turned the first pages with enthusiasm and a sense of discovery. It didn't take too many pages, however, before my expectations were disappointed. As the long line of characters came on stage, each one seemed darker (if not more depraved) than his predecessor. Light playing with the shadows of the human psyche seemed to fast become increasingly shadows only, with now and then only a wan, stray beam of light, barely enough to keep me reading. Had I not received an invitation to attend an upcoming author's reading for this book, I am quite sure I would have given up without finishing it. How depressing to read about characters who seem to have no redeeming qualities whatsoever, not even enough to give them a believable struggle with their dark side. That Amick's skill as a writer was evident only increased my frustration at potential so unfulfilled.The cast of characters includes: an Ojibwa man, Roger Drinkwater, who blows up jet skis and freaks out their noisy and inconsiderate owners (okay, on occasion, I actually liked this guy) by popping up out of the waves with war paint on his face; a 16-year-old boy, Mark, who, although he is otherwise presented as an appealingly sensitive and thoughtful young man, seems to have nothing but nothing on his mind other than having sex with 17-year-old Courtney and will put up with the most outrageous abuse from the girl; Courtney, who seems to have nothing but nothing on her mind but humiliating and debasing her young suitor in any manner possible, to ever increasing excess, just because she can; an Archie Bunker type bigot without Archie's charm who resents the marital choices of his children from other ethnic backgrounds but makes an unconvincing turnabout later; a 69-year-old minister, newly widowed from a marriage he cherished, suddenly lost in lust for a 16-year-old girl and in the throes of that lust, becoming addicted to Internet porn that focuses on teenage girls and within a two month span becoming a pedophile; a female cop who never quite develops much of a personality other than wanting to write comedy for David Letterman and developing a crush on Roger Drinkwater, and who looks the other way when his destruction of jet skis turns ever more explosive; and too many others. It was difficult at times to keep track of who is who, as the chapters often have little or no connection.In general, the cast of characters all remained two-dimensional to me. They failed to involve me in their lives, failed to win my compassion, failed to make me believe they could be real. They remained caricatures rather than characters with counterparts in reality. Amick invites us to look through a peephole, offering a peephole-size insight into the scene before us, hints at what may or may not lie underneath, and moves on again to another character. The result is shock value with graphic descriptions and perverse scenarios with no real purpose other than, well, shock value. [...] He skims across surfaces, something of a jet ski that makes noise, rattling what lies beneath, but never submerging to find the treasure buried below.My greatest value in reading this first novel was in the discussion it brought about with various writer friends about what it is that we seek in our fictional characters to infuse them with life and what it is that makes a book memorable. This first novel falls into the examples of writing that achieves neither. A chance to address and explore important themes with meaning was lost in these pages, remaining only at the level of sensationalism."},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"From the moment this book crossed my desk at the library where I work, I couldn't put it down. That's not to say it's heavy on plot. It's the characters that keep you reading and I'm always a sucker for interesting character development. My favorite person in the book is definitely Roger Drinkwater, a Native American/Vietnam Vet/swim coach/beef jerky maker who has a bit of a problem with jet skis. It was nice to live through him vicariously as he carried out his vendetta in some explosive ways.As you read the book (and you should definitely pick up a copy), get yourself some fudge and surf over to www.steve-amick.com where you can listen to the soundtrack for this book, the Weneshkeen Jukebox.It's a great summer read. I hate saying this about a book, but I wish there was a sequel or a TV series made out of this one. I miss the characters already."},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"Steve Amick is a wonderful writer and his book deserves a world of readers. He juggles many stories here; in that sense, this is an old-fashioned book, filled with subplots, minor characters, and the kind of tales you might hear on front porches in summer. All the people here feel alive, and his teenagers, in particular, are well-drawn: funny, sad, and filled with the sort of longing that never goes away.\\"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake\\" is fun to read, breezy and dense with one-liners worth remembering, and the twin triumphs of this novel are the voice, and the multi-layered plot. It moves quickly, and Mr. Amick obviously cares about these people, all of them, with all their quirks and tiny triumphs and struggles.It's the best book I've read in a long, long time."},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"When this book arrived, I was so enthused I put it at the top of my reading stack (which is enormous). When I began reading, I was immediately pulled into the story and fell in love with the writing. I'm from the Midwest and have spent some time in Michigan and was really enjoying the way the author pulled in stories of the Native American, the local residents, the summer visitors and the fun reference to the tourists as \\"fudgies\\". The writing is great and I really thought I had stumbled across a wonderful read and was having a hard time putting the book down.Then, I reached the 2/3 mark in the book and my feelings drastically changed. Anyone who thought they were getting a gentle, Mitford series book knew early on that that wasn't going to be how this one worked out which is just fine. I was assuming it would have more of an edge and some crude references along the lines of Garrison Keillor (who seemes fascinated with the thoughts of 12-year-old boys regarding body parts), but this book came as a shock. While there had been some very graphic sex scenes in the book early on that I didn't particularly care for it crossed the line into repulsive at this point. If I took direct quotes from the book, I doubt Amazon would allow this review to be published without removing the quotes. Very, very graphic descriptions of internet pornography pictures/sites are covered in minute detail. A 60 + year old minister toys with pedophelia and his thoughts and actions leave nothing to your imagination. It only gets worse from there with one final scene that almost made my physically ill. Nothing humorous here, just dark and repulsive. I have a difficult time with this book being labeled for high school age kids. I sure wouldn't want my 14-year-old daughter reading this ! I'm sure there are folks out there who will jump on me for being a prude, but I just don't care for feeling like I was ambushed. If I would have had any hint of what was to come, I just would have not read the book.It was very unfortunate the way the book unfolded since this is the last book I will read by this author and 3/4 of the book was wonderful."},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"Steve Amick, The Lake, The River & the Other Lake (Pantheon, 2005)reviewed by A. J. GretzSteve Amick's first novel is a reflection of the characters contained within - unusual, thoughtful, and, though flawed, incredibly likeable. The Lake, The River & the Other Lake is the story of one summer in a tiny Northern-Michigan town, and the all-too familiar sense of connection among its various inhabitants. The book revolves around a dozen or so characters that Amick manages to flesh out nicely, creating memorable and surprisingly deep moments of wit and retrospect. This is all the more impressive since many of their surface-level quirks - be it a nervous young billionaire, disgruntled Indian or nymphomaniac teenager - seem so potentially one-dimensional. However, as the novel progresses they each come alive in the classically Midwestern struggle to overcome the confines of a small-town identity, while still \\"doing the right thing.\\"Amick manages to effectively capture the laid back, disposable feeling of summer with his understated writing style. The writing is warm and rich with detail without becoming overbearing, making Weneshkeen an easy read with wide appeal. However, the prose is consistently impressive, as Amick seems to have a knack for making the small details count. The opening is particularly memorable, as Amick writes \\"there was a heavenly time, a sliver-thin window of peace that Roger Drinkwater cherished ever year on Meenigeesis - those early days when the water warmed just enough for him to bear but all others steered clear and he could swim in peace and hear nothing but the water and his breath and the birds and the distant road: the way it had once been on this lake.\\" Anyone who has ever spent time in one of Northern Michigan's tourist trap like Mackinaw City will be able to smell the mix of suntan lotion, boat exhaust, and fried food right away.The heart of the book lies in the relationship between Kimberly Lasco, a teenager, and the retired preacher Gene Reecher she befriends over the summer. Of all the characters that populate the fictional community of Weneshkeen, he proves to be one of the most challenging and engaging. He is a man with a good heart who, overwhelmed by the loss of his wife, fights a losing battle to keep from losing all sense of himself. Although these two characters are more isolated than the others in the novel, it gives the narrative space to breathe, and their interactions feel the most evenly paced of any in the book, despite Reecher's uncomfortable feelings for Lasco. At one point, the old man awakens from a dream about the young girl, saying \\"it was a warm, languid dream, bright with sunlight. It was something out in back of the house. The chaise lounges, the nutty liquid of the iced coffee. And skin - yes.\\" Amick's writing is at once poetic and disturbing, an unflinching look at the darkness present in the human condition.The plot-line involving Mark the pilot boy and his \\"girlfriend\\" is also worth mentioning here. One can't help but watch the train wreck crafted by Amick, as their relationship goes frighteningly beyond the normal awkwardness of teenage romance. His teenage voice is, thankfully, painless to read. This is partly because of his skill as a writer, and partly because every character has a difficult time distinguishing him/herself from Amick's naturally dry tone.Although this is a very solid effort for a first novel, the landscape of The Lake, The River & the Other Lake is mostly subplots and character explorations, and the author has a difficult time juggling all of his loose ends at once. Other than Reecher and Roger Drinkwater - think Native Companion with a vendetta against Jet-Ski's - most of the adults in town are distracting. As the book progresses, it becomes more and more difficult to keep tabs on who is doing what, and several characters seem to simply disappear in the final 30-40 pages. Although it is interesting to watch each person progress over the summer, the book would have benefitted from a smaller scope of characters. This would have allowed him to give more attention to the relationships and connections that seemed to matter the most.Still, there is a lot to like about Amick's writing. With an offbeat sense of humor and a sharp eye for detail, he offers a unique and unabashedly small town voice for the overlooked Midwesterner in all of us.___A. J.

Some of the characters include a Native American who is 1/8th Polish, a retired reverend who is a recent widower, a down on his profits, rich inventor of a (Googleish) search engine, a fruit farm owner who is perplexed that his kids are finding foreign spouses, and several teenagers.

But there is something about this book that got under my skin and I still am thinking about Amick's characters weeks later.

Bravo."},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"I found this book very hard to read at the beginning, in part due to the sheer number of characters and plot development there was to absorb. Once the main characters and overall scene had been established, I couldn't put this richly written and developed book down. I admit, at times, there were a lot of people, places, events and subplots to keep track of, but each chapter left me hungry for more.The characters are deeply human, some sad, some pathetic, some wise beyond their years. The character of Reecher the preacher explores the addictive nature of Internet porn and accurately portrays not only our cultures fascination with sex, but with the immediate gratification our society seems obsessed with. Reecher is a good man, who is lonely and isolated, and stumbles across (as we all have at one time or another) the pervasive world of porn that saturates the world wide web. What starts as a fascination quickly becomes an obsession that manifests in his lust for his young tutor. When reviewed with a human heart, you realize this man is not a pedophile (as he NEVER does anything hands on with his Lolita) he is a human being, a true sinner who allows himself to get wrapped up in a sick obsession that ultimately you come to understand is born of loneliness and a desire to capture some semblance of youth.Amick captures the teenaged voice with such clarity that one cannot help but get enveloped in the teen characters. You watch several different teenagers struggle with issues of class, sexual issues and parental relationships. I dare say that it took me back to a time in my life I'd rather not revisit.While I do believe there was an awful lot going on, which made some of it hard to keep track of, this novel is so well written with characters so well developed, you cannot help but like Amick's work and his wisdom. Furthermore, you can tell time was taken to really interweave the characters and the situations in the book. Amick has a knack for showing that which is completely, utterly and sometimes very sadly human.I look forward to his next literary triumph."},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"Overall, this was an entertaining book. I liked that there were many characters who were not immediately related to each other, but whose stories were all connected somehow. I also was impressed with Amick's ability to write convincingly from a female perspective. The only gripe I have with the book is that the whole preacher-with-a-porn-problem is a bit cliche for me. I know it is a relevant scenario, but I am bored with the topic. On the other hand, the preacher character did have some interesting insights to offer toward the end. Ultimately, I recommend reading this book, and I look forward to reading other books by this author."},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"This book was a really enjoyable read. It's filled with interesting characters that you find yourself very interested in as the summer goes on in the book. There are several storylines at once that follow various summerfolk or townspeople as they interact with each other and you see that interaction from everyone's point of view. Anyone who has a summer place will be able to completely related to the cast of characters here, especially the townies trying to act like they are summerpeople and the summerpeople trying to act like townies and what everyone thinks of this 3-month class system that sets up every year. Even, the town itself has it's weird points like a radioactive lighthouse and it's places you'd know like the fudge shop. It's a whole other character in itself.Reading this book is really is like being a nosy neighbor for a summer and you get to stick your nose into everyone's business without getting into trouble. If you like getting the dirt on everyone and especially if you have a summer place of your own or live in a town where the summerpeople flock in once a year you'll enjoy this book.On a tangent: if you have daughters of your own, you'll be praying that they don't turn out like one of the characters in this book. Yikes."},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"but it is beyond me. It just didn't flow and make sense to me. Maybe I am missing something here but there was no story line, it skipped from one thing to something else and just never fit together. Not my cup of tea, and I failed to read anything remotely \\"funny\\" or \\"moving\\" about it."},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"Steve Amick nails the quirks of northern Michigan culture in this book. I was a minor fudgie growing up, and can identify with some of the characters in the book.The author weaves an enjoyable tale of multiple individual story lines, most of which are only slightly connected. Yes, everybody really does have a story in this small town. Amick dodges some of the obvious temptations here and throws in multiple surprises.The book moves along well, never really getting fast paced until close to the end. It's the perfect casual read, pick up a copy and take it with you on your next vacation."},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"As I read this book, I could not help but think of Carl Hiaasen's excellent novels about crazy tourists and locals in the Florida he loves. Unfortunately, Steve Amick's Michigan-based version, while enjoyable to read and quite humorous at times, does not quite measure up.My primary critique is that the vast majority of the characters, even the ones I think I am supposed to like, are simply not likeable. Further, while Amick paints an illustrative picture of this small resort town overrun with rich summer visitors, the sheer number of characters clutters the novel with unrelated plotlines.I would recommend this book for someone who wants a little light reading during vacation."},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"I really expected to like this book and to some extent I did. The first two chapters were incredibly boring but then I started to really like it when Amick introduced the vonBushbergers. I found certain story lines were wonderfully written but he had too many going on (??? eight or so ???). Some of the characters were wonderful (vonBushbergers, Kimmy, Struska).I think the storyline with Kimmy and the pastor was actually very touching at the beginning and I think it would have been interesting if the pastor perhaps struggled with seeing the online pornography but resisted it and showed readers a way to get past those temptations. Instead the author chose to get incredibly graphic and disgusting (not sure if this was for shock value or what?) but at that point I really didn't want to read it anymore. I had similar feelings with the sexual escapades between Mark and Courtney - revolting really.The breakdown:4 Stars - Amick's potential writing ability3 Stars - for a few of the story lines1 Star - for the other story lines1 Star - for over-the-top sexual contentThe bottom line:I would not recommend it"},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"I sincerely tried to enjoy and finish this book. Unfortunately, it could not hold my interest beyond the attempt to create a cohesive link between characters. Surely, someone might find the connection between characters intriguing, the locations within the great lakes a connection from the past worthy of a good read, but for me, this book was less than worth the time spent reading it.If you are familiar with the area, the special connotations of regional jobs and seasonal experiences, then this book is worthy of your time. As a NW Washington resident, I found this book to be a bore."},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"I have to agree with another reviewer who was somewhat stunned by the turn of events in this book. It starts out as a character study of these small town residents and it's interesting to see how they all intertwine. The locals vs. the summer people vs. the tourists. Then the retired reverend's fall from grace is graphically spelled out for us, several times. As I was reading, I kept thinking, \\"No, no, I don't need to know all this!\\" His rationale for his behavior seems way off base for a \\"man of God\\". If that entire storyline was nixed, the book would have been far better."},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"I was excited when I ordered this book. I was anxious to get into a book filled with quaint and quirky characters. It may be that my tastes have changed. I really tried several times to get into this book and it simply did not hold my interest.This book has very tiny print and made reading uncomfortable. The author writes some of the longest sentences in history (Opening Chap. 6, a sentence with 43 words! Another had 55 words--add a period already!), and very long paragraphs which makes reading tedious. Why is it when we did these things in college English classes, we were told it's a no-no yet published authors often break those same rules?I'm glad so many enjoyed it, and I wish the author success, but it was not something I enjoyed. For me, reading it was a chore."},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake by Steve AmuckAt the outset of this novel, set among Michigan's Gold Coast, you get the feeling that this is going to be just another \\"Townie\\" vs. Year round\\" novel. One with perhaps, some extra quirks along the way. But with a little more reading you find that you are getting so much more. You're getting petty sabotage, pedophilia, bigotry, inter-net porn addiction, and teenaged extreme sex. Of course you also get a surprise visit with David Letterman and fudge.... a lot of fudge or more precisely \\"Fudgies\\" a cute name cooked up to describe the out of town folks and a running gag through out the entire novel. A very, very long running gag.Thankfully; and against my better judgment I forced myself to keep reading this book after slogging through the first half, because I promise you it gets better. Each and every person who has committed some act that is contrary to what we would expect to see in what I had thought was going to be a pleasant light read, gets there comeuppance. Moral lessons are in some very harsh ways, and a few non-traditional happy endings are to be had.Very dark writing with some clich&eacute;d secondary characters meant to be comedic but which seem to fall just a tad flat in my opinion. A generous helping of dark comedy is sprinkled throughout this book and thank goodness for that, or you may want to run screaming into the night."},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"I read with interest, in part because [full disclosure time] I have met Steve and found his recount of anecdotes both entertaining and insightful. How much more interesting to experience what he does by putting an account down on paper.Worth the read. Kept me going until late in the night until I fell asleep for exhaustion. If I never lived in small towns I'd have found the pace difficult to accept. But I have, and recognize that supposedly sleepy bergs can have a whole lot going on without outsiders [the \\"summer people\\"] ever realizing it. Moreover, the summer people not having a clue about the sophistication of small town residents, for that matter.Well executed. I particularly enjoyed how he incorporated real life tales that actually happened into the body of the tale. One pivotal scenario played out in the novel I got to watch in real time. No telling which one."},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"After reading the first few chapters of the book, it really didn't interest me that much, just seemed more like it dragged on. However, once I got into the book a little, I actually started to enjoy it a lot. Once the started to introduce more and more character, I became more curious as to how each of their lives would unfold and how they interact with each other.The book has its laughable parts which includes the incidents between the jet skis and Roger Drinkwater. As previously mentioned by another reviewer, this book is not for everyone. Either you like it or you don't. I do have to admit, this book is not for children because of the very explicit sexual descriptions. What would you expect from an author who writes for Playboy?I gave this book four stars out of five because I really did enjoy the book, but I feel that if the sexual references were omitted, this book could have been enjoyed by even those in High School."},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"Steve Amick has written a very readable and engrossing first novel. A great array of interesting north Michigan characters who mirror the types and traits that most American readers will be familiar with. The interaction of major characters and their various psychologies are handled with skill and sensitivity on Amick's part, and I found myself looking forward each day to reading a chapter or two. Much better read than Empire Falls! The novel's energy is a plus--in fact I'm inclined to apply the same characterization to Amick that was once applied to the Phillies' reliever Mitch Williams: Steve Amick writes as if his hair was on fire!"},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"Great novel.

Can be dark at times but worth the read! I'll read it again for sure."},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"I'm a sucker for the novels composed of linked stories that have been so en vogue of late (Olive Kitteridge, The Imperfectionists, A Visit From the Goon Squad), not to mention award-winning. But novelist Steve Amick beat them to the punch with this charming 2006 debut. The midwestern setting might as well be the dark side of the moon, as familiar as it is to me, but these characters with their struggles and foibles are sure to win you over. A delightful summer read!"},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"I didn't realize that this book would be so heavily focused on the native american population in the midwest. It was really interesting for me to learn a little bit more about this culture than what I experience at the Four Winds Casino in New Buffalo ;) We vacation in Michigan and I was hoping this would focus a little more on that summer fun, but it was a rather serious book. Overall, it was enjoyable but not the midwest focused \\"beach read\\" that I was hoping for."},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"Anyone who has vacationed on a lake or who has even wanted to vacation on a lake can live vicariously through the characters in Steve Amicks charming novel set along Michigan's \\"Gold Coast\\" where during the summer locals mix with everyone from wealthy summer-only residents to migrant workers. Anyone who has vacationed in a tranquil setting only to be disturbed by the loud whine of jet skis will certainly relate to the lifelong resident who sees them as damaging the setting of his beloved home. In some ways resembling Garrison Keillor's Lake Wobegon, this book will appeal to both young and old who like reading of eccentric characters who will resonate in the reader long after the last page is turned. This is definitely a great summertime read, a cut above the usual \\"beach read\\". Take it with you on your next lake vacation, you won't be sorry."},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"If you want a quick read and enjoy social interactions between different cultures in a rural, small-town setting in the US, grab this book. Some of it you can't help but read with a horrible fascination, wondering how the characters will crash together next. Some of the story's definitely warm and fuzzy, including how a few characters grow dynamically. Although developing characters may be considered retro now, I enjoy reading stories where you watch the characters learn from their mistakes. It's often less frustrating that way."},{"Title":"The Lake, the River & the Other Lake: A Novel","review":"Roger Drinkwater, part Ojibwe Indian and part Polish, has lived in Weneshkeen his whole life. He returned there after serving in Vietnam, and he has settled into a life of selling his homemade beef jerky and teaching swimming at the local schools.Oh, and he hates outsiders. Those outsiders who swoop in at the beginning of the summer season and spend the warm months disturbing his swimming and his sanity with their loud, buzzing jet skis. His covert operation to defeat these outsiders and end the noise pollution winds throughout the book and throughout all the little stories and inside glimpses of many of the locals and summer people (fudgies).Janey Struska is the local deputy - she was passed over for Sheriff despite \\"being from here\\" and despite having the favor of the locals. She's funny and spirited and dreams of wowing David Letterman with her quick comic wit. Reverend Eugene Reecher, elderly and alone with his grief for his beloved wife Mary, is biding his empty time now that he no longer presides over his flock every Sunday. He meets Kimmy, a lonely summer teen who works at the fudge shop while visiting her father who is in a court battle with his fudgie neighbor. They forge an odd but sweet friendship, and Kimmy teaches Eugene how to use the new fangled computer his distant, adult children forced upon him. Unfortunately, the computer brings the dear Reverend to temptations he had never before considered. Mark Starkey is another fudgie teen whose father lands him a dream job as a pilot boy and hates that he has to waste his summer months in such a crappy place until he is seduced by the breathtaking Courtney Banes, another visiting teen with a suspect past, a wealthy daddy, and a confusing definition of intimacy. And there are the vonBushbergers, a local family known for their fruit orchards. The vonBushberger patriarch has everything figured out until his adult children choose spouses that are way outside his idea of proper family.These are just some of the characters and conflicts in Amick's novel. He allows each character to tell his or her story, and the chapters alternate with differing points of view. The reader is granted a more intimate look into each of these lives. This is a great character study.I thought this was a charming book. It's very quirky with a good deal of humor, touching observations, and a dose of the dark side thrown in for balance. This isn't an overly sentimental book, and although it starts out as a light, beach read, it evolves into something much more complex. I took a chance on the book because I live in southeastern Michigan and thought it would be fun to read a quirky novel about the tourist areas in my state. This book transcends \\"fun\\" and \\"quirky\\" and delves into some of those challenges that we each end up facing sooner or later. Good stuff and I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Abducted Bride (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"In a case of mistaken identity, Amy Cole is drugged & abducted by Sir Jason Archer, who believes she's his errant wife Desiree. He chalks up the changes in her, and her insistence that she's not who he thinks she is to the fact that in the short time they were together, his wife changed dramatically, culminating in her running off with another man. He thinks it's just more of her scheming, though he's puzzled about what she thinks to gain.Amy plays along until she can escape, and in the time together, they fall in love.The good:The characters. Jason in particular was understandable and his emotions were well explained. While I got frustrated with him not believing Amy, I never thought he was an idiot not to. Amy was smart, and I enjoyed her logical attempts to make Jason see reason, as opposed to the more usual full-steam-ahead emotionally driven blundering of other romance heroines.The twists. When things are wrapped up in the end, there are some clever surprises. And there were a couple of places where the story didn't go where I expected it to, for which I'm grateful.The bad:There were times I thought Amy was just a little too accepting of the situation, and she was too quick to forgive in the end. It was a side effect of her logical nature, but I wanted to see a little more anger from her.And there's a thread of her brother spying in France that didn't quite go anywhere. Of course, part of that could be that it's such a short book.The verdict:A fun, entertaining read with some nice surprises."},{"Title":"The Abducted Bride (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"Short romances of this sort are successful when they utilize their length effectively. The Abducted Bride fails because it does not do this. I realize that the side characters provide the circumstances for the story but they aren't interesting and their inclusion feels very contrived. Desiree, Robert, and a whole host of minor characters do not play an incredibly important role or contribute very much at all yet the author feels the need to throw them all in. There are many moments where Amy and Jason just reflect on their situation or he tests her that could have been cut. Things that set up the plot, like how Jason gets a hold of Amy, who he thinks is his wife, are contrived and waste time. Also, when characters are introduced or a scene begins the author wastes time with the mystery of who the person is, which works once or twice but after a while feels repetitive and a bit irritating.My main problem is that the story needs to be more heavily weighted in the middle and the end. There is a lot of discussion of fabric and time spent apart but what the reader needs is to see Jason and Amy together so we can believably see them as a couple at the end. She is beautiful. He is handsome. She likes how he sings. He likes that she is good with children and people. This isn't really enough to build a relationship that grows to such a depth of love when they are constantly being pulled back out love by Jason's negative feelings toward his wife that carry over to Amy and Amy's determination to keep from falling for a married man and frustration and hurt at some of his more callous behaviors.There are a few nice moments, but all in all I think the story could have used more development. The moments when they start to fall for each other, kiss, or display some tension or sweetness are nice but the story doesn't feel like it earns it. Everything is wrapped up ridiculously quickly at the end and the conclusion is not satisfying because of this.Nevertheless, the story is a nice, light read. If you have the time and nothing else on your bookshelf, you could do worse than sit with this book for an hour or two."},{"Title":"The Abducted Bride (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"As of April 9th, 2012 this book has not been received, but has been paid for.

This book is a must just for this. My daughter and I (she is 6) go over each picture in detail and talk about them. Regarding the story, it's simple but imaginative. It is suited for a younger audience. One shouldn't forget that the subtitle is \\"The Power of Gratitude\\". It gets this message across."},{"Title":"Andy and the Lion","review":"Having lambasted, decimated, and torn to shreds James Daugherty's remarkably racist, &quot;Daniel Boone&quot;, it seemed only fair that I read a book of his that did not hinge on either white supremacy or genocide. &quot;Andy and the Lion&quot; seemed a good guess and after I read it I found I didn't just tolerate it... I didn't just like it... Heck I LOVED this book. What a great story! What superb illustrations and well phrased narrative. What an excellent excellent picture book... one that all children should read and remember for as long as they have brains to do so. Mr. Daugherty has not just reinterpreted the tale, &quot;Androclus and the Lion&quot;, he has put his mark on it and made it his very own.One day a bright young barefooted lad named Andy decided to patronize his local lending library. Inside he got out a book on lions and proceeded to read it through his meals and well into the evening. After his grandfather told him some wild tales of hunting lions in the wild, Andy went to bed and dreamed of the large yellow beasts. Upon waking he clearly had lions on his mind, but he goes to school as per usual. On the way there he stumbles across an honest to goodness lion of his own and finds that the poor thing has a nasty thorn caught in its paw. After removing the offending article (the book, ever covering its bases, informs us that, &quot;Andy always carried his pliers in the back pocket of his overalls&quot;) the lion is grateful and the two part ways. Not long thereafter, the circus comes to town. Andy goes to watch the fun but when a lion escapes from his high steel cage and makes for the boy, Andy thinks he's done for. Surprise! It turns out that the lion is the same one Andy helped. The two are joyfully reconciled, the people cheer, Andy gets his own parade, and in the end the two friends go back to the library to return the book.First of all, I want to thank the author for clearing something up for me. In his dedication, Mr. Daugherty thanks the two lions that sit in front of the New York Public Library. Uneducated me, I didn't know they were named Lady Astor and Lord Lenox, respectively. Just goes to show the benefits of reading older picture books, I guess. Now this book's a pip, no question. I challenge you to locate a single youngster that won't be enthralled by either Andy's lackadaisical lifestyle or his numerous encounters with the king of the jungle. The story reads with an easygoing vernacular that's difficult to resist. Heck, the first line in the story is, &quot;It was a bright day with just enough wind to float a flag&quot;. How can you not enjoy that? Daugherty has cleverly melded elements of this tale with the original fable on which it is based. What he doesn't care to say in the text, he shows in his delightful illustrations. For example, having read just the words of this tale, your average child reader might wonder how the lion met Andy in the first place. Daugherty has already covered his bases on that one. Earlier in the tale, as Andy reads of lions' lives in front of a fire, his father glances at a paper whose headline reads, &quot;Lion Escapes Circus&quot;. The pictures in this tale are filled to the brim with action and movement as well. There's a great moment when the thorn stuck in the lion's paw comes free and both Andy and the feline are sent cartwheeling backwards, legs askew and manes tousled. Admittedly, there's not much in the way of color in this tale. But heck, there's not much in the way of color in &quot;Make Way for Ducklings&quot; either. I hardly think it hurts the book a jot.This being the author that introduced the world to one of the most outrageously racist Newbery award winners, and being that the publication date on this puppy is 1938 (not the best year for tolerance), you might be wondering if there are any notable racial stereotypes marring an otherwise favorable text. Well, ladies and gents, I in this entire tale there is only a single picture of someone of color. In the scene where Andy protects the escaped lion from the now angry townspeople there's a brief image of a black fellow jogging away from the lion. It's innocuous and hardly worth a mumble of outrage. Obviously it would have been nice if this story had included one or two positive minority figures, but you take what you can get sometimes.So I've been won over to a James Daugherty book, in the end. Weaving a tight and lovable story of a boy, his dog, and his lion, I wish I could say that &quot;Andy and the Lion&quot; is well known today. It's not, and more's the pity. This is just a fabulous tale that deserves loving attention by scads of bright intelligent people. As it is, I insist that you go out and locate a copy for yourself immediately if not sooner. You won't regret it.. and even if you do you'll have to tip your hat a little to its good spirited whimsy."},{"Title":"Andy and the Lion","review":"With simple text and large illustrations, James Daugherty tells about Andy, a farm boy who loves to read (especially about lions!). On the way to school one day, Andy meets a real lion who just happens to have a thorn in his paw. Clever Andy takes the thorn out with his handy pliers and makes a friend of the lion. Weeks later when the circus comes to town, a wild lion escapes from the ring. All the people in the audience run for their lives but, of course, it's Andy's own lion friend, and Andy saves the day.This charming tale is delightful in its fantasy; most 6-9 year olds never quite understand that the lion is in Andy's imagination.

I read it to my three year old cousin and, though she always sits and listens to stories, she got very fidgety and impatient.

The examples are clear and they don't expect you to already know medical terminology. The vocabulary is clearly explained. There could have been more practice math problems, though. However, be aware that it is not a comprehensive textbook. You'll also need to purchase the textbook that goes with it, The Pharmacy Technician by Shrewabury, Medina, Cordiale et al.

I read the text book cover to cover and I've been casually quizzing myself with this book.I agree with another one of the reviewers: Unless you have a textbook to go along with this book, it can be hard to use. I would HIGHLY recommend getting BOTH!! The workbook does not really explain any of the answers, which can make it hard to grasp a concept if you don't have something more detailed to refer to. Sometimes, I'll miss a question in the workbook and REALLY have to dig for it in the text book. It would be nice if, in the answer key, they could either include explanations or at least tell you where to look.The layout of the book is simple & helpful. Each chapter is basically a detailed vocabulary list. At the end of each chapter, there are fill-in-the-blank questions, multiple choice, true/false, and open-ended questions to check understanding. The questions are challenging and will prepare you well, but again, GET THE TEXTBOOK WITH IT. Great book for reviewing, though. It also has a handy list in the back of the top 200 drugs that makes for easy index card making.(If you're looking for a good math study book, APhA's Complete Math Review for the Pharmacy Technician is REALLY good! Really prepares you well for the math part. I took the practice test in the Workbook & Cert. Review and got EVERY SINGLE math question right.)No matter which books you get, you need to put in the time or none of them will help! If you haven't taken any courses, I'd recommend at LEAST 2 months (2-3 hrs/day) with the books I mentioned."},{"Title":"Pharmacy Technician Workbook and Certification Review","review":"It is a good practice book for problem solving n stuff. Would recommend using it, instead of going to some expensive classes, given that you are willing to put your own effort in learning, otherwise go ahead and spend a lot of money for certification classes (which is not really worth the money)."},{"Title":"Pharmacy Technician Workbook and Certification Review","review":"I studied for my PTCB national certification exam using this workbook and the textbook \\"The Pharmacy Technician, 3rd ed\\" by Morton Publishing. Although the textbook was helpful, this workbook offered many additional study problems that complemented the textbook. The workbook offers a variety of problems, presented in a slew of different ways so you can verify your understanding of the various subjects. Types of different questions include true/false, fill in the blank, matching problems, mathematical conversion exercises and more.I think if you purchased just the workbook, some of the concepts might be confusing if you'd never been exposed to them before. However, as a supplement to the textbook, it is very effective. These books definitely helped me pass my exam on the first try and I highly recommend this workbook."},{"Title":"Pharmacy Technician Workbook and Certification Review","review":"This book would probably be a good review IF and only IF you have a hard text that goes along with it or you have attended a school for pharm tech for 2 yrs. This is a workbook ONLY and it doesn't explain the answers and some of the questions involve things that is I have never heard of and there was no way to figure it out without another source to go to. So IF you buy this book, make sure that you have the text book that goes along with it (and I don't know what that is) because if you are studying pharm tech on your own and you haven't gone to school for this, you will be disappointed because it is not a teaching book for review."},{"Title":"Pharmacy Technician Workbook and Certification Review","review":"The book is an excellent guide to obtaining a CPhT, it really does review all the pharmacy technician work and is repetitive enough to be informational but not repetitive enough to be annoying.

I truly enjoyed the read. The author's impressions of chilhood race relations reminded me of my childhood. I was white, going to a very ethnically diverse Elementary school where the students were aware the we shared different skin colors, but never placed any value, positive or negative on it. Of course, with sosciety's imfluence, those days of innocence did not last."},{"Title":"The Bodysnatchers (Doctor Who Series)","review":"The characters in the story The Bodysnatchers are well crafted for the most part. The Doctor is portrayed as a concerned yet offbeat protagonist who tries to solve a problem without violent means. Sam is shown in the novel to be a brave teen since she shows very little fear when she comes face to face with the Zygons. Prof. Litefoot is an old man who is curious and loves a good adventure but finds himself having more questions than answers regarding the Doctor and the Zygons. Emmeline and Nathaniel Seers are clueless as to what is going on and know nothing of their enemies. They are poorly fleshed out but their role in the story is minimal at best. Jack Howe is shown to be a greedy, violent, and ignorant man while his companion Albert is weak willed and only cares what Jack will do to him if he doesn't obey. Balaak is shown to be a one minded leader who has no respect nor patience for anyone or anything but Tuval is his foil in that he does have a degree of patience and does respect the Doctor and Sam by listening to them and not harming them. The viewpoint in The Bodysnatchers does serve the story well but it would have been more interesting if some of the scenes were presented through a Zygon viewpoint than always through the Doctor, Sam, or Litefoot. The structure of The Bodysnatchers does serve the story well but the only portion that should have been eliminated is when the Doctor escapes the Zygon ship only to re-infiltrate it by using scuba gear. This scene in the story could have been rewritten and revised better. The tension in The Bodysnatchers keeps it moving from one page to the next but this was not the case in the chapters before the Doctor discovered it was the Zygons behind the abductions. The setting of 1894 London did serve the novel well. The author does describe perfectly what city life was like during that time era and numerous detail is given. For example, filthy cobblestone roads, toothless women, and drunkards. Also, the detail of how dirty the Thames River was and the sewage floating in it also added to the feeling of evil that the reader is supposed to infer. There is no theme to the Bodysnatchers but the Doctor discovers that even the best intentions can lead to disaster. When the Doctor finds out what he accidentally did to the Zygon crew he experiences and demonstrates his own vulneribility and anger to Sam who is surprised by what she sees. The style of the Bodysnatchers does work for and against it. The description of the Zygons and the dialogue do work for the story but the scenes with excessive gore, such as the Zygon version of Nathaniel Seers dismembering bodies and Jack Howe smashing a shot glass into the face of a taunting bystander, were unnecessary and Morris seemed to write those scenes and others like it in the novel just so he could show how gory the novel could be. Morris should take a lesson from Blum and Orman when they wrote Vampire Science. When Blum and Orman wrote a scene when a vampire attacked they did it with excellent description but at the same time they did limit the gore. Morris could have described these gory acts in a more subtle approach as opposed to the direct approach he uses. Morris' description of the Zygons' bodies decomposing was more tasteful and did paint an excellent image in the reader's mind. Morris should have picked another title instead of The Bodysnatchers. Not only is the title overused by other writers and media but the Zygons do very little or no bodysnatching at all. The narration and dialogue in the novel are balanced well. Emmeline's dialogue did seem overly polite and it wouldn't have hurt Morris to let her dialogue be a little impolite now and then."},{"Title":"The Bodysnatchers (Doctor Who Series)","review":"My favourite Eighth Doctor comic strip is \\"Endgame\\" because it is a perfect visual example to what is achieved in \\"The Bodysnatchers\\" - the blending together of past elements to produce a whole new adventure, in this case the Doctor and Sam enlisting the aid of the gentlemanly pathologist George Litefoot (last seen in \\"The Talons of Weng-Chiang\\") to solve the gruesome disappearance of a hapless employee at the bottling factory of the sinister Nathaniel Seers. ...As I said before, a brilliant mix of old characters with new plots. I am glad that this trend has continued in such stories like \\"Genocide\\", \\"Legacy of the Daleks\\" and the two book \\"Interference\\" storyline by Lawrence Miles."},{"Title":"The Bodysnatchers (Doctor Who Series)","review":"This is an excellent book! The Doctor is prefect and so is the setting. One becomes depressed and feels chills when immersed in the dank, murky atmosphere of Victorian London. We're talking fog enshrouded streets, walks along the banks of the dirty Thames, all fodder for the imagination.The return of Professor Litefoot is delightful and the new and improved Zygons terrific. It was wonderful to have the chance to delve into their society and technology. The poison stickers inside their suckered-palms was a nice addition.When the Doctor realizes he has made a horrible mistake it is a chance to see that he can be failable and that he has not basically changed in all of his regenerations. His childlike wonder of discovery and his love of all life no matter what form it takes is a constant.Do yourself a favor and BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"The Bodysnatchers (Doctor Who Series)","review":"I thought this book was just great, it was very readable, and fast paced and as far as the action went, I thought it was as near to classic Doctor Who as we'll see. I didn't notice it being overly gory, it wasn't like it was out of context. When a vicious alien race bent on conquering the planet plops down in the middle of town, wouldn't you expect some bloodshed? I enjoyed the characters, I thought they were reasonably believable."},{"Title":"The Bodysnatchers (Doctor Who Series)","review":"The Bodysnatchers has a lot going for it. The plot is relatively interesting, most of the characters are given a lot of depth, and the Zygons' reappearance is given a lot of build-up. Sadly, detail is also one of the book's problems. It contains a certain amount of gore, which (for most of the book) is reasonably tolerable. Even the scenes of the Zygon/Mr Seers hacking up a corpse with an axe isn't all that bad. But the final chapter takes a sickening turn for the worse. The scenes of the Skarasen ripping through London are bound to make you expect gore, but you'd better expect a LOT. Mark Morris describes all the corpses, and even the scenes of a Skarasen eating a horse. Quite frankly, the book does not need this. Blood and guts aside, the constant hopping from character to character may give them all a descent slice of the action, but it becomes annoying. On the other hand, the character of George Litefoot is wonderfully written and totally interesting - as he was in The Talons Of Weng Chiang. Unfortunately, Jack Howe is totally unlikeable, killing several people and simply maiming others. His death scene somehow made me smile... It is good to see the Eighth Doctor given a touch of humour for once, but Sam seems a little too much like Ace. It's got atmosphere, imagination and depth, but The Bodysnatchers devotes too much time to gore."},{"Title":"The Bodysnatchers (Doctor Who Series)","review":"The third Eighth Doctor BBC book, The Bodysnatchers, has a potentially awesome premise, with a nostalgic look back at one of the best episodes of the program, The Talons of Weng-Chiang. BUT, written by an author from the horror genre, there are many depictions of gore in this book which may not necessarily add to the book. Do you really want to have a vivid description of a guy cutting out another man's tongue, a man having glass rubbed into his eyes, or a prostitute getting her nose broken? Probably not, and therefore this book is not that enjoyable. And then, important parts of the story that could use a better going over are not described that well. For instance, the white coloured Zygons, and the eating machines that are released to carnage the world. You have only a foggy idea what these people or creatures look like. Take my advice, read the book to learn more about Sam and the Doctor, and then move on to Genocide, the fourth book. A forgettable read."},{"Title":"The Bodysnatchers (Doctor Who Series)","review":"This novel is the most gruesome Doctor Who novel I have ever read. It contains some familiar faces: notably George Litefoot and the Zygons. Both are well depicted and a joy to re-discover. The plot was simple enough but not too difficult to follow. This is the third installment in the 8th Doctor series and this book coupled with Vampire Science are my favorite BBC books to date. A &quot;must&quot; read!"},{"Title":"The Bodysnatchers (Doctor Who Series)","review":"Another fun book in the Eighth Doctor series of books. This one is a sequel to two different Tom Baker stories, both &quot;Terror of the Zygons&quot; and &quot;Talons of Wen-Chiang&quot; and really plays on the atmosphere that those old Baker stories have. All the characters are in good form, the monsters are great and things move along at a good brisk pace (even though it does fall apart a tad at the end)."},{"Title":"The Bodysnatchers (Doctor Who Series)","review":"Looking backwards, it's impossible not to compare the BBC line to the former New Adventures line of books, especially with the latter's more emotional and complex stories, as well as a greater desire to experiment. It produced a lot of misses as well as hits, but the hits were as good as anything out there. This far into the BBC line, the score is a bit murkier, with some well told stories that are just that, well told stories without any sense that they're trying to push the envelope and do something new with a thirty year old series. This particular novel is decent and readable but ultimately there's nothing in it to really stick with you after the book is over. The plot is almost \\"column A and column B\\" where the author picks an interesting historical setting (Victorian England) and throws in an alien element that has no place there (the Zygons) and lets the inevitable hilarity ensue. Which would be all well and good if we hadn't seen that setting done before and better (\\"Evil of the Daleks\\" and \\"The Talons of Weng-Chiang\\", the latter referenced extensively here) so it just feels like a retread. All the aspects of the time period are here (factories, men covered in soot, fog, etc) and presented well, Morris has a good feel for the time but can't really overcome a story that feels almost paint by numbers by the end of it. The Zygons have a plan to take over stuff, the Doctor figures it out and sets out to stop them. That's pretty much it, a couple of the Zygons are characterized well (the scientist especially) but also have some weird cultural theories (they have to follow through on a plan even if they realize it's not going to work because they don't want to look bad . . . keep your foreign policy comments to yourself) and I never get the sense that they're a tangible threat, even if they are responsible for some spooky moments. The Doctor deals with them in his fashion and makes a mistake in the process but it seems more like an \\"oops\\" kind of thing, presented to show that he's falliable but nothing much done with it beyond that. He's still written well but I don't think they had a firm grip on his personality then. Sam remains as useless as ever, mostly existing to provide sassy one liners every so often, not having much beyond her other than \\"I am a contrary rebel and I can handle myself\\". Otherewise, it's readable, it's passable but it's certainly not exciting. It reads, like the majority of the BBC books by this point, as an okay episode of the TV series, insteading of using the print medium to tell stories that TV couldn't do (I do like how the copy on the back of the novel says \\"Featuring the Zygons!\\" even though in the book itself it's clearly meant to be a surprise reveal . . . it harkens back to the old days when you'd have a \\"of the Daleks\\" story and their presence would be held off until the first cliffhanger). Again, it's early but they had the New Adventures as a model, by this time we might have had the merely okay \\"Timewyrm: Genesys\\" and \\"Apocalypse\\" novels but we also had the excellent \\"Exodus\\" and \\"Revelation\\". Will we get such books here? Only time will tell."},{"Title":"The Bodysnatchers (Doctor Who Series)","review":"I think this book was great.when I got to the part when the 8th. dr. got poisoned I said &quot;aw man.&quot; but was happy that he was ok.I also felt sorry that he accidentally got rid of the whole Zygon group."},{"Title":"Style and Sense: For the Legal Profession : A Handbook for Court Reporters, Transcribers, Paralegals and Secretaries","review":"Reading Style &amp; Sense is like having a chat with experts who know what they are talking about and how to communicate it.

Some of the words in these lists are a little easy, but that's what helped me remember them even more (It would have been very intimidiating to read a word list in which ALL words were new!).There are many useful practice tests, and quite a few of them are amazingly similar to (but a little harder than) the ones you will find on actual tests.I ended up with a pretty good score in the end: 800M (as before) and 700+V (much better than before!).

This book was a real eye opener for me. It explains how the estrogens naturally found in a woman's body can't be patented, because they are just natural bodily hormones. Therefore, the drug giants who court all the doctors have no financial incentive to tout naturally occurring hormones. Instead, they push the horse estrogens, and other unnatural products, which cause side effects.This book explains how a woman with a good doctor can get a pharmacy to mix a custom-blended natural hormone replacement with few, if any, side effects, because it's what's in your body already.I took this book to my doctor who said of course he'd be happy to prescribe natural hormones as suggested in the book. Had I not brought it up, I, too would have been prescribed that horrible Premarin or Prempro, made from the urine of pregnant [and abused] mares.I've spoken with other women over 45-50 who take the horse estrogen, Premarin [the name comes from PREgnant MARe's urINe], and they were shocked that there was an alternative their doctors had never bothered mentioning.Anyone interested in natural health should buy this must-read, and then discuss with your doctor."},{"Title":"Natural Hormone Replacement For Women Over 45","review":"I had a hysterectomy 5 years ago and have been very sick ever since but was diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Depression and Panic Disorder.

Within one month, I began to notice a difference. I am now feeling wonderful for the first time in years - pre-hysterectomy normal. I am so thrilled that I am telling my story to all that will listen.

Everybody should know the difference and how it can affect their health."},{"Title":"Natural Hormone Replacement For Women Over 45","review":"Uzi Reiss and Elizabeth Vliet provide more thorough discussions of this topic, but Jonathan Wright has written magazine articles for years and offers a concise review of the evidence for bio-identical hormone replacement. Wright focuses on bio-identical hormone replacement, resulting in a briefer discussion, since he spends less time discussing studies of horse estrogens and artificial progestins.Misleading, sensationalized media coverage of large, poorly designed, ethically questionable estrogen replacement studies, including the Womens Health Initiative and Nurses Health Study continues to discourage women from obtaining safe effective natural hormone replacement. These large studies of thousands of women used the same dose of Premarin horse estrogens for study subjects, without regard to symptoms. Doseage was not adjusted for individual study patients. I doubt anyone would volunteer for a thyroid hormone replacement study, if they were informed individual hormone levels would not be measured and everyone would receive the same hormone dose, irregardless of whether they exhibited hypothyroidism symptoms. What is surprising about the large overpublicized Premarin/Progestin studies is that women were willing to submit themselves to these dangerous, poorly designed studies and that the media has succeeded so thoroughly, in misleading the public.Wright provides excellent information on the estrone/estradiol and estriol ratio correlation with cancer. He also explains studies indicating bio-identical progesterone decreases cancer.Wright explains why animal lovers will want horse estrogen (Premarin) removed from the market, when they learn how inhumanely horses are treated to obtain it. Many health insurers prefer dangerous horse estrogens, because they are less expensive to produce and purchase.Physicians treat individual patients, not study groups. When safe bioidentical hormone replacement dose is adjusted to the individual patient, using repeated testing and gradual dose increases, dramatic improvements in depression,insomnia, anxiety, fatigue, interstitial cystitis, fibromyalgia and migraine often occur.These bio-identical hormones are sometimes almost the only medications, which highly allergic patients do not have adverse reactions to.Steven Sponaugle"},{"Title":"Natural Hormone Replacement For Women Over 45","review":"Natural Hormone replacement is a MUST read for any woman who is looking for natural alternatvies.

A 30% increase in risk is not a 30% risk as this book implies. In real numbers this means that instead of 100 women out of 1000 developing breast cancer 130 women out of 1000 would develop breast cancer on HRT.

I've read every Stephen King book and many Dean Koontz, Sidney Sheldon and several others. However, I seldom feel a real identification and &quot;caring&quot; if you will, for the characters as I did with this story. The protagonist, Carl Atkins, is &quot;everyman&quot;. He's a small town &quot;Joe&quot;, a neighbor, a caring family member. He has a best friend and a girlfriend. And then his life spirals; he is drawn into the supernatural in a way that is so believeable. One gets the feeling that &quot;This could happen to me!&quot;. It will haunt you and make you look over you shoulder, as it takes place in an ordinary, quiet New Hampshire town; a safe place to live and work.As you get thoroughly involved in this page-turner, it climaxes at a point where you want to say &quot;It can't stop here; something must be done to stop this!&quot; And the hint of a sequel will help you go on until you can meet up with Carl once again and see where this evil will take him, and you."},{"Title":"Wisemen: The Awakening","review":"There are not many books that I've read which I have been unable to put down, but this is definitely one of them!!

But this book was not only a great story that thoroughly entertained me, it has affected me on several levels. First, it both freightened and pleased me by causing me to question the underlying meaning of some life situations and the issue of mortality itself. Second, the book raised questions about morality, leading me to explore my own ethics and question how I would react if I was faced with the same choices that the people in this book make. &quot;What would I decide and how easily would I reach that decision?&quot; Finally, when I read the last page, it was one of those books that left me wandering around for days feeling like something was &quot;missing&quot;. What was missing was the daily contact with the characters that had woven themselves into my life. I understand there is to be a sequel and I can hardly wait!!I highly recommend Wisemen: The Awakening. Although this book is a supernatural thriller on the surface, it goes beyond the sheer entertainment value.

Can the Wisemen be stopped? Should they be stopped? Or do they represent a disturbing yet inevitable new future?A final point: the book is particularly entertaining for New Hampshire residents because - while many of the key locations are fictitious - Mr. Wayne deftly weaves into the story other, actual New Hampshire sites. Thus, one can more readily identify with the characters as they wend their way, often under great duress, from Concord, NH, to the Lakes Region and back. I could actually visualize the drive!If you like mystery and intrigue, with science-fiction ambience, you won't be disappointed.

After torturing myself wallowing through the first 100 pages, I gave up in utter disgust and tossed them both in the shredder to be eventually reborn as compost. I don't consider myself a particularly finicky reader, and enjoy other authors in the paranormal genre. This one didn't do it for me in the least, despite repeated game attempts, and I can only conclude that other glowing reviewers are all either related to the author, owe him money or lost a bet. I found the story line tedious and with uneven tempo---entire passages, even chapters, were apparently inserted as filler with no apparent goal of moving the plot forward. Dialogue was awkward, (I spent a lot of time thinking, \\"Who talks like that?\\", which at least was a nice change from, \\"What was the point of all that?\\") and multiple scenes overdramatic or just inept. In short, just poor writing. I own plenty of books in many genres that I read again and again, many others that I read once and give away---very few do I feel compelled to actually toss without finishing. If I didn't live in a high-risk fire zone, I might have been tempted to burn them for the emotional satisfaction.

Now we have the 2002 tome \\"Charles Manson: Music, Mayhem, Murder\\" penned by England's Tommy Udo. I purchased it at the discount bookstore, sold by the back cover mentioning the author heading west \\"on a hunt for answers.\\" I thought to myself, \\"Hey, that's kind of cool,\\" assuming it would be interesting to see the tale told from a modern-day perspective. Unfortunately, all he's willing to investigate is a Sunset Boulevard head shop (that is, no doubt, selling this book at this moment).Udo is a fine writer, and he knows his music, but he offers absolutely nothing new to the case. His main theme appears to be an attempt to document Manson's supposed growing influence in today's vast rock music scene, flamed by the likes of Guns N' Roses, Nine Inch Nails and Marilyn Manson. He makes some mildly interesting points, and I enjoyed the terrific quotes by Marilyn Manson following the Columbine tragedy. The very cult Udo smugly warns is rising around the Manson mythos is, however, fueled by shady books such as this. He tries to connect a few distant dots with interesting bits of trivia involving the Metal, Goth and Industrial scenes, but there's not enough documentation or knowledgeable interviews to support his leaky proclamation.A number of factual errors are so inexcusable as to be surreal, and substantially weaken the book as a whole. Roman Polanski's first film as a director after the crimes was not \\"Chinatown\\" (page 40). In fact, the first film, Polanski's uncomfortably violent version of \\"Macbeth\\" (made two years after the murders), has been noted by critics as having eerie similarities to the crime itself, with Polanski admitting as much. Robert F. Kennedy was not assassinated in Seattle (page 117), but at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, California. \\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\" and \\"The Parallax View\\" were not inspired by the Manson crimes (page 178) - a stretch, to say the least, and an independent opinion on the author's part. Ironically, one could make an argument that the wave of \\"slasher\\" films rising to prominence in the 1970s were indeed inspired by these crimes, but the author never scratches that surface. On and on, the outrageous mistakes continue.Udo has some interesting opinions on Manson's recorded music, and this is where his expertise shows. There's just not enough substance to quantify for anything more than a mildly interesting magazine article.These days, the only way to write a book about this gory mess is to pen it in diary tone, personally documenting ones own observations and how they apply to U.S. society today. To Udo's credit, he attempts this vein, but the author does not possess enough emotional or intellectual maturity to support his book. The only time \\"Charles Manson: Music, Mayhem, Murder\\" comes alive is when he interviews a Los Angeles refugee of the 1960s (page 186). The man pulls out some snapshots from the period supposedly showing him, Dennis Wilson (of The Beach Boys) and Charles Manson at Wilson's Sunset Boulevard home. I've read enough books on this crime to know full well that very few photographs exist of Manson prior to his arrest in October of 1969 (and from 1967 to his arrest, practically none). In fact, there are no known photographs of Manson at Wilson's home with the exception of a blurry picture that could very well not be him. If Udo had printed this man's fascinating picture in his book, he would have had something new to offer (certainly it could have been marketed in such a way to boost the sales). The LA refugee offers to sell the pictures to him for $200. Udo, possessing the foresight of a rank amateur, refuses to buy. Thus, I must continue to trudge through his tedious exercise.As the author documents, there's not much left in Los Angeles from the days of 1969. The house on Cielo Drive has been torn down and replaced by what appears to be a castle. Spahn Ranch is gone, though the hills remain. The Barker Ranch in Death Valley stands solemnly, but Udo's trip there takes up about a half page of shallow navel-gazing. If one chooses to wallow in the grubby spirit of this case, that locale is about the best place to do it. Udo flees before dark."},{"Title":"Charles Manson: Music Mayhem Murder","review":"To some people, they might not like this book, but doing my term paper on Manson, it was very helpful because I was showing the relationship between Manson and music. If you are reading this book just for factual information, there is better information available; but if you are reading this book for what the attended purpose is for: to understand how Tommy Udo relates music to Manson's famous history.One of the reasons why this book is so good is because Udo did not just write about Manson, he actually asked people their point of view of Manson. Some girl said that she thought Manson was cool and Udo asked her some questions back and you could totally see that she knew almost next to nothing about Manson. Udo takes many points of view in to consideration when he wrote this book. Overall it is a good book and I think you should buy the book ONLY if you are interested in reading about the relationship of Manson and music."},{"Title":"Charles Manson: Music Mayhem Murder","review":"Charles Manson didnt have a relationship with the Beach Boys, not as a group.

Rather than launch a lengthy attack on each item #some more or less problematic than others), allow me to provide a prime example: On page 117, the author refers to Robert F. Kennedy being \\"gunned down in Seattle\\" in 1968. I assumed that everyone in this country with an eighth grade education is aware that Sirhan Sirhan murdered RFK in the pantry/kitchen of The Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. My point is that, with errors as gross and unfathomable as this, how is the reader to establish any faith in the many far more obscure declarations the writer offers? Not doing his (very basic) homework taints the entire book, and casts doubts on other \\"facts.\\""},{"Title":"Charles Manson: Music Mayhem Murder","review":"This book was much better than I thought it would be.

Some were already classics when I bought them secondhand. Some rate well enough to be used (read) again and again. Others languish - gathering dust- on the bottom shelf, often simply because I cannot throw any book away. Let's face it, there are some very ordinary books sold as 'the answer to a photographer's prayers'. I have my share of them.I think Barry Thornton's book,'Edge of Darkness', gets my 'top shelf' award for 2002, and may be on that top shelf for many years. This man writes common sense, in simple terms, and backs his words with recorded deeds. His pictures are nice. I like the way he explains the emotions behind the recording of the images, and the mechanics he employs to produce great negatives. These aspects are key. Once you have a fine negative, time is on your side to make a great picture. And how you approach the making of the negative image, emotionally and technically, will determine the final result.(Show me a printmaker who says he gets a perfect result first time and I'll show you someone who should be in politics.)If you want a very informative and readable book, well written, and illustrated with good examples of the Black and White craft, you should buy this book. If you heed Mr Thornton's words, you are bound to benefit in your craft.&quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; is a very good read."},{"Title":"Edge of Darkness: The Art, Craft, and Power of the High-Definition Monochrome Photograph","review":"This is a special book because of its literary elements and its ability to get you thinking. Each chapter is about an individual aspect of black and white photography such as format, grain, and enlargement. Each chapter begins with a rambling obtuse anecdote that somehow (and with great finesse) leads into the subject of the chapter. This book has a literary style that is sorely lacking in most \\"how to do photography\\" books (including my own). The key to reading the book is to take what is said in stride and enjoy the ride. I found it to be a fun book to read.The book reflects a fascinating \\"left-brain right-brain' mindset that is very much into quantified experimentation yet with an wholesome appreciation of aesthetics. Even if you don't agree with everything that is said, the book will probably motivate you to put a lot more reflection and thought in how you approach monochrome photography. Grainier is sharper? How can that be? Oh, I see.Sadly, Mr. Thornton passed away unexpectedly in October 2003. This is a great loss to those who like reading photography books since he had much more to say. In any case, Edge of Darkness is a great legacy to a very thoughtful man."},{"Title":"Edge of Darkness: The Art, Craft, and Power of the High-Definition Monochrome Photograph","review":"Barry Thornton has come out with a really nice book on how to produce high quality black &amp; white negatives and prints. The book is mainly concerned with 35mm and medium format negatives, although his approach is perfectly applicable to large format. I have prepared his two bath methol formula (shown in the book) and obtained really beautiful negatives, in terms of grain, sharpness and tonality, from a Leica and a Hasselblad. My next step will be to try Dixactol, a developer he has formulated and explains in the book, and which you can get, in the USA, from Photographers Formulary.In my many years enjoying photography as an advanced amateur, I was unable to produce negatives and prints as good as those I am getting now, after reading Elements and Edge of Darkness, both books by Barry Thornton.

Just outstanding reading.... highly recommended.Vladimir"},{"Title":"Edge of Darkness: The Art, Craft, and Power of the High-Definition Monochrome Photograph","review":"What a delightful book! Once you've mastered Adam's beautiful books and the other books about serious zone system work this is the sort of book you hope for. Part memoir, part advanced how-to, and part philosophy put to paper in a delightful prose style.Not exactly for beginners -- the author assumes you know the zone system and are serious about doing your own darkroom work. It also doesn't hurt to have read Anchell's Film Developing Cookbook and the Book of Pyro but not needed. The photos in the book are beautifully printed and yet the cost is reasonable. I hope this publisher will continue in this vein."},{"Title":"Edge of Darkness: The Art, Craft, and Power of the High-Definition Monochrome Photograph","review":"Barry Thornton's masterful book is all about what you have to do to take those razor-sharp, etching-clear B&W; photos. And it's all about film types and film-speeds and focal lengths and tripods and skylight and development chemistry and enlargement lenses and so on. The book is full of excellent guidance, test set-ups you should be doing to confirm the focus of your camera or the film-speed settings or the alignment of your enlarger or the various developer mixes that are available for B&W; chemistry and how each produces sharper or less-sharp images.Over and over again, he demonstrates that the sharpest photos don't necessarily come from the finest-grained films or the biggest lenses or the most commonly used developer chemistry. In fact, there's a point at which the actual graininess of a film/print -- something you'd think would detract from the sharpness of the image -- actually contributes to the eye's perception of sharpness, of acuity!This is one of the best written photography books I've ever read -- right up there with Ansel Adams' classic trilogy and the National Geographic Field Guides to Photography.He starts each chapter with a personal event or story about his life, a place he found and photographed, a person who influenced his work. Then, he takes this narrative subject and makes it the illustration of whatever the topic of the chapter is. Beautifully written. A joy to read! And that's really saying something about a book on photographic techniques!Of course, the book is printed on high-quality clay paper and is full of exquisite reproductions of Thornton's works. And, like a true technical book, every photo is accompanied by a blurb on the camera, lens, film, development chemistry and times, printing chemistry and times, coatings ..., really, much more information than most readers would care about. But all is meticulously documented and, as you go through the chapters, you come to understand the significance of these technical bits of data -- and the differences in the images they produce.This is truly an outstanding book on photography, one of the very best I've read -- and I've read dozens! Yes, it's about B&W; scenics, mostly. But the lessons it teaches are applicable to ALL photography and will help any photographer to improve. I highly recommend this well-written and very readable book."},{"Title":"Edge of Darkness: The Art, Craft, and Power of the High-Definition Monochrome Photograph","review":"As an amateur photographer striving for technical excellence, I found Barry's book and approach extremely useful. I like the way he breaks down the necessary elements of image sharpness and quality into chapters. I can digest them one at a time and try to correct my own shortcomings.

You can clearly see where the English translations are a little off after reviewing the Hebrew and Greek. Women should be encouraged to pursue a pastorate with all confidence from scripture after reading this and both men and women will be able to more accurately read their bible and not mis-quote scripture out of context or meaning."},{"Title":"In the Spirit We're Equal: The Spirit, the Bible, and Women a Revival Perspective","review":"Sue Hyatt's book brings up an interesting question, \\"how did Jesus treat women?\\" I especially recommend this book for those studying revival, as Sue points out, women were always at the forefront of revival. This book will help to expose any prejudice, bias or preconceived idea that you may have unintentionally developed during your Christian walk. It presents Biblical Truth but is very readable and will lead you to examine the Bible for yourself. Sue's book is written from a Spirit-oriented perspective and will encourage all those who have a call of God in their life. It will bring healing to many who have been hurt when questioned with doubts regarding their call. Revival will require every believer to be confident that God is the one who has called them to a divine purpose."},{"Title":"In the Spirit We're Equal: The Spirit, the Bible, and Women a Revival Perspective","review":"Susan Hyatt presents a very thorough work on the position of women in the church. When I pick this book up, I am immediately drawn into it. The research done is complete and very convincing.Susan tackles this subject from many different angles, beginning with Jesus' treatment of women. Our Lord Himself was indeed a friend of women, often behaving in ways that were contrary to the traditions of His day. Following Jesus' example, the early church also embraced women as an integral part of the body of Christ, and treated them as equals.Then she shows how the beliefs concerning women in modern Christianity evolved (they did not come from Jesus or the early church!) Furthermore there is included wonderful reports on how God has used women all throughout church history.As a man, I would say that this is an extremely important work to read for those of us who want to be free of the insecurities which lock us into ungodly mindsets about women. Also, a good study book with interesting clips of church history."},{"Title":"In the Spirit We're Equal: The Spirit, the Bible, and Women a Revival Perspective","review":"Susan Hyatt assumes what she claims, stating so herself, then emboldens those who presume as she does. She does present a deep-dive into very selective historical movements that favor her position, and makes some interesting observations which I find worthy of additional research. Yet I find that she openly neglects to undertake any thorough treatment of relevant Biblical texts in her work. I find it subtly dishonest and imbalanced.IMHO, if you already have your mind made up and don't want to be confused by relvant facts, or if you simply want to consider sundry arguements proposed by evangelical feminists for more breadth in relevant discussions, this book is for you.Tim Hayes; www.ableever.net."},{"Title":"Finney on revival;: An abbreviation of the sermons on revival","review":"This is a condensed version of Finney's Lectures on Revival. If you're short of time or not much of a reader, or you just want an introduction to Finney's thoughts on revival, you'll probably find this book helpful. However, it's much better to read the more complete version available here at Amazon.Shelhamer (correct spelling) says in his Preface, \\"In this new book, however, an attempt has been made to gather the main points from the large amount of material available [in the larger book], in order to provide a handbook for those Christian workers who would learn the simple principles which govern the promise of Revival.\\"That about sums up the book. There is a lot of material left out of this book that one would find very beneficial in the larger volume. For example, chapter one, \\"What is Revival?\\" in the 1988 Bethany House edition of Lectures on Revival is 9 pages long. In this book, it has been condensed to little over 1 page.So, for an introduction, it's a nice little book. If you really want to learn what Finney said on the subject, purchase one of the larger editions."},{"Title":"Wildfire: Igniting the She/Volution","review":"I ran into Sonia Johnson at the first continental Bioregional Congress in 1984 when she was running for president as the Citizens Party candidate. She was the first woman to get federal matching funds to run for president, but she had little or no support from the national media. Beginning in 1977 she campaigned indefatigably for the Equal Rights Amendment, denouncing her church's (Mormon) opposition to the amendment. This resulted in her excommunication from the church.My summary of Wildfire: There was a flourishing culture oriented around women for tens of thousands and perhaps hundreds of thousand of years. Patriarchy is a relatively new and weak culture based on control and violence. It is now (the book was written in 1991) going down and taking everything with it. Women's most crucial task is to deprogram ourselves from patriarchy's brainwashing, including the guilt of mothers. Since women do 2/3 of the world's work, make 1/10 of its money, and own less than 1/100 of its property, our resources are keeping it going. Each woman has to figure out for herself how she gives her power to men. We need to let go of letting male partners or children be responsible for our feelings and to find our source of satisfaction within ourselves."},{"Title":"Wildfire: Igniting the She/Volution","review":"This self-published marvel is a classic of nuttiness.

Not just a fleshed out version of a history texts after-thought, as happens so many times with books about the women or minorities of history - this book gives us the real forces behind some of the major events of the revolution - forces that include the demands of disenfranchised women eager to take part in the new Sovereignty of the people.The tons of research done by Godineau shows not only in the immense bibliography but also in the completeness of the themes discussed in the book. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the French Revolution or the history of Women."},{"Title":"The Honorable Picnic","review":"This novel was published in French in 1924 and translated into English in 1927. It was written under a pen name by Roger Poidatz, a Frenchman who lived in Japan for a time between the end of World War I and 1924. Donald Richie, the American writer on Japanese subjects for more than 60 years, has called it one of the most observant and honest novels ever written on the nation, as well as the best novel on Japan written by a foreigner. Little information is available in English on Poidatz, but it appears that he published very little besides this book.It was set in Japan in the early 1920s. It began in Tokyo's Ueno Park, where a young Swiss man with seduction on his mind invited a local woman to accompany him on a daytrip to Enoshima, a seaside resort to the south. He intended their trip to end up at a local hotel. (The author's pen name--which sounds in Japanese like \\"Shall we stay the night?\\"--was a play on this invitation.) Unfortunately for the seducer, a Japanese acquaintance invited himself along for the day and things snowballed from there, as more and more people were drawn into the excursion.Each chapter of the book was written from the viewpoint of a different participant, all but one of whom were Japanese. There was the local girl, who was concerned almost entirely with how best to show off her clothes, in minute detail, and who took along a girlfriend, a mother and a baby. The foreigner's Japanese acquaintance, who invited several business connections he wanted to impress with the foreign presence. The pathetic foreigner himself, who knew nothing of what he'd set in motion. The stationmaster at a rail stop near Enoshima, who together with the local police was tasked with monitoring the foreigner for security reasons. The mother invited by the girl, who was concerned most of all with decorating her new baby with good luck charms. The owner of the hotel in Enoshima where everyone ended up, who sought to use the Western presence to her lodging's advantage. A geisha at the hotel, who observed the evening's festivities with boredom and disdain for the foreigner's boorish ways. (For instance, he quickly spit out the local version of \\"Bordo.\\") And finally, a local student who encountered one of the characters late at night along the beach.The humorous ironies in the book were many. Although the foreigner had started things off, he rapidly became little more than a bystander, a footnote, as everyone else used him for their own purposes. He was ignorant of and entirely uninterested in the local culture. His only concern, sex, was far down the list of everyone else's priorities: enjoying a change of scene, displaying one's clothing, spying, advancing a business, and so on. Not that they didn't have a place for sex. The foreigner could've saved himself much trouble by just checking into a hotel and making a private arrangement.Most characters were mocked, together with local and foreign ways, but it was the Japanese who received the bulk of the author's attention. In abundant display were an obsession with keeping up appearances suitable to one's station and making the right impression at all costs. Rounds of elaborate gift-giving. The frequent expression of the opposite of what was felt. The lack of what a Westerner might call a sense of proportion. A focus on minute detail--the right color for a kimono sash, the best lucky charm to buy--to the exclusion of all else. Undertakings that grew to require the planning of campaigns. Authorities' over-riding concern with the nation's honor. Frequent misunderstandings of foreign ways, combined with a search for differences over similarities. And mixed feelings of superiority and humility before the foreigner--the former thought, the latter expressed.The details certainly attested to the author's power of observation in a place he knew only briefly, and to his ability to write beyond race-based stereotypes of his time. gift for impersonating characters from a culture not his own. How much the book is enjoyed, on the other hand, might depend in part on how closely you're attuned to his depiction, funny though it often was. For this reader, it was difficult to care much about any of the characters, they served mainly as butts of the author's humor.Most of the book was written as farce, with a surprising twist in mood at the end. Was the twist intended to deepen the reader's appreciation of the local people and values? And how affectionate, ultimately, was the author's mockery? In the end it seemed unclear, and maybe this ambiguity was another of the writer's achievements.The novel was a very early attempt by a foreign author to describe Japanese characters' points of view. Later ones included Richie's Companions of the Holiday (1968) and Audrey Hepburn's Neck (1996) by Alan Brown. Depressingly, it was only in Brown's work that a Japanese and a foreigner succeeded eventually in finding common ground.Excerpts:\\"Comparatively I ought to wear a costume today twice as pretty as the one I wore for the Exposition. But when I dressed to go to the Meiji Temple, I had put on the only costume that would do. And I could not wear that again since the foreign gentleman had seen it. What was I to do?\\"\\"Now there remained only my friend the foreigner, who was the pretext for our outing, to wait for . . . . To while away the interval we exchanged regards, and to dissemble our increasing uneasiness we displayed a gaiety more and more lively.\\"\\"In addition it is always pleasant to play host to an eminent foreigner; one is enabled to show him that we are no less Europeanized than he, that we understand as well as he the cusoms and etiquette of his continent. The pleasure is enhanced when other friends witness the scene . . . . Why do they not come to study our social system in detail? Why do they not emulate us? The Occidentals are too proud of themselves.\\"\\"It was His Lordship, the Occidental professor! I stretched out my arms toward him and burst into tears.\\"\\"Infinitely honorable-excellence, pardon pray my grave importunity, but I made bold to hope that you might have the kindness to have the benevolence to have the nobility to have the munificence . . .\\"\\"Here was the downfall of foreign science! An unbounded triumph for the science of Japan! A glory for my hotel!\\"\\"[Westerners] are reluctant to show themselves naked. Why? Out of shame, they explain. What childishness! All bodies are fashioned alike and everyone else knows without looking how yours is made. On the other hand, they disclose to the first comer their affections, their emotions, their most profound sentiments, all that which far more than their bodies constitutes personality . . . . Loudly they parade their happiness, deplore their grief . . . . Even more sensitive than they are we Japanese. But our smiles and our gestures . . . never reveal our innermost hearts. Within ourselves we cherish our emotions.\\"But never do you give your seat to an old woman [on the train], because she can get along by herself. Craftily she turns around and as soon as she sees the least little space, into it she drops like a flash of lightning . . .\\" [Reader: Truly, some things haven't changed since 1924]"},{"Title":"The Honorable Picnic","review":"The novel begins as a parody but achieves objectivity by equally ridiculing all of its (strong) central characters. The author was a French-speaking Swiss diplomat living in Tokyo in the 1920s at a seminal time both politically and socially. He depicts a society caught between modernity and tradition, an apparently complex, inter-related society in which most of the characters in fact merely pursue their own selfish ambitions, oblivious of the effect on others. The novel proceeds through a series of chapters, each depicting events from the perspective of a different character - the majority of them female. The ending is tragic and achieves a high degree of realism, doubtless due to its being based in part upon the author's own personal experiences. It is such a pity that the novel is (presently) no longer in print."},{"Title":"Metric Pattern Cutting for Children's Wear and Babywear: From Birth to 14 Years","review":"Babywear &amp; children's clothing will no longer have any secrets after you have used Winifreds' book.

I especially liked the chapters on oxidations and reductions. Examples of naturals products syntheses are ample and increase the utility of the book. All the references are clubbed together at the end of the book. All in all, a fascinating book for the serious organic chemistry student.

I picked it up this weekend when the entire family got stricken with the flu.Does this main character do anything else other than whining about how her sweetheart never proposed to her? Apparently not because for the entire 323 pages of this book that is all she did. She was obsessed with getting that dang ring on her finger, no matter what. It starts off with a wedding that she and her beloved Jack went to a wedding and Jack made the comment that he wasn't a fan of weddings. That comment set Tracey off in a panic thinking that he's never going to marry her. Then his mom tells her that he got the diamond off of her engagement ring and if he had proposed yet. So that sets Tracey off on another panic attack ... and on and on.I'll save you the trouble ... yes, they do get engaged, but after two weddings, a botched weekend trip, after the holidays and in the least romantic way. By the time I finished this book, I must either be on the mend or just sick and tired of heroines moping about not getting engaged ... I was excited that she's engaged and now I can dump the book at the library annual bookfair.My advice ... don't buy it. Borrow it or better yet, find some other books in the series that are much better written and more fun than a woman who has it all whining about how she hates her life and it would only be perfect if Jack, her knight in slightly dented armor would just hurry up and propose.

I found it insulting that Raphael is portrayed in such a stereotypical manner. He's a caricature, not a real person. I often wondered how Tracy's delicate little friend Kate could even stand Raphael, yet she's supposedly a buddy of his as well. I also don't see what Tracy sees in Jack.

With friends like that, who needs enemies."},{"Title":"Slightly Engaged (Red Dress Ink Novels)","review":"I really liked the first 2 books. But this book kept repeating the same things! I got tired of hearing about her ex Will , her wanting to be engaged to Jack and that thing about not having enough tomatoes in her salad seemed to go on too long. I really had to skim a lot of pages to get thru this. I was also disappointed in the way it ended. Still, I know I will end up reading the next book with hope that Wendy Markham will write it like she did the first two."},{"Title":"Slightly Engaged (Red Dress Ink Novels)","review":"Within the first 20 pages I had to put the book down on my coffee table; not because I am a scholar nor am I some book snob, nope I had to put it down because I was bummed that I paid 15 bucks for a book that evoke everything in me but interest. Sorry, but I think it was some of the worst writing I have ever seen published. The abuse of words that very few people, without a M.D., would know there meaning and the slow pace blew it for me. I had my mother, a published author, read it thinking that I was being overly judgmental. Nope she said that it stunk too!"},{"Title":"Slightly Engaged (Red Dress Ink Novels)","review":"the author seems to have talent in writing great romance novels, like other works of her such as BRIDE NEEDS GROOM and ONCE UPON A BLIND DATE have proven. All show good character development and a great storyline in general which gives you this \\" I can't put it down\\" feeling, since you want to know what happens next.Unfortunately this book is nothing like that, it is in fact nothing else but a major disappointment.Here we have a single woman in her mid twenty's who blabs on about how desperate she is about getting married to her boyfriend of two years. She talks about nothing else but waiting for him to propose already after having found out from his mother that he has the family's inheritance diamond ring and this goes on for 336 pages!It is unclear if they even love each other and plan to spend the future together as the couple themselves never talks about it. The main character Tracy is displayed as a pretty pathetic looser with absolutely no self esteem who can't thing of anything but getting married. And the irony of that is that she mentioned several time that she does not want to become one of those women; well if she is not the worst one of all, then who is?In the end of course Jack proposes in the most unglamorous way possible out on the street on a rainy day and she says yes, end of book."},{"Title":"Slightly Engaged (Red Dress Ink Novels)","review":"I just want to say I LOVED the first book in this series, Slightly Single, and THAT book I HIGHLY advise anyone to read.The second one was ok and I felt this one was just a complete mess.First of all Tracey is 25 and desperate to get married, and she is ready to leave her boyfriend if he doesnt give her a ring. TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD. She acts like she is an elderly woman in the book.Second I HATE the character of her friend Kate and I hate that Tracey is so pathetic she cant stand up to her.And third I didnt notice any chem. between Jack and Tracy.

Instead Manhattanite Tracey Spadolini lives with her lover Jack, but he seems to suffer from commitment phobia. The worst incident occurs at the wedding of Jack's former Brooklyn roommate Mike Middleford, Tracey's boss at Blair Barnett Consulting, to nasty Dianne. Not only did Jack not want to go he is negative about tying the knot in general. Tracey is mortified as she wants to be Jack's wife.Tracey gains some hope when Jack's mom tells her that her son has taken out a family heirloom ring that he will surely give to her as an engagement ring. Tracey is excited because she loves Jack and wants to raise a family with him, but days turn into weeks and finally months with no ring forthcoming. Tracey has lost all hope and wonders if she must move on beyond the man she loves.Jack's \\"blindness\\" to Tracey's concerns make for a fine chick lit tale even though the heroine's grieving over her single status can send the audience wanting to smack her oblivious beloved that is until the readers learn we don't know Jack. The story line centers on Tracey's lament as the last single in Manhattan. Wendy Markham provides a lighthearted romp starring a young woman wondering why everyone but she and Jack assume she is on the verge of becoming engaged.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Slightly Engaged (Red Dress Ink Novels)","review":"One more friend getting married begins a spiral of emotion for Tracey. She's been living the Jack for some time now, and he shows no sign of making it legal. Even after she gets a huge tip off from his mama that he might be thinking that way, no ring is forthcoming. Tracey does all she can to give him hints, to make things ideal for the big event, but Jack seems oblivious. Is she on her way to being a Missus, or is her romance just a big miss?** The author gets points for admitting that living together is not the same as marriage, but the fact that she seems to validate Tracey's gay friend marrying his lover is jarring. However, there are funny, real moments throughout the narrative, though not too much characterization beyond Tracey herself. **Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."},{"Title":"The Birthday King","review":"I found this book in my parents library; it had been there while I was growing up. 30 years later I wanted to find out what it was about.The premise of the story starts with a lot of dialog between the characters that will play into the story line. Mostly political discussions into what they feel is happening to their country. I found this a little hard to follow; the names were complex,ie everyone had several different names and professions. Most importantly we see the evolution of Hitlers germany through the views of the residents, a family running an industrial business. Later the characters come together and try to influence each other in their way of thinking and what is best for the future of their business regardless of the outcome of the war. They were deciding what is the more important values they wished to retain.The story spans the years 1939 to 1945. Most interesting is how the characters evolved based on things that were happening to their country; changing their minds often to fit the mood of what was happening.It all comes together in the end as the allied forces are approaching the city of Berlin; they must decide what will become of them and how they will be judged for their activities the past few years.A very complex story, yet quite simple.Most of all, this is the first story I have read that actually shows the feeling of the German people who were drawn into a war that they didn't fully understand and feared what would happen to them in the end and therefore were planning what to do after the enevitable loss of Germany."},{"Title":"The Seven dials mystery,","review":"~ * * * * ~~ I liked this book very much, because the style and pacing are just different enough!

I couldn't even bring myself to finish the last chapter. It is definitely an attempt to create a drawing-room flapper novel. It is even a little hard to keep some of the characters straight. Not that there weren't possibilities, but this production was too long for what little plot was really there."},{"Title":"The Seven dials mystery,","review":"\\"The Seven Dials Mystery\\" is a historical mystery set in England. (It was, of course, a contemporary mystery at the time it was written.) The detectives were Bundle and Superintendent Battle.The mystery was a clever one that kept me guessing to the end. Despite all the clues, the only way a reader could correctly guess whodunit is if they realized Christie didn't follow the \\"mystery rules\\" in this one. The characters were engaging and the tone lighthearted. The suspense was created by physical danger to Bundle and friends and by curiosity about whodunit.There was some explicit bad language. There were no sex scenes. Overall, I'd recommend this entertaining, clever mystery."},{"Title":"The Seven dials mystery,","review":"Something of a pseudo-sequel toThe Secret of Chimneys, only in the sense that it is set in the same location and features a few of the same characters, \\"The Seven Dials Mystery\\" is less of a mystery than it is an espionage thriller, reminiscent of Christie'sTommy & Tuppence books. And yet despite containing all the ingredients of a typical 1920s thriller (including secret societies and international documents) \\"The Seven Dials Mystery\\" ends up being more of a parody of the genre, with plenty of pokes and winks at the use of its various clich&eacute;s. There's also fun to be had at the expense of the aristocracy, such as the egocentric Lord Caterham and the foolish George Lomax, and the nouveau riche, in the form of the woebegone Lady Coote, whose husband has risen up in the world, but who is bullied by the servants and secretly longs for the old bicycle shop that she shared with her husband when they first married. When contemplating Agatha Christie, many can forget just how wickedly satirical she could be, and that aspect of her writing is in fine form throughout \\"The Seven Dials Mystery.\\"At a gathering at the historical mansion of Chimneys, a group of young men and women decide to play a joke on their friend who is prone to oversleeping. Buying eight alarm clocks in the village, they wait until he's asleep and carefully arrange them in his room, timed to go off simultaneously in the morning. But when he still manages to sleep through the cacophony, the friends go to wake him they find that he's died in the night.It's a terrible tragedy, presumably brought on by an accidental overdose of sleeping powder, but there is something strange in the layout of the room. One of the alarm clocks has been thrown out of the window, and the remaining seven lined up on the mantelpiece: seven dials. To some, this presumably needless act suggests a darker meaning behind their friend's death.Lady Eileen Brent (called \\"Bundle\\" for short) joins forces with Jimmy Thesiger in order to investigate further, both led by various clues to a night club known as the Seven Dials and a house party at Wyvern Abbey. There's plenty of excitement to be had in both locations, and Bundle in particular is a treat as she wrangles her way into situations of varying danger. Also on the scene is Christie's reoccurring detective Superintendent Battle, an implacable figure of authority who is much more intelligent than some give him credit for.Although it's a fun read, it's certainly not one of Christie's best. Bundle is a delightful character, but the story itself is rather convoluted and difficult to keep track of. Perhaps I was just a little slow on the uptake, but even after a second read, some of the situations and characters (not helped by giving most of them obscure nicknames) are a little unclear, and the action can jump sporadically from place to place in a rather haphazard manner. But the misdirection on display here is Christie at her most mischievous, and it all makes for a quick, humorous read."},{"Title":"The Seven dials mystery,","review":"Arguably the most famous mystery writer in the world and, most likely, the most beloved, Agatha Christie's English language books have sold over a billion copies.

I would definitely recommend the book to even those Christie fans who only prefer Poirot and Miss Marple mysteries - it's good enough to stand on its own."},{"Title":"The Seven dials mystery,","review":"\\"The Seven Dials Mystery\\" by Agatha Christie is definitely a dated piece of work. It features several characters that readers met in \\"The Secret of Chimneys\\" like Bundle Brent, George Lomax, and Bill Eversleigh. While it is not Christie's best work, it still features her trademark twists that will keep readers in the dark about who the guilty party is.An innocent house party turns to horror when young Gerry Wade is found dead. His death is made worse by the fact that his friends had planned to play a practical joke on him; since he was a notorious oversleeper, they ranged eight alarm clocks around his bed set to go off at intervals. When his dead body is found, however; only seven of those clocks remain, aligned in a row along the mantelpiece. George's friend, Ronny Devereux, ia convinced that his death is foul play, and his suspicions seem confirmed when Bundle finds him shot to death. She soon finds herself enlisting the help of another guest, Jimmy Thesiger and the stepsister of Gerald Wade, to find out what Ronny meant by his last words of \\"Seven Dials\\". Bundle's adventures lead her into what looks like an international spy ring intent upon recovering a secret formula that would revolutionize the steel industry. Yet along the way, she quickly learns that she may not be able to trust the people she thought she could confide in, including the Scotland Yard inspector on the case.\\"The Seven Dials Mystery\\" is a delightful, fast-paced lark through the English countryside, but its languge and time period definitely shine through. There is an awful lot of action followed by an almost too quick summary of guilt at the end. However, for fans of Christie's works, it is always enjoyable to revisit familiar characters and to see them in a different light."},{"Title":"The Seven dials mystery,","review":"The Seven Dials Mystery takes a few characters from the thriller/comedy Secret of Chimneys and finishes up their romantic storylines, as it were. The mystery itself is a bit silly and a bit fun. It takes Agatha Christie's usual secret society silliness and tweaks it a little while she, for a change, pooks fun at the genre of which she has been such a part in the twenties. The action bounces between three country homes and a club in London so that it never veers too far from territory the author is comfortable in. The character are, therefore, a little more stock than usual but she does get a chance to give Bundle (Lady Eileen Brent) a chance to shine that the character never quite got in the previous book. A slight, nice slice of summer reading."},{"Title":"The Seven dials mystery,","review":"THE SEVEN DIALS MYSTERY is set 4 years after THE SECRET OF CHIMNEYS (1929&amp;1925) and also takes place in that 'Stately Home' Chimneys.Lord Caterham has taken his family, including oldest daughter 'Bundle' AKA Lady Eileen, abroad in search of peace and quiet after all the excitement that had occured in THE SECRET OF CHIMNEYS. He has leased Chimneys to Sir Oswald and Lady Coote who have decided to have one last weekend party before their lease ended. The house is filled with 'bright young things' but one of the party, Gerry Wade has been a difficult guest in that he was consistently late to breakfast. That was bad enough but then he was found dead one morning.After the Cootes moved out and the Caterhams returned, Bundle found herself bored with country life and decided to return to London. On the way she ran into (literally)a young man, his dying words to her &quot;Seven Dials...tell....Jimmy Thesiger&quot; set Bundle and her friends on the trail of a mystery.Bundle and Bill Eversleigh (also in THE SECRET OF CHIMNEYS) are reunited as they try to solve the murders and the secret of the Seven Dials. False identities, red herrings and secret societies abound until Bundle and Bill, with the aid of Superintendent Battle resolve the mysteries.This, like THE SECRET OF CHIMNEYS, is Agatha Christie a la P. G Wodehouse. Far from the serious mystery that Christie is famous for, this is a comedy with mystery overtones. If you like Wodehouse you'll like this book, but if you are looking for a serious puzzler look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Seven dials mystery,","review":"In many respects THE SEVEN DIALS MYSTERY is typical of both Christie's \\"master criminal\\" novels of the 1920s and popular thriller fiction of the same decade--which is to say extremely improbable from start to finish. But Christie has a distinct tendency to approach such material in a very tongue-in-cheek manner, and with this novel she is clearly less interested in weaving one of her celebrated mysteries than she is in tossing off some frothy fun.DIALS revisits characters first met in THE CHIMNEYS, a novel set at the country estate of Lord Caterham and his sprightly daughter \\"Bundle.\\" On this occasion, however, Lord Caterham has leased the estate to a captain of industry, and when an unexpected death occurs during a weekend house party Bundle finds herself drawn into an adventure that involves two murders, a plot to steal an important invention, and a mysterious association known as \\"The Seven Dials.\\"While THE SEVEN DIALS MYSTERY is amusing to read, Christie doesn't quite manage to capture the madcap mood that makes such similar works as THE SECRET ADVERSARY so much fun to read--and with the exceptions of Bundle and Lord Caterham none of the characters here are greatly memorable. Fans will enjoy it as an ultra-light and ultra-fast read, but this isn't a work that will remain in mind very long after the book has been finished and set aside."},{"Title":"The Seven dials mystery,","review":"As far as location goes, Agatha Christie appeared to be drawn to Chimneys like PG Wodehouse to Blandings Castle. The similarities between certain key characters are striking, both are supposed to be idyllic rural havens with very laid back lords of the manors, both suffered plagues of chaos determined to put its stamp on them, and both also suffered from energetic young girls pining for action. There is also a bit of courtship and marriage proposals prevalent in Wodehouse novels. And not forgetting the insufferably competent secretaries.There however, the similarity ended. Whereas Wodehouse was anything but seriously humourous, Christie was humourously serious.A party of young men and women, idle rich, who were guesting at Chimneys, embarked on a practical joke to launch 8 alarm clocks on their Rip-van-Winkle friend Jerry Wade. The joke turned sour when Jerry was discovered dead in bed the next morning, and only seven clocks were found, arranged neatly from their original locations.Bundle, daughter of the manor's lord, found an unfinished letter written by Jerry which suggested sinister forces at work in relation to his death. The significance of the reference in the letter to the \\"Seven Dials\\" was confirmed later when she came across Ronny, (one of the guests engaged in the practical joke,) dying of gunshot wound. His last words referred to the Seven Dials and to Jimmy, yet another party to the alarm clock prank.To a girl yearning for adventure, it seemed to her her desire was practically forced upon her. Bundle proved herself resourceful, investigating staff in her own household, throwing in together with Jimmy and Lorraine Wade (Jerry's sister) to investigate the mysterious deaths.Reprising his role as the chief representative of the law was Superintendent Battle. Bundle was acquaintted with him in an earlier Agatha Christie's novel \\"Secret of Chimneys\\". Through him, she found the lead to the Seven Dials Club via Bill Eversleigh, also a repeat character from Secret of Chimneys.Soon, Bundle found herself in the middle of an international conspiracy, from eavesdropping on a secret society while hidden in a cupboard, to rubbing shoulders with foreign dignitaries in a diplomat party hosted by George Lomax, the insufferable bore from the Foreign Office (also from Secret of Chimneys). She discovered that an innovative technological breakthrough was the target among local business enterprises and commercial espionage.Here, we saw Agatha Christie being naive in understanding of science and technology. Her description reflects those of children's stories were important discoveries could be recorded in several sheets of \\"secret papers\\", of which only one copy in the world existed, handled carelessly in the studies of private residence. This happened not only in Seven Dials but also in several other of her mysteries.Overlooking that, Seven Dials was a great romantic adventure thriller set in the romantic era of the 20s where young women were gaining confidence in the area of action."},{"Title":"The Seven dials mystery,","review":"Christie reverses everything here so no one by the end is who you thought they were. And Bundle is one of her best characters. The usually wooden Battles has some of the story's best dialogue. A really enjoyable ride from the first page. Note the use of the many clocks at the beginning, sort of a long foreshadow to Christie's later work of the same title (The Clocks, that is)."},{"Title":"The Seven dials mystery,","review":"Once again Agatha Christie returns us to the stately home of Chimneys from her previous novel. We are reintroduced to Bundle, George Lomax, Superintendent Battle, and others from that earlier work. Lord Caterham has leased his estate to a wealthy businessman for the hunting season, but becomes distraught when murder once again strikes his ill-fated home. The plot centers on the theft of a valuable scientific formula and a crime-fighting society known as the Seven Dials. Comic elements coupled with brilliant but improbable plotting make this a satifying Christie read, though not one of her best."},{"Title":"The Seven dials mystery,","review":"After reading of the adventures of Tommy and Tuppence I was slightly disappointed with this book. It was, perhaps, a little too unrealistic for me. Anyone who liked this book should also read The Secret Adversary and N or M? This book was still enjoyable though and thats why I have given it four stars and not three."},{"Title":"The Seven dials mystery,","review":"The only things missing from this murderous P.G. Wodehouse type lark were Bertie Wooster & Jeeves. Val McDermid contributed an impassioned introduction on the proper appreciation of Dame Agatha's myriad talents. In my case, Ms. McDermid was preaching to the choir.Idle rich young folk are houseguests at country house Chimneys (revisited-see: \\"The Secret of Chimneys\\") that is being rented by noveau riche Lord Cootes for the summer. The young men at the party, though uniformly dense, have reasonable names. The young ladies, dashing and beautiful, are called \\"Bundles\\" and \\"Socks\\" for no particularly good reason except perhaps to annoy the reader. These madcaps play a joke involving multitudes of alarm clocks on one of their sleepy headed fellows, and the joke turns sour when the young man is found dead in his bed.Superintendent Battles is the voice of calm and reason here, but the sleuths are the young people. They roar around in roadsters, take fearful risks and generally have a fine time. The plot is intricate, the red herrings clever and misleading. As usual, Ms. Christie offers up a total surprise at the end.I agree with Ms. McDermid that AC has a particularly sly sense of humor. The larger-than-life trivial and shallow aspects of the characters are meant to amuse, but sometimes grate.

Wodehouses's best books. Although he's never turned a tale anything but excellently, this is somehow more endearing than most. It starts out normal enough, with a man who just became an earl (Reginald, third Earl of Havershot) going off to Hollywood to save his alcoholic cousin from the deadly drink. He meets an actress by the name of April June, the very embodiment of virtue, on the way there-- or so he thinks. He also runs into his ex- finacee, whose engagement to him he bungled by way of a little accident with a cigar. After some very cold ice cream, he needs to have a tooth pulled. In the dentist's waiting room he meets little Joey Cooley, the child actor, Idol of American Motherhood, who will be undergoing the same torture as him. Well, both souls get administered some laughing gas, and this gives them the ability to be masters of the art of astral projection. But the thing is, little mischevious Joey puts his soul into Reggie's body, rather then his own. Reggie then has no choice but to inhabit the body of the child star with the golden curls. Now we've got a dilemma. See, Joey wants to poke everyone in the snout, and in Reggie's body, now has the strength to do so with optimum results. Uh-oh. And now Reggie is left with the mind of a grown man, but the mean Miss Brinkmeyer (the &quot;tall, rangy, light-heavyweight, severe of aspect' woman with whom he shares a mutal hatred...animus is in the air) and all other of Cooley's keepers, who treat him like the eleven-year-old child they think he is. Double uh-oh.This book is one of the funniest things I've ever read, not only because Wodehouse is a master of the English language and shows such a conatagious affection for it, but because it's a very zany tale that never fails to make you laugh and keep a smile on your face all day. There are so many more hilarious moments in this book, and not a page goes by without a good, hearty chuckle. I would highly recommend this book and all of Wodehouse's books, for that matter."},{"Title":"Laughing Gas","review":"Wodehouse's usual skill with the turn of phrase and the unlikely situation makes this book a delight. It's atypical of his work in that it contains a fantastic element: a grown man and a bratty child, visiting a dentist at the same time, accidentally have their souls switched while under the ether."},{"Title":"Laughing Gas","review":"This review is more for people who've already read a few of Wodehouse's stories, particularly the Bertie Wooster-Jeeves stories, than people who haven't. I'm a fan of PG Wodehouse (though I'm relatively new and no question I've read less of his than other reviewers here) and I liked this one all right and can recommend it if you haven't got much else at hand, but I must say I didn't think it was that great and didn't find myself laughing much. The switched identities plot element may seem promising in theory, but it wasn't all that amusing as it developed; it was mainly good for some slapstick-style humor, really, and in fact the plot on the macro level, so to speak, is fairly predictable in many ways, as you could say of the plot in many of his stories. On the other hand, one aspect where his stories excel, and this one produces some good moments, is in nicely set-up situation comedy-type scenes, where the civilities or complications or just plain screw-ups are pretty good fun. Here for example there's a first-rate scene where Reggie meets his ex-fiancee. Also, Reggie or Lord Havershot is an endearing character in the mold of Bertie Wooster--civil, courteous, basically good-hearted, rising to aristocratic disdain at times; with a tasteful eye; but hapless, quite fallible, and often dense. This all makes for what are, for me anyway, the real highlights of the novel: the sometimes hilarious commentary that Reggie as narrator makes on things as they happen. For example when he says, of a sarcastic remark by his ex-fiancee regarding his new flame, \\"I chose to disregard the vulgar comment\\", or when he touts his own \\"generalship\\" in dealing with an awkward situation, these are such finely comical comments (at the same time prideful, correct, yet feckless and somehow, in some elusive way, disproportionate), in the same way as Bertie Wooster's commentary along the lines of \\"I gave him an icy stare--and I meant it to sting.\\" In that sense I find this novel engaging in the same way as the Bertie Wooster-Jeeves stories, where the Blandings or Psmith stories or other pieces that don't have 1st-person narration aren't quite as entertaining.So, the book is good for some delightful moments, but I don't think I'd put it near the top of my Wodehouse reading list. Among the ones I've read, I liked the following in roughly this order: 1. Code of the Woosters (the 1st one I read--maybe I'm partial to it for this reason like other people may be partial to Laughing Gas). 2~4. Joy in the Morning; Right Ho Jeeves; and Very Good Jeeves (much of it is not that great but it contains one of the funniest stories I've ever read.) 5~8. Something New; Leave it to Psmith; Blandings Castle; Heart of a Goof. 9~10. Quick Service; Mulliner Nights. This novel falls somewhere in the middle of that range, though of course I've enjoyed more or less every one of these stories."},{"Title":"Laughing Gas","review":"Laughing Gas was the first Wodehouse I ever read. I knew his work through some Jeeves tales (and their TV adaptations), but I had never ventured outside of those characters. Seeing that the storyline was somewhat like the Freaky Friday genre of films, I wanted to see what Wodehouse would do with this already familiar plot. I was not disappointed and I have gone back to him whenever I wanted something to make me laugh--as long as it's not an audiobook read by Jonathan Cecil!Reginald, Third Earl of Havershot (gotta love those Wodehouse puns) finds himself in the dentist's chair after an embarrassing incident seated next to child star Joey Cooley (&quot;Idol of American Motherhood&quot;), going through the same procedure. After the administration of some of the titular anesthetic, the two have an out-of-body experience. The mischievous Cooley, however, instead of returning to his own corporeal form, slips into Reggie's, leaving our hero left with the tot's as his only choice. Hilarity ensues, as they say, as little Joey likes to go around punching people in the nose and continues to do so under the guise of Reggie. Meanwhile Reggie is party to the stories going around about &quot;his&quot; behavior and is powerless to stop them while in his current pint-sized form.Wodehouse takes this in all of the expected directions and invents a few new ones, to boot, making Laughing Gas one of his best novels. Well, one of the best I've read, anyway."},{"Title":"Laughing Gas","review":"Several years ago, I asked the most well-read man I knew to recommend an author who was consistently funny and wrote light-hearted books. He recommended P.G. Wodehouse immediately, and I'm so glad he did.In Laughing Gas, Reginald, third Earl of Havershot, and Hollywood's reigning child idol, Joey Cooley, switch bodies while under the influence of laughing gas during simultaneous dental procedures. Hilarity ensues, and I mean that quite literally. It really is a laugh-out-loud funny book.The plot careens and swerves through lots of crazy coincidences, farcical situations, and unlikely encounters. But you don't keep reading to see what will happen next. The plot isn't the driving force with Wodehouse. Instead, what keeps the reader turning pages is the sheer joy of finding out what wonderful saying or hilarious conversation will come along next. The unexpected use of language is one of the charms of Laughing Gas. I opened the book at random just now and came across this little gem: \\"I didn't get his drift, and said so. He continued snowing.\\" The book is full of little treasures like that.Another thing I enjoyed about Laughing Gas is the lack of cynicism in the characters. A lot of comedy has a snarky side, which is fine with me for the most part, but the refreshing sincerity of Reggie Havershot and the rest of the fictional folk in Laughing Gas is a nice change of pace. Wodehouse really knows how to write a likeable everyman, even if that everyman might be a little slow on the uptake at times. Even the worst behaved characters probably won't get up to anything worse than \\"throwing soft-boiled eggs at the electric fan in the better class of restaurant.\\" It's a fun story, and I'd recommend it to anyone who needs a good laugh."},{"Title":"Laughing Gas","review":"\\"Laughing Gas\\" is a rather appropriate title for a work by P.G. Wodehouse, since most, if not all, of his novels and short stories will have readers laughing out loud. This delightful romp set in 1930s Hollywood is no different, although not quite on par with some of his other works. Perhaps it is because the plot revolves around an entirely implausible event or perhaps it winds up being far more sentimental than comic - not necessarily a bad thing.Reggie Havershot, just recently named the third Earl of Havershot, is dispatched to Hollywood to locate his lush of a cousin and to prevent him from a malignant marriage. On the train there, Reggie meets and falls in love with the beautiful actress, April June, who seems just as eager to return his attention - he is an earl after all, even if he has the face of a gorilla. Reggie cannot understand why others do not view April June with the same eyes that he does, but when a toothache stalls his romance, his real troubles begin. For while under the gas in the dentist's chair, Reggie's soul is swapped with that of Joey Cooley, the spoiled child star of the moment. Imagine Reggie's disbelief when he awakens in the young tyke's body and discovers the demands of a child actor's life. Imagine his further chagrin when Joey Cooley, now installed in his body, seems to have no desire to switch places and has taken it upon himself to carry out some wish fulfillment fantasies now that he is a grown up. How can this matter be righted without both characters ruining the life of the other? In Wodehouse there is a way.\\"Laughing Gas\\" is a delightful comic read that never stalls, but rushes headlong through various schemes and nefarious plots as Reggie comes to terms with his new life, learning just what a pill the true possessor of this young body is and just how much one can yearn for the simple things in life once they are denied him. This novel requires a great suspension of disbelief but it is freely given. Even with such a fanciful premise, readers will gladly accept a story that revolves around soul swaps. Anything is possible in Hollywood after all."},{"Title":"Laughing Gas","review":"This small book, 286 pages, is very very funny. It comes to us from one of the greatest English Comic writers. P.G. Wodehouse is best known for the worlds he created for his characters in Blandings Castle and the Wooster--Jeeves duo. In this book, Laughing Gas, he took a simple story and used his characters to take it to level of comedy that is unusual. The approach and especially the language was funny, but it also crated a farce and in some ways could be seen to be offering some interesting social satire.The two key characters were, Joey Cooley, a child actor, and Reginald Havershot and English Earl. All the characters in the book not only complimented the comedy portrayed by Joey and Reggie but seemed to add to the farce because of their own uniqueness and role in story. The idea of swapping souls has been a well tested plot over the years and at first you wonder how going back to this plot and story, told my an author born in the late 1800's, could bring anything original or interesting to this idea. Both Reggie and Joey were at the dentist and both went under laughing gas at the same time. We were told that they somehow slipped out of their bodies in the fourth dimension and swapped. At first just a dated approach to this idea soon proved that it didn't matter and indeed was different because it was dated. It was just funny page after page. The answer lies in the characters themselves. Reggie's English approach to life in Hollywood was one where he had to survive for a few days in Joey's little, and very different, body. It is from Reggie's perception from within his own body and also during the time he was in the child's body, that we mostly see this storyThe story was told with an English accent, in a time and place that does not really exist anymore. Both Joey and Reggie by them selves were funny but it was the plot that unfolded after the body switch that left you laughing out loud.I was not very familiar with P.G. Wpodehouse so for me the book was a fist close look. I was not disappointed and may be hooked."},{"Title":"Laughing Gas","review":"I'm a huge Wodehouse fan, grew up reading him, but I have to say that this particular book is more pedestrian than most of his work. The premise of two consciousness switching corporeal forms is a time-tested plot device, and here it's dressed up with the screwball antics and snappy language one expects from Wodehouse. The gist of it is that the newly minted Earl of Havershot heads off to America to rescue his alcoholic cousin Reggie from the perils of Hollywood dames and booze. Being a very traditional Wodehouse hero (average looking, kind hearted, more or less hapless, and somewhat dense), he manages to become besotted by a vapid movie starlet. Alas, soon after his arrival in Hollywood, he suffers a severe toothache and visits a dentist, resulting the application of the titular vapors.Whilst under the influence, his consciousness gets swapped with that of Joey Cooley, a bratty little child movie star who is having a tooth pulled in the office next door. Wacky antics ensue, as the Earl must succumb to the strict regime of the movie star under contract, including a wholly unpleasant diet, and a packed schedule of publicity appearances. As it happens, his former fiancee is on the scene as a press agent, as is his bon vivant cousin. From then on, wacky antics ensue, as the Earl learns the true colors of his movie star love, realizes the fine qualities of his ex, and of course everything ties up rather neatly at the end. Along the way, Wodehouse is given licence to draw upon his own experiences to poke very mild fun at life in Hollywood. The book feels somewhat rote, probably because it's such a familiar premise, and it reads as if someone took it and applied a Wodehouse-wash to it, and then set it out to dry. My favorite part is actually the very beginning, where the Earl sits in the Drones Club attempting to start telling his wild story. All in all, it's Wodehouse, so of course it's worth reading, but most of his output is much better."},{"Title":"Laughing Gas","review":"This was my introduction to Wodehouse, and I'm sure I'll come back for more. Clever and witty, the book about the soul switching between an English aristocrat, and a bratty Hollywood child star is something straight out of the movie world it pokes fun at.Wodehouse throws in plenty of funny and colorful characters while tying up plot points in neat little bows by the end.It should also be mentioned that the newly designed editions by Overlook Press are beautiful, compact, and a must have for collectors."},{"Title":"Laughing Gas","review":"What a treat Laughing Gas is to read! A great Wodehouse story and wonderful word play by the master. There is not a day that goes by that makes me wish I had met PG or Plum as he was known. I wonder if he was as masterful with language in person as he was with the written word? No matter, we have his over 100 books and Gas is one of those I like best.

Maybe it was the anticipation of reading 'unparalled humour and writing style' that let me down.But recently when I picked up an old copy of \\"Laughing Gas\\" and read it on a long flight, my neighbours on the plane kept on wondering what was wrong with me - I would burst into uncontrollable giggles at almost every second page. The book was actually like Laughing Gas (sorry, couldn't resist the obvious pun).The story revolves around an Earl (from England naturellement) who travels to America to rescue a 'wayword cousin' who has fallen for a starlet in Hollywood. But while on a visit to a dentist, the Earl exchanges bodies with that of a child-superstar Joey Cooley. The resultant confusion is simply humourous (though at times bordering on the slapstick).What keeps the reader engrossed is not the plot (which was probably ingenious when the book was written but not anymore) but the authors ability to churn out puns and one-liners that has the readers in splits. The ending unfortunately is quite Shakespearean with suddenly everything falling into place conveniently (the good-old \\"all's well that ends well\\").My belief in Wodehousian humour remained intact (if not stronger) after reading this book."},{"Title":"Laughing Gas","review":"Did not received product as shown in picture.The book I did receive was good some pencil marks."},{"Title":"Laughing Gas","review":"The super-hero kid, and the troubled young man, and the switch of 'souls' and identities!

At the beginning of the book, he is a a financially successful ad man who has a 'respectable' and 'comfortable' life, but he realizes, somewhere between women and unconcious suicide attempts, that he is nothing that he set out to be. So, he sets out on a journey to burn down what he had become and rebuild what he wanted to be.

I was curious what the film director's novel would be. As a film director, Kazan adapted this into the 1969 film with Kirk Douglas as Eddie, Faye Dunaway as Gwen & Deborah Kerr as Florence. I may seek that out.However, the book seemed tediously long to me. The main problem is that Eddie, the protagonist, is extremely unlikable. He is the quintessential self-centered man. The careless disregard for his wife's feelings, his lover's and his family's is incredible to read. (I kept hearing Daniel Day Lewis' voice from \\"There Will Be Blood\\" as I read Eddie.) Only briefly touched upon within the novel is spirituality, the need of man to identify with something bigger than himself to bring him happiness. So the seeds of destruction are everywhere in this novel. It is so completely abundant for 500 pages, but is it interesting? Not particularly. Tragic yes, but in the same way that people like to read about someone who does a horrific deed. We like to read about for several minutes, but who do we study in history? We tend to revere the examples of those who fought for a better world. Although Gwen was a fascinating character as were some of the supporting characters like Charles & Chet, I found myself repeatedly dragging myself to read another chapter with the assurance that if I kept on going, it would end. So I recommend \\"The Arrangement\\" like a literary root canal operation. It feels better when you're over it.

But right around page 300, I had a moment of frustration when I realized I still had 236 pages to go. That being said, I didn't want the book to end, and I wish that Bridhid had another story, AND now that I am done reading it, the 536 pages wasn't enough. My frustration lies in the fact that once I start a good book, I have to read it through. This book was a little long for me to finish in one night, so I had to put it down-around 2 A.M- and go to bed; and it was a very hard thing to do.This is probably my favorite P.C. Cast book. I know this book was published awhile ago, so maybe her writing was of better quality then, or maybe she needs to stop letting her daughter write for her; I went into this book, not really expecting much, I was pleasantly surprised.Also, I know teenagers are well versed it what sex is, but there is one sex scene, that would probably make me uncomfortable letting a young teen read- it's the only page of the entire book that's a bit questionable.I enjoyed watching Brighid and Cu grow and their characters develop. Brighid is rather flat and one dimensional to begin with, and Cu, can't seem to recover from the death of Brenna, the woman he was to marry. As the story progresses we get the pleasure of watching them both become what they were meant to be.I do have to admit that for most of the book I did have some trouble in my mind, picturing her as half \\"horse\\" half person and I still do to an extent. I had no problem with the winged people, and the hooves instead of feet, but this big beautiful centaur- all I see is a horse with a human upper half. This beauty everyone describe was difficult to imagine- the cover of the book helped, but still... a horses butt; I am sorry, I mean centaur butt.Setting that aside, this story was about forgiveness,love and of course healing."},{"Title":"Brighid's Quest","review":"P C CAST is an extremely good author.

Very well written story, with solid character development and plot. It can stand alone in the series, but I plan on reading the first book anyway, because this one was a good read. Although published by Harlequin Teen, I believe the content may be more appropriate for older teens/young adults.The Quest follows Brighid, a first-born Centaur Huntress as she searches for her place in a world that is new to her. She has spent her life rejecting her heritage and family line because she has seen and been victimized by the power that corrupted her mother. Leaving her life and fellow Centaurs behind she travels to McCallan Castle, and a clan led by Elphame, a half centaur half human chieftain, who is trying to create a land filled with equality and tolerance of other groups.As the Huntress for this new clan and Chieftain, Brighid helps provide for the people loyal to Elphame and work to protect them as necessary. Brighid's nature and magical heritage have made her an exceptional Huntress, able to track and take down animals with incredible ease. This tracking ability extends to the people around her and she is able to locate Elphame's Warrior brother who has fled the compound after a tragedy.Slowly, a relationship grows between the Huntress and the Warrior Cuchulainn as they attempt to save a misunderstood group of beings and return them to their ancestral homeland. Beginning with grudging acceptance and respect, their feelings blossom into friendship and eventually to a seemingly impossible romance.Eventually, with the love and protection of the Cuchulainn, Brighid must return to her own homeland and accept her destiny as High Shaman of the Dhianna Centaurs.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the publisher through the NetGalley book review program.

I was reluctant to read it but, as with some of the other books I've received, I decided to give \\"Brighid's Quest\\" a fair chance.While \\"Brighid's Quest\\" is a \\"typical, old school fantasy\\" (to quote another reviewer on LT) and not particularly literary, I don't think the author intended it to be anything more than what it is. This novel is escapist entertainment and geared for teens/young adults. Melodrama comes with the territory! Cast writes in a way that I can compare to Stephenie Meyer, but Cast's female characters appear to be stronger, more independent and more self sufficient. As is expected with a Harlequin Teen novel, this one includes more naughty bits than Meyer's books but is no more graphic than what can be seen on T.V.I think there is enough variety in Cast's characters that this storyline won't become as repetitive and tiresome in its progression as the Twilight series. If I were to place this novel on a scale of teen fantasy I would place it somewhere between the Twilight novels and the Mortal Instruments series by Cassandra Clare. None of these novels are what I would call literary, but they are entertaining and fun to read. I think there is value in books that are purely for entertainment.While the first novel in the series may have helped me understand the characters' personalities more deeply, I don't feel like I missed anything by reading this mid-series. The book was a fairly easy read but, because of some of the more mature subject matter, I wouldn't place it below Young Adult. Reading abilities vary greatly and the fact that this book is an easy to read does not detract from the entertainment value of the story."},{"Title":"Brighid's Quest","review":"Originally posted at [...]If you enjoy fantasy adventure on a grand scope with a hero and heroine fighting against impossible odds and a love story of epic proportions, then pick up Brighid's Quest because it delivers all that and more.This book can stand alone easily but it is based on a series in a world so unique and special that I'd encourage readers to find the back books just for the sheer enjoyment they bring. I've read the others so for me it was wonderful to visit again with some of the original characters as they had charmed me and I remember them from so long ago. That being said, Ms. Cast brings enough of who they are and their back story that anyone jumping into the series with this book can easily relate. This book is Brighid and Cuchulainn's story and the emotion captured in the pages of this book are as vibrant and touching as any reader could wish.Brighid is part woman and part horse, a centaur. She's a complex person, rich in personality and inner conflicts. She's got a mother who was corrupted by power, a destiny she fights, prejudice to overcome, friends to heal and a friendship that has sneaked over into love. She's strong, loyal, talented and destined for more than she expects. Over the duration of this story, Brighid grows in knowledge of her world and of herself. Despite all she's fought against, all the trials she's overcome, she never loses her compassion for others, even for those I truly believed shouldn't get any. She's an inspiration. She also has a delight wit which pops up at unexpected moments.Cuchulainn is a fractured man. He lost his first love and it tore him apart. His spirit is adrift and his family fears for his life. This is about his journey to healing, not just for himself but eventually, the people of the goddess, Epona. He's a warrior through and through and can be counted on. I liked Cu because he feels deeply, loves completely and is also loyal and courageous. His steadfast support of Brighid is as romantic as can be. Would that all men treated those they loved with that kind of honor and respect.There are some parts that I would caution a reader of the younger generation. The conflict does turn violent and at one part Brighid is in danger of being violated - the scene could possibly be disturbing to some younger readers but with the news programs these days, perhaps not so much. To balance that darkness, the love and gentle touches between Brighid and Cuchulainn are tender, sensual and bring their romance to the next level. I had no problem with them, indeed it enriched my view of their relationship.The children are beautiful. Liam is my favorite because he charms Brighid when she absolutely did not want to be charmed. He touches her heart and for the first time, she sees a different future for herself. It's a wonderful moment.Epona is the goddess and she's just as important a character as the hero and heroine because everything they do is in her name. Most gods and goddess in stories are manipulative and love to play power games as though humans were chess pieces on a chessboard. That is far from the truth in this book. Epona is a positive, loving and beautiful creation of Ms. Cast's mind and I'm in awe of its scope.This review could go on and on because there is so much detail, emotion, events and characters I've yet to cover but this world Ms. Cast has created is an amazing place to visit. Time flew as I read because I could not put this book down. It touched my emotions on so many levels. I highly recommend this book to readers of fantasy and romantic fantasy because it is so well written. Ms. Cast has a reputation for bringing her characters to life and she succeeds much to my vast enjoyment. It's a must read."},{"Title":"Brighid's Quest","review":"I have not read the first in the series for this book. I thought that would possibly hinder the story for me, but the story was well done and reading the first book in the series is not necessary to enjoy and understand this story line.Brighid's Quest is an intriguing and heartfelt fantasy story. This is a good read for someone who enjoys a great fantasy story with some romance. The character and relationship developments are well written, and make you want to know more about everyone in this world. The interaction between Cu and Brighid are odd at times, but those moments do not detract from the overall story and feel of the book. I am anxiously awaiting the next in the series, but in the mean time, I enjoyed this book so much that I will go back and read the first in the series, Elphame's Choice."},{"Title":"Brighid's Quest","review":"Fast paced and really holds your attention. Great book to curl up with over a weekend or a rainy day"},{"Title":"Brighid's Quest","review":"Having herd P.C Cast highly praised for the bestselling \`House of Night' novels, I felt compelled to discover her work and so I jumped at the chance to delve into a Goddess of Partholon novel. As an avid reader of both fantasy and the Young Adult genre, I was fascinated by how the author cleverly combined magic with myth & legend to create a refreshingly original paranormal phenomenon. Beautifully dreamlike this otherworldly creation had me glued to the pages as I lost myself within a remarkable world where Clans of Centaurs, archaic prophecies and divine begins merged. Delicately interwoven and multi-layered, as you begin to read deeper into Brighid's story you uncover astonishing revelations that add to the depth of detailed world-building. The main protagonist's heritage is not only fascinating but which also carries certain obligations, as no one can block-out their past no matter how you try.Torn between the possibilities...Brighid decides to leave behind the Centaur clan and find peace and acceptance within the human race. However, as she tries to look towards her future she cannot forget that the Shaman blood runs through her veins and that one cannot ignore her past or her heritage. As tragedy strikes Brighid must make that ultimate choice between what she was born to be and what she is avoiding, due to the love of her human friendships and strong feelings for a particular person. This is a story of self-discovery and fulfillment amid a magical feast that takes creativity to a whole new level...together with a lush purple cover that stands-out on any bookshelf.This thoroughly gripping tale was really enjoyable and which certainly impressed me, as I was unsure of whether I would like this novel or not. I can see why P.C Cast is a popular author within this genre, as she captures in essence those strong emotions that all teenagers and young adults feel when faced with tough challenges in life - love, loss, acceptance and confusion. Able to connect with Brighid and her inner struggles as she comes to terms with her powers, I lost myself within an exceptional otherworldly creation that is truly inspired and very magical. Mythological references entwined within a concoction of imaginative vision, well-written narrative and colorful characters make this a real \`treat'.I would highly recommend \\"the Goddess of Partholon\\" novels and Divine Trilogy to all who love creepy creatures subtle romance and suspenseful, page-turning narrative.3.5 stars!"},{"Title":"Brighid's Quest","review":"Love P C Cast and wish she would write more on this series.

Brighid's Quest arrived first so I started in on that. I love the world, the plot, understand it's a teen book, but I felt it could be condensed. It's over 500 pages and it takes almost the whole book for Brighid to face who she can become. I know teens go through a lot of soul searching but if I were a teen and read this I would have been fustrated she couldn't chart her course sooner. I also didn't understand why the New Fomorian's never encountered that stray band that Fallon 'stumbled' across by following their fire smoke. The book didn't show the brilliance of Divine By Mistake and it didn't get interesting until the final pages. I was left with too many questions. Will the warriors at Guardian's castle start a war? On the New Fomorian's? Will they go after Fallon? What will happen with Fallon's small band? Will Keir develop a backbone and stop his wife? What about the infant? Will he/she die at birth? Be evil? And let's get real here - What would you do if your brother betrayed you, tried to kill you, and you hadn't seen him for years? Will Brighid be all sweet and forgive him or will she develop some leadership characteristics, stop doubting herself, and act like a mature person that teens can learn from? Really really sad 500 pages and it doesn't get interesting until the end. By the way, I still haven't read the next Divine book because I was so disappointed with Brighid's Quest."},{"Title":"Brighid's Quest","review":"We didn't see much of Brighid in the previous book, and I really enjoyed her in this story. Brighid's quest was much better than Elphame's choice. The first half of Bridghid's quest there is too much repeating of what happened in the last book and the pace is rather slow. Even reader's who didn't read the previous book would probably be screaming we get it already. The last half of the book really picks up and I really enjoyed the relationship of Brighid and Cuchalainn. I would have liked to have learned more about Brighid and her past. I felt like the author barely grazed on the top of the surface. Maybe a chapter through the eyes of her sister when they were young would be interesting. The author seemed to be rushing the story and I wish she had wrote more about Brighid's return to the centaurs. However, the end of the book hinted at a sequel."},{"Title":"Brighid's Quest","review":"Brighid was a character you could relate to....I really enjoyed the way the author developed her characters. Another wonderful story!"},{"Title":"Brighid's Quest","review":"Like the best of writers, Cast's tone is so...real and unaffected that it seems like she must sit down and jot this off with ease. I don't know whether or not she does but I LOVE every one of her books. She's gotten better, too, since her first, Goddess By Mistake. It's also interesting to note that she's an English teacher at a Broken Arrow High School in bible belt Oklahoma -writing sensual and unapolgetically earthy works. That would seem to take as much courage as her heroines show. This particular book really reads best if you've read her other related work: Elphame. Treat yourself. This is escapist fiction...as good as it gets."},{"Title":"Brighid's Quest","review":"On a quest to escort the orphaned New Formorians (children born with wings) back to the land of their ancestors, Brighid, a centaur huntress, discovers a complication she hadn't anticipated: her quest companion, the warrior Cuchulainn, needs her help as well. Still grieving from the death of his love, it's begun to threaten his soul.I enjoyed this series' first book, Elphame's Choice, reasonably well, so I thought I'd give this one a try. Unfortunately, it's too predictable and not especially satisfying. I think I'm through with P.C. Cast."},{"Title":"Brighid's Quest","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. I read this book last from all of PC Casts other goddess novels. Great story."},{"Title":"Brighid's Quest","review":"The evil race of demon Fomorians kidnapped and raped the women of Partholon taking them into the Wastelands to bear their offspring. The Goddess Epona united the people of Partholon to defeat the demons and a century later touched Ephame who took as her mate a hybrid Falorian and drank his blood and took the madness that existed in the hybrids into her self. Now the descendants of the children of rape can go home to Partholon.Cu, whose lover was killed by one of the hybrids, goes to the wastelands to check out the New Fomarians to see if they are as good and gentle as his sister's lifemate says they are. Brighid, the female centaur goes after Cu and finds the seventy children and handful of adults pure of heart. When they return home, Brighid's sister comes to the keep to tell her that the centaurs are going to war because their High Shaman, Brighid's mother was killed by humans. Brighid, who was running away from her legacy, knows she must drink from the chalice of Epona and become her High Shaman, and fight her brother and his allies before the land is bathed in the blood of battle.Although Brighid is a centaur and Cu is human, they love each other and mate for life. Their marriage can only be consummated if Brighid drinks from the Chalice because then she will be able to shapeshift into human form. P. C. Cast has written a fascinating action packed romantic fantasy where true love can conquer all. Both hero and heroine go through many hardships and it is only through their love they feel they can overcome all their hardships. This is a special work that will appeal to a variety of readers.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Brighid's Quest","review":"Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and KritiquesVenture to a time and place beyond reality, where dreams and magic linger....Brighid Dhianna has left behind her centaur home of revenge and hatred to build her own destiny as Huntress to Clan MacCallan, blessed by the Goddess Epona. Here she has finally found peace and acceptance. When her chieftain, Elphame, sends Brighid on a quest to bring her brother home, she readily accepts.Cuchulainn's soul was shattered when his young wife was brutally murdered by demonic Fomorians, winged beasts cursed with a madness that will eventually destroy them. Some of these beings have survived war and live in peaceful exile, scraping out a meager life in the mountains. \\"Cu\\" goes there full of hate and bitterness to return these hybrid New Fomorians to Partholon. What he finds there shocks him.Brighid follows Cu to save him, having to call upon her dormant and long-denied Shaman blood to retrieve his soul and heal him. Just as hope springs new, fate intervenes once more, making Brighid choose between the life she has built in Partholon and the destiny of her blood as High Shaman to the centaurs. Which will she choose? Only Goddess Epona knows.Brighid's Quest is a fantastical adventure that will lure one to dream of another world. The story draws readers in from the beginning and holds them captive in its grasp through the hopeful conclusion. The landscape is brilliant and so incredible that it is easy to envision the beautiful Partholon and the grass covered plains of the centaur domain. When the beloved characters venture into the spirit realm, readers will see the beauty and hear the stirrings of wind through the trees. Though this is a sequel to Elphame's Choice, most of the storyline is easily followed and readers should have no difficulty understanding what is happening.Brighid's turmoil is real as she tries to put the life she hated behind her, only to be pulled back to it just when she thinks she is finally free. Her journey on the path to adapting to her Shamanic abilities is a hard one and easy to feel and understand. Cu's shattered soul struggles with living in an imaginary world where death has not taken his love away. He must learn, with Brighid's help, to come back to the real world and accept the fate he has been dealt.This novel is written almost as if in different acts of a play. The first segment is about Brighid's journey to the mountain to bring Cu and the New Fomorians home and all she encounters along the way. Then comes the story of how she journeys to the other realm to bring Cu's soul back and heal him. The final segment deals with Brighid's growth and acceptance of the fate dealt her, when she must choose which life she will live. All three individual stories are blended together masterfully, to build the overlying story which encompasses everything.Of course, romance is never missing from a book by P C Cast, and it shows itself in Brighid's Quest. As Cu's soul heals, his relationship with Brighid deepens from respect and deep friendship to the more powerful bond of soul mates. How these two come together in their love is inspired and bound to make readers sigh in delight at how they bridge the gap.? Kelley A. Hartsell, March 2006.

She has become one of my favorite authors and I suggest that everyone read about Brighid and her exciting and romantic quest. Superb!"},{"Title":"Brighid's Quest","review":"I love all of PC Cast's books. It helps to do a little research and read the books in order to help track the characters and how the intertwine through each book. I liked this one in part because it stays in one time space.

There are so many moments in this book that make it well worth the length, not just involving Brighid and Cu's interaction. but also the absolutely amazing sequences regarding the New Fomorians.

This story was so good ~ not to put any spoilers in but I have to say I love who Brighid ends up with. We meet up with characters from Elphame's book & meet the new Formians & centuars from Brighid's clan. I know there is a long wait for the next books but honestly, they are worth it."},{"Title":"Brighid's Quest","review":"P.C. Cast's \\"Brighid's Quest\\" is a good, solid story about a centaur (Brighid) who has run from her family for good reason -- most of them are cruel, sordid sorts who have done horrible things to their own people -- and has forsaken her birthright as a shaman because she quite rightly refused to study magic and religion from her mother (the previous shaman, and the only teacher available), as her mother was an extremely wicked person who was at best extremely narcissistic and vain; at worst, she was cruel and vicious.In \\"Elphame's Quest,\\" Brighid the centaur was a minor character; she had come to Elphame's abode, the castle of the Macallen, and had asked for a place as a Huntress. (This is a job that's not as sacred as that of a shaman, but it's just as important and necessary. Without an adequate food supply -- including fresh meat -- no castle or city would be able to survive.) Her family name, Dhianna, gave everyone pause -- the Dhianna Herd is known for being closed-minded, sheltered, and obstinate (those being its best qualities; see above for its worst) -- but Brighid more than proved her mettle in the previous book.Because this is a sequel, I have to mention at least a little bit of \\"Elphame's Quest\\" in order to review this; otherwise it makes no sense. (I'll try not to discuss too much of Elphame's story; that's for a later review.) In that story, one of the secondary plots dealt with Elphame's brother, Cuchulainn; he had always been a rough and ready \\"love 'em and leave 'em\\" type, but had inexplicably fallen in love with the shy, needy, talented and scarred healer, Brenna. They intended to marry, and had consummated their relationship and pledged before witnesses, but were unable to enjoy a marital relationship because Brenna was killed by some malicious fools who wanted to hurt the community at large (going after a Healer is fair game in war).Cuchulainn was shattered; he'd never expected to find love, much less with Brenna, and giving so freely of himself was extremely and extraordinarily difficult -- but worth it, so long as she was alive.At the start of \\"Brighid's Quest,\\" Brighid the Huntress, being Cuchulainn's friend, is trying to help him through his grief. As a centaur -- someone who cannot shapechange -- she doesn't even think about Cuchulainn as a possible mate; how could she?But Cuchulainn notices her, and feels guilty; Brenna isn't long-dead, and they should've had years ahead of them. Instead, all he has to remember are a few, short months of intense joy -- then intense sorrow, as her life ended so violently. Cuchulainn knows that shamans can shapechange; his own father is a centaur shaman (his mother being the priestess of Epona, who mates with a centaur of her choosing/Epona's choosing), and he has no prejudices about mixed-marriages.Brighid, gradually, falls in love with Cuchulainn, but doesn't realize it until about halfway through the book. There's a precipitating event; the Dhianna Herd is causing problems, and with Brighid's mother being dead, the head shaman is now her brother, a very difficult and bitter man who does nothing but harm.Brighid, consequently, has to attempt to become a shaman -- not because she wants it, necessarily (even though her romantic interests have definitely made her wish she could; shamans, after all, can shapechange), but because she knows it's better for her people and everyone else on the Plains where the Dhianna Herd makes its home. (Brighid doesn't believe in maurading, or taking what she wants that isn't hers; as a Huntress, she believes in hunting animals within season, and is a conservationist/ecologist.) That the Dhianna Herd has more or less raped the land they live on is part of her reasoning as to why she finally decides to become a shaman; she figures no one can do worse than her brother has, and that someone must try to do better.Cuchulainn, of course, supports her, but his own journey isn't over. He still feels guilty over it all, and needs the help of a shaman to put himself back together.The way these two come together in what seems from the start to be a star-crossed romance is extremely sweet, but not saccharine; Cuchulainn is able to build on what he'd learned about himself with Brenna and take all the good from that relationship into his new one with Brighid, and both become better and wiser people as they take up their burdens.I found this book to be a very good, solid romantic fantasy; it is believable, the characterizations are excellent, and Brighid is a woman worth knowing -- kind, wise, resourceful, but with a hot temper and the variety of faults you'd find in a real person. (Cuchulainn, as previously stated, is obviously no saint. I find that refreshing in fantasy literature; far too many heroes are saintly, and that doesn't ring true to my mind. People are not meant to be saints, even in fiction.)I think this is Ms. Cast's second-best book, behind solely \\"Goddess of Spring;\\" I rated that a four as well, but that one has some odd wordings at times that threw me out of the reader's trance. This one doesn't; it's better-written, better laid out, better plotted, and yet uses all of Ms. Cast's strengths -- her writing of dialogue, her humor, her characterization, and her knowledge.In other words, \\"Goddess of Spring\\" would've been a five without the problems I found in it; this is a very strong four that's nearly a five, and is just short of the pathos and romance I enjoyed so heartily in \\"Goddess of Spring.\\"But it's very good; very well-written, very enjoyable.Four-plus stars (just short of five stars), highly recommended.Barb Caffrey"},{"Title":"Brighid's Quest","review":"After hearing wonderful reviews for the works of P.C. Cast and one glowing one for this novel in particular, I rushed off to buy Brighid's Quest, intrigued by the premise of a centaur heroine.I cannot in any way fault P.C. Cast's writing. Her prose is beautiful, her descriptions lush. The word she built is unique and detailed. It's a fascinating mix of mythologies with Goddesses Incarnate, centaurs, and Fomorians.However, as lovely as the world and writing are, they can't make up for the total lack of conflict in the story. Everyone is just wonderful and lovely to everyone else. The children and bright, happy, and exuberant, not a brat in the bunch. Their leader is sweet, understanding, sweet, powerful, sweet... It's almost mind-numbing how perfect everyone is.250 pages into the book, Brighid and Cu have helped bring the perfect children and their perfect leader through the Fomorian land and across a pass. Thinking back on it, I'd be hard pressed to remember anything else that occured over those pages... And those pages were a trial to get through because I kept putting the book down out of sheer boredom. Nothing about the characters made me want to explore their futures.If you enjoy books where everyone is lovely and wonderful to each other, rather like a literary version of heaven, then this is the book for you. If you like something with conflict, characters making mistakes and learning from then, then you might want to give this a miss."},{"Title":"Brighid's Quest","review":"This book was nonstop excitement.

They're recollections and reminiscences from people who actually knew Mary Baker Eddy, up close and personal.I read these four books several times many years ago and still remember many of the stories. They provide an interesting insight into Eddy's life, a woman I consider to be one of the most intriguing, dynamic and remarkable women in American history.It was very insightful and forward-thinking of the Christian Science Publishing Society to capture and publish the stories of people who actually lived and worked and studied with Mary Baker Eddy. These books were compiled and written in the 1940s and those folks who walked and talked with Mrs. Eddy are long gone now. For that reason alone, these short tomes are each a worthy read.My only complaint is that they''re almost hagiographical in tone and content. They're overflowing with praise for Mrs. Eddy and there are absolutely no negative remarks contained within their pages, whatsoever.However, I obviously enjoyed reading these four books very much, for I've read them repeatedly. The stories are well told and the books are well-edited and tight. Above all, they're very inspirational and spiritually centered books, and provide an interesting look at the mighty and awesome healing power of prayer."},{"Title":"Hiking Grand Canyon National Park","review":"To me, this is the Grand Canyon book to get if you are planning on hiking the trails. It has great illustrations of the trails and elevations. You can easily follow the trail illustrations from one trail to another because they tell you the page number of the connecting trail. The textual descriptions are excellent and very easy to follow. The trails are broken up logically and are easy to piece together for extended trips into the canyon. If you are looking for a book with telephone numbers of who to call for reservations and all that, this is not the book. Fine with me because that information is always changing and isn't that what they made the internet for? The size is a bit large to be considered a pocket book but is easily packable. The size actually helps with the illustrated maps as it makes them what I consider to be perfect for trail use. I prefer to make copies (which I did not do if it is a violation of some copyright) of the trails I am going to hike and leave the book behind. The copies are handy for the inevitable rain that always comes. Put them in a zip lock bag with the one you need on top...this book does not stress much about people being physically prepared to hike the canyon. If they don't physically prepare, what makes you think they bother to read before they hit the trail? I have yet to see a sick person on the trail with a book about the canyon in their hand. The book does rate each of the trails with regard to difficulty. I have several books on the Grand Canyon and for planning and hiking the trails, this is the one I would recommend over all the others."},{"Title":"Hiking Grand Canyon National Park","review":"This is considered the definitive guide for hiking in the Grand Canyon and the strong points of this book are worth noting. The maps are excellent, as are the descriptions of how to get to trail head. However, the book is incomplete in certain areas and outdated. The Grand Canyon has implemented a shuttle system to stem the horrific crowds (I don't see much improvement) and hikers now can't drive to the South Kaibab trail or Hermit's Rest trail. The directions in this book are therefore rendered confusing due to the new restrictions.Most importantly, the authors neglect to stress that in order to successfully complete long hikes at the Grand Canyon, you must be physically prepared. Several times a year I hike to Phantom Ranch at the Colorado river and then back on the Bright Angel Trail. This is nine and a half miles one way with an elevation gain of 5,000 feet. Oftentimes I pass many sick, debilitated and unprepared hikers who quite obviously didn't do any physical preparation for this hike. Physically fit people should be able to do it in 3-4 hours coming up, but many are stuck on the trail for 12 hours and suffering. This could be avoided by exercising and hiking for months in advance in order to enjoy and relish the spectacular experience. Another fabulous challenge is doing a rim to rim hike, but only for those FIT.The author does detail the debilitating and life-threatening heat conditions that exist in the Canyon. I recommend to anyone planning long hikes *not* to attempt them in the summer! Temperatures frequently exceed 110 degrees and heat exhaustion and/or heat stroke can result. The best months to hike in the Grand Canyon are October, November and April.The Grand Canyon (even with the terrible crowds) is a sublime experience and Phantom Ranch is the best part of the canyon. Forget the mule and use your own two feet. It's a magical experience, a great hike and one you will want to do again and again!"},{"Title":"Hiking Grand Canyon National Park","review":"We used this book exclusively to pick the trails we wanted to attempt. The book was very helpful, explaining details such as elevation change, estimated hike times to various points on the trails, and ratings of the trails' difficulty. The book also included directions to each trailhead, and other information such as weather and hiking conditons. We had our 6 and 9 year olds with us, and the book contained a listing of easy to difficult day hikes for families. I found this book very valuable in preparation for our daily hikes into the Grand Canyon."},{"Title":"Hiking Grand Canyon National Park","review":"The overview and locator maps proved very useful. Posting the elevation gain and loss (as well as a plot showing where these occured) was very helpful in negotiating the trails. Precautions and general hiking information in the front sections of the book were very thorough."},{"Title":"Hiking Grand Canyon National Park","review":"I purchased this book while planning the production of a DVD Hiking Guide (which is now also available on AmazonJon's DVD Hiking Guides - Grand Canyon National Park).I own several hiking books on the Grand Canyon and consider this one to be the best. Many trails are discussed; the descriptions are enjoyable to read and informative (providing some information on flora/fauna & geology). It talks about Grand Canyon weather, hiking with children, potential hazards, first aid, emergencies..in short, essential information on how to hike safe.Shuttle services, lodging, campground information, physical conditioning...this and more is covered in this book. Two thumbs up!!P.S. The review by Candace Scott complaining that the book doesn't address the physical conditioning needed, and certain trail heads not being accessible by car is (at least as of this current 2006 edition)..to put it bluntly, wrong. There is a section on Physical Conditioning. And this book plainly identifies trail heads that are not accessible to private vehicle year round, showing also during which months they are open to vehicles."},{"Title":"Beat Takeshi Vs. Takeshi Kitano","review":"Casio Abe, Beat Takeshi vs. Takeshi Kitano (Kaya, 2003)Either Japanese film criticism is an entirely different beast than its western counterpart, or Casio Abe is the downright oddest film critic I have ever come across. Not that this is a bad thing; his impressionist takes on the films of Takeshi Kitano are quite fun to read, and this book, I'll say from the outset, is a must for Kitano fans-- but as you'll learn pretty quickly (as in, in the translator's foreword), Casio Abe does not watch films like the average film critic. Indeed, he watches films like the average film fan, and because of that, he tends to be kind of obsessive, even when he's getting the details wrong (a habit for which, it should be noted, Abe never, ever apologizes-- he's one of those \\"the facts get in the way of the truth\\" types, I guess).After a long introductory essay in which Abe traces Kitano's television career and explains his thesis that Beat Takeshi (Kitano's television persona, and the name he acts under in most of his films) is set against Takeshi Kitano (the director) in just about every way possible, he dives right in, devoting one essay/chapter to each of Kitano's films. The original book covered only the first four, having been released in 1994, and these essays are much longer and more in-depth than the ones that were added for the book's 2003 release (the chapters on Kikujiro and Brother, for example, are less than six pages, while Abe's examination of Sonatine runs thirty). Despite Abe's rather lackadaisical method of film viewing, there can be no denying from word one that this guy takes Kitano seriously as an auteur; like Tom Mes' wonderful books on Takashi Miike and Shinya Tsukamoto, that such a book exists at all with Takeshi Kitano as its subject is a very welcome thing. And as far as that goes, Abe's topics are much the same as those one finds in any other book of film criticism-- themes that move from film to film, notes on small character quirks (for example, Abe's observation that for most of A Scene at the Sea, the two main characters never face one another-- a detail I'd completely missed), that sort of thing. But there's an exuberance to Abe's writing that one doesn't find in most film criticism, just as there is with Mes. Perhaps it comes from taking a director who isn't considered all that hot in his home country and treating him like he is (in some sort of transgressive sense)? I don't know, but in the intervening fourteen years, Abe has certainly been proved right, as Sonatine (and Kitano's later films Hana-bi and Kikujiro) has started finding its way onto critics' thousand-best-films-ever-made lists. There can no longer be any doubt that Kitano is, in fact, a serious, and very good, filmmaker. Abe just saw it before everyone else did. And now that Kitano is finally gaining some appreciation in the west, you can get your hands on this little book and find out what all the fuss is about. (Or you could just go rent Kikujiro.) ***"},{"Title":"Beat Takeshi Vs. Takeshi Kitano","review":"This book is full of interesting reviews of most of Takeshi's films, everything from Violent Cop to Dolls. It presents engrossing ideas of the duality of self and the masks Takeshi wears for his public. While being perhaps a little too worshipful of the director/superstar, it is none the less thought provoking and thorough. Worth every penny."},{"Title":"Beat Takeshi Vs. Takeshi Kitano","review":"I'm a big fan of Takeshi Kitano and I picked this book up without even thinking about it when I saw it. It is a very nice paperback; small but well bound with a great cover photo.The book is very well written but that may be the book's one flaw as it is very wordy and reads like a thesis. While that's not necessarily a bad thing, this simply isn't a book to pick up for a casual read as it is a bit demanding intellectually speaking. It does present some very interesting theories and insight into Kitano's work, both in film and in television. I really enjoyed reading the author's dissection on the nature of the Beat Takeshi/Takeshi Kitano relationship in his films and his take on television culture in general, which he crucifies more than once throughout the book.Also, like with other books of this nature, I can't help but feel like the author sees way too much into Kitano's work, probably more than Kitano himself. Kitano doesn't strike me as the type to meticulously plan every tiny detail in his films as the author insinuates in this book. Kitano seems to me to be more of an instinctual director who works more off of intuition. While I do appreciate that this is an analytical essay on the subject, some of the theories and points are just way out there, probably enough to make Kitano himself scratch his head in a perplexed state.The book covers everything up until \\"Dolls\\", which is a shame since Kitano has filmed \\"Zatoichi\\" and \\"Takeshis\\" in the past few years and I would've loved to read what the author had to say about those films.If you'd like a nice, concise reading on Mr. Kitano's work (and who wouldn't?), I strongly recommend this."},{"Title":"Beat Takeshi Vs. Takeshi Kitano","review":"The seemingly split personality between international film auteur Takeshi Kitano and TV personality/movie actor \\"Beat\\" Takeshi has intrigued me since I saw his wondrous 2000 road movie, \\"Kikujiro\\", right after one of the ridiculously dubbed episodes of his game show, \\"Most Extreme Elimination Challenge\\" (a.k.a. \\"Takeshi's Castle\\"). What appears common between the two selves is the unpredictability of his technique and his quirky sense of humor. Film critic Casio Abe has done a thorough job in examining both halves of the man in question with a series of meticulously written essays that illuminate Kitano's artistic motivations and the native culture that embraces him wholeheartedly. \\"Kikujiro\\", as it turns out, is something of an anachronism in Kitano's filmography since he is known by Westerners for developing his own film noir aesthetic with its stylized violence and narrative idiosyncrasies. You can tell from the book why his approach is revered by directors such as Martin Scorcese, John Woo and especially Quentin Tarantino, who seems to follow similar themes in his films.As a true Japanese film connoisseur, Abe tends to get didactic in his meticulous descriptions of scenes and character motivations within Kitano's movies. For example, his comments about Kitano transcending Beat Takeshi move toward a philosophical discussion that borders on pretentious. The author's praise sometimes gets a little too effusive, but it's a forgivable indulgence since only the most serious fan of Kitano's work would read this book. Regardless, it's fortunate that this work has been translated into English since Kitano's worldwide audience has been building steadily for the past decade. Abe includes several excerpts from Kitano interviews and paints as complete a portrait of the filmmaker as possible. Originally published in 1994, the graphically pleasing softbound book has been augmented with a series of more recent magazine articles that focus on his most recent work. This is an excellent overview of Kitano's work for those who have been lucky enough to expose themselves to his artistry."},{"Title":"They Don't Dance Much","review":"&quot;They Don't Dance Much&quot; was rescued from obscurity by Southern Illinois University's Lost Fiction Series. Author James Ross' style is similar to James M. Cain; this book resonates like a film noir screenplay. Judging from the popularity of the recent film &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; someone in Hollywood should take notice. But &quot;They Don't Dance Much&quot; is more than a cheap thrill. It's true literature. Those fans of excellent writing out there need to take a look at this book. They won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"They Don't Dance Much","review":"Raymond Chandler mentioned this novel (along with THIEVES LIKE US) in a letter in his collected letters, so I grabbed a copy, and I can only say that Chandler knew one when he saw one. This completely amoral tale of roadhouse denizens in the depression era South is wonderfully atmospheric and gets under your skin in an unforgettalbe way. Deadpan violence, stark atmoshpere, and characters worthy of a pulp Faulkner. Don't miss it if rural American noir is your genre."},{"Title":"They Don't Dance Much","review":"I first read this book almost 20 years ago and recently purchased a second copy of it. It is superb. The language is pitch-perfect throughout, and the story coils itself inexorably around the reader. For years I had told people that, if they really wanted to read a hard-as-nails novel, they should find \\"They Don't Dance Much.\\" My rereading confirms my earlier opinion. The novel has scenes of extraordinary violence told in a spare, unadorned prose that makes the action all the more graphic.The comparison to James M. Cain is probably fair enough--but I think that Ross is even better than Cain. Ross makes his characters' slide into night seem more gradual and more shocking for its gradualness. And Ross's universe is less moralistic than Cain's: in Ross's novels, evildoers are not necessarily punished.Really, this novel should be republished by Penguin Classics or the New York Review of Books. It deserves recognition as one of the best novels of twentieth-century American literature."},{"Title":"They Don't Dance Much","review":"A genuine masterpiece! I have read all the greats out there: Charles Bukowski, James M. Cain, Chandler, Hammet, Hemingway, Orwell, Jim Thompson, Clarence Cooper, Jr., Iceberg Slim, John and Dan Fante, Donald Goines, Joseph Conrad, B. Traven, Jack London, Albert Camus, Knut Hamsun...and this guy, James Ross, with his one and only book is right up there at the very top of the heap with the best of the best. You won't find better writing anywhere...and it's not so much the story even, but what he does with it. Ross uses a deceptively easy-going, simple style that sort of sneaks up on your psyche and leaves a mark long after you have finished his tale. A remarkable work; a certified classic in my humble opinion. Highly recommend it to anyone who likes a solid read."},{"Title":"The Feminine Connection: Freeing the Female Psyche","review":"The author adequately disentangles the roots of female identity rejection from a psychoanalytic perspective. The book is very easy to follow, though, and it offers relief for anyone who feels burdened by femininity or the female gender role. The author suggests through the book that some women are vulnerable to the subtle but persistent cultural conditioning that teaches to value the masculine and reject the feminine, giving place to feelings of worthlessness. I felt very empowered with the book's dialogue, that discusses thoroughly all the wonderful meanings and facets of femininity without enclosing it in any one of its dimensions. Recommended!"},{"Title":"The Feminine Connection: Freeing the Female Psyche","review":"Hello. I am actually the author of the book. If you as a woman struggle with your self esteem, this book may inspire you to value and honor your feminine identity, something that women who are successful by patriarchal standards have to contend with. The second theme of the book is to envision a society with the masculine and the feminine qualities in balance."},{"Title":"Party Ideologies in America, 1828-1996","review":"The author has identified long periods of time spanning several generations where the ideologies of the Whigs-Republicans and the Democrats have been generally consistent before transitioning to new philosophies. The book rests on the statements and views of party elites, though mostly presidential candidates, during presidential campaigns as being definitive of those parties' ideologies.The periods identified for the Whigs and Republicans are the National Epoch (1828-1924) and the Neo-Liberal Epoch (1928-1992). For the Democrats the periods are the Jeffersonian Epoch (1828-1892), the Populist Epoch (1896-1948), and the Universalist Epoch (1952-1992). It may be surprising to learn that Bryan and not FDR started an epoch or that Hoover was the first neo-liberalist and not Goldwater or Reagan.The author explores the nuances of the views of the parties on such matters as liberty, democracy, equality, virtue, the market, labor, etc. For example, both parties could make the claim of being pro labor. But for 19th century Republicans labor was not much different than modern-day entrepreneurship. The rise of organized labor, or unionism, was an unwelcome development. Democrats generally viewed labor as work done by the common man and did not include economic elites.The author clearly shows that some aspects of party ideologies underwent near reversal across political epochs. By far the most interesting reversal of views is the attitude of the parties concerning the state and by extension the national government. The Whigs and Republicans of the 19th century were far more state-oriented than are the Reaganites. Republicans supported state intervention in the economy in building public works, maintaining high tariffs, and in generally advancing the cause of Americanism. The 19th century Democrats on the other hand were highly suspicious of state power. The Jacksonian assault on the National Bank is the foremost example of acting on that suspicion. Yet beginning with the Populist Epoch, Democrats sought to use the state to counter the increasing power of industrial entities.The nineteenth century Republicans favored the growth of large economic entities, however the rhetoric of latter day Republicans seems to favor the rights of small businessmen and is opposed to anti-competitive formations and state regulation of the economy. Here the author could question the legitimacy of party ideologies. The claims of the pro-business party to be representing small businessmen in an era of massive corporate consolidations would seem to be of dubious validity. However, clearly the two parties have completely reversed their views of the state.The book is well organized; it definitely clarifies the political speech of the two major American political parties by providing well-drawn frameworks on which to hang that speech."},{"Title":"Party Ideologies in America, 1828-1996","review":"This book is must reading for anyone with a serious interest in American political parties and their historical development. Gerring's work is a major contribution, showing that American parties do have distinct ideologies, and that these ideologies have persisted over long stretches of American history. The book is extremely well-researched, and written in a clear and engaging fashion."},{"Title":"Party Ideologies in America, 1828-1996","review":"An excellent discussion on party ideology in America, well researched and nicely presented. Starts off with a helpful review of where the thesis will take the reader, and then methodically makes the points and convinced me, the skeptical reader.For the record, my favorite passage is a quote of Martin Van Buren on page 43... but you will have to read the book to find out what I mean!"},{"Title":"Party Ideologies in America, 1828-1996","review":"POLITICS AND THE ROLE OF THE STATE IS DETERMINED BY ACTIONS AND POLICIES, NOT RHETORIC.

The gait descriptions are thoroughly explained. Finer points of tracking and how to see tracks are well-defined. Explanations are written clearly and amply illustrated to make learning easier.

James tells you what he knows and is careful not to pretend to know more than he does."},{"Title":"A Field Guide to Mammal Tracking in North America","review":"Animal tracks are more than just impressions in the snow, mud, or dirt. They are a record of what an animal was doing, where it was going, and what it was thinking... IF you know how to read them.Jim Halfpenny has spent most of his life following, recording, and interpreting the elusive tracks of animals. This book focuses on mammals.Now there are a number of books on bird and mammal tracks. A Field Guide to Mammal Tracking in North America is much more than a collection of diagrams. This book:* discusses the anatomy and behavior behind tracks* develops a rationale on how to look at and measure a track* revels the differences between a gait, a step, a jump, and a straddle* discusses tracking techniques (Halfpenny gives seminars on this topic, and it is included as Chapter 4 in this book)* reviews track characteristics of canids, felids, lagomorphs, ungulates, and rodents, along with bears, weasels, raccoons, opossums, and shrews.* discusses \\"scatology\\"* presents a number of interesting cases that he then works through to show the reader how to approach a mystery track and identify the animal, and its behavior, correctly.This is not a very expensive book. It could have been even less expensive with the elimination of the 12 full-page color illustrations of selected mammals in the center of the book. They were nice, but distracting, and most of the drawings don't even have pictures of tracks, the point of the book!This book would have been improved with use of a digital camera in capturing images of tracks.

She shares what it was like being married to him. Let's just say they're not married anymore ... Her honesty with her heroin addiction is to be admired, along with all she went through physically when restrained to a steel neck cage after an accident.

(It was very sporadic). That according to her began in some form back in England and it seems she indulged in it due to it being accepted at that time as well as a way to have her either have energy (when she needed it) or to relax when she was over worked and needed to calm down.I did not know that Burt Reynolds was according to Joyce, an abuser of women though. His ex wife Loni Anderson claimed the same during their very public divorce in 1991 and Burt falls under suspicion in 1970 during the death of another actress, Inger Stensland (Inger Stevens) though I do not believe that he actually killed her (she had bruises on her forearms, a defensive posture and a cut on her lip which would indicate some form of physical attack on Burt's side).Her second husband, Robert Bergmann was nothing but a con artist, who stole from her, divorced her then almost killed her giving her a broken neck.About Joyce, she has tremendous talent, she could sing, act, and dance. I wonder why her other skills did not take off because she was that promising though she did try to break the typecasting that she was cemented to.She may have look fragile, however, she was a woman of steel, many a persons would falter at the issues this lady went through, but she took all the punishment and continued to rebound back."},{"Title":"Laughing on the Outside, Crying on the Inside (The Bittersweet Saga of the Sock-it-to-me Girl)","review":"I REALLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK ABOUT FORMER LAUGH-IN GIRL JUDY CARNE.

I noticed on the back the comment that it is \\"groundbreaking\\" collection of \\"some of the most exciting verse being written today.\\" But some of the names inside frankly did not ring a bell. And others, like Robert Pinsky, Louise Gluck, Jorie Graham, without taking anything away from them, seemed oddly included in a groundbreaking collection. You can probably tell that I ended up buying it.Then I noticed that this collection was first published in 1991 under the title \\"New American Poets of the '90s,\\" reissued in August 2005. But the thing that was weird to me was that it was reissued as though it continues to be 1991. There is a brief explanation by Jack Myers that some of the poets have gone on to win Pulitzer Prizes, National Book Awards, etc. And as for the poems, there are some wild, extraordinary surprises in there. It is definitely something a lover of poetry should add to the collection.But I wanted to know more. There is zero information about the poets themselves, except some publishing notes. It seemed unfair to the reader and the poets not to give some kind of update. Are you still alive? Are you teaching somewhere? have you written anything since 1991? Did you move to New Zealand? Do you have ten kids? Do you like pina coladas? Does your dog still bark all night?Was it too much work to give this collection a real update?

I thought the wrecks were the mast interesting parts of this book, followed by the fixing of the cars. The author shows true spirit for all the tracks and drivers. Some of the drivers in this book are Dale Earnhardt, Dale Earnhardt Jr., Mike Skinner, Steve Park, Dale Jarret, and Darrell Waltrip. Some of the tracks are Martinsville Speedway, Darlington Speedway, Daytona Speedway, Talladega Speedway, and Atlanta Motor Speedway. I think every NASCAR fan should read this book."},{"Title":"WHEELS: A Season on Nascar's Winston Cup Circuit","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the book and its style of switching back and forth from the 96 season to historical background and vignettes of the small time racer.

(The problem was not that Indy Speedway wanted to open up qualifying, just the opposite. He guranteed spots to his IRL drivers even if their speeds were slower. )Second, the first part of the season was covered in meticulous detail, but the last half was summarized. It seemed like the author was looking to wind it up.

Paul is a great author and he made me want to stop what I was doing and get back to reading this book.This is a fantastic book and I loved every minute of it. Wheels is a book that has a adrenaline rush that keeps on going and going in till you have to stop reading the book. I loved how Paul made me fell like I was in the drivers seat the hole time it was great. This book is about a season of racing on the Winston Cup circuit. Wheels covers many race car drivers and it tells there story from when they were on the old dirt tracks to when they started driving professional. Some of the drivers that it covers are Dale Earnhardt, Jeff Gordon, Rusty Wallace, and Terry Labonte. The main driver that the book covers is Dale Earnhardt and he is a fantastic driver.Earnhardt has a great personality. He is always making friends where ever he goes, it could be on the track or some where like his neighbors house. Dale had a wish that consisted of him beating Jeff Gordon in the points so he could win the Championship and it was a great part in the book. That particular moment in the book was my favorite because Paul had me on toes the whole time. Paul was explaining it like you were watching it right in front of your eyes.I also like how Paul Hemphill included all the tracks and how he emphasized the good ones. The best track was Bristol Motor Speedway and it had a great race there. Paul included that Bristol was the shortest track on the circuit that was only a half mile long. He took us through all the bumps and turns and of course the wrecks. He also included the championship race that was at Daytona Speedway and it was the most exciting part of the whole season.This as a fantastic book and I would recommend it to only the people that like sitting down watching a 500 lap race with a nice cold drink in one hand and the other one for throwing stuff ant the television."},{"Title":"WHEELS: A Season on Nascar's Winston Cup Circuit","review":"I found this book to be a very nice overview of NASCAR history and the modern circuit.

So toaday, when I watched the Daytona 500, I could understand the hidden meaning behind &quot;Mr. Excitement,&quot; especially when he kissed the wall with a few laps to go. And why this win for Dale Earnhart was so significant. Buy this book, its one of the best about the sport, and is written more as a literary piece than a &quot;gear head&quot; manual about cars."},{"Title":"WHEELS: A Season on Nascar's Winston Cup Circuit","review":"Hempill writes a very entertaining book about the 1996 season, and the sport's history, without sounding like a text book or the back of a baseball card. He gives fans a rare, truthful behind-the-scenes look at a sport that may be growing too fast for its own godd. A super read, especially for those interesting in what goes on in the race shops, sponsor tents and driver's trailers."},{"Title":"WHEELS: A Season on Nascar's Winston Cup Circuit","review":"Either Paul Hemphill put the wrong title on this book or he got sidetracked during the process of writing it. The book purports to be the story of the 1996 NASCAR season, but it is instead a meandering tale covering everything from the origins of stock car racing to the fortunes of some minor-league dirt-track racer. If he wanted to write a book on the history of the sport, then he should have done so and not tried to shoehorn that information into a book supposedly about one season. The book is well-written and meticulously researched, but it does a poor job of capturing what was one of the most intriguing and exciting points races in recent years. Hemphill glosses over several of the season's races, perhaps in order to save space for his entertaining yet frivoulous tales of moonshiners and drunk, racist fans. He also spends far too much time playing up the battle between Dale Earnhardt and Jeff Gordon. There are 40 other drivers on the circuit, many of whom get just a passing mention. Hemphill would have been better served by spending a little more time with the drivers and less time with the old bootleggers"},{"Title":"The Harrowing of Gwynedd (The Heirs of Saint Camber, Vol. 1)","review":"This was an excellent book. I hope that this won't be the end of this generation of characters in the Deryni series. All of Ms. Kurtz novels feature main characters of strong moral value, and this is not an exception. This is a novel full of the usual well written and thought out scenes, and strong charaters. It is, as are of her Ms. Kurtz books enjoyable and believable. It has a good number of surprises as well, and it's own fair share of suspense and intrigue. The charaters struggle and risk all they have for what the feel is the greater good. They stop at nothing to do what is right, and accomplish it while attempting to hurt as few others along the way as possible. this is a page turner of a book. It won't dissapoint."},{"Title":"The Harrowing of Gwynedd (The Heirs of Saint Camber, Vol. 1)","review":"I have mixed feelings about the Deryni series. At it's best it is very authentic, mixing a very detailed pseudo-pagan medievalism with a well thought out magical system. It fails sometimes though in the characterizations and motivations and gets rather gimmicky and embarrassingly self-imitative at times. But this book is not one of those. The books featuring St Camber and his children and the beginning of the Haldane line are generally quite fun and illustrate medieval religious issues in a fantasy format. I haven't come across too many books that deal with the issue of Sainthood in an almost physical way, which is odd because there are so many medieval based fantasy characters out there. Or if I have come across fantasy books featuring the issue of Sainthood they must have been so bad I can't remember any of them. This one is good. All the more so since it studies a character who was both admirable and interesting. And as I remember it, it's been awhile, the plot has some surprising quirks. You might want to read the three previous books that feature Camber himself, or you might want to let this story introduce you to the legend."},{"Title":"The Harrowing of Gwynedd (The Heirs of Saint Camber, Vol. 1)","review":"I applaud Katherine Kurtz's ability to introduce her characters to all readers so that they feel like family.

Over the years I've become more accepting of the views and positions of the characters other than Penrod and Sam (e.g. Penrod's parents and older sister, Sam's older brother, Marjorie Jones, Maurice Levy, and even Penrod's little dog Duke) but this maturity of viewpoint adds to the overall pleasure of the books and does not detract at all from the sidesplitting comic effects evoked by the combination of Penrod's scrapes and Booth Tarkington's deadpan (and sometimes mock-heroic) narrative descibing these scrapes. The story of \\"The Great Tar Fight\\" rivals the chapter on the last day of school in \\"Tom Sawyer\\" for sheer sustained humor.I would like to mention in passing that in three of the four best American books about boyhood (\\"Tom Sawyer\\", \\"Penrod\\", \\"The City Boy\\" (by Herman Wouk) and \\"Huckleberry Finn\\") the protagonists of the first three each have a strong crush on a particular girl. Since Tom, Penrod and Herbie are all eleven years old in their respective books, we see a certain flouting of the \\"no girls allowed\\", all-male clubhouse attitude usually depicted as typical of boys of that age."},{"Title":"Penrod","review":"This turn of the century (turn of the LAST century) novel appears to be the first in a too-short series. The book is both fun and funny which don't always go together.As far as racism, sexism, elitism goes, kids are bright enough to not only figure them out, but to realize the author was making a point about them, just as Mark Twain attempted to do.I would classify this as a must-read for kids and a should-read for adults."},{"Title":"Penrod","review":"I first read this book some time in the 1920s.

Wodehouse, whose style and word mastery resembles him. You may find yourself surprised. A great American book."},{"Title":"Penrod","review":"In the days before a book like \\"Penrod\\" would be frowned upon by the mainstream media and stand almost no chance of getting published, there lived a man named Booth Tarkington. He was a wise observer of human nature who mastered the psychology of human interactions, especially those pertaining to pre-adolescent boys.Yes, Tarkington knew boys. He knew how they acted, why they acted, what they wanted, what they feared, and he wrote a series of books using this knowledge--\\"Penrod,\\" \\"Penrod and Sam,\\" and \\"Penrod Jashber,\\" all centering around the misadventures of an exuberant, character-filled, eleven-year old named, you guessed it, Penrod Schofield.With the lyricism and observational skills of a poet, Booth Tarkington chronicles carefree days in the young life of Penrod with innocent beauty. He takes us on a joyful romp through a boy's life in a time when boys were much freer to be just that--boys. Akin to Mark Twain's (in)famous Tom Sawyer, Penrod is a rascal, a rapscallion, getting into constant trouble at school, with his family, and with neighborhood boys, yet he is also a clever and creative young lad whom the confines of school and family and boring routine just cannot keep dormant. He is constantly coming up with new ideas that adults just shake their heads at but his fellow exuberant boys understand. And he's a romantic; he is unabashedly in love with the beautiful Marjorie Jones, and their turbulent attraction is a witty embodiment of the immortal bad boy-good girl romance. Penrod is the essence of boyhood.Booth Tarkington's \\"Penrod\\" is absolutely alive with nothing but pure spirit, almost as much as the boy himself. Today spirit like that would be misunderstood in young males and stifled by the world at large, but as for this beautiful work by Booth Tarkington, it will always be just Penrod, his dog, and his friend Sam, living life day by day in a simpler America."},{"Title":"Penrod","review":"As good as when I read it more than 30 years ago.

These three novels span a 44-year period of time in publication, yet it's interesting how similar they are in incident (the children having to submit to \\"adult\\" forms of entertainment [performing in plays, putting on recitations, taking dancing lessons], boyhood fights against bullies, resorting to mild forms of blackmail to get unwelcomed things done, perplexing adults with all forms of mischievous [but relatively harmless] behavior); I doubt that would be the case over these last 44 years. Penrod's list of misadventures includes being embarrassed before everyone at the school play, daydreaming at school and making a fool of himself, getting sick on too much candy, dipping Victorine's pigtails in the inkwell, fighting over the attention of Marjorie Jones, and embarrassing Mrs. Bassett in front of the minister. As Tom Sawyer once dreamed of dying to \\"teach his ungrateful aunt a lesson,\\" Penrod has his fantastical adventure novel he's writing in which he recasts all his disappointments in a much more daring and heroic light. Tarkington has a good ear for the talk of children, and the style in which he writes is sharply comical and appealing to adults. Still a funny book today."},{"Title":"Penrod","review":"I just wanted to note that the Doris Day movies &quot;On Moonlight Bay&quot; and &quot;By the Light of the Silvery Moon&quot; were based on the Penrod stories."},{"Title":"Penrod","review":"I am an eleven year old boy and an avid reader. I fully understand Penrod's unique qualities being his age and love the book. I read the book in about two days the first time and spent almost a year reading and reading this timeless classic. You will get years of amusement from this great book. I can fully relate to Penrod being somewhat like him. Two thumbs up."},{"Title":"Penrod","review":"Booth Tarkington's humorous tales of 12-year old Penrod Schofield compare favorably with Mark Twain's novels Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn and Rudyard Kipling's Starky and Friends. The immensely popular Penrod (1914) was followed by Penrod and Sam (1916) and Penrod Jashber (1929).Unfortunately, some of Tarkington's tales of young Penrod reflect the commonplace racial prejudice of early twentieth century America. This prejudice is not mean-spirited nor vicious, but nonetheless some stories may be unsettling to today's readers. Racial prejudice is not front and center, but is simply part of the background. Racial comments are made in a casual, off-handed, unconscious fashion.Penrod Schofield is a typical boy. He has little interest in being a perfect young gentleman (and in fact considers the term somewhat pejorative). He is not bad boy by any means, but he does seem to be continually in trouble. He is embarrassed by his forced participation in school plays and dance classes, and always seems to offend the only girl for whom he has some liking.At one point Penrod quickly makes friends with two young black boys, Herman and Verman, and persuades them to participate in an exhibition as Herman the one-fingered tatood wild man and Verman the savage tatood wild boy who talks only in his native languages. Their small earnings from their amateur carnival are shared fairly. Penrod is particularly impressed that their father was in jail: \\"Pappy cut a man, an' de police done kep' him in jail sense Chris'mus-time; but dey goin' tuhn him loose ag'in nex' week.\\"A later chapter in which Herman and Verman save Penrod from a white bully is titled Coloured Troops in Action. The reader recognizes that Penrod's occasional expressions like darky boy (and other more objectionable terms) are never intentionally offensive, but are simply common speech (and hence reflections of a pervasive, socially acceptable prejudice, not a personal prejudice on Penrod's part.)Nonetheless, Tarkington's Penrod tales are not likely to be found in classrooms today. Rightly or wrongly, later generations (and certainly recent generations) hold earlier generations to new standards. There is much to be said for and against political correctness, but it is a shame when earlier literature is ignored (a prejudicial censorship?) for modern sins.Penrod provides a fascinating insight into how completely racial prejudice permeated American society in the early twentieth century. A creative high school history teacher might use Penrod as an illustration that societal norms do change in relatively short periods. In any event I recommend Penrod to any reader with a little tolerance for past prejudices and past intolerances.Booth Tarkington is a lesser known author today, although other than William Faulkner, he is the only author to have been awarded the Pulitzer Prize in fiction twice - The Magnificent Ambersons (1918) and Alice Adams (1921)."},{"Title":"Penrod","review":"After all these years, it was a treat to read a chapter or two of \\"Penrod\\" taking me back to a much simpler time.

It was a great story about a 12 year old boy named penrod along with his faithful companion duke and his friends Sam,Verman, and Herman. The gang was always clashing with adults and teacherS making it a humurous story about young boys getting into mischief. Its an amazing story that yound adults can relate to as well as adults in their past experiences in their school days. It almost feels as if ur part of the group and your right along with them starting trouble. From anything to skipping a pageant to dipping a girls hair in ink. Its an amazing story about teenagers living an average life in an urban city living and coping with everyday problems."},{"Title":"Penrod","review":"How can romantic comedies about ADULTS be based on the Penrod novels?!? It just doesn't make any sense. If they really are, they must take extreme liberties with the plot.

But circumstances and timing conspire in such a way that he manages to leave a trail of destruction everywhere he goes. This book chronicles Penrod's adventures with his buddy, Sam, his dog, Duke, and his new neighbors, brothers Herman and Verman. It's a hilarious, madcap romp that quickly covers a lot of ground and frequently leaves Penrod's backside smarting at the hand of his exasperated father.If you enjoyed Tom Sawyer or Huck Finn, then do yourself a favor and read Penrod. It's a page-turner, laugh-out-loud funny, and a classic in its own right. For decades, Penrod was very popular novel. But it fails today's litmus test of political correctness, so it is probably doomed to be forgotten. And that's a real tragedy. Penrod is beautifully written. It is filled with love, wit, and charm. And ninety years after it was written, most of what it has to say about people still rings true. Whenever I need a dose of innocence, humor, and insightful commentary on the human condition, I know I can rely on Tarkington to deliver the goods.

Unfortunately, everything he does gets him in trouble with the adults around him--teachers, parents, parents of neighbors. And Penrod is always bewildered about the fact that he is in trouble, bewildered by the fact that he takes a beating at punishment, and equally bewildered by the times he escapes punishment.Of course, as a preteen, he is also bewildered by girls. He has a crush on a girl living in his neighborhood, but is completely unaware of how to get him to like her. She refers to him as the worst boy in town, and demands that he never speak to her. Interestingly she angers him even more by calling him a \\"little gentleman\\" than she does by ignoring him and calling him the worst boy in town.

It is the only book I have ever read eight times. Writing with remarkable prose, Booth Tarkington weaves the kind of tale that would cause any middle-age spread to jiggle with the laughter it evokes.

Well it is not even that he is a bad child it is just that he gets blamed for every thing that happens; for instance when his sisters dress disappears and ends up in dukes dog house and Penrod got blamed for it even though duke took it. He enjoys writing, and playing with his dog Duke who is almost always with him. Penrod thinks of himself as the class clown and tends not to be very truthful. Penrod has an unimportant role in the school production of The Round Table, but do not tell him that because he thinks if he dose not go the show will not go on with out him. Through out the book Penrod grows up a lot in my opinion for example he tell his father the truth at the end of the book which I did not think would happen. He does get in a lot of trouble whether it's eating too much candy or squealing on his sister.I did not like Penrod because it was in my opinion aimed more for boys and not as much towards girls or maybe it was just me but I was not entertained through out the whole book. There were most definitely parts I liked for example parts were Penrod is in conversation; one part I did not like was the excerpts from Penrod's book about how Mr. Wilson is killed. I liked the conversational parts because through out the book you are kind of in Penrod's head, and I did not like that. But in conversation you sort of get both views from both people not just what Penrod thinks. Don't lie because no one will believe you even if you are right, that is the moral of this story.

The person who wrote the piece was under the impression that Tarkington was approving of racism. (Such people tend to make the same mistake regarding Mark Twain.) Actually, Tarkington considered himself progressive regarding race relations, despite the racist stereotypes that are so glaring in the Penrod novels to contemporary eyes. There are quite a few wink and nod approvals of the books for the same mistaken reason as at AR here, so I've decided to debunk it.Beyond the racist aspect, are the Penrod novels good children's literature? Not really. They're rather formulaic. Tarkington was neither a Carroll nor a Dickens. There are better books from the past and the present. Unless you are a white supremacist or Far Right sort, I doubt that you will want your child to be exposed to material that is, despite the intent of the author, indoctrination into both sexism and racism.

So that's lucky, right?Llewellyn's did something different this year. Instead of breaking the articles by season... they have broken them into the four elements. A radical but obvious way to organize magical information! My impressions:Earth Magic:Great articles include a look at Powerful Objects and Ritual Tools, Fulgurite: Crystalized Lightning (very interesting), Herbcraft, Labyrinths, and Kitchen Witchcraft.Air Magic:A Pagen look at subjects like Color Magic, Incants and Song, Living Together in Magic and how to act within groups, and a great article I really enjoyed was how to bring Air magic into your life without incense and smudgesticks (for us \\"non-smokers\\").Fire Magic:How to light up your magical life with Candles, Deity Magic, Children and Ritual, How to make your own Magic Wands and Staffs, Creating Sigils (signs of magic), and the Stars.Water Magic:Brewing up articles on Relationships and Emotions, Love Magic, Potions, Brews and Oils, Magical Baths, Being Spiritally Social, Empathy, Dealing with Loss, and Moon Lore.I was really happily surprised by this approach of seperating articles by element. The Almanac Section naturally gives you day by day info on Holidays, Moon Phases, Color of the Day, Incense of the Day and many holiday recipes.The Llewellyn's Magical Almanac has been a great reference for me for almost 15 years.

In this extremely well written book Dirschel describes hell in the following way: &quot;...the time spent there never changes and no matter how much you may feel prepared to face the day ahead, once you get there it is always so much worse than your worst anticipation. That is just the way it is.&quot;Simplicity is a story of the condemned of society being damned to hell, but in a twist of fate some are turned into vampires: &quot;Hell is a horrible place but at least for the vampire, it does go away.&quot;Dirschel does a brilliant job of allowing the reader to not only glimpse into the bowels of hell, according to his fictional accounting, he offers the age old story of the vampire life in a unique way; through the lives of two people who not only don't seem to fit in, they demonstrate that sometimes in hell, the &quot;hell&quot; they thought they'd experienced while still living pales in comparison.This horror novel seems to be a documentary of the fallen amongst the living who fall even farther on the other side, even as vampires. Preying on the underbelly of society by night, they are condemned to a &quot;living&quot; hell of tortuous acts against their feeling selves by day.At times the reader will want to read with only one eye open, much like the way horror films are often watched. The reader may even fell nauseous reading the pages of descriptions of the torture of the day because it is so well crafted.All the senses are brought to life with the reading of this journey into hell. And yet it is a love story of a different nature, so creatively woven it defies the reader to not believe it actually took place, knowing full well that vampires do not exist...or do they?The reader will be drained and have much to ponder about how they live their life: a poweful deterrent to not wanting to be condemned to hell everlasting is found within the pages of this phenomenal book Excellent."},{"Title":"Simplicity","review":"A new author, a new book . . .I am greatly surprised at how captivated I am with this book.

I have almost finished it and I don't want it to end!"},{"Title":"Simplicity","review":"For the fan of horror, Mark Dirshchel's, Simplicity, deserves a top spot on your bookshelf among the likes of 'Salem's Lot, Interview With The Vampire and yes, even Stoker's Dracula. In addition to weaving a strong story of modern day vampirism replite with human frailities and love, Dirshchel creates an unbelievable depiction of Hell. When I finished reading his book, I couldn't help but examine the meaning of Faith...and you will too because absolutely no one would ever want to visit Dirshchel's Hell and meet one-on-one with the likes of Pink."},{"Title":"Simplicity","review":"I have to admit that I don't usually get into books of this nature, but after my husband finished reading Mr. Dirschel's thrilling tale of horror, he insisted that I at least read the first chapter of this story.I'm here to tell you that after reading only the first few pages, I was hooked. &quot;Simplicity&quot; held me spellbound throughout the whole story. I could not put this book down!Mr. Dirschel's talent for storytelling so effortlessly glided me with his expert choice of words into his makebelieve world of a vampire. A world of stunning horror and shocking intensity, and yet he still managed to weave in just the right mixture of beauty and romance to make his story more than just another horror story. I truly believe this is one of the best stories out on the market today.&quot;Simplicity&quot; is a story that oddly I find myself still thinking about almost two weeks after I finished reading the book. And now I strangely find muself looking forward to this writer's next novel."},{"Title":"Simplicity","review":"I have to write something after reading all the rave reviews about this book. I've nursed my feelings about this book, hoping that someone would write an honest review and spare me this uncomfortable task.But here goes.The story is disjointed. It erratically jumps in time. After a while, it didn't really matter at what point the story picks up from the previous chapter because there was little to no build-up in the plot. It just stagnated like a dead corpse.The characters are meatless. Patrick, the protagonist, moves from an existence as a smelly drunk to a non-existence as a gloomy vampire. Lori, Patrick's love interest, literally jumps into hopelessness and took me with her, agonizing with every meaningless expression along the way. I couldn't feel anything for Lori or for Patrick. Their love affair was as dry as their souls.Only Pink, a vile haunting demon, managed to stir something within me, complete disgust, which represents the only emotion I felt for the book, otherwise the book would have earned one star.The book was also full of errors. Frustrating, pull-your-hair-out types of errors become noticeable only when they are as numerous as they are in this book. I found myself asking what the author really meant to say through too many incorrect sentences. This was a frustrating effort when all I wanted to do was read a good story, as the many good reviews led me to expect.I was very disappointed, and I'm not sure if the disgust I felt while reading the book was due to its dismal quality or due to its only memorable character, the demon, Pink. Mark Dirschel's noteworthy achievement with this work is to create a totally disgusting character, something that even overshadowed the bad grammar, and that character is Pink."},{"Title":"Simplicity","review":"\\"The vividness of this initial memory threatens to open my emotional reservoir and spill tears of misery down my cheeks but of course, I will not allow that. If I had passed out before my eyes fell upon her, perhaps her beauty never would have taken me in and things would be different now. I would not have to undergo this pathetic soul searching just to set myself free. Alas, what's done is done and I believe the ability to cry has been dead inside me even longer than my cold and rotten heart. Violent anger, white-hot and seething in its intensity has replaced it. Pardon me while I take another drink so that I can continue.\\"Simplicity is a visually poignant view of a man's struggle to maintain his eternal soul. His story is one of powerful emotions tempered with a desperate need to survive under the considerable forces of evil that surrounds him. Patrick is an unforgettable character with a life force that permeates through the reader's mind and heart making him impossible to ignore.Dirschel's use of first person throughout this novel created the images and the character development that very few writers ever achieve. It constantly reminded me of reading Poe. I felt Patrick's frustrations. I heard his screams. I lived in his world of both dark and light. This novel left me spellbound. I can hardly wait to read his next one."},{"Title":"Simplicity","review":"If anyone had told me I would read a book about vampires, let alone become engrossed in the story, I would have laughed in their face. But that was before I read Simplicity. Mr. Dirschel creates a provocative tale here. The narrative was finely crafted and the characters memorable. Be warned. The subject matter is often troubling and sometimes grotesque, but that does not negate the fact that Mr. Dirschel writes very well.Patrick has been homeless since his middle teens. A hopeless alcoholic, he considers himself to be \\"an invalid eyesore of a man.\\" His crib is wherever he can find shelter for the night. His days are spent begging to buy whiskey and a little food to keep himself alive and moving. One night he sees a lovely young girl contemplating jumping off the bridge above his concrete shelter. Her blonde hair, sweet face, and soft skin stir feelings in him that he thought were long since pickled into nothingness. To his shock, this lovely vision talks with him as if he were human, treats him kindly. One night later Patrick watches Lori jump to her death from the bridge. And that is where the real story begins.Before the moment of impact, Lori is swept away by a dark spirit - Van Pierre - and turned into a vampire. The next night she returns to Patrick with Van Pierre. Because of his soft feelings for Lori, he is rather easily turned into a creature of the night. Patrick has always believed that hatred, disgust and apathy poison man's soul. But he soon experiences hellish scenes so horrible that even a soulless vampire creature is sickened. Despite his status as human stalker, Patrick retains a bit of his softness. He lives by certain rules, refusing to kill families or children. And he still loves Lori. By night Patrick prowls for sustenance. By day he is tormented by his vile demon keeper, Pink. Tortures too graphically horrible to comprehend are inflicted in Pink's attempts to turn Patrick to Satan's way and break his spirit. Patrick writes a journal in an attempt to purge the final ghastly cries of love from his black heart. Simplicity is that journal.Scenes of graphic violence and vampire sexuality make this book too disturbing for sensitive readers or children. I cannot recommend it for all, but will repeat that - despite the sometimes horrible depictions of Patrick's life - Mark Dirschel's writing is powerful."},{"Title":"Simplicity","review":"When I first started this book, I didn't know for sure if I liked it or not. It was slow. We got past page 60 before the first \\"bite\\" of a vampire. But after that, the story got far more interesting, and I found myself captivated by it. Make no mistake... this is NOT \\"Twilight\\", where it's cool and even fun to be a vampire. This reminds us that being a vampire is anything but cool. It reminds us that vampires are, in fact, dammed souls.This is not a horror story. It is not even a thriller. Rather, it is an exploratory journey into the bowels of Hell. It postulates that during the daylight hours, when vampires are \\"asleep\\", their souls go to Hell...every day...without let up. Although the night brings respite from their hellish experience, they are cursed for all eternity. And if a vampire does get \\"killed\\", he spends ALL of his time in Hell.The descriptions of Hell are numerous and frequent. They make Dante's Inferno look like a pleasant walk in the park. Revolting, Disgusting, nauseating, gross, foul, terrifying... these are just some of the emotions you will feel, yet none of them by themselves adequately describe the Hell the author portrays. Put together, they come close. No one escapes. There is no happy ending.This is not for the faint of heart, or weak stomach. Yet in a perverse way, I must congratulate Mr. Dirschel for a well written journey into a realm most of us really would rather avoid. When I finished reading, I felt as though I had been through the ringer. My emotions left me shaking, and preoccupied for a long time afterwards. Sounds like a good book, right?"},{"Title":"Simplicity","review":"Mark Dirschel's, \\"SIMPLICITY\\" is without question one of the best written books I have ever read and flat out scared me to death. It is one book I could not put down. I found myself wandering back, just to hold the book and try in some way to figure out the hold SIMPLICITY had on me. It was like a magnet, pulling me in its direction. Stephen King's novels should take a note from SIMPLICITY. Mark's intelligence glows in graphic descriptions of his characters, spilling them forth in vivid colors, graphically seducing you into a fearful society. SIMPLICITY sends you into a nightmaring hell by day and thrusts you head long into a world of vampires by night. Patrick, a transient person is trapped by Lori and the love he feels for her. Tricked into drinking from the \\"masters\\" cup, Lori seduces and cajoles Patrick into her own suicidal hell and forces Patrick to endure an everlasting lust for blood. SIMPLICITY'S horror is more than a simple transformation of death, it is death chosen by will and by force far greater than human concept. Fire, brimstone, hatred, vile contempt and an undying love for Lori, engages Patrick to persue his aching desire to survive the undead. This book would make a great movie! 5 stars to Mark Dirschel for an outstanding book."},{"Title":"Simplicity","review":"Mark really goes over the top and nails this one. You might want to buy some garlic and wooden stakes before you read this book.I cannot wait to get me hands on his other books."},{"Title":"Simplicity","review":"Trip along with me for a moment and imagine a vampire with a poet's soul who will unequivocally disprove the myth that men don't feel love as deeply as women. Intrigued? Meet Patrick, the undead hero of Simplicity, who sentences himself to Hell for the woman he loves. Patrick knows more about selflessness, unconditional love, charisma, and seduction than do most romantic leading men.When he meets Lori, Patrick is a filthy vagrant whose daily beggings are spent on food only if there's enough left after he buys his beloved bottle, and Lori is a damaged beauty who keeps trying to kill herself but never quite succeeds. They spend what is supposed to be Lori's last night alive talking together under the bridge where Patrick lives and from which Lori jumps--right into the arms of Van Pierre, a recruiter for Hell's army. When she returns to Patrick the next night and bids him drink from the dark man's chalice, he obeys without question because he loves her already, and they are plunged into the world of nightly bloodlust.As horrified as they are by what they've become, they can't deny the thrill of their new powers. Patrick is more than willing to suffer every day while he sleeps and his soul returns to Hell to be tortured unmercifully by Pink, his personal demon, as long as he gets to be with Lori every night when he awakens. But Lori is still haunted by her life and continues to plan her own demise even though it means she will remain in Hell forever and will be leaving Patrick--the only man who has ever really loved her--alone for eternity.Simplicity is like a 435-page paradox: one minute it's a gruesome peepshow of demonic torture sessions that revolted me more than Stephen King at his goriest, and the next it's a sensitive commentary on man's inhumanity to man and our deep-seated desire to be valued and loved for ourselves. I was just as moved by Patrick's quest for Lori's love as I was repulsed by the descriptions of his visits to Hell. I can't tell you how odd it feels to be inspired by the insights of a vampire, but Patrick's musings read like an essay on enlightenment. The thinking person's horror story, if you will.And since vampires exist for eternity, I sure hope there's another journey into Patrick's world in our literary future."},{"Title":"Simplicity","review":"SIMPLICITY was the most horrid book I have ever tried to get through !!

The author extrapolates information from the earliest Christian sources we already have to give us a clear picture of how Jesus' earliest Jewish followers interpreted his identity and his mission with the conclusion that this was passed on to them by Jesus himself.The author takes those portions of the New Testament which could only have been written and understood by first century Jews and for first century Jews. These writings have an affinity for the kind of Jewish sectarian ideas that are found in the Dead Sea Scrolls. These writings include Matthew, John, Hebrews, James, I and II Peter, the Johannine episles, Jude, and Revelation. The Gospel of Mark and Luke and the bulk of the Pauline Epistles were clearly written for a gentile audience. However, there are primitive declarations embedded in Paul's writings which he could not have made up.Other products of primitive Jewish Christianity include the Didache, the Greek version of The Testimony of the Twelve Patriarchs, and The Similitudes of Enoch. The Nag Hammadi gospels of Thomas and Philip and the Pseudo-Clementine writings were products of later forms of heterodox Jewish Christianity.A variety of messianic titles and figures identified with Jesus that would only make sense to messianic Jews of the first century include: an archangel (a heavenly mediator); an eschatological Mosaic prophet; The Name of the Lord (by which Jesus worked miracles); the Righteous One (used in James); the Shepherd and Lamb (denoting God's relationship to Israel); the rejected stone; the firstborn Son of God; and the Heavenly High Priest (Melchizedek).Jesus was reticent to declare himself as a messiah and his Davidic kingship was somewhat muted to avoid political controversies which would have destroyed the movement right from the start. However, the author demonstrates that Jesus' followers could hardly have believed that his actions fulfilled prophecies unless Jesus believed himself to be the Messiah.The title Lord was given to Jesus very early as evidenced by the most ancient eucharistic prayer invoking his presence which was retained in Aramaic, \\"Maranatha\\" (our Lord come). The extensive use of Psalm 110:1 in the New Testament also reinforces this title. The phrase our God and Lord Jesus referred to two separate entities, God and Jesus, and were not a threat to Jewish monotheism. The term \\"Word\\" used in John's prologue was a theme used in Jewish Wisdom literature and was a product of the more Hellenized Judaism found in Asia Minor where the Johannine writings originated.The author demonstrates that Jesus most commonly referred to himself as Son of Man in reference to Daniel 7. This is a vague term that would be unintelligible to gentiles but combines the elements of suffering and vindication. Jesus undoubtedly saw himself as the suffering servant of Isaiah. Jesus' suffering and death echoes the theme of Isaac submitting to his own proposed sacrifice. This was a common motif employed in first century Judaism.The resurrection was the inspiration which fueled his followers' convictions that he was the Messiah. This could only have been supported by what Jesus had taught them previously in regard to himself as a fulfillment of prophecies. This belief ultimately came from Jesus himself.The author does a masterful job of tearing down previous theories of celebrated liberal scholars such as Bultmann who claimed all of these messianic claims about Jesus were legendary and projected back into the Gospels at a later date. The New Testament is an accurate reflection of what Jesus believed about himself."},{"Title":"THE CHRISTOLOGY OF EARLY JEWISH CHRISTIANITY (Studies in Biblical Theology, Second Series-17).","review":"All serious students of early Church history and Christian origins should be thankful to Regent College for republishing this book that originally appeared in nineteen seventy. While this book was written early in the extended and productive career of Richard Longenecker, it is a challenging work of meticulous scholarship which provides incisive insights and analysis. Fully conversant with all prior scholarship and the source documents including the Dead Sea Scrolls, the author's arguments are well developed and stimulating. Disconcerting to some will be the author's unquestioning acceptance of the resurrection of Jesus and the activities of the Holy Spirit in the early Church. Whether this is a reflection of the author's faith or merely a respect for the intellectual integrity of his sources matters little. It is my contention that to dismiss these supernatural constructs as anti-rational misses the point. The fact is that the acceptance of such phenomenon in the first century CE was widespread. To exclude or explain away the resurrection and the activities of the Holy Spirit in any reconstruction of this history leads to tortured and distorted interpretations. In my opinion, it is a remarkable post Enlightenment scholarly conceit to dismiss the \\"realities\\" of the past to create naturalistically correct alternative histories. The acceptance of Jesus' resurrection by His earliest followers is seen by the author as pivotal in the formation of their thoughts regarding Him.This book is broken up into five chapters the first of which is a introduction detailing the issues to be considered with an explanation of the methods to be used and scope of the inquiry to be pursued. The second chapter deals with some \\"Distinctive Images and Motifs\\" that occur in the New Testament that refer to Jesus. Among the topics covered here are angelomorphic Christology, the eschatological Mosaic prophet, the Name of God and more. All these titles and attributes as applied to Jesus are shown to be early and specifically Jewish Christian in origin. And, while some of this material was absorbed into the developing orthodox Church, other aspects of it stayed almost exclusively in Jewish Christian sectarian circles where it persisted for a number of centuries after His death. Skipping to the fourth chapter, Longenecker considers Jesus' \\"Lordship and Its Attendant Features.\\" Distinctions are drawn here supporting the contention that the Lordship of Jesus Christ was a congenial construct in the Gentile mission based both upon His resurrection and exaltation. In this milieu, the messiahship of Jesus was just not as relevant as among the Judeans. The appellations for Jesus considered here are the Lord, God, savior, and the word. On one hand, in the Pauline epistles to the gentiles, it is noted that Jesus Christ was used as a proper name with the Lord as an appellative. On the other hand, Peter refers to \\"Jesus, our Lord and Christ\\" in a Jewish Christian setting where \\"Lord\\" and \\"Christ\\" are both titles. But, generally in Jewish Christian circles the predominate titles for Jesus referenced messiahship.The third chapter is titled \\"Messiahship and Its Implications.\\" The concept of the messiah is first addressed comparatively by considering Essenic thought as reflected in the sectarian documents from Qumran, as developed in the Jewish Christian documents of the New Testament, and in the Simon Bar Kosibah fragments from Wadi Murrabba. Fully explored is the nationalistic, warrior \\"Messiah\\" and King who was generally expected to appear in late second temple Judaism. Then the very different messiahship of Jesus is described. A strong case is made that among His early followers in Palestine the consciousness of His messiahship was directly a result of their acceptance of His resurrection and post resurrectional teachings. Next, careful attention is paid to the displacement of the \\"Son of Man\\" as a title. While it may have been an exceedingly useful self designation for Jesus in His ministry, its lack of usefulness in the Jewish mission as an appelative led to its early subordination. Other messianic motifs considered are the Son of God, God's Salvation, the suffering servant, Davidic kingship, and Jesus as the perfected high priest. Each of these is well developed and analyzed and deserves further discussion. However, space prohibits. Suffice it to say that this is very informative but complex material that calls for intense study and contemplation. Ultimately, and at the risk of repetition, what stands out in Longenecker's work is the centrality of the resurrection of Jesus as the primary validating factor for the revelation of His messiahship to His earliest Jewish followers.Chapter five is a short conclusion drawing together all the materials previously explicated. It shows how in the broad context of the early Church these \\"strands and thoughts\\" coalesced so as to affirm the messiahship and exaltation of Jesus which led to His recognition as Lord, Savior and yes, Divine. Also, of interest is Longenecker's analysis of prior scholarship. His extremely cogent presentation traces the development of German scholarly thought on Christology from the nineteenth century right up to the publication of this work. The author readily acknowledges the dominance of this construct in academic discourse on the subject. This earlier paradigm still underlies much of even the most recent scholarship on the historical Jesus. Both the contemporary \\"Jesus Seminar\\" and \\"Jewish Jesus\\" schools owe deep intellectual debts to post enlightenment German thought. And, that debt is rarely even acknowledged. Nor is scholarship such as presented in this book often engaged by those offering differing views. Interpretations such as developed in this work are largely dismissed cavalierly as \\"evangelical apologetics.\\" Once again, the shameful balkanization of the study of Christian origins into competing ideological camps comes into stark relief. Whether one disagrees with Longenecker or not, this is valuable scholarship that deserves to be confronted. Merely, accepting the thoughts of Johannes Weiss and Albert Schweitzer as refined by Rudolph Bultmann and his followers as \\"the received truth\\" is counterproductive to disciplinary progress. And, I think it is also highly polemic and susceptible to the charge of being agenda driven."},{"Title":"More Alike than Different: An Inspiring Message for Anyone Coping with Life's Difficulties","review":"I love this book more than anything I have ever read.

They are forced to hold the party at the home of Beverly's ex-husband Tom who divorced her to marry Leigh. A gracious Beverly insures no one feels uncomfortable. Later that night, Dr. Bill's body is found tightly wedged in a drawn wrenched ditch. Nobody knows the cause of death but rumors abound. Shortly thereafter, Leigh disappears. Julie finds the body believing that the same person murdered both people.The protagonist, trying to achieve justice for the dead, almost finds herself becoming the third victim of a demented killer. Her bravery and unwavering quest for the truth as well as her loyalty to friends and family are only some of the reasons the heroine is easy to like. Sad to say, the killer's identity is totally believable and raises some interesting legal and social issues. After a two-year absence, it is good to see the Purple Sage gang reunited again.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Skeletons in Purple Sage","review":"With Skeletons in Purple Sage, Barbara Burnett Smith hascreated a very appealing heroine in Jolie Wyatt, arealistic and interesting family and a whole town ofcharacters, good and bad.A disasterous flood has brought the Governor to townto asses the damage and Jolie has been picked to hosta reception - difficult to do when the site is undersix feet of water.The next available location is logical but difficult,since the hostess is the new wife of Jolie's good friend'sEx. After that, the discovery of the body of the town'sbeloved doctor in a ditch just piles on the trouble.Jolie wants to find out who took her doctor's life, whythe local fundamentalist church is shunning the doctor'sfuneral and why her Mother always liked her sister best.I strongly recomment this book for its character developmentand the exciting plot."},{"Title":"Problems and Solutions in Quantum Mechanics","review":"This is a superb difficult book, not for the faint-hearted. It contains solutions involving Green's Functions and Propagators, not usully found in such books. Don't look for detailed solutions to the \\"usual suspects\\" - if they're there, they are there to support the more challening problems. The solutions do not always include as many steps as I like to include. Filling them in adds to one's understanding of the method of solution. I didn't always like the path the book tread and followed a different one - at least I had something to compare to 5 pages later. (The book's solution was nearly always (if not, always) superior to mine. But you know \\"My solution, right or wrong, but my solution!\\"The problems are at a level (and some correspond to) the text by Mertzbacher. I showed the book to my QM professor and his response was to write down the ISBN. Not every type of problem at this level is solved and I would get Zetelli's \\"Quantum Physics\\" to fill in gaps, say in WKB and Angular Momentum. There are a number of other useful books, for example, \\"Problems and Solutions in Quantum Mechanics\\" written in China based on US university qualifying exam problems, and a short, but very good, book from Cambridge U. Press: Squires - \\"Problems in Quantum Mechanics - with Solutions\\" which covers problems through time-dependent perturbation theory."},{"Title":"Seattle: Past to Present","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I'm surprised to see it doesn't have ANY reviews so far... This book introduced me to a real love for Seattle history. More people should read it!"},{"Title":"The Ghost in the House: Motherhood, Raising Children, and Struggling with Depression","review":"If I hadn't seen an ongoing discussion with the author online and heard about this book, I probably would not have picked it up since I do not suffer much from depression. But the discussion has sparked an interest and since I do have relatives that suffer from depression, I was intrigued enough to read it.The topic may sound off-putting but I can honestly say that this is one of the best laid-out and well-written books I have read in a long time. From the very first paragraph, Thompson grabs the reader's attention and holds it till the last page has been turned. Even then, you're finding yourself wishing that you have a little bit more money in your pocket to buy this book for all the women in your life. (And some for the men to better understand their wives!)This is a book that explains a taboo subject. It explores Post-Partum depression (not as thoroughly as other books may have) but also, maternal depression, which I will admit that I have never heard of. But the stories of individuals in this book have made it real and something noteworthy to explore. Thompson has made a concise exploration into this study. She makes the issue personal since she does suffer from depression. Her stories and other women's stories have given maternal depression a name and I never realized that it was so common till I read this book. She gives the reader a better understanding about depression, what kind of help you can get now and there is even a chapter on rat/monkey studies that is very interesting.This is science mixed in with intimate details. It is a book that teaches you something new and makes it interesting. It makes you pause in reflection and gives you a better understanding on what maternal depression really is. It helps maybe to feel a little bit less alone in this struggle and for me, it does help me understand those in my family who suffers from depression a bit more. This book really should be read by everyone to shed a little bit more light on a dark disease of the mind.9-10-06"},{"Title":"The Ghost in the House: Motherhood, Raising Children, and Struggling with Depression","review":"I'm really not sure which book Publishers Weekly was reading, but it couldn't have been this one! Instead focus on Library Journal who, in my opinion, got it right. As a clinical social worker, who has worked with hundreds of mothers, this is a book I recommend to clients as well as mental health professionals. Thompson's ability to explain complicated -medical/physiological/pharmacological- information while simultaneously using commonly understood language,without watering down the information one iota, is a true gift. The stories Thompson shares from her own experience as a mother struggling with depression, in adddition to the compelling interviews she has conducted with hundreds of mothers(all backed by excellent research relating what is happening currently in the field of depression) set this book apart making it a one stop resource.As strange as it may sound, this book is an enjoyable read, even though it is tackling a very serious subject; maternal depression. I know! Enjoyable and maternal depression does appear to be incongruous in the same sentence. However Thompson's way with the written word just doesn't come along very often in this genre. Most of the books written about depression are heavily technical or written like a \\"how to\\" manual. Thompson has found, as Dave Matthews would sing, \\"The Space Between\\"."},{"Title":"The Ghost in the House: Motherhood, Raising Children, and Struggling with Depression","review":"The Ghost in the House will ring true for every mother who has struggled with depression, whether postpartum or other. It would also serve as a great resource for those who know or live with someone with depression.Tracy Thompson pulls together and seamlessly blends her own experience as a mother who struggles with depression, the stories she gleaned from thousands of mothers who responded to her plea for women to share their experiences and hard scientific evidence about this illness and its impact on mothers who struggle with it and their families.Far from being \\"depressing\\", this book gives hope by helping the reader understand the interplay of nature and nurture as well as a variety of insights on some of the solutions and strategies that have worked for others. Depression is a complex physiological illness that defies simplistic or pat answers and is further complicated by a mother's concerns about the impact of her illness on her children and on their psychological futures. Tracy Thompson encompasses all of this in The Ghost in the House.I've only written a couple other reviews on Amazon, but this book compelled me to do so."},{"Title":"The Ghost in the House: Motherhood, Raising Children, and Struggling with Depression","review":"This was a really interesting book to read...even though my kids are older, 11 and 13, I found myself remembering how miserable I felt at times during their babyhoods. I started out as a stay-at-home mom and felt valueless and overwhelmed even though I knew that my babies were the most precious things in the world. My question throughout this book is...why does she assume that the depression came first? I believe that there are many happy women who become mothers, only to find out that it can be the most wearisome, intellectually unrewarding job. (Yes, I know, there are women who will think I'm horrible; I've heard it all before). But the reality is that just raising kids (no matter how much you love them and I love mine) can be very unrewarding for some women...perhaps they weren't depressed before but became depressed. This book focuses on women who are prone to depression, have experienced depression prior to having kids, and who have actually had serious depression episodes. I think that there are a whole bunch of women who fall into other categories. There are many mothers who love their kids but aren't that great at being housewives and on call 24/7...could depression be a natural outcome of total submission to family and kids at the expense of outside pursuits?"},{"Title":"The Ghost in the House: Motherhood, Raising Children, and Struggling with Depression","review":"In this important book, Tracy Thompson tackles the seldom talked about topic of maternal depression and has done a phenomenal job of exploring how, for far too many women, depression can intermingle with and transform the experience of motherhood. Drawing upon her own experiences with depression and including the stories of hundreds of women she interviewed, she paints a picture of maternal depression that is honest, compelling, and perhaps most importantly, empathic. Moreover, she has deftly woven this evocative descriptive material with a careful review of the medical literature, creating a work that is scholarly and engaging.As a psychiatrist who works primarily with women who suffer from depression within the context of pregnancy and raising children, I am certain this book will resonate for any mother who has struggled with depression. I was particularly impressed with Ms. Thompson's ability to write so candidly about depression and how it can color and compromise the act of mothering, while at the same time maintaining an aura of hopefulness. Over and over she urges women to get the help they need, arguing that depression need not be a devastating experience. In fact, she notes that by addressing the problem directly, a woman may have the opportunity to become a more insightful and emotionally available parent.This book is a pleasure to read. Ms. Thompson is an exquisite writer, and her ability to take complex medical information and to gracefully intertwine it with the deeply personal stories of those who have grappled with this illness is impressive. For these reasons, I recommend The Ghost in the House to any mother who has struggled with depression, as well as anyone who is interested in learning more about depression within the context of motherhood."},{"Title":"The Ghost in the House: Motherhood, Raising Children, and Struggling with Depression","review":"To the reader who was depressed by this book... depression is scary, especially to the person struggling with it everyday. If you have clinical depression, you can not make it go away be denying it is there. You must get out from under those covers and face it.This book was so empowering to me because it showed that even when that seems like the impossible task you can still help your children make the best of themselves, and become strong and self sufficient. I found the stories touching, and really, quite familiar. I was so encouraged by the fact that there are women out there who are dealing with this disease just like me every day, and they are succeeding.We all love our children dearly and don't want to hurt them, but we are imperfect individuals. It is a fact of life that we will at some point negatively impact our children's lives. Whether it be large or small it is going to happen. This book, when truly taken to heart, helps in so many ways to teach depressed mothers how to keep that hurt to a minimum. A+ Tracy Thompson, and thank you."},{"Title":"The Ghost in the House: Motherhood, Raising Children, and Struggling with Depression","review":"This book is awesome for any woman, especially mother that is is suffering from depression. It has helped me immensely in my relationship with myself, my mother, and my daughter."},{"Title":"The Ghost in the House: Motherhood, Raising Children, and Struggling with Depression","review":"I suffer with depression and I have a young toddler. I found Ms Thompson's research and first-hand experience affirming and empowering. I will definitely read her first book. Unfortunately I couldn't relate to the upper-middle class majority of women she spoke to and she only gave a passing mention to women like me who also have to deal with poverty and very limited access (if at all) to quality psychiatric support or just decent counseling."},{"Title":"The Ghost in the House: Motherhood, Raising Children, and Struggling with Depression","review":"Thompson is to be commended for giving so many mothers who suffer from postpartum depression a voice. The woman who speak here offer a painfully honest and insightful look at how this disease affects families from a non-clinical perspective. As the author points out, there is a taboo against admitting that you have anything but warm maternal feelings for your little one, and readers of this book who have felt similiarly will appreciate the anecdotes gathered.However, I wish there had been more discussion of solutions to combat this problem on more than just an individual level. Discussion of social change would have been encouraging, at least briefly, but perhaps that was beyond the book's scope."},{"Title":"The Ghost in the House: Motherhood, Raising Children, and Struggling with Depression","review":"Anyone who has suffered from depression and is a mother must read this book. Who knew that a book about depression would be uplifting. The author interviewed other women that have suffered from deqression and anxiety. It makes you realize that you are not alone! Millions of other women like you are out there. The number one lesson is to get help!"},{"Title":"The Ghost in the House: Motherhood, Raising Children, and Struggling with Depression","review":"I reread this book recently and was struck by its dead-on accuracy and vivid imagery. I've read lots of books on depression and many are helpful or informative, but this is the one that rips my heart open. I can see myself reflected in its stories. I have underlined dozens of passages and scribbled Yes! Yes! in the margins.It frustrates me to see that this book never got the attention it deserves. Perhaps this subject is still too difficult to talk about. No one wants to admit to depression; no one wants to admit to being inadequate as a mother; no one wants to risk losing her children. So we tough it out alone. Big mistake.But for suffering mothers and children, this book tells you that you are not alone and that help is available. I wish I could give a copy to everyone I know."},{"Title":"The Ghost in the House: Motherhood, Raising Children, and Struggling with Depression","review":"I've had depression and anxiety on and off for the past decade, and this book is the best I've read on parenting with depression. I got it from our local library and wanted to highlight so many phrases that I immediately purchased my own copy here. It helped me to not feel so alone in my struggle, showing me how other moms handle certain things. It has helped me quite a bit. I recommend it highly, especially if your kids are still young."},{"Title":"The Ghost in the House: Motherhood, Raising Children, and Struggling with Depression","review":"This book is stunningly brilliant--it makes sense of all the new cutting-edge brain research, drawing on the author's many years as an investigative reporter. But it's also highly readable, utterly compelling, and wholly eloquent in tackling one of the taboo truths about mothers all over the world and especially in the developed West, where our to-do lists grow by the minute, our media tell us to count our blessings, and medical professionals often fail to address signs and symptoms of depression at an early stage. I am buying copies for everyone I know who is a mother, has a mother, or cares about mental health: In short, I want everyone to read this book! its message, ultimately, is rather hopeful and highlights the resilience and resourcefulness of mothers and children. I LOVED THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"The Ghost in the House: Motherhood, Raising Children, and Struggling with Depression","review":"The first thing that struck me about this book was the title, specifically \\"struggling with depression\\". Thank you. As I fight my way back up for the fourth time since becoming a mother, the last thing I need is another chirpy book about \\"overcoming\\", \\"beating\\", or otherwise banishing depression forever. This is the first book I've seen that acknowledges that, for at least some of us, it is a life-long fight.Some reviewers have suggested that it's very upsetting to know that our depression is going to have a profound effect on our children. Perhaps that's why this is the first time it's been addressed truthfully. I KNEW it was impacting my family, but not one single Doctor would admit it and help me find a way to minimize the damage. It's ridiculous to think that anything that causes a mother to suffer this deeply doesn't affect her family.I found this book quite hopeful on two levels. The personal stories and interviews demonstrate that experiences I thought were mine alone are not unique. The people who had the courage to share also prove that this illness can be managed. What has been managed can be managed, and I am not alone in trying to find the right set of tools and skills. The other level that I find hopeful is the amount of research the author cites. There are people out there trying to figure this thing out.The cliche of \\"the first step is admitting there is a problem\\" is a cliche because it's true. As a culture we need to admit that Depression exists, many more people have it than we think, and it has a deep and lasting impact on our families and society at large. This book has the potential to be a big first step."},{"Title":"The Ghost in the House: Motherhood, Raising Children, and Struggling with Depression","review":"I thought that this book would help me find coping mechanisms in order to overcome difficulties that i deal with daily.I found myself scared out of my mind at some of the stories she told about how kids are badly affected by a mother's depression. It made me want to crawl in bed and cry because I might be a cause of pain to my daughter."},{"Title":"Solomon & Sheba","review":"Solomon and Sheba by Faye Levine is a neglected masterpiece that deserves to be resurrected. A fictional account of the Queen of Sheba's fabled encounter with Solomon, this is a tour de force not to be missed. One wonders why this book has been so neglected. I would put it up against most of the so-called outstanding works of fiction being produced today. To call it inspired is an understatement. To read it is to be there, with the protagonists, as Solomon builds his temple.
