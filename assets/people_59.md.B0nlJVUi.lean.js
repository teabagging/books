Living as an orphan she is driven to become successful and fall in love. She becomes a young writer nd often expresses her feelings and thoughts through her writing. As a young teenager I can easily relate to a lot of how she feels. I felt comfort in reading this novel because I am not the only person going through a lot of changes in my life. I recommend this novel to a lot of young readers and especially young teenage girls. Jane Eyre contains a point of view that captivates the reading."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I don't remember when I first read Jane Eyre. I have read it on and off for years now, along with hundreds of other books. When I was younger, I admired everything Jane did; every decision she made was the right one. Jane was the heroine of the story and I didn't question her decisions. But.. after much reflection on the outcomes of her decisions, I have come to the conclusion that she was TOO strong, too determined that she must lead a faultless life. It was almost creepy, how iron willed she was. I think the true victim of the novel was not Jane herself, but the rich and powerful Fairfax Rochester, who was so much in love with her that even Jane hoped her leaving would not drive him to madness and despair.. His plea, \\"You will not come? You will not be my comforter, my rescuer? My deep love, my wild woe, my frantic prayer are all nothing to you?\\" .. but Jane, in her determination to be true to her morals,walked away and left him in a near suicidal state. \\"Oh, Jane, this is bitter. This is wicked.\\" These words fell from Mr Rochester's lips when he saw that she meant to leave. I tend to agree. It DID seem wicked to leave him on the verge of madness. He ask no more of her, at that time, than to just stay in residence until some alternative plan could be embarked upon. However, she didn't want to be suspetible to the worldy temptations embodied in Mr Rochester...She almost died because of her decision to tear herself away, and what happened to Mr. Rochester will make the reader shudder. But.. Jane's \\"integrity\\" and strength remain intact,and supposedly that is the lesson the reader is supposed to carry away. But I love Jane Eyre anyway,love the story, and have a leather bound edition of it on my bookshelf. It's beautifully written and deeply interesting. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I read &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, against my wishes, when I was a junior in high school and found it stuffy and dry, much like other books from the Victorian period. However, when I read it again as a sophomore in college my opinion change. I saw &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; as a heroine who fought her way from the bottom of society in order to make something out of herself.What I liked about the title character was that she was smart and even more importantly she was strong-willed. Somehow, Charlotte Bronte created a female heroine who had real character at a time when most women were used solely as ornaments and child-bearing machines."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"The protagonist is clear-headed, thoughtful, and independent. Even when she falls in love, she doesn't let that love take over her life. She knows that it's better to lose her love than to lose herself.

Their heroines don't have half the brains or the personality of Jane."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyre was a very good book. At first glance, I wasn't sure if I was going to enjoy this book because I didn't like the previoius Victorian book I read. This book proved to be a lot better. It was not a typical romance novel. Jane Eyre was a love story, but also had many unforeseen twists that kept my attention. I had no idea what was going to happen, and when something didn't go the way I had expected, I was worried about how it would turn out. I enjoyed the basic plot, but I liked the unpredictablility the most. This book took me a lot longer to read than I had expected. This was because Jane Eyre is at a high reading level. It had many vocabulary words that confused me. This was the only drawback to this book. I would recommend this book to ages 14-20 and to people that enjoy classical literature. It was very enjoyable, but I would not suggest reacing Jane Eyre to anyone who likes more action because this book describes each event in great detail. Overall, I thought this book was very enlightening and enjoyable."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Alright, joint greatest with Wuthering Heights. This novel for all its faults (journalistic style, over reliance on coincidence, a certain Byronic vulgarity to Rochester) simply transcends other English fiction of its time.

Take my word for it, you will be returning to these enchanting pages again and again!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"It seems silly to say that a book can affect you on a profound level. well I definitely believe in this power that a good book has. Jane Eyre is one of them. I cannot say that this was an easy book to read. But it was a book that I was very enriched by reading. Romance is a genre that is looked down on by many \\"sophisticated readers.\\" Perhaps they would look down on Jane Eyre, but would probably get some eyebrows raised at them. Well Jane Eyre is the archetype for the romance novel. After having read thousands of them, I know a romance novel when I see it, and Jane Eyre does qualify. But it is much more than this. It's a story for the person who wonders why the keep trying to do the right thing, and persevering in life, instead of just taking what they want when they want it. If Jane Eyre had been that sort of person, she would not have gotten her happy ending. Instead, Jane walked away from the thing she wanted most in the world. She almost died doing what she felt in her heart was right. Had the story ended there, I probably would have detested this book. But it doesn't. We see Jane continue to grow and act as the phenomenal person that she was. Although often downtrodden, she is no meek mouse. She has a fighting spirit that keeps her going when others would have laid down and died. But despite being a fighter, she is not a user and abuser. It's hard at times for the difference to be clearly delineated. Well there is no question about Jane's level of strength and intregrity. Although it is made clear several times in this novel, that Jane is no beauty, her soul makes her a beautiful character. Beautiful in a more profound way.There are moments when you feel, how can one person suffer so? But taking the journey, you realize that all Jane's suffering had a purpose. It refined her into a woman who could look beneath and love what others could never love or understand. It made her the woman who could love and heal Rochester.At the same time, Rochester was made for Jane Eyre. He had searched his life for a woman like her, and made quite a few mistakes along the way. And out of love, he was able to let her go when he wanted to keep her. But she came back to him, when he needed her most.Rochester is the hero that formed the archetype for many of my favorites: tortured, scarred, dark, enigmatic, all of those things. Best of all, loving little, plain, ordinary Jane with a fundamental intensity that pours out of the pages of this book into my heart as a reader. Despite his lack of perfection, I could not love him more.Ah, how maudlin I sound. I can't help it. This book moved me to tears. Yet I smiled at the same time. I enjoyed the conversations between Rochester and Jane. There was a heat there, a passion. Yet this book is clean enough to read in Sunday school. That is grand romance. The journey so well expressed, that no sex scenes are needed. It's all there.This novel is also inspirational. Not preachy, in my opinion, but for a believer, one can definitely find spiritual messages in this book. About perseverance, about not wearying about doing good. About the profoundness of God's love. It's all there, but in a narrative that expertly showcases it, not preaching it.I feel I am failing to write the review I want to write for this book. The words do fail me. All I can say is that this book will always be a favorite of mine because of the way it touched my heart and challenged me."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"In many ways, \`Jane Eyre' can be seen as an autobiographical novel. Certainly, Charlotte Bronte drew on her experiences as both pupil and teacher in shaping the character of Jane Eyre. The story of Jane Eyre is a triumph of character and spirit over circumstance. Jane herself is depicted as small and plain and with an independent spirit. She believes, fundamentally, in equality and, absolutely, in the healing power of love.The story can be read on a number of different levels: as a triumph of \`good' over \`evil'; as a claim of a woman's independence; and as a love story. I have read it three different times over the past 40 years and have formed different impressions each time. Perhaps on a fourth read I may form another impression altogether different.\`Jane Eyre' is a wonderful mixture of the conventional and the unconventional. Jane is a survivor who uses her strength of character to survive the adversities which form part of her life. Many of the views expressed through the characters had critics arguing about the relative morality of the work. Some of those debates would be viewed with astonishment through our late 20th and early 21st century eyes but in the context of the 19th century it was not accepted that women could be the equal of men.Charlotte Bronte wrote \`Jane Eyre' in 1846, and it was accepted for publication in 1847. Charlotte outlived her younger sisters Emily and Anne and had a number of other novels published: each of her novels is worth reading.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyre was authored by the inimitable Charlotte Bronte of the Yorkshire writing Brontes of Haworth Parsonage. The novel was written under the pen name \\"Currer Bell\\" in fears that it might be thought to have been by a woman. Bronte dedicated the book to one of her literary heroes William Makepeace Thackery whom she met on a London trip. Little did Charotte know that Thackery had to deal with a wife gone mad as had Rochester in her novel!Jane Eyre suffers through a miserable childhood. She is raised by a cruel aunt Mrs. Reed after the death of her parents. Jane is sent to the odious Lowood Academy where she lives for eight years from age 10 to 18.At Lowood, Janes befriends the older girl Helen Burns. Helen dies at an early age; Jane remains at Lowood. Miss Eyre eventually becomes a teacher at the school as she has learned French, sewing and social skills.Jane departs Lowood to become the governess of Adele the illegitimate daughter of Mr. Rochester. Rochester is a Byronic figure who has a madwife named Blanche living in the third story of his estate Thornfield. Jane leaves Rochester at the wedding altar when it is discovered he has a living wife. Jane flees to a home of evangelic Christians where she is courted by the future missonary Mr. St.John. He rejects the wealthy Rosamund Oliver for Jane. Jane, however, loves Rochester. In a dramatic ending the little Miss Eyre is reunited with her lover and weds Rochester. Jane comforts Rochester who has become blind and maimed due to the burning down of Thornfield. The fire had been set by his mad wife Blanche who leaped off the roof of the building. Daphne Du Maurier would use a similar ending of her novel \\"Rebecca.\\"The name \\"Jane Eyre\\" can be interpreted in many ways. Jane was the middle name of Charlotte's sister Emily. Eyre may refer to her desire to fly freely in the independent air of personal freedom. Eyre also hints at the fact that Jane is an heiress. Jane also \\"errs\\" in some of her decisions as she makes her pilgrim's progress through northern England. The book is a Cinderella story in which a poor and plain young woman wins her lover. The dialogue is sharp, witty and the scene is populated by interesting rural servants and domestic animals such as the dog Pilot.The book contains elements of Gothic terror, romance and a defense of the rights of women. Bronte is often taught in courses on Feminism. Charlotte Bronte writing in the first person uses a rich language drawing on Biblical, Classical and Shakespearean language and metaphor. Bronte knew how to tell a good story for her life was similar to that of Jane Eyre. Bronte saw many of her sibling die young and lived in genteel poverty as a governess and teacher.Jane Eyre is an immortal classic which will continue to be read and enjoyed by future generations. It is the kind of book which will hook you on reading. Excellent and deserving of several rereadings. The Penguin edition has a large section of notes explaining Victorian customs and the literary allusions."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Or: The Book Is Better Than The Movies.

One more thing I cried reading this book(add this to my list of books that make me cry: Marley and Me, The Return of the King, and now Jane Eyre)."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"When Charlotte Bronte wrote Jane Eyre in 1847, she was forced by the ideals of the time to publish it under a man's name: Currer Bell. However, the novel's accurate depiction of a woman on a quest of self-discovery and love would correctly identify the author as a woman herself. In it, the title character leaves her childhood school to serve as governess at Thornfield Park, where she falls in love with her master, Mr. Rochester. However, the discovery of his insane wife makes it impossible to be with him, and Jane must leave to gain her own independence before the two can be reunited. This exquisitely written novel is truly a classic, but don't let that be a deterrent: Bronte's style remains consistently readable and lucid throughout. Add this to the effortless relatability of the title character, and we have a completely compelling novel on our hands. Throughout her master work, Bronte uses literary techniques like characterization, appeals to pathos, and theme to make Jane and her story highly relatable to nearly all girls and women.From the outset of the novel, the reader is given a very good idea of Jane and her character. In fact, the main traits mentioned by Bronte in the narrative are what make Jane so immediately relatable to the audience (which, by merit of its basic plot as a 19th century gothic romance, would logically be made of older girls and women of all ages that would find it intriguing). Jane, from the beginning, describes herself as, \\"poor, obscure, plain, and little\\" (272). These descriptors are reinforced throughout the novel as Jane and others describe her in terms of wealth, popularity, looks, and stature; as Jane has very little of all four of these things, she is often looked down upon by herself and others. Very rarely are fictional heroines depicted in such terms; add this to the fact that Jane has a heart of gold and Bronte has given us one of fiction's most relatable characters. Even if the reader is not poor, obscure, plain, or little, they have felt that they were each of these things at least once in their lifetime. Because Jane is so far from the ideal, the reader, as another person very far from the ideal, automatically relates to and invests in the story of Jane Eyre.Charlotte Bronte also makes Jane incredibly relatable though her usage of appeals to pathos. She makes these appeals from the outset of the novel, when Jane is sent from her relation in order to live at Lowood School, a strict institution that treats the students there terribly. Here she feels lonely and suffers lashings for offenses as quizzical as not standing when a teacher enters the room. It is when Jane starts teaching at the school that we get one of the most relatable appeals to pathos. Jane narrates, \\"I desired liberty; for liberty I gasped; for liberty I uttered a prayer; it seemed scattered on the wind faintly blowing. I abandoned it and framed a humbler supplication. For change, stimulus. That petition, too, seemed swept off into vague space.\\" (88). There isn't a person in the world hasn't longed for some sort of freedom for a change in their life only to find it not forthcoming. Jane's desire for something new and the ability to do what she wants rather than what others want her to do is relatable on all levels of life -from a girl's elementary school years to her advanced womanhood.These appeals to pathos are also apparent in regard to Jane's love for her employer, Mr. Rochester: she believes it is unrequited for the first half of the novel and then, when he reveals that he shares her feelings, discovers that he already has a wife, insane though still very much alive. Jane's moral standards make it impossible for them to be together, and so for a large portion of the text Jane has lost her love and her dearest friend. Bronte writes, from Jane's perspective, \\"It shivered in my heart, like a suffering child in a cold cradle: sickness and anguish had seized it; it could not seek Mr. Rochester's arms--it could not derive warmth from his breast. Oh, never more could it turn to him; for faith was blighted--confidence destroyed! Mr. Rochester was not to me what he had been, for he was not what I had thought him\\" (319). Throughout this passage and many others in the text, Bronte creates a sense of loss, specifically of a loved one; this is also an emotion which can be considered relatable on all levels of the board, because every woman or girl has lost a loved one, be it romantic or platonic, and this awareness of commonality between the reader and Bronte's Jane is the obvious result of appeals to pathos made throughout the novel.Finally, the theme of the novel is perhaps what makes it most relatable: Jane Eyre is, essentially, a woman's quest to be loved on her own terms. Only when Rochester's wife has died in a house fire and Jane has achieved her own economic and emotional independence do the two marry and be together. In essence, Jane completely succeeds at her quest. \\"Reader, I married him. A quiet wedding we had: he and I, the parson and the clerk, were alone present\\" (488). In their previous engagement before the discovery of Rochester's wife, he had sought to bedeck her with jewels and expensive fabrics, and he had been proud and arrogant in her love for him. It is different and far more agreeable to Jane now that he spurns the luxuries and arrogance that were once so integral to his happiness. Far more than that, the last chapter focuses on Jane's happiness with her marriage, which is in direct, though welcome opposition to previous chapters, in which her struggles, sacrifices, and hardships are chronicled. Jane, who had been a loveless orphan, now has a husband, children, and familial ties; similarly, each girl or woman who reads this fantastic story wishes for each of these things. Jane's desire to be loved on her own terms is a direct reflection of the readers; the theme Bronte creates from this--a quest to be loved--sustains Jane Eyre's relatability to modern readers.This marvelously crafted novel is truly a classic which remains highly readable in both style and plotline. Additionally, Bronte assured its immortality when she made the main character, Jane Eyre, such a relatable character. Using characterization, appeals to pathos, and theme, Bronte created one of fiction's most relatable characters. I would highly recommend this to girls and woman passed the age of ten; it truly is"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This illustrated edition has gorgeous neo-victorian ink illustrations by Dame Darcy, reminiscent of the style of Edward Gorey, author/illustrator of \\"Amphigorey,\\" among others.

It was the story of an orphan, and her trials while she's trying to find herself.

Because I identify with Jane on so many levels, her world becomes a sort of fantasy world to me when I read it.

In this novel, Bronte writes like a pro, opening the story with a conflict that immediately engages her readers' interest in Jane and quickly follows up with another that firmly cements that affection. When the evil Rev. Brocklehurst asks Jane what she must do to avoid the eternal torture of hell, she replies, \\"I must keep in good health, and not die,\\" and her immortality as a literary character is secured. One strength of this novel is the first-person narration with everything seen through Jane's eyes. Although we know her to be a passionate individual, she is also absolutely trustworthy,and the generous and smart woman she becomes plays no games in telling her tale in simple, straightforward narration. We burn with indignation at Aunt Reed and Rev. Brocklehurst, grieve over Helen, share her growing affection for Sophie and Mrs. Fairfax, and rejoice in her discovery that in Rochester she has at last found someone who is her intellectual and emotional equal, the first true friend since leaving Lowood School. In short, in the first two-thirds of Jane Eyre, Bronte's work is close to a masterpiece. However, her story goes off the rails in the St. John Rivers section, the part of the book that many readers dislike and the section most film adaptions do their best to diminish or eliminate. In earlier readings, Jane's decision to flee Thornfield with a few shillings and a small bundle of clothes made perfect sense, and her subsequent discovery that the Rivers siblings were actually family -- her first cousins -- adequate explanation for her decision to share equally with them the fortune left to Jane by their uncle in Madeira. But on this reading I saw how unnecessary, how unJane-like, her flight actually is. Jane has already learned from her Aunt Reed that her uncle intends to leave her his fortune, and it is that uncle who sends his solicitor to crash her wedding and prevent her bogus marriage to Rochester. The solicitor explains exactly that before leaving Thornfield. Above all else, Jane Eyre is smart and capable, smart enough to recognize that her uncle's solicitor will provide her with necessary support and capable enough to get herself to London to receive it. However, a few hours later, Bronte sends Jane rushing across the moors in a coach heading god knows where, a destination that will be determined by how far her meager money can pay for transport. Is this the young woman who ably advertised for a post when she wanted a new life? Is this the young woman who traveled to her aunt's deathbed and remained long enough to help her hateful cousins settle their affairs following their mother's death? Absolutely not. While Jane's flight makes sense, her decision to flee blindly to parts unknown is ludicrous, given everything else we know about her. And so the results of that flight -- her fortuitous discovery of her cousins and the jousting with priggish St. John over his desire to have her join him in his missionary work as his wife -- are ludicrous as well. No wonder readers recoil from that section of the book. Having written Jane out of character and into a tight corner with Rivers, Bronte comes to her rescue with a hokey gimmick -- the sound of Rochester's voice calling her name across the vast moors that divide them. Jane's dear readers are certainly happy that she has found a loving family and secured an income that provides independence. And they're happy that Rochester has proven himself a man of honor in sacrificing his vision and his hand in attempting to save his mad wife from the burning battlements of Thornfield Hall. So they forgive Bronte the flaws of the St. John Rivers section of the novel, glossing over it as quickly as possible to arrive at Jane's well-deserved happy ending. But while not fatal, the flaws are serious enough to prevent Jane Eyre from being a true masterpiece."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I just finished reading this for the first time.

Jane Eyre is one of many phenomenal books that will cling to your memory long after you have completed them.Now, in full disclosure, I read this, partly because I was never forced to in college; and partially because I wanted to write a piece of bizarro fiction that was centered around Ms. Eyre (one that does not involve zombies or vampires). But I found myself drawn into the novel and captivated by the storytelling. Even as a man, I found myself empathizing with Eyre, feeling the mud as it clung to my clothes in that desperate moment of dangerous hope and determined self-reliance.

Jane Eyre follows the life of a \\"plain Jane\\" and goes through the hardships and successes that she does. The author, Charlotte Bronte, wrote the novel from Jane's perspective so the reader can get and insight into Jane's mind and truly feel the emotions that Jane is feeling. At points of conflict, the reader will often find themselves hoping and wanting Jane to make a certain decision. Jane's life does not start out easy and so the reader immediately gains pity and empathy for Jane. It is the classic story of whether a girl should follow her head or her heart. Bronte writes in beautiful, eloquent language that paints a very clear picture for the reader. There are points in the novel where it is just the constant flow of Jane's thoughts, but that adds to the immense character development. As the reader gets to know Jane, they are able to relate to her because she is painted to be a very plain, yet strong-willed, young woman. The mark of Jane's passion comes from the beginning when she is talking to her aunt and says, \\"I am glad you are no relation of mine. I will never call you aunt again as long as I live. I will never come to visit you when I am grown up; and if any one asks me how I liked you, and how you treated me, I will say the very thought of you makes me sick, and that you treated me with miserable cruelty.\\" From this point on, the reader can see that even though Jane wants to be a \\"good child,\\" she has a more rebellious streak in her. Jane Eyre is a good read for someone who likes very good character development and has patience to get through much detail. I personally did not like the ending very much because it seemed to contradict the main idea of the rest of the novel, but other than that, I found myself engaged and interested in Jane's life and her decisions."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is a novel that follows a woman from the Victorian times in which she struggles to find her true identity and what really brings her happiness. Starting off as an orphan adopted by her aunt who despises her, she works her way up to become a governess. Through her struggle of finding independence in a society where women are looked down upon, she meets Mr. Rochester and hopelessly falls in love with him. Torn between finding independent happiness and romantic happiness, Jane indulges in a self journey fighting between what her heart desires and what her mind wants. Rochester is a man with much power and in a way intimidates Jane with his status but little did Jane know he was hiding a dark secret from her.\\"Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and a field for their efforts as much as their brothers do; they suffer from too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags. It is thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.\\"Not only is this a dramatic romance novel, but it is also a very eye opening novel in which Jane discovers that women should not confine to the expectations society has provided for them, but instead has a whole world to them for them to explore and obtain."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"\\"Jane Eyre\\" by Charlotte Bronte is a classic gothic romance story. Its intense, thrilling, and disturbinging details are told from the autobiographical standpoint of the narrator, Jane Eyre. A definite feminist novel, Bronte created an untraditional character who defies the expectations society has of her. Jane is no Disney character; Bronte's heroine is not blessed with beauty nor money, but she is a fiercely independent character with remarkably complex emotions.The novel begins with Jane Eyre, as an orphaned child, living at Gateshead with her Aunt Reed. From the very beginning, readers understand that Jane does not and will not have an easy life. Bullied and suppressed by her aunt and cousins, Jane is an outsider. She is sent to the Red Room as punishment one day by her Aunt Reed. In defiance, even at a young age, Jane exclaims to Mrs. Reed, \\" I am not deceitful: if I were, I should say I love you; but I declare I do not love you: I dislike you the worst of anybody in the world except John Reed.\\" Appalled by her outburst and fueld by her hatred for Jane, Mrs. Reed a decides to sent Jane to Lowood School, an institution for orphaned girls. After years at Lowood, a glimmer of hope appears later when she becomes a governess at Thornfield, home of a certain Mr. Rochester. Since the story is told from the memory of Jane, the reader is given a first-hand impression of the heighted emotional state of Jane and troubles she suffers through.At Thornfield, Jane becomes governess for a little French girl, Adele, and soon becomes entrapped in a spiral of emotions when confronted my Mr. Rochester. It is clear that Jane is the subordinate and Mr. Rochester is the master, but one cannot help but root for their romance and love to endure. Bronte's story of dark gothic elements, insanity, and dark lingering secrets make up this tragic romance story. Bronte draws attention to the cultural assumption of the Victorian woman's role and the relations between a man and women in the 19th century. Her novel calls for women's equality and equal treatment.The characters are very thoroughly developed. From the point of view of Jane, as a reader, we learn every bit of detail about Jane: her plainness, her loyalty, and unwavering independence. When confronted, Jane demands, \\"'Do you think I can stay and become nothing to you? do you think I am an automaton? - a machine without feelings? and can bear to have my morsel of bread snatched from my lips, and my drop of living water dashed from my cup? Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am soulless and heartless? you think wrong! - I have as much soul as you - and full as much hart! And if God had gifted me with some beauty and much wealth, I should have made it as hard for you to leave me, as it is now for me to leave you.'\\" Such an exclamation defied the stereotypes of a subdued and quiet lady.Interweaved throughout her novel, Bronte obviously develops the major theme of female independence and strength. However, Bronte also employs several motifs, one being the constant appearance of wings and birds. At the very beginning of the novel, Jane reads Bewick's History of British Birds which wrote of \\"the solitary rocks and promontories by them [the sea-fowl[ only inhabited,\\" symbolizing the independence of birds and the ability to fly away that she wished she had. Then at Thornfield, Jane describes a party of guests as \\"a flock of white plumy birds.\\" Upon seeing the ladies and gentlemen at Thornfield, Jane is even more aware of her dependence of others and the lowly status she has claims to. Still, she admires the freedom the guests have to come and go and indulge in frivolous activities. Even Rochester tells Jane to \\"be still; don't struggle so, like a wild frantic bird that is rending its own plumage in its desperation.\\" Each instance, Jane is struggling to find her freedom, her own independence.Jane Eyre is a tantalizing novel deserves to be read. Be prepared for a complex and nuanced plot. Written in true Victorian style, Bronte writes in long, elegant sentences that sometimes takes a few reads to truly understand. The plot she weaves is enrapturing, leaving reader on the edge of his or her seat, just waiting to read what happens next. However, Bronte takes her time developing her plot and ends up writing a three-hundred page book that could have easily fit into one hundred, but perhaps the Victorian readers of her generation had the time to sit down and read longer novels. Don't hesitate to purchase this book, it's a story you won't regret reading!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"In this gripping novel, Charlotte Bronte tells the story of a fiery young governess who finds love in an unlikely place. Through the use of descriptive and flowery language, Bronte successfully writes a prize winning book with extremely well-developed characters, a dramatic plot, and thought-provoking themes. Jane, the protagonist, is a young orphan living with her cold-hearted and widowed aunt, Sarah Reed. She is taken to Lowood School, where, among severe circumstances, she manages to find a friend called Helen Burns. Later, Jane decides to be a governess so she travels to Thornfield to work for the tall, brooding, and menacing Mr. Rochester. This book is considered to be one of the first feminist books because of Jane's unconventional personality and sense of independence. Jane, although physically plain, surprises and wins the heart of both the reader, and Mr. Rochester through her witty dialogue and frankness. Mr. Rochester maintains the reader's interest with his passionate and strong personality that often shows a soft side when it comes to love. It is most entertaining to read their playful and clever back and forth, as well as to see their fondness for each other grow. The characters in this novel are delightfully well-developed. Bronte does a thorough job of giving all characters life, including the minor characters like Mrs. Fairfax and Miss Temple. She uses foils to really differentiate between characters and to emphasize specific traits that are important, for example, Mr. Rochester and St. John are foils, contrasting St. John's \\"handsome Grecian features\\" yet cold personality with Mr. Rochester's unhandsome looks and passionate and emotional personality. The title, even though it may not catch the reader's attention, really reflects how Jane thinks of herself as just plain Jane. So don't be fooled by the simple title and long-winded sentences. Jane Eyre will certainly be a surprising, and delightful read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is the quintessential feminist novel. Jane is faced with and ultimately opposes her traditional role as a woman in the 1800's as she is subordinate to her love interest, Mr. Rochester. Beforehand, Jane endures a tough childhood as an orphan living with her deceased uncle's family at Gateshead. She is sent away to an \\"orphan school\\", Lowood, and eventually works as a governess at Thornfield. That is where she meets Rochester, and soon learns of a dark secret that threatens their budding romance. Later on, Jane rejects the love that she feels for Rochester, and leaves Thornfield. She faces trouble and is rescued by a second love interest, St. John. A multitude of events ensue, and this novel closes with an unorthodox, but fitting end.Jane is not the typical female character, as she is outspoken and quite independent. She does not allow herself to be pushed around, which is evident through the incident in which she physically fights with her cousin, John at Gateshead. Jane is confronted with themes of gender roles, social class, love, etc.Rochester is Jane's superior, and their romantic relationship almost replicates their professional relationship. Since he is of wealthy status, and Jane is not, they aren't on equal ground and she is portrayed as his subordinate. This is evident when Rochester refers to Jane as \\"my little friend\\" among other monikers.St. John is a foil to Rochester in every sense. He is a morally upright individual, who is devoutly religious and appeals to Jane as a cold person overall. This is in stark contrast to Rochester, whom Jane views as warm and has \\"flaming\\" eyes.In my opinion, the plot was excellent, but was a bit drawn-out. Jane's journey is full of riveting twists, but the build-up was a bit long, and the intricate language of the novel left me uninterested at times. However, regarding the major events and Victorian/Gothic elements, the language/rising action was appropriate, just not as appealing from a modern perspective. The ending was unorthodox, although I did somewhat expect it. Nevertheless, Jane's words reassure that in the end, Jane is not a subordinate, but an equal. She states \\"we are precisely suited in character--perfect concord is the result\\" which lets go of all of their societal/gender role burdens, and assures that they were meant for each other because of their match in personality/character. There are a multitude of themes present in this novel that require an approach from a wholly different perspective. For example, one cannot understand the importance of the character Jane Eyre within literary history, without considering the fact that she was the first strong/independent female protagonist. This novel, overall, is timeless and is a suitable example of feminist ideals."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I received the book in a timely matter and book was in great shape and very clean.

We all know the story of Jane Eyre, and it is here in it's entirety. The issue I speak of is with the actual book itself, not the novel or story. I was looking for a book to start a library for my wife. Jane Eyre is one of her favorite pieces of fiction, but if we were to start a library that we could pass down, the book should be something worth passing down. The cover here caught my eye, simple enough. Utilizing the \\"Peek inside\\" feature for this specific edition, it notes that it has a cloth bound cover and illustrated interior front and rear pages. Upon receiving the book itself, the cover looks the same, but is not cloth bound and the illustrations are missing. The print is extra large with wide margins. This seems to be more of a textbook or school issue version of the novel than a collector's item. It makes me wonder if the book is misrepresented by Amazon by mistake or if the book itself has done so. If a collector's edition of this novel is what you are looking for, stay clear."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane was orphaned as a baby and thrust upon her widowed aunt, to raise alongside her own three children. Her aunt, resentful of Jane and distrustful of such a quiet and sad child, makes her life miserable. When Jane is ten and the opportunity for her to go away to boarding school arises, she jumps at the chance. Aside from not being constantly harassed by her aunt and cousins, things are not much better at school, at first. The teachers are strict, uniforms are painfully plain, food is scarce and sometimes inedible. However, Jane feels at peace with her life there, even staying on to teach when she is too old to be a student.When Jane is eighteen, her dear friend and former teacher leaves school to marry. Jane decides it is time for a change in her own life. She advertises herself out as a private tutor, and is soon hired to be the governess and teacher for young Adele, a little French girl under the guardianship of Mr. Rochester, who lives in a grand English manor.Mr. Rochester is moody; he is more often grouchy and irritable than pleasant. He insults Jane, and seems surprised and charmed when she returns his barbs without taking offense. Jane begins to dare to hope for a relationship to develop between them. But Mr. Rochester is a society man. He is wealthy, and he surrounds himself with other wealthy folks, including some very eligible young ladies who look down on Jane. Furthermore, Jane can't be certain Mr. Rochester is always truthful with her. Something very strange is going on at Mr. Rochester's manor, something certain to shock Jane.I liked the fact that the protagonists of this story are not beautiful people. Jane is small, thin and plain. Mr. Rochester is often described as ugly, and certainly fierce. It's nice to read a love story about people who are more normal than the usual cast of characters in a romance. I also liked Jane's resolve in staying true to herself. She is confident in who she is and even her love can't make her betray her morals. However, despite her decision to become independent, she still knows that Mr. Rochester has a claim on her heart, and she isn't ashamed of that fact.The weakness of this story is simply that of time and style. It was written in the 1800s, when writers had a tendency to focus on description and long dialog, sometimes at the expense of action. As a result, there are parts of this book that are tedious and require skimming in order to get to the good stuff."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Charlotte Bronte beautifully constructs each sentence in \\"Jane Eyre\\" with an exacting precision that is at once dated and elegant.While the story can be a bit overwrought in almost a parody like way--it hasn't aged especially well--all of that is a minor distraction to enjoying the exquisite craftsmanship with which Bronte writes.Bronte is as much an architect as a storyteller--every sentence and event ties to an often unexpected event or occurance later in the book. She doesn't just churn out prose in the assembly-line fashion of hacks Janet Evanovich or Stephen King. When you read Bronte, you understand what is meant by \\"classic.\\" She is the difference between junk food (Evanovich/King) and a gourmet meal.This isn't airplane reading and you won't breeze through it in days.

I decided to read it again before the movie comes out. Although I enjoyed it, I didn't enjoy it as much as I did as an idealistic, romantic teenager. I can understand why some students have said this book is boring, as they probably can't relate to it. Relationships today, at least in the US, are very different than in Bronte's days. I think readers need to read and understand this story in the context of the culture, mores, etc. of the 1800s.I am giving this only 4 stars, because Bronte is overly wordy in my opinion. She often wrote several paragraphs to say something that could have been written more succinctly in a few sentences.I think this book is more likely to appeal to girls and young women who enjoy romantic, gothic novels than to males."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I needed this book for a school project.

The story tells the life of a young woman and how she gets through the troubles of work, a hard life, and heartbreaking relationship. Although boring and bare at times, Jane Eyre could be inspirational to the desires of love and romance in the early 1800's.Hard life starts at the age of 10 when she is orphaned and left to her critical aunt. Putting her faith in front of her, she tries to get through all the tough times. As she grew older, she becomes more knowing of her surroundings. Jane ends up falling in love with a man secretly still married. Jane finds out and runs away with no money and finds a family who can care and be her friend. In a twist, Jane, gets a big inheritance from her now passed away uncle. The man that she still loves comes back to find her after a tragedy of his family. They both have come to realize that they have both have found true love and would do anything to be with that other person. The two are married and have one child.The book Jane Eyre is the romantic novel that most women would dream for. It has the perfect fairy-tale ending in a true love that can never break. Jane worked hard and had a rough life and in the end it had paid off by being with the man that she had loved so much who loves her back. He had said, \\"I ask you to pass through life at my side, to be my second self and best earth companion.\\""},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I enjoyed reading this gothic novel. The story takes place in England, during the 19th century. Jane Eyre is orphaned at a young age. Raised in Lowood school, her only friend is Helen She is annoyed by the headmaster Brocklehurst. She is employed as a governess at an estate, where she falls in love with her employer, Rochester. This is a fine example of a coming of age novel."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This book is truly a classic. I read it for my A.P English class over the summer. It's just very long. There are too many dead points in the novel. The novel jumps back and forth between different thoughts and actually speaking often. It has a lot of good symbolism in it however. I reccomend reading wide sargasso sea afterwards for it is a novel from Bertha's point of view!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Review:Pride and Prejudice is a love story between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, an uptight man who has too much pride. Their first impressions gave a big start to this story that developed into the major conflicts and story line. My favorite chapter was the first one because it sets the tone for the story. It gives us the setting and the introduction to the characters. We really get to see how Mrs. Bennett is a really loud mother who all she lives for is for the search of husbands for her daughters. We know that Mrs. Bennett favors Jane, which is the eldest and most beautiful one of all. Then we start to understand Mr. Bennett's attitude towards his wife's plea and towards his defense toward his daughters. He isn't judge mental towards his daughters when it comes to men.I would recommend this book mostly to women/girls between the ages of 17-50, because this story deals with the trouble of what girls go through and it deals with five girls living in the household, which we can relate to. The daughters were not that old yet they were mature for their age. Teens will like it because we all go through these stages of male, and women can relate because of the maturity level that is in this story.One literary term that was used in the story was Analogy. It is used to describe two characters (Elizabeth and Darcy) that are alike by comparing them. In the story we can see their differences but along with it their similarities and common interest start to show.Overall I can say that I liked this book, Pride and Prejudice because it was an interesting story. Nowadays we read about homicide detectives and mysteries happening with murderer, but this story is nothing like this. Is builds its own suspense through characters personalities. It's based on feeling rather than action so we can all relate to this story psychologically. It captivates us in an imaginary world in the 18th century that sets us rules and regulations that were use back then. For example women were just suspected to marry wealth and make a family. They played no other role whatsoever, so since we don't live in that type of environment anymore, than we can just picture how life was back then and see what they went through, and their approach through these situations, to help us get through the book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte was our book club selection for this month.

I give \\"Jane Eyre\\" one monkey, ten minutes.While recognizing Bronte's derring-do in writing a novel about a homely 17-year-old governess who rejects a virtuous adonis (St. John Rivers) for her much older and unattractive employer, this is a book I cannot see reading again unless it's the only way to save a terminally ill relative.This book is a slow read. And I mean slow. A snail? Greased lightning. Molasses on a cold day? Quicksilver. Eighth-period study hall in high school on a Friday? Over in a flash. We're talking a slow, boring read here, even without the benefit of a high school English teacher's enthusiasm for ruining literature.The novel chronicles the story of Jane Eyre from her childhood as an orphan up until the birth of her first child. Life was hard for orphans in 19th-century England, particularly when their parents' marriage was considered improper. Fair enough, I suppose: that's why Jane's childhood is so rotten, and she is picked on by the cousins she lives with, misliked and mistreated by her aunt and so on. Unfortunately, Bronte's writing is so dry and lifeless that it's hard to care.It just gets worse from there. The book is written in the first person, with the result that we get to hear every self-pitying thought Jane has (and there are plenty of them), about how plain she is, how her employer Mr. Rochester could never love her, how beautiful her imagined rival in love is, and on and on and on for page after tedious page.My standard joke is \\"This is both good and original. Unfortunately, the parts that are good are not original, and the parts that are original are not good.\\" I will give Charlotte Bronte the benefit of the doubt, and will say that \\"Jane Eyre\\" is thoroughly original. Unlike the works of Shakespeare and a number of other classics of English and world literature, I can't say it is particularly good.Jocko Grinn"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"The book Jane Eyre was only okay. In the beginning it was very hard to get in to. Nothing interesting really happened until later on in the book. It was also really boring in parts when she described things like the weather. She would go in to so much detail and drag it on forever. There would be pages of her describing one thing. In a way it can be good because you can really make a good picture in your head, but it can get really annoying and boring fast. As the book went on it did seem to pick up a little bit. There were very interesting things actually happening in the book. There were times where I did not want to set down the book. For instance, I liked how the main character, Jane, wasn't the rich, beautiful, popular girl. She was plain and simple. I liked this because it is different from most other books. It shows a life about a girl who, like most of us, does not get everything she wants. I really enjoyed that part of the story. I also enjoyed the part when she inherited a lot of money from her uncle. At the same time she learned about three new cousins of hers. Not even knowing them, she split her money. It showed how much she cared about family more than money. That was a good lesson in the book. In another part of the book there is something that goes along with that and that is when Mr. Rochester tells Jane about Adele and her mother. He took care of Adele even though he did not believe that she was even his. That showed some responsibility in Mr. Rochester. However there were a lot of things that happened in the book that I did not like. I did not like Mr. Rochester. He was a selfish liar. It seemed like he was always keeping a different secret and lying about it. He lied to Jane many times but yet they still get married. I thought that was ridiculous. At first I thought Jane was stronger than that, but this really showed how weak she was. She went back to him although he kept lying to her. I mean he had a wife who needed help locked up on the third floor. That seemed a little too crazy to fall in love with a guy who does that. I felt like she got married because she did not want to be so lonely and she did not really care what kind of person it was she did marry. Although, she did know that she did not want to marry Mr. St. John which was a good thing because I do not think that he wanted to marry her for the right reasons. After Jane told him that she did not want to marry him, he went right back to his religion and it did not really bother him. Overall, the book was not the best or anything. It had a couple parts I enjoyed. On the other hand, there were many parts that either bored me or annoyed me."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Beware when you buy this tape.

Charlotte Bronte has trouble explaining the setting of the scenes, for one. Normally, the average reader can comprehend what the setting is like just by reading a few well-written lines. But Bronte bores the reader by over-explaining the setting, as if we needed to know every single detail. Unfortunately, it is this lengthy prose that makes the story itself hard to read. Secondly, the characters are bland, which makes the difficulty even greater. Maybe with livelier characters this novel would be easier to read.

Full of life lessons and tidbits of facts about nature, this story will not only make youngsters happy, but it will also please parents as well.Blacky the Crow is a trouble loving misfit whose love of mischief is only possibly succeeded by his love of eggs. To get the later, Burgess starts the tale off with a troublesome plot by Blacky geared towards stealing a pair of eggs. Blacky doesn't succeed, and soon moves on to a bigger and better thing. The bigger and better thing that captures his interest happens to also prove that Blacky has a heart; as he goes all out day after day to prevent a hunter from shooting a flock of ducks. To do this, he has to enlist the help of Farmer Brown's Boy, who in this tale comes off as a highly respectable role model as Farmer Brown's Boy ends up standing up to the adult hunter with Blacky's help, and the result is that the hunter eventually goes away and the ducks are safe.My daughter loves this book for bedtime readings.

Plus, unlike many of these Dover editions of Thornton Burgess' books, it has honest-to-god original Harrison Cady illustrations.Harrison Cady did two sets of drawings for this title; 8 color ones, printed on plates, for Little, Brown, of which 4 were later used for Grosset & Dunlap, printed in B&W; on plates. Then, Cady redrew those 4 as line drawings for Grosset & Dunlap to print on the text paper stock instead of on plates. Those 4 line drawings are crude by Harrison Cady's standards, compared to the line drawings he did for many other Burgess books.This Dover edition has the 4 crude line drawings. Some other Dover editions have the illustrations from the B&W; plates, and it would have been better if they had done that for this title too. But kudos to Dover for getting it basically right for this title.If you like these illustrations, I'd recommend finding a used copy of the Little, Brown edition too -- mostly to get all 8 higher-quality drawings, but also to see them in color as Cady originally drew them."},{"Title":"Blacky the crow","review":"All Thorton W.

Since 1960s Mahfouz has been acknowledged as the master of the Arabic novel. Many in the Arab world saw the prize somewahat ironic, not least because the work for which Mahfouz received the prize had been published at least three decades earlier. However, Mahfouz's books are still unavailable in many Middle Eastern countries on account of his support for President Sadat's Camp David peace treaty with Israel in 1978.Mahfouz was born in Gamaliya, Cairo. He graduated from the Cairo University in 1934. By 1936, having spent a year working on an M.A., he decided to become a professional writer. He worked as a journalist at Ar-Risala, and ontributed to A-Hilal and Al-Ahram.Before turning to the novel Mahfouz wrote articles and short stories. By 1939 he had already written three novels. In the same year he entered government bureaucracy, where he was employed for the next 35 years. From 1939 until 1954 he was a civil servant at Ministry of Islamic Affairs, and worked then as director of Foundation for Support of the Cinema for the State Cinema Orgazination. In 1969-71 he was consultant for cinema affairs to the Ministry of Culture.ABATH AL-AQDAR (1939), RADUBIS (1943), and KIFAH TIBAH (1944) were historical novels, that were conceived as a part of a larger unfilled project of 30 novels meant to cover the whole history of Egypt.However, following the third novel, Mahfouz shifted his interest to the present.Mahfouz's major work in the 1950s was The Cairo Trilogy, which the author completed before the July Revolution. The three novels were titled with the street names Palace Walk, Palace of Desire, and Sugar Street. It depicts the life of three generations in Cairo from WW I to the 1950s, when King Farouk I was overthrown. Without turning the individual characters into representantives of the different historical currents, Mahfouz lets history flow from the richness of characters and from their psychological, intellectual and social dimensions. The trilogy and its mode connects Mahfouz with the line of such authors as Balzac, Dickens, Tolstoy, and Galsworthy.The Children of Gebelawi (1959), which was serialized in the magazine Al-Ahram, portrayed average Egyptians living the lives of Cain and Abel, Moses, Jesus, and Mohammed. The work was banned throughout the Arab world, except Lebanon. Mahfouz left his post as Director of Censorship and was appointed Director of the Foundation for the Support of the Cinema. In 1969 he became consultant to the Ministry of Culture, retiring in 1972. He has been also a board member of Dar al Ma'aref publishing house.In the 1960s and 1970s Mahfouz started to construct his novels more freely and use interior monologue. In Miramar (1967) he used a form of multiple first-person narration in which four narrators tell the story. Manfouz become more interested in destinies, ideas, and human types than meticulous details of the perivious period. In Arabian Nighs and Days (1981) and in The Journey of Ibn Fatouma (1983) he used traditional Arabic narratives as subtexts.Mahfouz has written some 40 novels and short story collections, screenplays and several stage plays. In his works Mahfouz have combined intellectual and cultural influnces from East and West - his own exposure to the literary of non-Arabic culture began in his youth with enthusiastic consumption of Western detective stories. Mahfouz's stories are almost always set in the heavily populated urban quarters of Cairo. His focus on 'the little man' who has to deal with the changing traditions, rebellion of younger generations and the temptations of Western values has made him spokesperson not only for Egypt but also for a number of non-Western cultures. But Mahfouz is not so interested in historical and realistic analysis as the philosophical and psychological impact of the change on ordinary people. Mahfouz's introspection has been valuable landmark in the 1990s for understanding the realities of Egypt in the age of transition.NOTE: Latest news of Mahfouz tell that the fundamentalist Muslims have threatened him because of his writings. In his works Mahfouz has offered critical views of British colonialism and contemporary Egypt, social issues, and political prisoners.

The heroines, Cassandra of ICTC & Penelope of Secrets, are similar in many ways. Both are enchanting young women of special birth & impecunious circumstances who explore first love as only the English can. The innocence of emerging womanhood is deftly handled by both authors. I loved having the opportunity to \\"revisit\\" a Cassandra clone & see first love again, this time when the heroine is a year or two older & better equipped to properly fall for the hero.Lovely books, both of them. I strongly recommend I Capture the Castle as a delightful chaser - or \\"prequel\\" - to The Lost Art of Keeping Secrets."},{"Title":"The Lost Art of Keeping Secrets","review":"Ever read a book that you don't want to end? I actually put down THE LOST ART OF KEEPING SECRETS for weeks at a time - so not because it lost my interest and I didn't want to flip pages - because I wanted to savor it, keep it as a treat for when lesser books let me down.THE LOST ART OF KEEPING SECRETS beautifully evokes England post World War II, as a shell-shocked nation comes out of rationing and the second half of the 20th century beckons. Eighteen year old Penelope Wallace lives in her family's ancestral home, a centuries' old stately house called Milton Magna, which is falling down around her family's ears. There is no money to fix Magna as her father was killed in the war, and her mother, Talitha, is a famous beauty who married very young and remains somewhat immature and impractical. It's up to Penelope and her younger brother Inigo to save the house, but Inigo yearns to play guitar in America. He is constantly being sent down from school for playing his records, especially the ones featuring an obscure new singer named Elvis Presley.Penelope's sheltered life changes when she meets Charlotte Ferris, a sophisticated London resident who takes a shine to the country girl. Before long Penelope is pulled into Charlotte's world, meeting her Aunt Clare, who is writing her autobiography, and Clare's son Harry. Harry is an amateur magician who performs for haute London society, and he is madly in love with an American heiress. When the heiress announces her engagement to a perfectly respectful but staid member of the British aristocracy, Harry schemes to get her back - by using Penelope to make her jealous (and dangling tickets to Penelope's crush object, the American singer Johnny Ray, as bait). But is Penelope's heart as immune to Harry's charm as she insists?The title works on many levels. There's the lost world of Talitha, as exemplified by Milton Magna. There's the fact that the brave new world of Penelope and Charlotte, the world of nascent rock n' roll and Teddy boys, is long lost to the contemporary reader. There are secrets aplenty, from Harry's magic to Charlotte's lover to the secret that binds Clare and Talitha together - to the new secret that Penelope will keep past the novel's end. The novel works thematically on many levels.THE LOST ART OF KEEPING SECRETS is a charming and absorbing read, with engaging characters and a skillfully drawn setting. It is far from cliched, and sparkles with wonderful detail and authentic feeling. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Lost Art of Keeping Secrets","review":"This book has a lot of easy things to like, with engaging characters clinging to the edges of a sparkling London life. What hooked me right away and kept me going, however, was how this book rewards careful readers. The surface of shopping trips to Selfridge's floats on emotions that are expressed with remarkable subtlety. For example, why are duck dinners such an ordeal for the family? Skip one passing reference in the book, and fail to think about what it means, and you'll miss the answer. It reminded me of Ishiguro's \\"Remains of the Day,\\" but with a feminine voice. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Lost Art of Keeping Secrets","review":"This book is such a refreshing distraction from other novels currently being shoved down our throats. I adored the introduction of Charlotte and Harry, but was slightly disppointed by Harry's vanishing act in the last 1/3 of the book. I was also surprised by Penelope's desire and willingness to have guests at Magna while it was in such a state of disrepair.Each character was beautifully written. Every one of them had much to offer to this story. I judge a book by whether or not I want the story to continue past the last page, and this one passed the test."},{"Title":"The Lost Art of Keeping Secrets","review":"I absolutely loved this book. Never mind that I am a Daphne Du Maurier fan, it stands apart. Not only is the story funny and interesting, the characters are absolutely engaging. So engaging that you feel as if they are good friends. Plus there's a subtle thread of mystery that runs throughout. I can see why this book was such a big hit in England. We need more books like it in the states. It's really quite unusual. I hated to see it end."},{"Title":"The Lost Art of Keeping Secrets","review":"This is a wonderful book. I didn't want it to end.

It seems to be a wonderful combination of a generation of novels - Penelope has all the gauche charm of Mrs. de Winter and her mother is the quintessential Rebecca without the adultery and Milton Magna is inevitably Manderley - a profound homage to Daphne Du Maurier! The genteel poverty she describes defines so many novels of Evelyn Waugh and Nancy Mitford - Brideshead Revisted, Pursuit of Love and Love in a Cold Climate. I liked this book not merely for the characters and the story but because of its youthful perspective and affection for all the right writers!"},{"Title":"The Lost Art of Keeping Secrets","review":"Eighteen-year-old Penelope Wallace is quietly biding her time. Clanking around the ramshackle, drafty, disintegrating medieval manor house she shares with her widowed mother, the legendarily beautiful Talitha, Penelope works part time in an antique store and takes classes in literature and art in preparation for a trip to Italy.Penelope's somewhat staid life changes in an instant when she meets the effervescent, confident, utterly infectious Charlotte: \\"Charlotte...was all possibilities. She was the sort of person one reads about in novels yet rarely meets in real life.\\" Almost before she knows it, Penelope is drawn into Charlotte's frivolous, flirtatious lifestyle of parties with young London's fashionable set.Penelope also encounters Charlotte's cousin Harry, a somewhat eccentric aspiring magician. Bereft after the love of his life, Marina, became engaged to another man, Harry concocts a plan to make Marina jealous and thereby win her back. The bait? Penelope herself, who agrees to accompany Harry to parties to rouse Marina's envy.Before long, Penelope discovers that her feelings for Harry might go beyond mere playacting. In the meantime, how can she cheer up her still-grieving mother and save their family's estate? In a plot as whimsical as Charlotte herself, family secrets, hidden loves, and even an American screenwriter play pivotal roles.Set in London and the countryside in 1955, THE LOST ART OF KEEPING SECRETS is infused with the manners and rapidly shifting morals of that tumultuous decade. Obsessed with American culture --- Penelope's aunt from the States is fascinating to her, as are rumors of an unknown singer named Elvis Presley --- Penelope and her friends stand on the verge of a post-war way of life about to disappear. Descriptions of fashion, art and music abound. Eva Rice, the daughter of noted lyricist Tim Rice, has a keen ear and eye for the charm, glamour and nuances of 1950s British life.--- Reviewed by Norah Piehl"},{"Title":"The Lost Art of Keeping Secrets","review":"This is an absolutely DELIGHTFUL little read!

Penelope lives in a big, historic, rundown and famous mansion with her glamorous and beautiful mother and her brother. 18 year-old Penelope makes friends with gregarious and posh Charlotte and her wannabe magician brother, Harry.

And then the story really gets moving, Charlotte's cousin Harry proves a great character and Penelope's brother Inigo is almost as interesting. Slowly the four of them learn about how their families had met up before and how their lives have changed from knowing each other.I can't say enough about this book, it takes itself lightheartedly but addresses some serious issues, living in post WW2 England, rationing, being a teenager on ther cusp of womanhood, its FANTASTIC!"},{"Title":"The Lost Art of Keeping Secrets","review":"This book is a lovely read.

The father is killed in the war, and as the novel opens, his wife and two children despair over how they will be able to keep the enormous property and building without a breadwinner. The story continues, primarily about small decisions, life altering chances, and the nuances of family, friendship, and love.Quote: \\"This was going to prove to be one of those momentous decisions made without the slightest realization of its momentousness.\\"This book was really slow to get moving.

In London, Penelope meets zany Charlotte Ferris. When they agree that Johnnie Ray is the greatest, they vow to be friends for life; neither defining further whether they meant either of theirs or Johnnie's.Charlotte introduces Penelope to her cousin, a wannabe magician, Harry Delancy.

Soon Penelope becomes a fixture at parties.THE LOST ART OF KEEPING SECRETS is an intriguing 1950s British character driven \\"manners\\" tale. Charlotte is a wonderful protagonist whose evolution from a naivet? girl to polished woman of the world (at least the Thames) makes for a fine sensitive tale as she swings like a pendulum between her attraction to Harry and other blokes like the invading Hollywood Yank.

Penelope's mother Talitha married her father when she was only 17 years old. She sees her friends anxiously looking to get married. Penelope is not as self-confident as her beautiful mother or Charlotte. Her father died in the war. Her mother, Penelope, and her brother have been struggling to maintain the vast family estate Milton Magna. Charlotte's cousin Harry, wannabe magician, enlists Penelope to help him make his ex-girlfriend who engaged to someone else, jealous. Penelope also meets Rocky Dakota, a man that will impact all of their lives. Charlotte's Aunt Clare and Talitha are the ones that hold the most secrets. The narrative was the most interesting when it focused on Penelope and Charlotte. I was disappointed with Harry's disappearance and left pondering what could have been. Overall, it was an appealing read about family and love in England during the 1950s."},{"Title":"The Lost Art of Keeping Secrets","review":"Glamorous and contemplative, Eva Rice's Lost Art of Keeping Secrets is all about the idealism of youth and the search for fulfillment in 1950's England. It's also about the hats, the gloves and the gorgeous frocks, when one afternoon, eighteen-year-old Penelope Wallace finds herself mesmerized by sophisticated city-girl Charlotte Ferris whilst stepping off a bus stop and into a London taxi.Although they are total strangers, Charlotte invites Penelope home for tea at her Kensington Court townhouse, where Penelope meets Aunt Clare and Charlotte's brother Harry, and learns all the local social gossip. Apparently, Harry is absolutely besotted with the lovely and sophisticated Marina Hamilton, of Dorset House, \\"newly rich and seething with youth.\\" Unfortunately, much to Harry's vexation, Marina is betrothed to someone else.Penelope, however, has her own worries. Times are tough - her medieval ancestral home Magna is crumbling down around her, and neither Penelope, or Inigo, her fiercely opinionated younger brother, nor Talitha Wallace her glamorous mother, has the resources to fix it up. Talitha, whose \\"star quality is her greatest gift,\\" spends her days in a type of glamorous fink, and pining for her husband who was killed in the War.Obsessed with love for American singer Johnny Ray, and full of wide-eyed innocence, Penelope doesn't realize that accepting tea with Charlotte sets her life off course, and swings her off the familiar tracks that she had travelled so far. Going against her mother's better judgment, who would be \\"horrified at being seen dead at a bus stop, and fiercely disapproving of accepting tea invitations,\\" Penelope encourages Charlotte's friendship, and invites her and Harry for a weekend at Magna.Even though, Penelope has a part-time job in a quaint antiques shop, she spends most of the money she earns on clothes because needs new outfits now that Charlotte is intending to introduce her to high society. It's a world of models, actors, royalty and beauty. Going to Jazz cafes, smoking glamorous cigarettes, and drinking espressos. And where the steady influence of American pop-culture is increasingly making itself felt.Penelope is caught up in this gathering momentum that had started in America and is making its way to the shores of Great Britain. Talitha spurns American culture and she's appalled by her sister's willingness to embrace a country that she considers to be so deeply vulgar. Consequently, Penelope and Inigo become caught up in a widening generational war, caught between the need to do exactly as their mother wishes and the desperate urge to break away from her.Author Eva Rice has a firm grasp of her characters, particularly Penelope with all her flaws, fears, and insecurities about her life and her obsession with all things shiny and new. She's a complex, multi-faceted character, a mature young girl who is intent to use equal parts mind and heart to find her way in life. Charlotte is also nicely portrayed - she's a girl who recognizes her self worth and is determined to have a good time. She also knows the limitations of her society and is endemic of that rare type who has the luxury of picking and choosing exactly who they remember and forget.Rice excels in describing a newly rejuvenated post-war England that is eager to adopt the new and glamorous. Rationing, has recently become a thing of the past and shops are now beginning to stock products from all over the world, even Talitha has started to shop, heavily influenced by the \\"flounce of Parisian culture and five-inch heals.\\" There seems to be such hope now that it's just an incomprehensible and unthinkable notion that the Wallace family just can't afford to be living in Magna any longer.The Lost Art of Keeping Secrets is heavy on melancholy and the soft romance of ages past. And the author manages captures the ebb and flow of life in the 1950's, with all the characters, including Penelope, forced to confront their pretensions, insecurities, and their motivations. Rice certainly is good at mixing up the common and poor with the rich and the vulgar, and she excels in presenting the lives of girls with names like \\"Katherine Leigh-Jones and Alicia Davidson-Fornby.\\"Ultimately though, The Lost Art of Keeping Secrets comes across as rather shapeless and terribly clich?d. There's also a blandness and dullness to this story with prose that is somewhat awash in the familiar and the perfunctory. It's as though London's alluring and intrepid young society in which Penelope becomes so besotted with, isn't that daring and enthralling after all.

Every character in this story is interesting, but its really about finding love where you least exspect it and with someone you weren't exspecting. Penelope is a tall 6 foot awkward upper class 18 year old who lives in a crumbling mansion they can no longer aford with her goregous mother and younger brother and she's in love with the singer Johnnie Ray like millions of other girls in 1950's England.One day while standing at a bus stop she strikes up and unsual friendship with a girl named Charlotte Faris and goes to tea with her on a whim and meets her cousin Harry and her Aunt Clare. Penelope's life is transformed with this encounter but the best thing about this is the growing and unlikey romance she developes with Harry who has one blue eye an one brown and who is very short.I loved this book and was so sad when it ended I wanted to know more about what happened with Harry and Penelope and Charlotte!"},{"Title":"The Lost Art of Keeping Secrets","review":"This book is absolutely charming.

It was a nice lighthearted book that starts out a bit tiring but has you hooked before you know it!"},{"Title":"The Lost Art of Keeping Secrets","review":"\\"Exquisite\\" is a big word to apply to a book, but it is not hyperbole in referencing THE LOST ART OF KEEPING SECRETS.From the first sentence, author Eva Rice draws in her readers, subtly taking them inside her story.Her use of language is elegant and the plot is intricate and lovely.The primary and secondary heroines, Penelope and Charlotte respectively, each are engaging and beguiling. Like young women everywhere who are on the precipice of adulthood, they are concerned with men and parties and their wardrobes. Yet since they are in London and members of the upper class, the men are glamorous and the parties are lavish and the clothing is beautiful. The banter of many of the characters could come straight from a Cole Porter song.Eva Rice describes a moment before either she or I were born, immediately after World War II, and she sets her tale in London, a place I've only visited a few times. Yet she does such a superb job that it truly seemed to me as if I were there, viewing these characters, these settings, first hand.It was an interesting moment in time, a pivotal moment. Until I read this novel, I'd never heard of the singer Johnnie Ray, but he was real, he existed, and his popularity with the girls of that day foreshadowed the entire fan movement that would attach to Elvis and The Beatles.Ms. Rice certainly seems to understand the people and the place of her plot -- or she's simply just a terrific writer and, like one of the main characters, she can conjure magic. While reading THE LOST ART, it actually felt as if I were peeking at the characters' homes, listening to their conversations.The only quibble I have with THE LOST ART is that in a few spots, Ms. Rice uses words such as \\"youthquake\\" which were coined a decade after the era of the story.When all is said and done, the the conclusion of the book proves to have been inevitable. Yet it is a great tribute to the skill of this author that THE LOST ART OF KEEPING SECRETS is so lyrical and imaginative that it is not until the final pages that it becomes obvious that this book is nothing more -- nothing less -- than a romance novel at its best.Ms. Rice is the modern heiress to this genre invented by Jane Austen."},{"Title":"The Lost Art of Keeping Secrets","review":"Penelope Wallace's life changes the day she takes a spontaneous taxi ride with a green coat clad stranger by the name of Charlotte Ferris. Living with her gorgeous and alluring mother and younger brother Inigo, Penelope is everything you would imagine an 18 year old in 1950's London to be - simple yet enchanting all at the same time.Living in a rundown English estate and desperately trying to get by with the loss of her father, Penelope dreams of finding her proper place in society. In Charlotte she's found the sister and best friend she's never had. They have more in common then Penelope would have imagined, including a passion for American singing superstar Johnnie Ray *swoon*.On a whim, Penelope decides to go on a \\"date\\" with Charlotte's cousin Harry Delancy. The event is the engagement party of Harry's ex-girlfriend whom he is still madly in love with. Their date is a ploy to make her (the ex-girlfriend) jealous, but it becomes much more than that, exposing Charlotte to a world of glamorous parties and a budding romance.Author Eva Rice writes so colorfully, that the characters seem to jump right off of the pages. The plot twist at the end just adds the cherry on top of this delicious story. I appreciated everything about THE LOST ART OF KEEPING SECRETS and literally fell in love with every storyline.

It was a very pleasant story of young people in postwar England. Penelope Wallace is facing the challenge of her family's crumbling financial circumstances as the 1950's hover on the verge of a cultural explosion. She balances her burgeoning social life and her fantasy obsession with a current pop star against her increasing anxiety about her family's dire situation. The atmosphere of the story is rich in historical details of London's high society. It was fun to watch the characters getting on with their lives just as everything (as we the readers know) is about to change for them. The characters were interesting and very likable. The story, although pleasant, was unfortunately forgettable.The plot includes several budding romances, an undisclosed illness and a catastrophic final event, but somehow none of these events ever built up a sense of tension for me. Each turn of the plot was just a bit too predictable. If you enjoyed Travels With My Aunt, Rebecca, and I Captured the Castle, you will probably enjoy this book as well.

I loved this book. The main characters Charolotte and Penelope play so perfectly off each other that their friendship, from the start of the book, is kismet. There are few times when I find a book that really grabs me so strongly and so I would read a few pages, put it down, pick it back up. It took me about 2 weeks to read this book but it wasn't because I didn't love it- quite the opposite. I wanted to savor the pages and the language and wanted to think about what I had read.Before this book, I had never read any period pieces set in post-WWII London. I thought it was a great story and a lot of the story line revolves heavily around the war, its effects on the main characters, and the dichotomy between the young generation who grew up in wartime and those who remembered life before.

I wasn't really all that concerned about the \\"tragedies\\" of London's social elite in the 1950's, and, frankly, I thought the characters were going to be a lot more shallow than they turned out to be. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that there was way more to the story than that, and the drama that I expected turned out to have depth and heart.I can't imagine having grown up during the second World War. It must have been a strange sensation indeed to wake up one day in your growing up years to realize that it's over and things can go back to normal. How would you know what normal was? In Penelope Wallace's case, her generation had to figure it out as they went along. I thought the overall tone that Rice presented in the novel really worked in that regard.The characters really came to life for me, as well as the setting. The plot didn't hold together at all times, which sometimes detracted from the story. There were just certain inconsistencies in some things that were said and a few scenes, but the overall characters and setting really won me over. There were some aspects of predictability as well, but it was one of those cases that I would have been put out if it had turned out another way. I liked that the ending was happy without being cheesy or sappy-sweet.I recommend this if you'd like something on the lighter side, but still with a bit of substance."},{"Title":"The Lost Art of Keeping Secrets","review":"\\"The Lost Art of Keeping Secrets\\" would have been much more entertaining if some of the heavy drinking of alcohol has been omitted. In 1955, which is the time this book takes place, I don't believe drinking among 18-year-olds was as commonplace as Ms. Rice thinks it was. In fact, at least here in America, it was illegal, as the legal age was 21. I would have recommended this book to others if most of the heavy drinking been had been left out. In my opinion, those parts were quite boring, offensive, and didn't add to the story."},{"Title":"The Lost Art of Keeping Secrets","review":"This story was amazing. It has been awhile since I finished it but its a great story and very well written."},{"Title":"The Lost Art of Keeping Secrets","review":"It is fun to witness British life in the 1950s as music changed forever the tempo of our world. The tone of the novel was warm and romantic, flighty and fun, serious and sad. My emotions were fully engaged with every character. I truly enjoyed the book and didn't want it to end. I would recommend this to any of my friends."},{"Title":"The Lost Art of Keeping Secrets","review":"This book hardly needs extra praise, but I can't help heaping on a little more because, well, it's just so GOOD. I was shocked, in fact, by how much I loved it: I'm an avid but cranky reader, probably because I'm also a writer by profession and can't turn off the editorial voice, and besides that I'm essentially allergic to 'chick-lit'. I can't recall what made me break down and buy a book with pink page-ends in the first place (the early stages of pregnancy, perhaps?!) But once I started, I couldn't stop turning those rose-tinted pages. I loved the down-to-earth optimism of the narrator, the understated quirkiness of her friends and family, and the plot, if decidedly girly, was nevertheless beguiling.Don't listen to the denigrators! If this book doesn't make you smile, I don't know what will."},{"Title":"The Lost Art of Keeping Secrets","review":"After reading a series of serious books, I wanted something fun but intelligent to read ..something that was light but not complete nonsense!The story at the back seemed like fun and it was a Richard and Judy's Book Club selection too!The book was completely worth it! The best thing about The Lost Art of Keeping Secrets was that it was so Jane Austen-ish ....it could almost have been written by Jane Austen herself!The novel was not only enjoyable, but at the same time humorous , touching and romantic as well. Every character was likable and well -developed. While reading, it felt as if they were my close buddies! It was like I knew each character personally. Eva Rice has written in a manner that made me feel I was getting a glimpse into the lives of people I already knew and liked. The book seemed so fresh and had that \\"feel good\\" element to it. At the end of the book, I had a smile on my face. It gave me that warm fuzzy feel inside.The novel was predictable to be honest. But it didn't matter to me at all.Eva Rice has given a great description of the post-war period and how it was like to be a teenager in that era.The simplicity of the book makes it so beautiful to me. Its a sweet and romantic story that doesn't require a lot of brains but still is so much more than the usual \\"chick-lits.\\"The characters were completely relatable, the setting and the era was well-described . Apart from reminding me of Jane Austen, Lost Art Of Keeping Secrets is also reminiscent of I Capture The Castle.Overall:A warm , light and humorous novel!Recommended?To everyone who loves Austen and Dodie Smith!"},{"Title":"The Lost Art of Keeping Secrets","review":"This book is a throwback on the 60s era, and it is amazing! Set in England, two girls get to know each other by a twist of fate, and their lives become so interesting because of it. I can't give away the ending, but it makes you feel so good! If you are going to read one good fictional book this year, make it this one."},{"Title":"The Lost Art of Keeping Secrets","review":"This book sets up a quiet sweet world, a set of light fun characters, and then moves them gracefully across each other. It takes good care of the reader, and while the people suffer trials, there is never a doubt that things will turn out well for them. And that's good news, because you'll come to care about the flawed but likable people you meet here. The neat bow on the end was a bit too contrived, even for me a reader who likes a happy ending. Still, if you are looking for a book for a plane flight, or even just a free day where you can curl up on a favorite cushion with a cup of tea, you wont be disappointed with The Lost Art of Keeping Secrets."},{"Title":"The Lost Art of Keeping Secrets","review":"Certainly one of the best books I've read in a long time.I honestly found this book just perusing through the bookstore aisles one day. I always read the first page or so before buying, so there must have been something about it i liked. I love how all of the sub-plots are interwoven throughout. I'd never heard of Johnnie Ray, but shortly after finishing the book, I noticed that his music actually came on one of my Pandora radio stations!I can only imagine the time it took to research all the elements of this story. It's given me inspiration for the novels I hope to write myself one day. I cant wait to read more from Eva Rice."},{"Title":"The Lost Art of Keeping Secrets","review":"I found this book at the dollar store...the DOLLAR STORE, and I've fallen in love with it. It's one of those books from which lines keep running through my head throughout the day. And it was an uplifting book; so much of \\"relevant\\" literature leaves a sour taste, but this book is truly well-crafted, edited, about love and youth without being maudlin.Now I'm hunting for more Eva Rice."},{"Title":"The Lost Art of Keeping Secrets","review":"The Lost Art of Keeping Secrets by Eva Rice is a book I discovered in the bargain section. The story is set in London, post-WWII. Eighteen year old Penelope, her brother,Indigo, and her mother live in a large estate house, which they can not afford to maintain. Penelope's father died during the war and left them nearly penniless.While looking for a job, Penelope takes an impulsive cab ride with a stranger, the lively Charlotte Ferris, and the two soon become fast friends. Penelope follows Charlotte to society parties and even pretends to be her cousin's fiance to make a girl jealous. Penelope and Charlotte share a love of American rock-n-roll which is just starting to emerge, and fashion and fun.This is a delightful, charming read, full of quirky characters. The story is about friendship, coming of age, a changing world, and a dash of romance. I did not want this book to end nor did I want to leave 1950's London. This is much more than a chick-lit novel and I strongly recommend this well-written, captivating book."},{"Title":"The Lost Art of Keeping Secrets","review":"I loved this book!!

Overall, a very entertaining book to say the least with the Nazis and Asian Mercenary Cult joining forces and then helping the UAAF at the end to stop a comet from ending all of mankind. It seemed like an appropriate end to the series but it appears Maloney has taken our hero back in time in the next novel."},{"Title":"Allyson's Beau","review":"I was suprised to find that Allyson's Beau wasn't just another story about a horse, and even more suprised to find that this is the author's first book. Even though I don't live in the world of horses, there was much about the well-defined protagonist - Allyson - that I could identify with.This is a story about a young woman's journey through some very difficult times, resulting in her growth and ultimately, triumph. I won't go into what Allyson goes through that challenges her - not what you might expect - and not to give too much away, but the story does not have a predictable outcome. There is also some romance in the book, as well.The author is kind enough to include a glossary of technical terms, for those who are not in the know about horses, etc. All in all, it was an excellent read, and I am looking forward to Ms. Vander Wende-William's next novel."},{"Title":"Allyson's Beau","review":"This book details the story of Allyson, a young woman trying to make her way in life and achieve her goal of working with horses full-time despite numerous obstacles and hurdles along the way. A detailed, funny, romantic story that is difficult to put down. (Additionally, I learned more about horses reading this book than I ever knew!)"},{"Title":"Allyson's Beau","review":"This is a great book. Allyson comes across like a real person, and even though the setting is the 70's, her experiences and the problems she confronts are very contemporary. I think teenagers today will really be able to relate. Also, any teenager who loves horses (or any adult, for that matter) will really enjoy this book. The world of horses is not my world, but the author did an excellent job of pulling me into that world and holding me there spellbound. This was one of those books I just didn't want to put down."},{"Title":"Women, Writing, and the Reproduction of Culture in Tudor and Stuart Britain","review":"I'm grateful for this book, that's both scholarly and easily read by the non-scholar.

I particularly enjoyed the &quot;Tutoring the Tudors&quot; chapter by Kathi Vosevich. Her research brings to life the differences in the political rhetoric of Queens Mary and Elizabeth Tudor."},{"Title":"EXCHANGE RATE MODELLING","review":"The book provides answers to the key issues on exchange rate modelling supported by empirical evidence. It gives a comprehensive overview of the econometrics technique used for modelling exchange rate from macroeconomic perspective.It is an essential guidance for those readers generally interested in the topic and those practitians actually trying to model the exchange rate."},{"Title":"Etudes De Sociologie Religieuse: Studies in Religious Sociology (European sociology)","review":"je suis professeur de sociologie a l'universite de Kuwai"},{"Title":"PROCOPIUS AND THE SIXTH CENTURY","review":"Cameron's Procopius and the Sixth Century, first published in 1985, became for a long time orthodoxy on Procopius' mystifying three works.Cameron's merit is, firstly, to have shown the importance of genre and how it must supersede the search for factual detail, and secondly to have pointed at the complementarity of the three works. Thus Cameron points at the influence and constraints of genre, especially of classical history on the Wars and of invective on the Secret History. Expatiating on the subject's sexual antics, for example, was a conventional part of classical invective. The reader was never expected to take literally Theodora's orgies, her multiple abortions, or the statement that Justinian caused the death of a hundred billion people. Buildings is likewise a formulaic work, if in the opposite sense to the Secret History. Not so much a descriptive or an exhaustive work, it must be seen as an argumentative piece aiming to extol the emperor's church and fortress-building.At the same time, Procopius and the Sixth Century may be too ready to accept Procopius' Christianity, and too bent on making him a typical Byzantine scholar rather than the classical author he evidently wished to be read as. This has considerable implications as to how his very contradictory works are read, especially the controversial Secret History. Procopius himself wrote in his introduction to it that this was the key to his work, and Cameron's conclusions amount to denying that. This is a learned textual reading of Procopius based on the modern tools of cultural historical analysis, but it is weak on making use of the Wars' classical references. As a result, it tends to downgrade Procopius, and underplay his political message. For a more recent, and perhaps more perceptive but also controversial, analysis, see Anthony Kaldellis's Procopius of Caesarea."},{"Title":"A Klimt Journal: Based on the Designs of Gustav Klimt","review":"\\"Based on the designs of Gustav Klimt.

Parts of it flowed smoothly and parts made little sense and moved like molasses. Aside from that I agree with some other reviewers in that the racism (she automatically assumes every Arab she meets is a terrorist) and the sexism (well, maybe not sexism, but her coworker calling her 'baby' and her going along with it rubs me the wrong way) left a bad taste in my mouth. I love chick lit, but I think chick lit should still be intelligent and well-written, and this book is not."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"The first book I read from Helen Fielding was of course Bridget Jones a long time ago. This is (i think) HF's best work and cutest character. Olivia is so silly and so lovable and yet such a strong woman. She has such a love for adventure that more often than not her imagination runs quite wild, a fresh, fun, sunny read. I LOVE this book so much i have it on 3 formats ( audio book I bought first loved it so much i bought the hard cover used, and now own it on kindle so no matter what if i have bad day i can spend a day in the life of Olivia Joules and her folded toilet paper & survival tin)"},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"As a Bridget Jones' Diary fan I was eager to read this book as well. It's not written diary style like BJD, but is still a very good read and entertaining. The main character is very quirky and does some random things, but is very likeable and easy to relate to. The book wasn't as laugh out loud funny to me as BJD and it's rather farfetched, but still good."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"I wish I could find another book JUST LIKE THIS ONE. I've never read a book that's made me laugh so hard! This was a quick, fluffy read, yet not sappy or overly romantic and sex-filled. Somehow Fielding managed to combine the perfect amounts of suspense, humor and romance, all the while appealing to those of us who know, deep down, we are really CIA operatives waiting to happen:) A perfect \\"escape from reality\\" book."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"I was pretty good! I give it 9 out of 10 supermommie pink stars. The heroine is a journalist that writes for a London newspaper and a London magazine (maybe that's why I liked it). She desperately wants to be a spy of some sort so she imagines that she already is. She travels for her newspaper/magazine article and get's into all kinds of \\"fun trouble\\". The ending was totally unexpected (although why I didn't expect it is unknown to me. I should have expected it) but good.The reason for not getting a perfect supermommie pink star total was that the romance portion was slow and convoluted. Foreshadowing could have been a bit better and would have smoothed out the ending BUT then the ending wouldn't have been as shocking as it was. I guess I just go for the hot and heavier love scenes and this was a PG.This book is a MUST read. If you have read Bridget Jones Diary you have to automatically move to this book next. You will laugh.NOTE: Don't read it on the train or you will laugh out loud many times and people will think that you are crazier than you really are."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"I was sad to reach the end because I had such fun reading this! Olivia's keen British wit and the book's fast pace make it a fun escape. The reviewers who grinch that is it implausible, etc. need to lighten up. I tend to be one of those \\"that would never happen\\" people, but when you are clearly reading a silly novel, get over it. Besides, the pastiches of the cranky editors and vapid Hollywood hangers-on are both spot-on and a hoot. I would love to see this made into a movie with Ian McKellen as the MI6/professor character."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"I imagine Olivia Joules is who Bridget Jones would be if she decided to focus on her career instead of her love life. I was pleasantly surprised that this book had a much more developed storyline than the book jacket description provided. Granted, the storyline is somewhat far-fetched, but that's part of it's charm. I loved it!"},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"Boy, I read this book last year and had a terrible time putting it down. Helen Fielding's writing style draws you, keeps you interested, and captivates your mind while also tickling your funny bone.

Alas, this book was a disappointment from chapter 1 on. A passable Ian Fleming-style conspiracy plot provides the background to a literary train wreck, a calamity littered with shallow characters, hollow stereotypes, and stale dialog. My chief complaints? 1) Nearly every Muslim character is either a terrorist or a dirty, shady salesman. 2) The chief love interest is a condescending muscle-bound American CIA agent who likes to call his female colleagues \\"baby.\\" Swoon! 3) Covert agents investigating Al-Qaeda can safely pass as either reporters or academics. Beg Pardon? 4) Ms. Joules' first impulse upon seeing any man appears to generally involve sizing him up as \\"man material.\\" I could go on, but you get the idea. If you're looking for more sexism, racism, and crotch-related humor in your chick lit, this is the book for you. Otherwise, stay far, far, away."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"A perfect beach book. A fun way to spend your time.

It is surely not what one would think from the title or looks of the cover, but it surely entertained me and satisfied by reading hunger.Olivia Joules is a cute, fashionista who is a little out of her mind and never fails to amuse.First thing I thought of when I read the first couple of chapters was Adele Lang's Confessions. But then the story began to develop and one idea turned into another and the story formed quite well.I liked Fielding's character development too. Half of the things I thought were going to happen didn't. And half the things I thought about the characters didn't happen either. I loved how Olivia's overactive imagination went from daydreams and theories to reality and back again. And Fielding did not over complicate the story either. Which can happen and it didn't in this case. The \\"mystery\\" of it all was quite easy to follow and a pleasure to read. The characters I think were also well developed but not overly so. The reader gets just enough information about each character to get the point across. Which is something I personally like, because as I stated eariler, it didn't over complicate things.Great, easy, fun read! Can't wait for another one! I hope another Olivia Joules story is on the way!"},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination is one of the rare books that is insane enough to be unbelievable but realistic enough to keep you flipping the pages into the wee hours of the night. This is another one of Helen Fielding's sensational delights that allows women to realize that they are the main focus in their own lives despite the poisoning, maddening man issues and terrorism that is so apparent. It's a really quick read, great for travel or vacation and is a conversation piece that is remarkable to pass along to the girls. Happy Reading."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"I got half way through and then decided that life is too short to waste time on books like this.Bridget Jones was great and why I picked this book up. Oops. I kept re-reading the reviews as I tried to get through the book. So many five stars?The best review mentioned that when British writers try to write an \\"American\\" book they invariably fail and fall into cliche. I think that statement works. The book aims to be so hip and cool and falls so flat. Indeed, it's manic, with one surprise after the other, falling into each other and never fully developed (leading into a mess and confusion...I felt unsatisfied). So, to the author...slow down and develop something before moving on to the next thing. This book is all too much of nothing.Sorry, I hate giving bad reviews but this book is just so lacking in anything much compelling or original. It isn't a one star...the sentances hang together and it isn't terrible. It just isn't good or worthwhile.As for the stereotypes...yes, I agree. This aspect of the book didn't bother me. A lack of a likeable character, which flows from the stereotypes, was a bigger issue.I don't know why this book exists. Since it got so many glowing reviews an audience does exist. I'm just not it."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"You know, I just love it when the user reviews completely ruin the ending of a book.You may hated the book but that doesn't mean you have to spoil it for those who haven't read it yet."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"i enjoyed reading bridget jones, and thought i would like olivia joules. but the plot is predictable and the character a little over the top. helen spends much of this book reinforcing stereotypes, which i find annoying and close minded. just read bridget jones and don't bother with olivia joules."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"I have never read a more ridiculous story.

Even if I did not read the Bridget Jones' diaries (which I did and thoroughly enjoyed), I still would be perplexed how this kind of writing/book gets published. The al-Quaeda references are kind of annoying and boring and cliche, almost ridiculous.

Some of us have that one crazy person in our life who is always reading too much into everything and has an over-active imagination. If this describes you, then you will enjoy this book.I read it in a day because I was dying to see what was going to happen next. Parts of the book were, \\"Yeah right,\\" moments, but that happens in all spy novels/movies.I thought the character of Olivia Joules was intriguing, with the imagination of a great writer.

She is Bridget Jones with an attitude.

Instead, I found a main character with no plausible motivation whatsoever (All right, her family was killed when she was young--and? Why does this matter? It doesn't.). I could nearly have tolerated that had it not been for the blatant racism of the work. This book lacks any hint of a balanced perspective on Islam, Arabic culture, or...well, anything, really.Further, the heroine's lack of self-control is frankly embarrassing. If one is intended to believe that she is convinced that she is mixed up with shady dealings and in nearly perpetual danger of losing her life, then what the devil is she doing randomly falling in love/lust with people whom she has no reason to trust and then feeling betrayed when they are not all they seem? I suppose this was an attempt to create a female version of James Bond's frequent sexual exploits, but the accompanied whinging made me want to tell Olivia she'd better leave that to the experts.In brief: neither fun, funny, nor anything except maddening and deadly dull."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"This review is for the Penguin Books 2005 paperback edition, 305 pages. OLIVIA JONES AND THE OVERACTIVE IMAGINATION was on the USA Today top 150 bestseller list for four weeks in June and July 2004, reaching a peak position of 81.I read this novel twice in as many weeks, the first time zipping along sniffing the eccentric aromas of lovely silliness laced with adverbs about a pert blonde British freelance journalist with the essential ingredient for a M16 spy, an overactive imagination. Skimming along, oblivious of details, not looking for clues, I enjoyed what I presumed delightful nonsense although with the haunting suspicion of missing something.So I read it again. With foreknowledge of important characters like the close-cropped blond and the hairy bellboy, I listed them, noting on which page they appeared and reappeared. Like Olivia Joules I googled my suspicions. Takfiri are in fact followers of Takfir wal Hijira. Popayan is a colonial city in Colombia, not one of the Bay Islands off the coast of Honduras, yet Helen Fielding captured the ambiance of those islands as I know it. (I lived in La Ceiba for seven years.)On second reading I paused to consider the subtext on frivolity, arrogance and despite and appreciated that Ms. Fielding didn't explain the technicalities of scuba diving.

Because of said imagination, Olivia has been demoted at her job from major stories to the fashion section of the newspaper. Olivia is sent to Miami to cover a face cream premiere and becomes convinced that a movie producer she meets at the premiere, Pierre Feramo, is really Osama bin Laden. Mayhem ensues as Olivia tries to foil the suspected terrorist.I was very excited when I heard that Fielding had a new novel coming out. I read \\"Bridget Jones' Diary\\" before it became colossally trendy to do so and I simply adored it. Thus, I was excited at the prospect of more from Fielding. I have to say I was a bit disappointed with this novel. The whole \\"Oh my gosh! He's Osama bin Laden!\\" thing was cute and entertaining when it first occurred in the novel. However, when he actually turned out to be a terrorist and al-Qaeda conspirator, I wanted to throw the book across the room. Perhaps it's because I read the novel very near to the 3rd anniversary of 9/11, but I just thought that linking this fictional character with al-Qaeda was poor on the part of Fielding. Plus, Olivia really wasn't that likeable. I didn't go into this novel expecting a Bridget-eque tale, but I did expect something better than what I got."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"I think the reason some people do not like this book is because they are expecting Bridget Jones. While the main character, Olivia, is somewhat similar to Bridget, she is a totally different character and this books reads a lot differenly than the Bridget Jones series. I believe this misconception that this book is along the same lines is why some people did not like the book. I admit the book was slow at the beginning, but once I got into it, I could not put it down and I was laughing out loud right until the end. The plot was very unique and combined serious issues with a daring female spy. Good read!"},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"Olivia Joules, a spy in the making, varies from Helen Fielding's other literary counterpart, Bridget Jones, in that Olivia is gorgeous, reasonably confident and capable whereas Bridget was unsure, average-looking and a bumbler, EXCEPT, like Bridget, Olivia has an overactive imagination.Olivia Joules is primarily a modern spy thriller, conscious of the post-9/11 era. In the beginning, we meet journalist Olivia after she's been demoted by her pompous boss (a recurring character in Fielding's books) to covering launches of facial creams. She is assigned to a launch in South Beach.Here is where the book gets fun. She whisks off to South Beach, where she meets a dashing gentlemen, then to Catalina Island, then Honduras, and, before you know it, you're in the midst of escapist beach reading where you can feel the sun and see the blue-green water. Of course, in the end, our hero Olivia's overactive imagination is validated and saves the day.This book is light; it's meant to be so. Fielding can write this type of lit and she is truly humorous. I think the only criteria for a book like this is \\"was it fun?\\" For me, yes."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"Wow, seems like people either loved it or hated it....well...I LOVED THIS BOOK. I flew through it in three days...couldn't put it down! It has parts that are just hilarious, it is suspenseful and I really didn't expect a lot of what happened. Although, I didn't try to analyze it too much either. It is simply a fun read. If you like the show Alias, you will love this.

I loved Olivia Joules as well. I never start a book with any assumptions, as it will most definitely make it less enjoyable. I thought it was wonderful.By the way, nice job to the reviewer that spoiled the whole book.

In typical Fielding style, Olivia is flawed but lovable, insightful and hilarious! I don't want to give too much away, but her mysterious boyfriend is probably one of the funniest male characters I've read in a while (although he's supposed to be a scary terrorist!) The whole effect was wonderful. Like I said, it's not perfect but a fun read... so I really don't understand the bad reviews. Buy it and enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"My daughter got this from the library while we were on vacation, and passed it on to me to read before she returned it. She loved it. I wasn't quite as enamored.I didn't hate it, either. It was a fun read, but didn't have a whole lot of substance to it.Anyway, Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination is like a comedy version of the movie Conspiracy Theory. Olivia is a journalist who sees conspiracies and Big Stories everywhere, and finally stumbles on to one, by sheer accident.My main complaint about the story is that it was too firmly straddling the fence between being a semi-serious James Bond-type story and being an over-the-top Stephanie Plum-type story. If it had leaned more either way, I'd have been much happier with it. Instead, we're asked to believe, for example, that the CIA would recruit her on the spot as an agent because of her overactive imagination and without the support of the entire book being completely over-the-top, things like that just fall flat.The romance, too, was too wishy-washy. I'd have been happier with it being focused on either less or more, or even left out completely. As it was, I couldn't believe in it, and it felt out of place.I did, however, love Olivia's \\"Rules for Living.\\" (#1: \\"Don't panic.\\" #2: \\"No one is thinking about you. They're thinking about themselves, just like you.\\") In fact, I think they made the book for me. Without them, I'd probably have given the book 3 or 3.5 stars. Not just that the rules were present, but what they were, and how Olivia referred to them at times throughout the story."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"While I can't fully relate to Fielding sex-crazed heroines, and while I did not care to be (as one reviewer stated it) \\"inflicted\\" with Fielding's politics, I would not wish to deny that this was an amazingly entertaining read. I must be among the few in that I liked it better than Bridget Jones. It was the first work of pop fiction in some time that I have been able to read cover to cover without skimming. I tend to delight myself with nonfiction and the classics, and I have a hard time not being bored by pop. fiction. Did this grab me because of its intellectual depth, its profundity, its complexity of language? Certainly not. It grabbed me because it was funny, entertaining...farcical. And that last word is the key-if you don't like farce and you want a \\"serious\\" thriller, by all means, skip this! It's widely implausible, as it is meant to be. (SPOILERS) I actually though it rather more of a twist that Pierre did in fact turn out to be a terrorist, since the reader is expecting he won't and that it will just be some comical mistake of Olivia's. Once that bit is revealed, the plot does become much more predictable and not quite as enjoyable, but I still had no problem plodding on through to the end. I found Olivia's character to be a bit undulating; she seems the Nancy Drew type one second and the Bridget Jones type the next-that is, she seems suddenly to become a very capable agent after being a bit of a silly journalist. Well, she's a bit silly throughout, I suppose. Despite its flaws, I very much enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"I've enjoyed all of the Helen Fielding books I've read mainly because they're a lot of fun; light hearted and a bit neurotic. This book was no exception! Although a bit far fetched, it was a fun read, with a mixture of romance and intrigue. The main character, Olivia, was irresistible -- her \\"rules for living\\" were so clever that I actually hear myself repeating them as I manage my day!

Losito has written an informative, thought-provoking, and even inspiring little book. He writes so that, \\"others may be drawn ever closer to Our Lord Jesus and see that for His sake and through Him, great holiness of life is quite possible and within reach, closer than imagined.\\" His book is meant to inspire readers to give serious, deep and prayerful thought to their manner of speech. I know it accomplished this with me.Monsignor tells us that no matter who or where we are, there is a means available to us in being able to attain extraordinary holiness. This means is found in James 3:2 which tells us: \\"Any man among you who is perfect in speech, is a perfect man.\\" Holiness and sanctity, no matter who, what, or where you are, is possible if one can be perfect in speech. In the book Monsignor goes into great detail about how one is to accomplish this and touches upon all of the problems one has with speech. There are twenty-three chapters, and seventeen of them are dedicated to these usual problems we have and how we can overcome them. If you are struggling with speech, whether that be in charity and humility in speech, gossip, sarcasm, silence, honesty, etc. this is the book for you.I found it very helpful in my own life.

Here is a summary of the book contents:Part 1: An appreciation of the Medium - a very quick summary of the field. Covers lots of territory with little depthPart 2: Seeing Pictures - portion of the book I would like to see expanded, only 8 pages long. This covers composition and how to see pictures.Part 3: Film - obvious. Covers grain, types, use a tripod, etc.Part 4: Techniques - Light metering. Be aware of how your meter can fool you. Also filters.Part 5: Completing the Vision - How to Print. Contact sheets, variable contrast papers, toning.Part 6: Photo Diary - Artist's statement.I think where the book fails is that it covers everything with such little depth. The Zone System gets maybe a paragraph. The one area where it does spend time is in using the light meter. If you aren't familiar with how white or black objects can fool a meter looking for middle gray, then maybe you could benefit from this book. I think it is more designed for the beginner/intermediate photographer. I think a book in this series which covers landscape composition a bit better is &quot;How to Photograph Landscapes&quot; by Joe Lange.Most of the information presented in this book is not specific to landscape. The author makes clear that one of his favorite types of photographs is to find faces in cliffs and rocks. Not really my cup of tea. Again not terrible for basics but there are many books which cover the same material. I wish the book would have focused more on a few areas, particular to outdoors, and added more depth.

Roach produced several books which introduced youngsters to the writings and life of Henry David Thoreau.\\"The Mouse and the Song\\" begins by describing the life of Mouse, who lives in an unnamed woods near an unnamed pond. She leads a typical mouse life, full of the usual dangers and the activity of the food-gathering business. Mouse eventually encounters a man in the woods, and she eventually grows trustful enough to eat a piece of cheese from his hand. She is enchanted by the music she hears when he blows through a tube with holes in it. \\"The fox, the owl, the weasel, the hawk were still a part of Mouse's days and nights, but now she had the music as well and it could not be taken from her.\\" By the end of the book as winter approaches, Mouse finds a new home territory, away from the man and his flute. She also finds a song of her own and soon sings \\"from the center of her being.\\"A brief foreword tells the reader that this storyline was inspired by the mouse episode in Thoreau's \\"Walden.\\" Otherwise, the text is blissfully unmarked by reminders, thus allowing the reader (child or parent) to choose whether or not to make the connection. Either way, it's a good story. As for whether or not mice actually sing -- well, you'll have to make that decision on your own.At least two children's books have focused on this small tale from \\"Walden.\\" \\"The Mouse and the Song\\" is more subtle in its approach than \\"Little Mouse\\" by Bill Montague, and I like this one better for being so. It's more about Mouse than about Henry, and that's OK. It honors both."},{"Title":"York's Journal: A Novel","review":"Anyone interested in good historical fiction, especially about the American frontier, should read York's Journal, a novel about the Lewis & Clark expedition as told from the point of view of William Clark's slave. Nichols has created a plausible, dignified, often humorous and engaging voice for his narrator. Like an earlier version of Frederick Douglass, York keeps his literacy and intelligence secret from his white master. We experience his longing for freedom, his robust sexuality, his prowess as a hunter, his dignity and integrity. From his first glimpse of native people along the Missouri to his friendship with members of the Clatsop tribe at the mouth of the Columbia, York feels a deep kinship with the mistrusted, despised, yet resilient Indians, and he is forever scheming to run off and join them. He shows us the familiar heroes in an unfamiliar light, especially Clark's struggles with the English language and Lewis's struggles with the gloom and paranoia that would eventually consume him. Having read several accounts of the Lewis & Clark saga, including the official journals, I was intrigued by this fresh telling."},{"Title":"York's Journal: A Novel","review":"York's Journal: A NovelBy William NicholsReview by Terry DavisOregon has been celebrating the 200th year anniversary of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. The celebration includes lectures at universities, colleges, and other schools, exhibits, tours, music, with instruments of the period, and much more. Even now, a replica of Fort Clatsop is being built, after a fire recently destroyed the previous one.York's Journal: A Novel, by William Nichols and published in 2005, is a creative addition to this celebration.William Styron, a generation ago, wrote a novel, The Confessions of Nat Turner. The novel triggered considerable criticism and conflict regarding the author being white and trying to create the consciousness of a black man.The same issue could be raised by York's Journal-a white author and a black main character speaking through the device of a journal. The resolution is that in spite of the racial difference, at least two important characteristics are shared. Both black and white share a common humanity and the potential for empathy. Through the power of the imagination, an author can shed beautiful and shining light on our common existence as humans. I believe that William Nichols has accomplished such a work.York, a slave in the servitude of William Clark, was a member of the \\"Corps of Discovery\\" though never officially recognized as such. Earlier in his life, he had learned to read and write. How this unusual learning occurred is recounted in the novel. York's love of reading and writing is central to the novel. His perceptiveness brings out and develops many themes: the sheer adventure of the Expedition, with its hardships, illnesses, and humor, relationships with various aborigines and tribes, women and sex, the mystery of wilderness, spirituality, and the overriding tension between freedom and servitude.The language, the voice of York, is impressive, consistent throughout, inventive, and often humorous. It sparkles with imaginative turns of phrase. Some examples give a taste of this highlight of the novel: \\"The master's fear is often the servant's opportunity\\" (p. 14). \\"The gold of evening\\" (p. 78). \\"Nothing is better than work one freely chooses\\" (p. 10).The language is important to the novel not only for such characteristics but also for the importance of the journal and its writing to the characterization of York. When York has not had opportunity to write for awhile, he exclaims, \\"My journal comes alive again!\\" (p. 182). The journaling became almost an addiction for York, \\"like strong drink was to white men\\" (p.188). On the downside for York, \\"my journal was become a visible emblem of all the bonds that held me to civilization\\" (p. 188). On the other hand, his writing \\"gave shape to the joy I find in freedom\\" (p. 212).These examples reflect and embody a central theme, a conflict both external and internal, between freedom and servitude. York never varied from his understandable longing for freedom. Yet he is honest enough with himself to see that gaining his freedom was not merely a matter of becoming legally free or of leaving the Expedition and staying with natives and making a new life with them. He \\"longed for civilization despite my hatred of servitude\\" (p. 166). The Expedition became for York a quest for his freedom. \\"On my journey westward I would be a man,\\" he said, hoping to find freedom in the west (pp. 61, 62).Along the way were all the adventures, joys, and trials and tribulation of this great physical adventure. As the Corps of Discovery made its way across the vastness of the continent, they encountered many native tribes, and their many differences are described. Because of his condition of servitude among the whites, York seemed much drawn to the natives and developed many interesting and valued personal relationships with them. Some of these were sexual relationships, which was an important part of York's adventures. In the Barocka Uanapa ceremony of the Mandan tribe, as an honored guest, he enjoyed the pleasures of intimacy with the wife of one of the Mandans. Later, he learned directly that \\"Clatsops couple more patiently and deliberately than any people I have known\\" (p. 149). He developed a close relationship of love with Keluk, of the Clatsops.York felt drawn to the natives in part because as a slave in the white man's Expedition, he was lonely. Except for Shannon, a young white man, he could not be open with the whites. As York pointed out, \\"dissembling is a necessity of servitude\\" (p. 152). Shannon was \\"the one man on the Expedition with whom I did not have to pretend I was a dolt\\" (p. 28). Yet even with Shannon, York noted that he \\"was not foolish enough to share my dream of freedom with a white man\\" (p. 31).He \\"longed to find a place where I could feel the presence of true companionship\\" (p. 41). Among the natives, he did find that true companionship. And because of his liking for them, he found his sympathies with them in the disputes and conflicts between the Expedition and the various tribes. The Clatsops, for example, feared a treacherous alliance between the white men of the Expedition and those of a ship arriving in the Columbia River. York's comment tells a lot: \\"Knowing what I do of white men, I saw no reason to dismiss their fears\\" (p. 149).An outgrowth of his finding companionship with the natives was his hearing interesting stories from them, stories of mythological and spiritual insight. These stories, of Teahwit, Bear Woman, Talapus, and others, are engagingly narrated. They speak about truths relevant to York's emotional and psychological states and become integral and revealing parts of the novel.They also point to what I take to be a central part of the novel. It is that the adventure becomes a deep spiritual quest. This aspect of the story is hinted at in the references to the mystery of the wilderness, at first just hints of the spirit, a feeling York \\"came to cherish\\" despite his fears (p. 72). The stories often related to such fears. As Keluk explained to York, the story of Awl Woman was a story of yas mesachie, that is, of great evil (p. 177).The spiritual quest blossoms and deepens in York's encounter with Teahwit's story about seeking his tahmahnawis, the Clatsop term for the Holy Spirit, by going to the top of Saghalie mountain. This name refers to the mountain with the shape of a saddle. This mountain, now called Saddle Mountain, is a real mountain near the northern Oregon coast. It still, of course, is a place of great mystery and spirit. Teahwit's story led to York making his own journey up the mountain in search of his tahmahnawis. Significantly, there is just one path to the top. Also significantly, Mooluk, York's Clatsop friend and teacher, took York's rifle before showing him the way to the mountain. Nor did he take food.As with any truly spiritual quest, York's ascension of Saghalie brought up the essential conflicts and troubles in his psyche and life. Central to these were his journal writing, so precious to him. But his writing was also the telling, as York said, \\"of a slave whose fortunes depended on the whims of others\\" (p. 188). His journal, he sees, had become \\"a visible emblem of all the bonds that held me to civilization\\" (p. 188). And that bond made his task more difficult. \\"In this vast wilderness,\\" York says, \\"I knew I must come to feel at home\\" (p. 187).York's resolution on the mountain top was to \\"forswear writing in my journal and if that failed to free my spirit to live among the Clatsops, I would throw its pages in the fire\\" (p. 188). The resolution to sacrifice the symbol of his bondage is at the heart of any true spiritual quest.He did not, however, keep this resolution. The journey through life often hits us with the unexpected. For York, shortly after his quest on the mountain, Master Clark told him that he would free him on their safe return. \\"Then I understood the truth: I was not become a Clatsop\\" (p. 191). He could, York said, \\"think only of my joy and pride in holding freedom as a prize won on the Expedition to the western sea\\" (p. 191). But the inner conflict was so great that he was \\"filled with rage, knowing I would not choose to stay among the Clatsops\\" (p. 191).Thus, he returned to civilization with the Expedition, continued writing in his journal, was freed as promised from the bondage of servitude, and given by Master Clark some land of his own to work.How puzzling, ambiguous, and mysterious life is! York's return to civilization brought him \\"only sorrow\\" (p. 197). He concluded that \\"it had been an error to leave the land of the Clatsops\\" (p. 197). He remembered his farewell to Keluk and his promise to return \\"when I am free\\" (p. 197). She did not believe him.The story of Talapus reverberates at this point with all the angst of life. Talapus, who must \\"guard against his habit of doing foolish things,\\" had \\"grown to like his life among the shadow people\\" and he \\"tells the spirit he prefers to stay\\" with them (p. 199). Because of his disobedience, \\"The spirit never returns\\" to Talapus (p. 200).Whether the story of Talapus applies directly to York is ambiguous. But York does say that in telling his story, he came to understand a truth: \\"this freedom and this land are not enough. It remains to tell what I have learned from writing my story\\" (p. 206). He understands also that he must \\"go to seek my way in the wilderness that once seemed to me only a terrifying land\\" (p. 216).Perhaps he did. I hope so. Whether or not, he was indeed a man. True liberation of any person brings more light to our human condition. And this marvelous novel throws clarifying light on that condition. Well done!"},{"Title":"York's Journal: A Novel","review":"York's Journal is intriguing partially for what it is NOT. The novel assumes that the reader is informed about the expedition or is able to look things up. So, as other readers have noted, it does not spread itself thin trying to cover non-fiction matters commonly available. One hardly senses, for example, the enormity of the distances and time (and drudgery) involved. Nor the trip's logistics, goals, funding, setbacks, and even its historical impact. And since its protagonist is something of a stoic, it doesn't dwell very long on privation, loneliness, and hardship.Rather, York's Journal: A Novel is a fully imagined and unexpected trip into a trip. The language is magical; the locutions, vocabulary, and rhythms carry the reader back to our young nation's growth spurt and lend a compelling sense of authenticity. York gives us dark views of the leaders, esp. Captain Clark. Since York is Clark's black slave, his special position vis-&agrave;-vis his \\"master,\\" his white company and the very different Indian nations they meet makes for some startling possibilities (and also some humorous and uninhibited sexual encounters). It offers York's troubling, mysterious dreams and nightmares as he becomes more and more alive.Most important, though, is how the novel artfully explores powerful connections between writing, freedom and selfhood."},{"Title":"York's Journal: A Novel","review":"As a history reader and teacher, I am acutely aware that history is about \\"selection\\" of the available data. In this way many stories, often those of women and people of color are left out.Nichols has done an amazing job of recapturing Clark's slave York's story from the Lewis and Clark Journals, never overstepping into flights of fancy but instead imaginatively giving us another insight into that incredible troop of explorers and their incredible journey. Good scholarship, excellent writing, a great read."},{"Title":"York's Journal: A Novel","review":"This book turned out to be quite a nice surprise. I have little interest in either historical novels or the Lewis and Clark expidition, but was intrigued by the fact that the journey did, indeed, include a slave, and in Nichols' book, the slave can read and write, and therefore we have, his, York's journal.Fortunately, the author has spared us a day by day account of the journey West, and concentrated on the more notable events of the trip, including extensive interaction with Native Americans and the difficulties attendant on traversing a new and unknown part of the continent. This is all seen through theeyes of York, who shares in the triumph of discovery as someone thought of as something less than a man. The book deals in detail with his interaction with the various tribes that are encountered, and the concept of freedom begins to define itself in York, until a promise is made to him which is revealing of both the tragedy and the sorrow of slavery, and the book ends with York's decision of how to deal with it.This novel succeeds on all levels. It is an informative narrative of the journey as well as an excellent description of the white-and black-mans interaction with the tribes of the West. The passages dealing with Indian myth and legend are of particular interest. Most importantly it succeeds in its presentation of another dimension of the peculiar, and horrifying, institution of American slavery.

One needs only to look a Martin Chemnitz' four giant tomes on the examination of the Council of Trent to know this was true--and widely known. Nevertheless, today, many Lutherans and Catholics claim that the difference between their confessions is really not such a giant chasm.Dr. Robert Preus, however, would disagree that true differences between Lutheranism and Roman Catholicism no longer exist. In this, his final book before his death in November 1995, Dr. Robert Preus shows through recent documents and scholarship that true agreement has not really been reached between these two churches.Dr. Preus shows that the priority in dialogues between Lutherans and Catholics is &quot;external unity and external peace among the churches.&quot; (pg. 106) He brings to the fore that new definitions to define old terms have taken place instead of true agreement: \\"an amalgam of the old Lutheran and Roman Catholic definitions, or rather, a pasting together of the two disparate sets of definitions--sort of like a treaty.\\" (pg. 111) Preus unmasks that agreements like the Joint Declaration are really vehicles that explain away true doctrinal differences as mere non-divisive differences.Nevertheless, true differences do exist between Roman Catholicism and confession, orthodox Lutheranism. Here are a few for starters: 1) the authority of Scripture, 2) the doctrine of justification, the focus of this book, 3) the authority of the pope, 4) the number and the nature of the sacraments, and 5) the role of the Virgin Mary and the saints.Buy the book to read the searing truth told in a non-vehement way. For &quot;when two parties say they depend upon the saving grace of God for salvation, and by grace one party (the Lutherans) means the saving, loving disposition of God and the other party (the Roman Catholics) means an infused quality, can they be said to share a common confession?&quot; (p. 54.) If you want to believe that no doctrinal differences exist and you like plugging your ears and singing happy melodies, then avoid this book. However, all truth seekers need to buy this book while it is still in print!"},{"Title":"Justification and Rome","review":"This giant of a Lutheran, Bob Preus, here in his final book shows that real Lutheranism and real Roman Catholicism are radically different. What kind of Lutheran and what kind of Roman Catholic? Those who follow there official, historical, published beliefs.Preus carefully shows that the recent announced settling of the theological differences through the publishing of &quot;The Joint Declaration of Justification&quot; is premature and not honest in its conclusions.For centuries and still today, the major difference which separates confessions in Christianity is this doctrine of justification. Here Preus offers evidence from Scripture, the Lutheran Confessions and from church history that unless there is true agreement in all doctrine, there is no true theological settlement, only a false ornamentation of external unity.Such is our ecumenical times, and as always, confessors of the truth have such to contend with. Dr. Preus will go down in history as one fine and valiant contender for the faith handed down. May we who inherit such fine examples continue in his stead, and contend for the three Reformational solas without being contenious.This is a major work of first class. Written so many can feast at the nourishing truth laid out so cogently here.

I was hopefully that this book might help improve my relationship with God.Since my love languages are Words of Affirmation and Physical Touch, I figured it would be tough to explain how God could use those with me, since I can't officially \\"hear\\" Him and definitely can't feel His physical touch. The book handles that very well and points out that, oddly enough, those whose love language is physical touch often show their love to God by singing to him (so true for me!) and report feeling Him as a physical sensation in times when they are close to Him. That was really helpful for me.However, Chapman spends a large portion of one of the chapters condemning homosexuality and giving an example of a person he counseled who was homosexual, saying that he (Chapman) was able to convince them to become heterosexual. This kind of change is virtually impossible in someone who is truly homosexual ([...]).If you are in any way supportive of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) community, or are LGBT yourself, this part of the book may cause you a great deal of pain.

This entire book is filled with stories about other people. There is no real substance here and definitely not anything new. Any decent information that can be gleaned from this book would amount to maybe 4 pages. The rest of this book is nothing but fluff and filler. This book is only good for those people who have zero emotional insight and have to be grabbed by the hand and slowly walked through each explanation and connection. Reading this book felt like I was stuck in a NYC traffic jam.

I'm always talking about it."},{"Title":"The Love Languages of God","review":"As a therapist, Gary Chapman offers an inspirational, uplifting text that, if heard by a reader ready to trust Dr. Chapman's ideas about God, just might lift that reader out of the spiritual doldrums.He follows on his theme from previous books-- the idea that love is expressed in five basic languages, and that everyone has a primary means of expressing love and of feeling loved. (giving gifts, for example, or hearing words of affirmation). God, according to Chapman, speaks these very same \\"languages\\", and therefore the experiences of feeling loved by God and of contributing meaningfully to \\"God's Kingdom\\" are rendered accessible to people of every psychological stripe.The obvious challenge to this idea is the fact that many people in the world feel disconnected from God and do not experience spiritual ecstasy. To this, Chapman replies that sometimes, God denies you access to Himself through your \\"preferred love language\\" in order to challenge you and to promote spiritual growth. He offers numerous anecdotes to promote the idea that, in such cases, it really does all work out in the end.Unfortunately, Chapman fails to deal frankly and thoroughly with spiritual disillusionment in its rawest forms, preferring happy-ending stories that support his love-language theory. In fact, the book often reads like a self-promoting infomercial, relating story after story of individuals and couples whose lives were \\"transformed\\" following an encounter with Gary Chapman's \\"love languages\\" books. If for any reason you fail to fit in with this throng of satisfied customers, this book may leave you feeling sorely cheated and excluded from the experience of connection with God."},{"Title":"The Love Languages of God","review":"I love the original 5 love language book--this one is awesome, too!

It's not about us, people! Stop being so selfish and thinking about God as your own personal genie in the sky who only wants to bless you.

However, it is very wrong and misleading to claim that the author's views are supported by Biblical teachings.David Powlison, in his excellent book \\"Seeing with New Eyes\\", devoted a chapter to point out what is wrong with Gary Chapman's message about the five love languages from the Biblical point of view. He has put it in succinct terms so I have taken the liberty to summarize his points below:***Chapman's premise exalts the observation that even tax collectors, Gentiles and sinners love those who love them. So it recommends that if I scratch your back (by showing affection in the love language you're most receptive of), you will tend to scratch mine. The book teaches you how to become aware of what others want and tell you how to provide it to them in building good relationships. It is practical & choleric wisdom - by manipulation or pandering or both when it is used in the vein of \\"you, being evil, can learn how to give good gifts to your children and spouse\\". Chapman's model is premised on a give-to-get economy, \\"I will give to fill your love tank. But at the back of my mind I'm always considering whether and when I'll get my own tank filled\\".Chapman never deals with the fact that even desire for good things can be evil desires in God's analyses if those things begin to rule us as idolatrous mini-Gods. A love language (or a lust language, at level 5 (LL#5)) instinctively tends to look at all reality through the lens of \\"my needs\\". It gives excuses to those who mistreat others on the pretext of not having had their their love tanks filled. Each of the 5 languages often speaks with a dark and greedy growl. The love of Christ speaks contrary to such self-centered \\"love\\" language because we are taught to love at the life-and-death, love-thy-enemy level irrespective of our felt needs. The book speaks of a language that is diametrically opposed to what Jesus said, \\"Expect nothing in return (Luke 6:35) and tests what we are living for by how we handle evil\\".***I saw the need to post this review as I was given the book by a dedicated Christian friend. It is one thing to give secular advice on \\"How to win friends and influence people\\". It is something else to masquerade it as Christian teachings and push such erroneous ideas to unsuspecting Christians as biblical truths to be grasped for successful living.Seeing With New Eyes: Counseling and the Human Condition Through the Lens of Scripture (Resources for Changing Lives)"},{"Title":"The Love Languages of God","review":"OK, when I first started reading this book, I enjoyed it. And I thought I would really enjoy where it was going. I actually recommended it to several friends (a recommendation I now regret). That opinion changed rather quickly as the book continued on and on without much to say.The book started off with Chapman briefly explaining why he thinks some of us feel more connected to God in certain ways (ie., study, worship, prayer, ...). He argues that this is a result of each of us having a primary love language. And consequently we relate to God best in our own language. This was, in my opinion, a very promising insight. It goes a long way in explaining why my wife and I have different responses to worship and service. To her, service is a joy, worship is a duty. To me, it's vice versa. I think Chapman was on to something.He then goes on, in the next five chapters, to show how God displays each of the five love languages. These chapters, although not very insightful, do offer decent support for his original theory. Unfortunately, however, the book could have ended right here. Because after this, the next 5 or so chapters seem like one big promotion for Chapman's Five Love Languages book(s) and lecture series.I also felt as though Chapman was searching for something significant to write about in these closing chapters. He seems to have run out of material for his original thesis and now just begins writing about anything that relates to love. Which reminds me, the chapter on discipline was very disappointing. At one point Chapman actually suggests that a man lost his children as a judgement of God. Now, I'm not going to debate God's sovereignty in all things nor suggest that God does not have the right over life and death. But to claim that this man losing his children was judgement from God is a leap of faith I'm not going to take.All in all, the book is poor, but not terrible. If you keep in mind that Chapman is a psychologist and not a theologian, you may find some very helpful information here. But don't expect any grand revelations concerning love or God in this book."},{"Title":"The Love Languages of God","review":"I had heard about the 5 love languages before and I thought I was pretty sure about which mine was. When I saw this book about Gods love languages I was curious, because I have trouble experiencing His love on a daily bases.Through this book I haven't just learned what my love language is (not the one I thought, but the one my heart speaks) it has also explained so much more to me about human relationships and Gods desire to love us, on a daily bases! And how those two work hand in hand. It has taught me how to show my friends and family that I love them in their language and it showed me different ways that God expresses His love to us. Besides that it challenged me to love those I normally would walk away from because I don't know how to relate to them.If you look for a theological, religious or an psychological book you are in the wrong place. But if you are looking for a book that will transform you in your heart and mind into a more loving person, to yourself, God and others, this is the best book for it! Besides the Bible of course :-). We all know how difficult it can be to read and understand the bible sometimes, this book will make it easier for you, because you will learn more about the character of God and how He wants to relate to you in your life with your specific needs.I have read few books like this one that have had a deep impact in my life!I strongly recommend it to anyone who longs for closeness in their relationships with others and with God!!"},{"Title":"The Love Languages of God","review":"I read the original \\"The Five Love Languages\\" and thought that it was really inspiring and something that I could definely apply to my life.If you've already read \\"The Five Love Languages\\", you may feel like you are getting ripped off and that Chapman is just taking a concept that he has already established and applying it to other situations to make a buck. CONTINUE TO READ THE BOOK!I read this book several months ago, and have given it little thought. Then I gave the book to a friend, because I think that it is something that even those who have been Christians for quite some time can take a look at.I think that this book is a must-read for new Christians who may have lost the initial feeling they had about being saved. I've been a Christian since I was 8, but I recently decided to make being a Christian my way of life from here on out. I remember when I rededicated my life to Christ, it was great. Then, I walked out of the church, into the real depraved world.What was really inspiring in this book is that no matter what you've done in life, you can ask God to forgive you, and He will. Though we may know that, sometimes, we need someone else to actually say it.The examples for Scripture are awesome. When I was done with each chapter, I would go through the Bible and see how God, Jesus, the disciples, or God's people used \\"Words of Affirmation\\", \\"Physical Touch\\", \\"Quality Time\\", \\"Gifts\\" and \\"Acts of Service\\" to show their love for God or man.One of the parts that was truly amazing to me was the chapter \\"When Love Seems Distance\\". It discusses why we sometimes feel that God doesn't love us. For one, it can be that we are straying from God.My one complaint with this book is that all of the references to Scripture are as endnotes at the back of the book. In Chapman's other books, the Bible version that is references is in parentheses or the text of the verse is on the page. So, in order to know where in the Bible a verse was coming from, I had to flip to the back of the book."},{"Title":"The Love Languages of God","review":"This book provides insight for relating to others in our lives.

Some readers may have gone in with expectations too high. I do think the book starts off great and then in the last few chapters gets a bit boring. I found myself skimming the last few chapters. I do feel that Chapman is effective in describing how different people express their love for God differently, but that doesn't mean someone loves God more or less because their expression is different from yours. He also was effective in showing that even though God speaks all five love languages fluently, you hear Him most in your primary love language. In my personal life, I find that God responds to my prayers most in my primary language. He also used biblical examples to show how different people worshipped God different (e.g., Martha and Mary) and how God used the five love languages to speak to us through His word. Good read and I think it will make you appreciate the differences in the body of Christ more."},{"Title":"The Love Languages of God","review":"Gary Chapman's \\"The Five Love Languages\\" has made its way into the common language of the 21st-century evangelical church and has made significant inroads into the non-evangelical church and even beyond the Christian community. Though some are thrilled to pick apart his main thesis, I am convinced that the love languages, when rightly understood, offer a framework to give and receive love more selflessly and graciously, and that is a good thing.In his \\"The Love Languages of God,\\" Chapman extrapolates the five love languages beyond human relationships and suggests that the same five means of giving and receiving love operate in our relationship with God. Truthfully, when I previously read \\"The Five Love Languages,\\" I was easily able to imagine how those concepts applied to many relationships beyond my relationship with my wife, which was the vocal point of the book and my original interest in it. But it never occurred to me that my love relationship with God might operate in similar fashion.At the very least, I found Chapman's extension of his original idea to be fascinating, if not exactly airtight. \\"The Love Languages of God\\" is certainly more theologically substantial than \\"The Five Love Languages,\\" and a few points of sloppy or inconsistent theology revealed Chapman's background as a psychologist and counselor, not a theologian or pastor. And it seemed as if he was really reaching a few times to figure out how to translate certain components of human love (i.e. physical touch) into the spiritual realm. But, ultimately, I found the personal exercise of contemplating my spiritual practices in light of the love languages to be interesting, engaging, and somewhat helpful.I appreciate any honest effort, like this one, to clarify that our respective relationships with God can and should look different from one person to another, based on the many created differences within each of our personalities and spiritual inclinations. I would suggest that Gary Thomas' \\"Sacred Pathways\\" covers that ground more thoroughly and carefully than Chapman's effort here. Nonetheless, I'm happy to recommend this book to anyone who has appreciated \\"The Five Love Languages\\" and is interested in considering how we were individually created to love God and be loved by God and how differently that might look among all of us who call ourselves beloved by God."},{"Title":"The Love Languages of God","review":"This book is spectacular.

I enjoyed reading this novel very much. It was very nice light entertainment.Jake Saunders and Howard Waldrop, the authors, have fashioned an extremely entertaining post-holocaust action novel in the rebellious remnants of the United States. It's obvious that both spent a lot of time reading and researching before the novel was written because there a quite a few disparate elements successfully rolled together in this light entertaining novel. Among the elements are: Wild West Texas Rangers cowboy story elements, an interest in the Arab-Israeli wars, an interest in W.W.II military hardware, an interest in Cold War politics, and probably, above all else, a projected post-nuclear Armageddon scenario.The novel was written in 1974 and parts of the novel cobbled together into a novelette previously appeared in Galaxy Magazine in July, 1973. This story was probably written during the height of the 1973 Yom Kippur War and probably the authors drew much inspiration from what appeared in the newspapers, magazine, and other media of the time.The authors built an alternate history in which 1992 a limited nuclear exchange and widespread use of biological and chemical weapons has killed nine out of every ten people in the world. The two coalitions were a Chinese-Irish-Afrikaaner versus a Russo-British coalition that eventually allies with the United States. Europe waffles and is mostly destroyed in the crossfire. The Israelis stood neutral and their sworn Arab enemies attacked Israel, but with little result. Egyptians bombers managed to hit Tel Aviv, but after that brief attack, the Arab world was all but destroyed by Israeli military might. As neutrals, Israel managed to avoid all but the lingering effects of the WMD (weapons of mass destruction) exchange and stands as one of the last prospering enclaves of humanity. In fact, Israel is so prosperous that they have an overpopulation problem. Enter story plot element one, Israel now hires out its excess population as mercenary soldiers to the rest of the world.Meanwhile, in the shattered remnants of the USA, Texas declares independence and a second US civil war develops, with a Second Lone Star Republic arising driven by oil interests and the SA, Sons of the Alamo, a white supremacy Gestapo-like group holding the power behind the throne. Israeli mercenaries have been hired out to both sides of the war and the book's protagonists are a mixed unit of Israeli tankists and reinforcements from the federal government. Their mission is to penetrate the heart of Texas and rescue the kidnapped president of the USA.However, the World War has not only destroyed the world's population, but along with that population went the many technicians who maintained the technology that not only drove high-tech societies, but their military machines as well. Any weapon surviving is thrust onto the field including W.W.II museum pieces, M-4 Shermans, M-3 Grants, and even a Stuart tank. The federal Israelis start out in updated British Chieftain and Centurion tanks, but are quickly moved into vintage armor as they take losses. A little high technology exists such as main gun cannons replaced with laser weaponry, but most of the weapons are conventional arms from the 1970s and before.Several historical personages are written into the story including Israeli generals Yoffe and Sharon. Sharon, in this alternate future, is a general hired out to the Second Lone Star state instead of being a future president of Israel. The cameos were fun to read. The authors seem to be a little prescient as well since they predict a 1982 Arab-Israeli war that did occur.The story very much reminds me of the Steve Jackson Games universe called Car Wars or the movies Mad Max and The Road Warrior. All of the popular apocalyptic background is there including the particular character of Texas that all writers from that state seem to imbue their work with. Among my favorite humorous elements were giant cockroaches the size of small dogs that are now hunted for sport and in one Texas cantina; the protagonists find one mounted over a bar.I highly recommend this fun little sci-fi novel.

When a nuclear war wipes out a good chunk of Earth's population, Israel is relatively untouched and helps America fight its wars in exchange for a place to live. Now a group of Israeli and American soldiers face a tough challenge. Rescue the kidnapped President of the United States from Texas, which has seceded from the Union.It's a quick read with OK character development and decent action. I really liked the laser-armed Israeli Centurion tanks duking it out with a Texas heavy cruiser. Also, a first-rate job by the authors bringing out the harshness, and hopelessness, of a post-apocalypse world, from contaminated farmland to cities no longer maintained. The characters in many instances are torn between their dreams for life after fighting, then wonder if they will live long enough to see them or if they can even make a life in this miserable world. Some really good scenes when the Israelis ad Americans infiltrate the Texan compound. They learn of the conflict between the regular Texan Army and the fanatical faction called the Sons of the Alamo. One great aspect was the Israeli commander's view of one Texan general who comes off as an honorable warrior, leading the Israeli to dislike the idea that he may have to kill him in order to complete his mission."},{"Title":"THE TEXAS-ISRAELI WAR 1999","review":"In the future...in, um, 1999...England will be attacked by Ireland with bombs full of LSD; the UK's leaders will go insane and drop nukes on several countries; other countries will drop nukes on still other countries; the US will get dragged into it; chemical and biological weapons will be launched at nearly every country in the planet; nine tenths of the earth's population will die; Texas will secede from the US; and a new Civil War will be fought between the Union and the Republic of Texas, with the Union using hired Israeli troops for much of the fighting.It's going to be interesting.Especially, since on top of all of that, Texas will kidnap the US President, the Vice President will go crazy with power, and Israeli troops will be forced to go undercover to get the President back--along the way, fighting against Texas and going against the orders of the power-crazed VP.That's the story told here, and it's an interesting one. If it weren't set in a projected future (1999, theorized from 1973 and 1974), if the tanks didn't have lasers in it, and if we hadn't already sent a manned expedition to Mars (which WE SHOULD HAVE DONE ALREADY), the story wouldn't really be sci-fi, more of a military novel, almost like something by Tom Clancy. It's really grounded, though it does have a little fun with giant, mutated roaches.It's a pretty decent, fast-paced read, though it often resorts to telling instead of showing, frequently uses passive voice instead of active, and sometimes lapses into bits of seemingly lazy racism--for instance, referring to one character once as \\"the black.\\"The story is a cool idea though, and anyone familiar with Texas, Lousiana, or New Mexico will find an interesting future proposed here for their states.

And the best thing to do is acknowledge the rule and try not to regret the fumbling beginnings too much. The important thing is what you are doing now. The second rule of writing is \\"Don't give up the day job.\\" It's the day job that allows you to have ethics, that allows you to write for your own muse rather than Paramount's or Byron Preiss'. There comes a time when you forego the day job and try to make it on your wits and it backfires. As you stumble along, trying to reach out forward rather than backwards to the day job, you grab onto the quick buck. Was that the scenario for The Texas-Israeli War: 1999? Probably not, because, for its flaws, The Texas-Israeli War: 1999 is not calculated enough to make that quick buck. But neither is it inspired enough to contain the full muse that Howard Waldrop has followed since that time (and I refuse to blame the co-author for any perceived flaws; Waldrop must share what praise or blame there is equally).The Texas-Israeli War: 1999 is an adventure novel. These days it would probably be published by Baen rather than Del Rey, because of its focus on military equipment and maneuvering. While the story stays within the Baen military style, it contains that inspired spark that I associate with Waldrop. The descriptions of military things reads true because Howard probably read about it in Jane's Fighting something-or-other. The story fails, however, in its portrayal of certain \\"political\\" aspects. The intrigue surrounding the SS-like Sons of the Alamo; the President Pro-Tem, and his motivations, ring tinny.Pick up Howard's Them Bones or A Dozen Tough Jobs, and come back to this one only if you are a completist."},{"Title":"THE TEXAS-ISRAELI WAR 1999","review":"I read this book when I was much younger and I just re-read, again.

No one except her money manager, Paul Blackshear.The rest of this short novel speeds along as Blackshear, at first reluctantly, tries to find out who is threatening Helen and why. Millar paints several impressive character portraits of Helen, her self-absorbed Mother, Blackshear and others. The ending is a shocking, twist that never feels false or forced.How has Margaret Millar has escaped my attention until now? Why isn't she as well-known as Patricia Highsmith?

Born a cripple, he could have been consigned to the rubbish heap but instead and against all odds became a celebrated writer of this Whitbread Book winner, &quot;The Banyan Tree&quot; as well as an early book of poems. Without taking anything away from Joseph Meehan (a self portrait of Nolan), he couldn't have overcome his debilitating handicaps to scale the heights he did without the steady support and tender loving care of his family. A father, mother and sister who are such warm and emotionally intelligent human beings anybody would be blessed and proud to have them as family. The school principals, teachers and fellow students who accepted him, nurtured him and gave him the chance to prove himself equal to the best among physically whole human specimens are themselves shining examples of humanity who deserve as much recognition in Nolan's lifestory. Although it has been compared with James Joyce's &quot;Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man&quot;, it is in reality nothing like it. Whereas Joyce's work is for the most part depressing and full of pain and harshness, Nolan's story is so morally uplifting you almost forget its grave subject matter. Nolan's dazzling and inventive writing style is also unique and something to relish. He coins and mints new words which have a yet found a conventional meaning but are so emotionally accurate you know they're right. Read this if you're feeling down and need something to restore your faith in mankind !"},{"Title":"Waste minimization assessment for a manufacturer of aluminum cans (SuDoc EP 1.96:600/M-91/025)","review":"As a college English and literature instructor, I intend to make this book a required reading if it becomes available in print again.

This was a book that I read and reviewed back in February, and ever since I have been mystified why the book never seemed to gain the wide acceptance of readers. All of the reviews that have been posted by readers for &quot;The Banyan Tree&quot; have been 5 star reviews, and the same is the case for &quot;Under The Eye Of The Clock&quot;.If you read you understand how difficult it is to write anything, much less a full book, and then have it selected for and win a prestigious award. In the case of the book I review now it was the 1987 Whitbred Award that was awarded to Mr. Nolan. All very impressive, but that's just the start.This is an autobiography written by a very young man who next wrote the book &quot;The Banyan Tree&quot; and would take 12 years to do so. This is a painfully candid, but uplifting book about a man with the support of a wonderful Family overcomes extreme realities that are his life to become an Author of international renown.Mr. Nolan cannot speak, he can barely move at all. He types with what he calls his &quot;Unicorn Stick&quot; that he wears on his head, and even then his head must be supported while he works.An Autobiography is a courageous work if honestly presented. When you add Mr. Nolan's additional challenges he faces as a writer, and as a person living with his physical issues it becomes an extraordinary autobiographical book.I hope more readers find Mr. Nolan, he is a unique writer of immense talent, and if you pass by his work you deprive yourself of great literature."},{"Title":"Waste minimization assessment for a manufacturer of aluminum cans (SuDoc EP 1.96:600/M-91/025)","review":"Under the Eye of the Clock is the autobiography of Christopher Nolan, the talented young poet with cerebral palsy. He can't walk or talk or write in the usual manner. Since Nolan lacks the use of his hands, this book like Dam-Burst of Dreams, the book of poems that preceded it, was written by means of a typing stick affixed to his head. The book succeeds both as pure artistry and as a window into the world of the disabled. Nolan has re-named himself Joseph Meehan and told his story entirely in the objectivity of the third person. This brilliant stroke allows him to avoid excessive self-pity while making his sufferings and triumphs real and deep. Nolan's use of language had earned him comparisons with James Joyce, Yeats, and Dylan Thomas. Nolan stretches the meanings and implications of words, rearranges their spelling, and even invents new ones to communicate his moods and perceptions and illuminate life, his own and those he observes, with his unique poet's sensibility."},{"Title":"Waste minimization assessment for a manufacturer of aluminum cans (SuDoc EP 1.96:600/M-91/025)","review":"This is a great book!!!

In a U.S. Army course, the main learning points about General Mitchell were that he campaigned for an independent air force and was court-martialed for insubordination and disrespect. Members of the U.S Air Force speak of Mitchell as the first American prophet in the temple of Air Power. So I figured I'd read it for myself. As it turns out, the two perceptions are not mutually exclusive.If you're interested in early airpower theory, readThe Command of the Air (USAF Warrior Studies)by Guilio Douhet. Douhet provides a coherent and internally sound conceptual structure where Mitchell just sounds like he's lobbying for a Congressional appropriation. In addition to this edition, \\"Winged Defense\\" appears inRoots of Strategy Book: 4 Military Classics : The Influence of Sea Power upon History, 1660-1783, Some Principles of Maritime Strategy, Command of the Air, Winged Defense.By Mitchell's own admission, this book was hastily assembled and published from other articles and notes from his Congressional presentations. And it shows. Sweeping statements and extensive lists of requirements for Mitchell's vision of an air force are great, but where Douhet had meticulously charted out his reasoning, Mitchell's underlying argument seems to be \\"I'm an Airman, you're not, now listen to me because you'll never really understand.\\" Not an argument that carries the day, unless your the boss, and not necessarily then. His use of hyperbole only accentuates this perception, like when he asserts that in 1921, the Army hadn't changed since the Civil War that ended in 1865.The only defense for the poor structure of Mitchell's arguments may be that he was trying to make them accessible to a broader audience, while preserving the spirit of airmen manifest in his prose.As a historical work, this is an important primary source for one of the first experiments (the first U.S. experiment) in the use of air craft to attack a naval vessel. Mitchell carefully records the experiment, the events surrounding it, and some of the political considerations of the time. This is gold for historians of the interwar period.There are constant reminders of his attitudes about aviation that grate on the nerves of non-flyers, like his assertion that majors, captains, and lieutenants in aviation carried greater responsibility that admirals and generals. He sure didn't understand the concept of a Joint military as Douhet seemed to. Mitchell wanted an Air Corps that was supported by the Army and Navy, rather than a triad of power, land, sea and air.Mitchell was also a fighter pilot, and had all the vices of modern fighter pilots.(Q: How do you know if there is a fighter pilot at your party?A: He'll tell you.Q: What's the difference between God and fighter pilots?A: God doesn't think he's a fighter pilot.Etc...) but because of this, envisioned a greater role for fighter aircraft than Douhet, which is an interesting contrast.To his credit, Mitchell understood and articulated a more balanced view of offence and defence than Douhet did, and he understood ground based defences a bit better than Douhet.I have heard officers from the U.S. Air Force's Space Operations community voice the opinion that space needs its Mitchell, someone willing to martyr their career for the goal of an independent Space Force (and when asked if they were volunteering, they change the subject). Be careful what you ask for...\\"Winged Defense\\" was worth reading as history, but not very clear regarding air power theory, and I didn't enjoy it. It is interesting how many of the attitudes of aviators have changed so little over the entire history of their discipline.E. M. Van CourtP.S.

General Billy Mitchell's publications during the dark days of the interwar period between the World Wars. General Mitchell, the strongest advocate for an independent Air Force, frequently wrote on the future capabilities of Air Power. It took nearly sixty years for many of his predictions to come true.The book is a reproduction of many of those original papers. The typeset used for the book will look unusual to many readers, as the articles are published close to how they first appeared. In any case, the quaint print only serves to reinforce the truly prophetic words of a true visionary.This books needs to be on the reading list for every student of Air Power.

However the twists themselves were anti-climactic (i read the whole book for that? come on), the attempted metaphors of New York as a fairyland and the connections to movies were lost on me, and the characters did not attract. I think I'll leave my Deaver collection to rest for awhile, 2.5 stars."},{"Title":"Manhattan Is My Beat (Rune Trilogy)","review":"This is one of the author's earlier works, and while it is not one of his best efforts, it is still a cut above what is currently proffered by other writers of this genre. Jeffrey Deaver writes with a decidedly contemporary feel, his prose always spare and lean. While he does not dwell unduly on character development, it does not deter from the book, as it is wholly plot driven, with enough twists and turns to keep the reader guessing until the last minute. It makes for a quick, enjoyable read.The book revolves around a decades old bank robbery in which the million dollars heisted was never recovered. This robbery was memorialized in an old bete noire film entitled \\"Manhattan is My Beat\\". Enter the story's unlikely heroine, twenty year old Rune of the purple hair, who works in a video store, squats in an abandoned loft that she calls home, and has an imagination that doesn't quit.When one of her video customers is killed execution style in his apartment, Rune is drawn into events of the past, as they converge upon the present. The now dead customer had repeatedly rented the film, \\"Manhattan is My Beat\\", and Rune firmly believes that there is a connection between his death and the age old bank heist. Her do-or-die resolve to discover why her customer was killed leads the moxie endowed Rune on a merry and dangerous chase. It is one that keeps the reader fully engaged and entertained."},{"Title":"Manhattan Is My Beat (Rune Trilogy)","review":"While this book may lack a thing or two in style and literary creativity, it still creates an admirable montage of events, centered around Rune, it's central character. Good to lose yourself in....Bad to look to for literary merit. Jeffery Deaver is not Ralph Ellison, quite obviously, but the storyline is great, with lots of surprises. Maybe I've been submerged in &quot;Invisible Man&quot; and &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; and &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; for too long, but, as my English teacher would say, this book qualifies as a &quot;smut&quot; book........but, a good smut book nonetheless."},{"Title":"Manhattan Is My Beat (Rune Trilogy)","review":"I quite enjoyed this book. Although it wasn't as good as his Lincoln Rhyme series, it was still a little page-turner. Deaver has done very well, as the heroine of the story is one of the most unusual in any genres -- a homeless, semi-dysfunctional romantic who works in a video store and survives by squatting in an empty apartment. Her flights of fancy with fairy tales wear a bit thin in places but there is enough fun, suspense and action in the tale to make up for it.As always, the story twists and turns and no-one is who they seem. The ending feels slightly pat but probably explained by this being one of his early works. This book is great if you want to get inside his mind and compare how it has matured and changed since.Definitely worth a read -- and if you haven't already, go and read the Lincoln Rhyme series. It's up there with Michael Connelly in my opinion."},{"Title":"Manhattan Is My Beat (Rune Trilogy)","review":"Manhattan Is My Beat is a quick mystery read with only a few classic Deaver twists. Realizing he wrote this back in 1988, Deaver had not yet evolved to such vicious violence as in The Coffin Dancer or The Devils Teardrop.It's a quirky little story with a quirky little female, Rune, in her 20's, purplish hair, a desire for love and fantasy. She begins her biggest adventure when a friendly old man who has rented the same movie from the store she works in, 18 times in a month, is found dead, by Rune. Was it all part of the movie? Was it an accident? Does 1 million dollars really exist from a bank robbery over 50 years ago? And who are these people shooting at her now? I liked the ending, although a bit trite--it left me smiling.A fun piece of mystery fluff."},{"Title":"Manhattan Is My Beat (Rune Trilogy)","review":"Being a more recent Jeffery Deaver fan I was very excited to see that his first five novels where going to be republished. While \\"Manhattan is My Beat\\" is entertaining and has the usual surprises that Deaver throws in, I noticed a small lack of polish and some very corny parts.The story is about occupational drifter Rune (just Rune) who while working at a video store befriends an older customer named Mr. Kelly. While making a pickup for Mr. Kelly, Rune finds her friend murdered. She doesn't like the way the police are handling the homicide, so Rune takes matters into her own hands. Her first clue is Mr. Kelly's favorite movie which he rented every time he came into the video store. The movie is about an actual bank heist where the money was hidden and never recovered. Rune believes that Mr. Kelly had found the money through the movie, and that was why he was killed. So Rune starts her quest.The Rune character is likeable, but a little odd in many ways. She is not your typical Deaver character. In total the story moves along, and any reader should enjoy the plot shifts and twists at the end. For the Deaver fan this is not \\"The Bone Collector\\" or \\"Devil's Teardrop\\" but a nice look at what Deaver was like when he started out as a novelist."},{"Title":"Manhattan Is My Beat (Rune Trilogy)","review":"This early Deaver novel was a pleasant surprise. It is completely free of the foresic and scientific detail of the Lincoln Rhyme books, but is a page-turner in its own right. Deaver's charming protagonist, Rune, is a young woman who is constantly reinventing herself. If Lincoln Rhyme is driven my science and encyclopedic knowledge, Rune is just as driven by instinct and a pure, though unusual, moral code. Full of twists and turns and a series of suprises, it's a fun read."},{"Title":"Manhattan Is My Beat (Rune Trilogy)","review":"I just finished reading this book and I thought it was a very fast read. I didn't take me too long to finish this and I liked the characters. The characters were interesting and different. I liked the plot and how it was woven. I have read many Jeffery Deaver books, and this isn't the best one but its right up there. Its one you can take the time to read and enjoy, its not that long, but it starts out fast and continues till the end."},{"Title":"Manhattan Is My Beat (Rune Trilogy)","review":"This early work of Jeffery Deaver certainly lacks the depth of his current works. (Shallow Graves) Manhattan is My Beat references an old movie that has as it's theme the theft of one million dollars. Deaver's heroine, Rune, is a very light not well described character. She developes a careing relationship with an old man who has a passion for watching an old movie titled &quot;Manhattan is My Beat.&quot; Their friendship takes Rune on a twisted search for a missing million dollars. During her search she must deal with paid killers and the United States Marshall Service. Figuring out who is who is the meat of the book. While the book will keep you thinking until the end, it is not filled with depth of plot, character development or sense of the city that we would expect from Deaver. Not long and easy to read. This is a very light book, with a much expected ending. Most of the characters seem to be very nice people. Would like to have known more about them. A nice two day read, but nothing more."},{"Title":"Manhattan Is My Beat (Rune Trilogy)","review":"Sometimes when an out-of-print book by one of my favorite authors is rereleased, I am not always convinced that the publisher hasn't just tacked on a best-selling name to an old book by someone else. Usually, I am disappointed. But I am positive that this was written by Jeffery Deaver. Rune is a video store employer who becomes attached to an older man who keeps renting &quot;Manhatten Is My Beat.&quot; When he is found dead, Rune is so upset that she decides to investigate. The police seem so apathetic about the crime. As she watches the video, she is convinced that an old bank robbery is the key. I liked her free-spirit, her way of life (living in a building under reconstruction - undetected), and how Deaver cleverly led you to believe certain things were happening, when they actually were otherwise. Surprises abound as you read this book. I anxiously await the other older Deaver novels that will soon be in print. I'm getting ready to begin &quot;Mistress of Justice,&quot; another oldie, but I'm sure a goodie. And, yes, I feel that this was novice Deaver and not a knockoff."},{"Title":"Manhattan Is My Beat (Rune Trilogy)","review":"This work by JD is really fast-paced and intricate at the same time! a page-turner if you ever saw one! if you're a native of NYC as I am, you'll like the way he describes the Village and Downtown Manhattan! really accurate; the story is fast-paced; Rune is kind of ditzy but determined to get what she wants regardless of the consequences. If you want to pass sometime and have some fun-reading, this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"Manhattan Is My Beat (Rune Trilogy)","review":"This very fast paced plot is easy to read and introduces a very attractive and quirky character, Rune, a very pleasant twenty year old girl full of dreams, instinct, passion and poetic creativity who works at a video store and starts by chance his own investigation about the murder of a customer whom she was very fond of Mr. KellyThis tale is very original, consistent, well conceived, sweet and funny, has its own magic, keeps you guessing and wondering, delivers a lot of surprises and does not let you go until the very last page but having read many of the Deaver books and being the trickery his trademark, I was a little bit disappointed at how he employed some of his magic twists to solve some intricate situations because sometimes they came out all of a sudden and out of any logic (the same way Batman was set free of the bad guys traps in every chapter back in the 60's, or like Mr. Connelly did in The Poet near the ending), no cunning prior preparation, just the easy way (what a pity! no subtlety)Rune is a character that deserves a participation in other books like the legendary Lincoln Rhyme does. How about to put them together ??"},{"Title":"Manhattan Is My Beat (Rune Trilogy)","review":"I bought this book purely on the strength of its being written by Jeffrey Deaver. However, less than 3 pages into this terrible novel it becomes very hard to believe that it was written by the same man who brought us The Bone Collector and the Coffin Dancer. The fact that it was written in 1988, before Deaver was established, may explain some of its mediocrity but there is no excuse for the fact that this is simply a terrible book.The basic plot is that Rune, a supremely annoying \\"punk\\" discovers a favourite customer of hers shot to death when she goes to his apartment to collect a video he has rented 18 times in one month. The film is a \\"true\\" story about a Manhattan bank robbery in which a police officer steals a million dollars which he hides away and which has never been found. In the biggest jump to a conclusion I have ever come across, Rune decides that the the depiction of what was done with the money in the film is real and that Mr Kelly found it, and makes up her mind to find it herself.The plot of the book probably could have been fairly good, but Deaver ruins the entire story with Rune, the most unrealistic and annoying \\"heroine\\" I have ever read. She lives in a fantasy world that a 5 year old child would be too mature for, and has no concept of the real world whatsoever. Everything about her, from her appearance to her manner of speaking to her ridiculous inability to lie makes the reader want to punch the book as it's the nearest thing possible to punching her in the face.Another major problem with this novel is its glaring predictability. There are no twists and turns in it and if Deaver thought anything in it was going to shock the reader, then he must have been as naive as Rune herself. This book is chock-full of cliches that were probably old even in 1988.This book has nothing to offer the discerning reader and it probably better left to those who see reading as hard work and only do it to reassure themselves that they can once in a while. Complete and utter rubbish."},{"Title":"Manhattan Is My Beat (Rune Trilogy)","review":"This early book by Jeffrey Deaver shows why his books are so popular today. He captures the flavor of Manhattan in the late 80s--particularly the downtown scene. Rune, the main character, is a wonderful portrayal of a twenty year old child/woman on a quest to find the killer of her friend, the elderly Mr. Kelly. This book is well paced and shows that Deaver was already a master in 1988. An excellent read."},{"Title":"Manhattan Is My Beat (Rune Trilogy)","review":"I've often heard people say they just can't put a book down, but once I started this, hey...I couldn't put it down. The character of Rune just drew me in and I couldn't wait to see what would happen to her next. And there were enough twists and turns to keep my guessing. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Manhattan Is My Beat (Rune Trilogy)","review":"Manhattan is my beat is one of the early novels by Jeffery Deaver, and at times you can see the reflection of the brillance that you find in his latest novels. However at times the book is a wee bit slow for my taste and in particular for a Deaver novel.Rune, the heroine in this novel is actually a great character and you will find her to be quite enjoyable. The main premise of a crime solved via an old movie is interesting and could have been better developed, but I feel Deaver just did an adequate job.I do recommend that you read this novel because it is an enjoyable read and it contains the trademark Deaver twists, but you shuld be forewarned that this book will not enthrall you like Bone Collector, Coffin Dancer, Empty Chair, Maiden's Grave, or Devil's Teardrop. It is good but not great."},{"Title":"Manhattan Is My Beat (Rune Trilogy)","review":"Having read the Lincoln Rhyme novels, I was anxious to get my hands on anything Deaver. While some of his other work was 5 star material, MANHATTAN IS MY BEAT left me a little dissapointed.Rune is a homeless girl squatting in a skyscraper and working in a vido store. She loves old movies and fairy tales. When picking up a tape, she finds a favorite customer dead. She believes that his killer and the location of a long lost million dollars is hidden in the film he rented so often. Her prying exposes her to a world of danger and she manages to bring her few friends into the mix with her.As with any Deaver tale, there are twists and turns, and plot flips. The ending leaves you with literary whiplash. The main character Rune's obsession with fairy tales leads to forced analogies and the book can drag as a result. The ending is too tidy as to be somewhat unbelievable. I do wish that Deaver would have devoted more of the narrative to the villain(s) as he does with some of his more interesting works.Overall, it is a quick read with a good amount of suspense and intrigue, but it falls short of Deaver's better novels."},{"Title":"Manhattan Is My Beat (Rune Trilogy)","review":"I've been hooked on Deaver since I read THE BONE COLLECTOR. I was pleasantly surprised by MANHATTAN... I found it to be an excellent example of some of the basics that make Deaver novels so much fun. He has created one of the most enjoyable lead characters here in Rune, a somewhat kooky, plucky 20-year-old with a vivid imagination and romantic ideals. She meets up with even more interesting characters in Mr. Kelly, Tony (her boss), Stephanie, Raoul Elliott, Sandra, Haart, Zane, Richard, etc. This is a classic in-the-wrong-place-at-the-wrong-time story as Rune accidentally interrupts the murderer of her friend, Mr. Kelly. Throw in some assumptions about the killing, some crime-solving techniques Rune has learned from movies, cops, bad guys and lusty roommates, and you have a formula for a light, fun mystery. And with most Deaver novels, you never really know who anyone actually is until the end.I truly enjoyed reading this novel. As an earlier Deaver work, it's not as polished as some we've seen more recently. However, I liked that this one seems to be all about the joy of writing a good story rather than the chore of writing for the masses. I recommend this one; it's quick and it's fun. I, for one, vote for a series starring the very loveable Rune."},{"Title":"Manhattan Is My Beat (Rune Trilogy)","review":"Manhattan Is My Beat is a great thriller by the master of suspense, Jeffery Deaver. I didn't like it as much as his latest one's like The Empty Chair and The Bone Collector. It seems like the each book gets better with him. There was a great conclusion to this book.

We meet Rune, she is as lively as a cocked pistol. She does work in a video store to support one of her passions; movies. She does find the dead body of Mr. Kelly, an elderly man who keeps renting the same movie--over &amp; over. And she does hit the Manhattan mean streets to connect all the pieces of this diabolical puzzle plot.I thouroughly enjoyed this crime novel. Rune, as a female sleuth is perky, weird, sassy and bright. Not as graphic or gripping as other Deaver classics, yet a good one.other reading suggestions: &quot;Hot Six&quot; by Janet Evanovich and &quot;The Devils Teardrop&quot; by Jeffrey DeaverThanks for your interest &amp; comments--CDS"},{"Title":"Manhattan Is My Beat (Rune Trilogy)","review":"We see the roots of Deaver's work in this early effort from him featuring Rune (later to be seen in \\"Death of a Blue Movie Star\\" and \\"Hard News\\"). While not perfect - I personally didn't see the point to the whole Richard sub-plot - it's overall a satisfying mystery with enough twists to keep you guessing until the end - all three of them.Rune is a young woman who has come to New York from Ohio and is squatting in a gazebo while the building is being renovated around her. She works for a video store and one day while out to pick up a video from a customer, she discovers the customer has just been murdered. She had been friends with the customer - Robert Kelly - and they had shared a love of movies; she decides that the murder has something to do with Mr. Kelly's favorite movie - \\"Manhattan is My Beat,\\" which was based upon a true story about a bank robbery. She decides that Mr. Kelly had found the money from the robbery (which had never been recovered) and therefore had been killed for it. So she sets out to solve his murder herself, and to find the money.There isn't much else of the plot that can be outlined without spoiling the plot for those who haven't yet read it. Suffice it to say that those who are fans of Deaver, those who enjoy mysteries and thrillers - they should enjoy this book. Just keep in mind it is an early effort and Deaver hadn't quite shaken all the knots out of his style yet. That said, I enjoyed it a great deal. Recommend from me!"},{"Title":"Manhattan Is My Beat (Rune Trilogy)","review":"This plot is rather simple, but kept my interest.Deaver has produced better works.The greatest thing (to me) in the story line was the beautiful city setting,which sets the scence for crime and mystery.I found the main character (Rune) to be most annoying and unsuitable as a mystery solver. I thought Rune was a bit unrealistic as a character.Apart from that,it is not a bad read."},{"Title":"Manhattan Is My Beat (Rune Trilogy)","review":"this being an early Deaver, it is natural to suspect taht it wouldnt be as good as some of his later ones. In general, its right. THis is not as good as some later books, but its still pretty good.The plot is nicely simple. Not too much complicated stuff to get your head round. The characters are good, and he leaves space for them to be further dweveloped. Presumably, this will come in the next two books (as it would in any good series).Rune is a nice lead character, nicely contemporary. Some people've said she's annoying, but personally, i didn't think so. On the surface she comes across as naive, but gradually you see that she isnt as so as you first thought. she might have got her head in the clouds, but her feet are still firmly on the ground...as always with a deaver novel, there are twists a-plenty. and ill admit, here they werent quite as complex as some of his later novels twists, but they are just as viable. and still i didnt guess them. (I gave up trying long ago!)The writing is good, the plot is good, the characters are good. What more could you want?As, presumably, this was his first novel, it's a very worthy effort. I look forward to the next Rune novels."},{"Title":"Manhattan Is My Beat (Rune Trilogy)","review":"Again, I loved it and the main character Rune became my heroine.

I have read all three books and feel that she is generally unsuitable as a lead character. All of Deaver's other 'heroes' are so clever and likeable, but Rune is just a careless person who reminds me of an annoying child who has no real skill as an investigator. All of the other characters in the book are really what keeps you going."},{"Title":"Manhattan Is My Beat (Rune Trilogy)","review":"Rune, an eccentric young woman from the Midwest, feels at home in Manhattan, which she thinks of as the Magic Kingdom. Although she's not a particularly conscientious employee, she enjoys her job at a video rental shop. One day, when she goes out to pick up a video from one of her favorite customers, an old man with whom she enjoys a friendly rapport, she finds herself in the middle of a crime scene. The customer is dead, and Rune takes it upon herself to find out who did it. She thinks the clue to his murder may lie in the old man's favorite movie, \\"Manhattan Is My Beat,\\" which was based on the true story of a bank heist that resulted in the disappearance of a million dollars. Rune suspects her friend was searching for the missing money, and she embarks on a quest to find the money herself as well as solve the murder.So far as I can tell, \\"Manhattan Is My Beat\\" was Jeffery Deaver's first published novel. Clearly he had a long way to go to polish his literary powers. Rune is an appealing character, but far less so than Deaver expects us to think she is; he takes her so seriously, she becomes rather annoying in a way that really isn't her fault at all. Too naive to be considered worldly, too street-smart to come across as believably naive, Rune simply doesn't feel \\"real.\\" The plot is pretty silly - I never quite figured out how Rune jumped to the conclusion that a professional hit squad had decided to target an old man because he was going on some bizarre treasure hunt based on a 40-year-old movie. The plot twists feel rather cheap and contrived, and there are few moments of genuine suspense. After all, if Rune has so little regard for her own safety as to take on a squad of professional killers simply for excitement (and to see justice done for a man she barely knew), why should we care either?However, Deaver's fans will be able to see a hint in this early work of the writer he was to become. His trademark double-crosses and plot twists are on display here; they're less exciting, unexpected, and satisfying than those in his more mature work, but it's clear that his talent for cooking up an unrelentingly suspenseful plot had only to be honed and refined.\\"Manhattan Is My Beat\\" is an enjoyable read, but nothing extraordinary. It should be most appealing to Deaver's devout fans, for the insight it offers into how his work has evolved over the course of his career."},{"Title":"Manhattan Is My Beat (Rune Trilogy)","review":"Manhattan is My Beat is the first book in Jeffrey Deaver's Rune series. The main character, Rune, is twenty and petite. She lives in a loft with a glass gazebo and her current employment is in a video store; she loves movies. Rune's elderly friend is murdered and she becomes convinced he has found the million-dollar proceeds of a bank robbery in the 1930s. Determined to pursue this, she tangles with the NYPD, copywriters, actresses, hit men for the Mafia, illegal immigrants, screenwriters with Alzheimer's and the US Marshals. Plenty of plot twists and quite a few laughs along the way. Rune seems to be a cross between Kinsey Milhone and Stephanie Plum. Refreshing!"},{"Title":"Manhattan Is My Beat (Rune Trilogy)","review":"I'd love to rate this book higher than three stars, but it has some glaring flaws. But where it shines, as many have said before me, is with its main character. Rune is fun, quirky, and yet not to far-fetched (as you might think in the beginning) to not have vulnerability and a real sweetness. The downside is that she is not fully developed enough to really hold her own, which is painfully obvious by the end of the story. She's unreliable as a narrator, and because of this, you learn you can't trust anyone, not even Rune. Even more disappointing is that the author pulls the ending out of nowhere. Part of the deal between mystery writer and reader is that they'll give you just enough that you might figure out the ending, if you pay close attention. You don't see it coming, and the climax is so absurd, it's painful.All that being said, it's worth reading just to remember what it's like to read a character other than the blank page heroines and copycat sleuths with hangovers, miseries, and sad stories. Rune is a breath of fresh air, and proves formulaic doesn't have to be all wrapped in formula. Deaver has a winning character."},{"Title":"Manhattan Is My Beat (Rune Trilogy)","review":"Was not the caliber of Deaver that Ive come to expect, but was still a good read."},{"Title":"Manhattan Is My Beat (Rune Trilogy)","review":"Someone or something I read recommended this book to me over 10 years ago. I just now got around to reading it. I can't imagine why I thought it would be good. I reread the review here to see if it would jog my memory, but no luck. I can't recommend this book. The plot is very twisty, that's true. Other than that, the characters seem as multi-dimensional as comic book heroes and villains and the dialog is ridiculous. Yes, the book is set in downtown NYC in the late 80's, but I was a frequent visitor at that time and had friends there. No one acted or talked like the people in this book. It's more like the view of someone who was a middle-aged suburbanite at the time and read an article in the Times about the East Village scene - and did no further research.

While it is true of most of his works, the Rune books, starting with Manhattan is my beat lacks the ticking time bomb, but instead immerses the reader into the world seen through the vivid imagination of a young woman who sees things through fairy-tale glasses.Rune is an almost perfect portrait of an ENFP, who vividly lives in a world half real and half of possibilities, which would both attract me to her... though she'd drive me crazy at the same time. In this book, her quest is one half of justice for a kindly old man who kept renting the same videotape over and over again, and half on a quest for a mythical treasure of great worth. However, when the worlds of her fantasy and the worlds of reality crash, the result is a strange mixture of the two world that only a person like Rune could survive."},{"Title":"Manhattan Is My Beat (Rune Trilogy)","review":"I was fortunate to find a reprint of the 1988 &quot;Manhattan is My Beat&quot; by Jeffery Deaver. I looked at the print page closely to make sure they weren't tricking me by reprinting and retitling, as some authors do (James Patterson, shame on you). This is just a terrific little book which is well constructed and contains a myriad of emotions. I felt I knew the characters quite well and could even visualize most of them; Deaver is so good at this. Our heroine is very waif-like, very quirky, much like the Holly Golightly she admired in &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany's.&quot; She has a wonderful imagination which leads her to fantasize about the lives of everyone she meets in her current job in a video rental store. Her open and friendly nature leads her into a mystery which turns deadly . It is sad when she briefly puts aside her ability to see all things in a beautiful, magical way. I can't imagine anyone not liking this fine tale."},{"Title":"Manhattan Is My Beat (Rune Trilogy)","review":"The main character in this book was a breath of fresh air. Rune's youth and optimism, in spite of the roadblocks that are placed in front of her, keep her moving towards the solution to her mystery.

You will also want to read Death of a Blue Movie Star, as you watch Rune develop her investigative skills."},{"Title":"Manhattan Is My Beat (Rune Trilogy)","review":"The great thing about this book, an early entry from twistmaster Deaver, is its heroine. Rune is not the usual highly educated, all knowing experts that Deaver has made his name with, but instead a punkish, homeless girl who lives in her own fantasy version of Manhattan.She is the last person who should investigate a murder, but that is exactly what she does when an old man she has befriended is brutally murdered in what appears to be a professional hit. Armed with only her spunk and knowledge gleamed from her favourite Nior films, Rune sets out to bring the killers to justice, only to learn that in the real world, there are no ture happy endings.Highly entertaining tale is probably a little too whimsical for many hard-core thriller readers (fans of Deaver's clinical, cynical heroes will be shocked,) but the novel has atmosphere to burn, and the mystery keeps you hooked to the last page.An offbeat treat."},{"Title":"Manhattan Is My Beat (Rune Trilogy)","review":"This is one of the author's earlier works, and while it is not one of his best efforts, it is still a cut above what is currently proffered by other writers of this genre. Jeffrey Deaver writes with a decidedly contemporary feel, his prose always spare and lean. While he does not dwell unduly on character development, it does not deter from the book, as it is wholly plot driven, with enough twists and turns to keep the reader guessing until the last minute. It makes for a quick, enjoyable read.The book revolves around a decades old bank robbery in which the million dollars heisted was never recovered. This robbery was memorialized in an old bete noire film entitled \\"Manhattan is My Beat\\". Enter the story's unlikely heroine, twenty year old Rune of the purple hair, who works in a video store, squats in an abandoned loft that she calls home, and has an imagination that doesn't quit.When one of her video customers is killed execution style in his apartment, Rune is drawn into events of the past, as they converge upon the present. The now dead customer had repeatedly rented the film, \\"Manhattan is My Beat\\", and Rune firmly believes that there is a connection between his death and the age old bank heist.

She is at times a space cadet, a goody-two shoes, and a person who thoughtlessly faces danger.Runes life is a kind of perils of Pauline, she works in a video story, she squats in a building being renovated and she fabricates stories about the life she leads. All of this results in both cops and bad guys chasing her. Rune with her blinders cannot differentiate the good guys from bad.I debated over three or four stars, but decided to be kind.

Along the way we meet some colorful characters with witty dialogue. The plot involves a couple of Mafiaoso hits, one that goes wrong and a million dollars that may or may not be real as a treasure. Deaver throws in some twists at the end that are great. It's not like his last 7 books or so...more straight forward and slim.

This plot is hard to follow at times and sometimes I don't think the author is aware of what he wants the characters to do. I have read his later books and know he can write a good thriller. Too bad this book falls flat, I believe his publisher re-released to capitalize on his famous status. I will read more of the scout series and might try the next one in this series just because Rune is such a likable character."},{"Title":"Manhattan Is My Beat (Rune Trilogy)","review":"I have to give 5 stars to any book that keeps me up reading past 1 a.m. (I'm not a late night person). This novel is very different from the Lincoln Rhymes series, but is entertaining in its own way.The protagonist is a 20-year-old free spirit in Greenwich Village, currently working in a video store. She becomes a &quot;detective&quot; after she finds a customer shot to death when she arrives at his house to pick up a video, and then decides that the police is not working properly on the case. Her character shows both naivete and incredible spunk. The case she stumbles into involves a series of Mafia hits, and places her in considerable danger.The plot is full of twists and turns; the ending ties together all loose ends. This is a fun read."},{"Title":"Manhattan Is My Beat (Rune Trilogy)","review":"Although not as highly publicized as his Lincoln Rhyme series, Jeffrey Deaver still delivers a suspense filled, highly entertaining book with MANHATTAN IS MY BEAT.A whole review could be dedicated to Rune, the main character in this epic. She's punk, she lives in an abandoned apartment on a rooftop, and she doesn't care what anyone thinks of her. The reader is enraptured by her antics and I wished I could have such a carefree attitude, or at least know someone like her. The term colorful doesn't do her justice!Rune works for Washington Square Video owned by an overbearing jerk. When customer Robert Kelly has a late movie that needs to be picked up, Rune is given the assignment. This simple task is muddied when Rune discovers Kelly's body, an obvious case of murder. As she exits his apartment, she and a jogger see a green car speed away that she guesses is the murderer. The police don't move fast enough, so Rune decides to investigate on her own. She's sure Robert Kelly's murder is somehow tied to the movie he constantly rented, \\"Manhattan is My Beat\\". As she plugs along looking for clues, the hit men are intent upon eliminating Rune and the jogger who witnessed the car.Thrown into Rune's world is Richard, her boyfriend who is anything but what the reader expects. Rune is unpretentious to Richard's rigidity. It was almost as if Deaver had to put Rune in a relationship with a businessman so she wasn't so bizarre she would offend some readers. I would much rather have enjoyed Rune on her own and not have her fenced in by Richard. But then again, Richard only has a minor role, so he could easily be overlooked.Some of the scenes are very predictable but Deaver always has a few that catch the reader by surprise. This mix, along with Rune's antics, make for a story that will have you not only trying to catch the killers with Rune, but also wanting to befriend her and just hang out. I laughed so hard at times that I had to stop reading and wipe the tears out of my eyes. Seldom does a character touch the reader like Rune, and when that happens, it's definitely a fun read.MANHATTAN IS MY BEAT is a fast paced book that will capture you from the beginning. Not as mentally challenging as figuring out the villains in the Lincoln Rhyme series, it will leave you smiling and is a few hours well spent."},{"Title":"NIV Recovery Devotional Bible","review":"This Bible is my favorite bible for several reasons. First of all, it is aimed at people who have used/are using the 12 Steps. While I am not a 12 Step-er, I did come from a highly dysfunctional family. This Bible offers a lot of insight for those of us who have had dysfunctional families, histories of abuse, low self-esteem, and addictions/compulsions. The explanations are wonderful. There are also enlightening daily devotionals to read that guide you through the Bible in one year. If you've ever been scared to read a Bible because you don't think you'll understand it, or you don't think it relates to your current life, then this is the Bible to try."},{"Title":"NIV Recovery Devotional Bible","review":"We have found this to be a an awesome teaching tool and are pleased to recommend this version of the Bible to those we meet in Christ Centered 12-Step Recovery. Our Group really enjoys the way it is put together. Especially the way the little blue boxes, out to the side of scriptures, connect the steps up. Which is exactly what we purpose to do. Connecting the scriptures up with the steps and the steps up with the scriptures. To encourage those in recovery to come up higher in their relationship with God and The Lord Jesus Christ, by His Holy Spirit. With this is the powerful life connections which are well written and usually right on time. And also the daily devotions, that are also deeply written and felt. One other thing our group has particularly enjoyed is the history of 12-step recovery being layed out with the information of how the steps came right out of the Bible, in the Original Oxford Group. We have been given an awesome revelation as to what the conflict generally seems to be. Since we know people in recovery who do not want to hear anything about Jesus. And we also know people in Christ, who do not want to hear anything about recovery. We began to see, that if a person has really worked the steps of recovery, 1)I Can't! 2)He Can! &amp; 3)I Know I'll Let Him!, then they have and are experiencing God's love and healing, whether they give God the Praise, Glory, and Honor or not, &quot;it is still His and His alone!&quot; And if someone is in Christ Jesus, they have worked the steps, whether they call them steps or not. By simply admitting they are powerless over sin and have need of a Saviour. That they come to believe Jesus can save them. And that they make a decision to turn their lives and their will over to the care of God, as they soon find out, they can not understand, because He is so AWESOME! So this is an extremely healthy approach to 12-step recovery, that encourages others to take charge and with Christ's strength, make a stand and use the steps as an avenue to gain the closure on issues that have driven them to use and abuse drugs and alcohol, sometimes all their lives. This Recovery Bible is an awesome tool and we truly do give God the Praise, Glory, and Honor for it's availability to carry the message of hope for the hopeless and that recovery is possible, in JESUS' Name!"},{"Title":"NIV Recovery Devotional Bible","review":"This has been an extremely valuable tool in my recovery process.

Oldtimers considered the Book of James, Jesus' Sermon on the Mount, and 1 Corinthians 13 to be absolutely essential to the program. And both cofounders Dr. Bob and Bill W. stated that Jesus' Sermon on the Mount contained the underlying spiritual philosophy of A.A. Moreover early AAs used daily Bible devotionals to assist them in their studies. These included The Upper Room, The Runner's Bible, My Utmost for His Highest, Abundant Living, and Daily Strength for Daily Needs. For background on this Bible importance, seeThe Good Book and the Big Book: A.A.'s Roots in the Bible (Bridge Builders Edition);The James Club and the Original A.A. Program's Absolute Essentials;Good Morning!: Quiet Time, Morning Watch, Meditation, and Early A.A.;New Light on Alcoholism: God, Sam Shoemaker, and A.A. (2d ed.). In the past twenty years, at least four so-called \\"recovery Bibles\\" have gained popularity as tools for those who want to employ the Bible in recovery fellowships--this particular Bible, Life Recovery Bible, Serenity, and Celebrate Recovery Bible.I own them all and endorse them all, particularly this volume. The standard I apply is whether the editors have adequately reported early A.A. history, recognized that the basic ideas of A.A. came from the Bible, not the Oxford Group, and underlined the importance of James, the Sermon, and 1 Cor 13. I commend this particular recovery Bible and its editor for meeting most of the standards.

As a medieval Tibetan work, it has the usual introductory material--lots of numbered lists & definitions, obsessive-legends as scare tactics, dogma & mythology (e.g. multiple hells in great detail=fire & brimstone=negative motivation, & sensate (detailed). It does cover the basics pretty completely with tons of stories. My favorite is Tilopa's fish-eating one (p. 105) which reminds me of the Kabbalistic practice of raising the sparks of animals to a higher plane of existence-by eating them with the proper intention (kavannah). But the typesetting is poor in my copy, the translators chose to use unusual spellings (e.g. Mil-la-re-ba vs. Milarepa), p. 187: the author only addresses sudden & gradual approaches (ignores the evanescent), & the text is mostly religious vs. psychological or philosophical. On the other hand, the author provides some interesting comments & observations such as p. 221: that the Vinaya is Hinayana, p. 166: Ma-ji-lap-dr?n (Machig Labdr?n) developed a female version of Ch?d-the only teaching spread from Tibet to India, p. 29: the unfortunate realms can be here & now, p. 34: \\"Pride causes contempt of the lower, jealousy of the higher, & competitiveness with the equal,\\" & my favorite in the book--pp. 103-4: \\"You should rely on your teacher the way a bee receives honey from a flower, taking the best that there is, taking just what it needs & then returning to its home. The bee does not become involved with other aspects of the flower. You should learn to take from the lama those qualities which he or she has as if they were being poured from one vessel into another. Once you have received these good qualities of mind, return to your own place. We have a saying that when it comes to incense or a lama, one should keep one's distance. Incense smells very pleasant from a little way off, but if you get too close, the smoke will enter your nose & make your eyes water. If you stay with your lama day in & day out, you will inevitably begin to find fault with him & by so doing become incapable of receiving his blessings and help.\\" Very pragmatic.

His unique perspective, having grown up on a reservation and having had the opportunity to actually know many of the subjects of his writings add a depth and color to his works that I can only describe as totally enjoyable.I consider this book, like the other two I have read, as real historical treasures.If you have any interest at all in the 'American Indian' or think you might like to learn more about this subject, DEFINITELY read Eastman's books. He was born in the second half of the nineteenth century and died, I believe, about 1939.

A british couple shared this new edition with us and we could not wait to purchase one ourselves.This edition is up-to-date and provides excellent information about clockwise and the more traditional counterclockwise routes. Each leg is accurately described with a detailed map and elevation chart. Refuges are listed, giving the hiker information about number of available beds and phone numbers to call ahead for reservations."},{"Title":"Tour of Mont Blanc (A Cicerone Guide)","review":"Although you can comfortably carry this book in a larger pocket, it contains almost every information you need while doing the Tour de Mont Blanc. This comprehensive guidebook describes the tour in the both clockwise and anti-clockwise directions. The suggested itineraries would suit most hikers. Since the book focuses on the Tour of Mont Blanc itself, it includes only few side trips. If you have time for more side trips, you should complement this book with either a local guidebook in French or a good topographic map.Maps in the book are simple, but useful. I have found them sufficient for most parts of the tour, but they did not help much in few rather confusing places. That is why I sometimes used a real topographic map along with the ones included in the guidebook. Description of trails could be more detailed, but there is an obvious trade-off between the amount of information and the weight of a book. I think the author chose the most practical solution of this trade-off.The book also offers useful information on accommodation. Both brief descriptions of the \\"refuges\\" and the phone numbers (or e-mail addresses whenever available) are up to date. Prices are missing, but you will need to call those places in advance anyway because booking is strongly advised on this popular trek.Finally, the book also covers various interesting topics, from weather to ATMs. My only criticism here is that the author had mostly the British readers in mind while writing about flights and health insurance. Since the book has become the most popular guidebook among the English-speaking hikers, I hope the next edition will be slightly more international.I gave this book five stars because it is the most helpful and comprehensive guidebook about the Tour of Mont Blanc I have ever seen.

One can find where to pick up the trail after exiting the cable ca,r but it's trial and error ... not the most comfortable way to start out a trek. This needs to be fixed. For the rest of the trek, however, the descriptions are excellent and fool-proof. Refuges are evaluated (read between the lines), not just described, and what's available in the various towns one goes through is more helpful than one might think.

On our 1st day from Les Houches to La Flegere, it took us 11.5 hours whereas the book mentions around 6.5-7 hours. We barely had a 20-minute lunch stop with quick photos stops but that was it. On the rest of the days although we were better than the 1st day, we still overshot the times by at least 2 hours.

When Jana arrives at the parsonage she learns that Rob has run away with his secretary, cleaned out their meager savings, taken most of their valuable belongings, and has stolen jewelry left to her by a relative.With the new pastor arriving, Jana has four days to vacate the parsonage. She has no job, little money, few personal belongings and a baby on the way. Her only option is to turn to the mother who has continually rebuffed her and emotionally abandoned her.Jana's mother, Eleanor is haunted by a childhood of betrayal that she has been unwilling to share with anyone-and it has taken its toll on all of her relationships. It is the delightful and eccentric aunt who will weave God's love through the lives of these two estranged women.Peterson's novel deals with the difficult topics of infidelity, incest, and rape from the view that they are areas that are reaching epidemic proportions in and out of the church. She writes about the issues openly, honestly and respectively with the idea that the faith community must confront these issues in order to better help the survivors.An author warning: \\"Mothers and other caregivers will need to decide if the story is appropriate for their teenage girls.\\" This is a thoughtful addition that will be appreciated by everyone. While this might be considered an adult novel, certain teenagers will be able to read it and benefit from the story. I would suggest that mothers and teenagers read it and then discuss it.Armchair Interviews says: Kudos to Peterson for having the courage to deal with these delicate subjects in such a respectful manner, and while doing so, she still manages to educate and give us a good read."},{"Title":"What She Left for Me","review":"This is an excellent book!

It is about a pastor's wife who finds out she is pregnant while on a work and witness trip and comes home to share the news and finds out her husband, the pastor, has left her for another woman. What I found refreshing about this book and storyline is just because we're Christians, doesn't mean our lives are storybook. It is nice to see a realistic point of view and that God can overcome the hurts if we let Him help us."},{"Title":"What She Left for Me","review":"Three women's lives are intertwined in ways they have never discussed until circumstances bring them all under one roof.Jana, the youngest of the three, must move in with her Great-aunt Taffy and her mother, Eleanor, when she finds out her husband has left her for his secretary. To make matters worse, he is the pastor of their church and she must leave the parsonage within a week.Jana and her mother have never gotten along. Eleanor has pushed Jana away at every turn, trying to teach her to never be dependent on anyone for anything, including love, which is what Jana has wanted more than anything.Jana has spent her entire life thinking her mother didn't love her and knowing that her father didn't want her. She also begs her mother to tell her about the past, where she came from and who her dad was - the very things her mom has fought to forget.Then there's Taffy. She has a joy for life that neither Jana nor Eleanor can understand.They are certain she has never endured a hardship as they have only to discover that her life hasn't been that dissimilar from theirs and her joy truly comes from the peace she has with God."},{"Title":"What She Left for Me","review":"I've spent the past week reading What She Left for Me by Tracie Peterson. I won't give you a synopsis of the book - other reviewers have done that, but this is definitely a KEEPER. I want to encourage you to read it and learn from it, and pass it on to a hurting friend. This book is dedicated: \\"To all who bear their secret shame, who carry the pain of the past, who long to be set free.\\" Ms. Peterson continues with a letter to the reader, suggesting that moms and other caregivers should decide if this book is appropriate for teenage girls. I wish I could stand on a street corner and hand this book to everyone who passes but Ms. Peterson is right, you have to determine if your teenage daughter is emotionally ready for this story. But please note, you don't have to have been a victim of abuse or molestation to learn something from this story. I learned from Jana when she thought to herself, \\"Can a person hold something against another without even realizing it?\\" I've never thought about it so I had to highlight that phrase. We're definitely 'products' of our past-whether we want to be or not. I'm sure we all have ghosts that rear their ugly heads and say boo to us now and then-especially when we think we're happy. We need to rid ourselves of those ghosts and Ms. Peterson's tortured, hurting characters show us exactly how to do it. Yes, this book is about forgiveness, and it will show you how. Taffy said, \\"You must never confuse forgiveness for approval; it's not the same thing. . ..\\" I encourage you to grab a copy of What She Left for Me. Savor every word and each lesson learned by Peterson's well-rounded characters. If you have demons in your past, Jana, Eleanor and Taffy's stories will point your in the right direction for forgiveness. As for me, I'm going to the blackboard and write \`you must never confuse forgiveness for approval; it's not the same thing' five hundred times. Would you like to join me?"},{"Title":"What She Left for Me","review":"Pregnant Jana comes home following a three week missionary trip to Africa only to find her pastor husband dumped her for his secretary, emptied their finances and took anything else of value including her jewelry left to her by a relative before vanishing. Jana is further stunned when she learns he explained all to his parishioners including that Jana knew.Feeling stripped of any decency by a man of God she thought she knew and with the new pastor arriving shortly to take over her current residence, Jana returns home in spite of an estranged relationship with her mom Eleanor. Also residing in her mother's house is her lovable eccentric Great-Aunt Taffy. Through Taffy's manipulations, the kindness of a minister and while the pregnancy progresses, Jana and Eleanor begin to heal the past as both turn to God to help them find forgiveness as each realizes \\"to err is human\\". Still Jana has further tribulations to cope with hopefully with her mom at her side and the Lord everywhere to guide her.Though obviously an inspirational tale, WHAT SHE LEFT FOR ME is much more as Tracie Patterson delves into taboo subjects like adultery by religious leaders and rape by adult family members of a child. Jana is a terrific central character who learns that probably no bond is stronger than that of a mother and daughter except with the Lord. Eleanor and Taffy strengthen the strong insightful family drama that focuses on various interrelationships. This includes negative impacts caused by \\"loving\\" third parties that like some politicians, prefer sanitizing, insisting this only occurs in liberal hot spots like Boston. This is a thought provoking eye opening relationship drama.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"What She Left for Me","review":"What She Left for Me by Tracie Peterson is a book that deals with themes of adultery, rape, incest, and child abuse. Tracie gives a warning at the beginning of her book mentioning that parents should first make sure the book is okay for their teenagers to read. Because I am 19 and was able to handle this book, I'm not sure the typical 13-14 year old would be able to. She does not make things graphic like other authors to, but it is implied that inappropriate things are happening.The books starts off with 26 year old Jana McGuire coming home from Africa from a missions trip. Excited to tell her pastor husband that she is pregnant with their first child, she comes home to a airport with no one there to greet her. Once home, she finds a note from her husband saying that he has fallen in love with his secretary and that he wants a divorce. He withdraws all their money--leaving her penniless, and even takes her family heirloom jewerly. Jana with no one to turn to calls the mother she barley knows and asks if she may move in with her and her great-aunt Taffy. Her mother, Eleanor however is very reluctant with the move-in. Eleanor has secrets from the past that she is trying to hide, a past she just wishes would go away and disappear. Jana, however wants to know those secrets and find out truly who her father is, who she really is, and how her past has affected the choices she has made. Will these woman ever truly be set free from the past secrets and lies that bond them?This is not the best from Tracie. Not very rich in detail compared to her wonderful Heirs of Montana series and other past works she has done. Neitherless it was still a good read. The book has TONS of dialogue between the three main characters (Jana, Eleanor, and Taffy). Sometimes the dialogue gets so repetive though you just want the main plot to move forward--I kept looking ahead to find out what happens. I still enjoyed it, but it wouldn't be something I would read again. If you want a REALLY good book about family secrets and lies told read Lynn Austin's \\"Eve's Daughter's\\"."},{"Title":"What She Left for Me","review":"this book started out like any ole contemporary fiction book. It really took an abrupt turn and covered some sensitive issues. Tracie had me really wondering. This book covered incest and adultery. It was written very well. The characters in the book were people I grew to have feelings for. Aunt Taffy is every ones dream aunt. Eleanor was also some one who I really felt grieved for with all her difficulties in life. I would not recomend this book to teens unless an explanation and discussion follows. It was a fast read and different from Tracies usual writting."},{"Title":"What She Left for Me","review":"I enjoyed this book. It was moving.

Her novels are in tune with real-life issues.Her moral certainty is to be applauded. Each book is certain to hit home for me or one of my friends.

I'll never pass up one of her novels."},{"Title":"What She Left for Me","review":"The book was really heart touching. You felt empathy for the characters and the struggles they faced in life. It was good to watch their journey through the trials and find their way back to God. They learn that God had never left them, but they had distanced themselves from Him. He was there all the time. Their struggles have only made them stronger. They learn that healing can only be found in and through Him."},{"Title":"What She Left for Me","review":"My sister got me reading books by Tracie Peterson ans I went to Amazon and ordered this book.

She's excited to share her good news with Robert. They're expecting a baby! But the surprise doesn't end there. When Jana gets home, she discovers that Robert has left with his secretary, divorce papers have been filed, and he has taken everything of value in the house--and the bank account. When the deacons show up, Jana learns she has to be out of the parsonage in four days. Left homeless and penniless, Jana has no choice but to go home to her mother, Eleanor, a woman who always seemed to hate her, and her great aunt, Taffy, who Jana hardly knew.Eleanor is hardly thrilled when Jana shows up and shares her pregnancy and Robert's infidelity with her. She unkindly suggests Jana get an abortion because she is familiar with how hard it is to be a single mother. Jana is still reeling from Robert's betrayal and is desperate for answers as to why Eleanor hates her, and who her father is as well as reeling from Robert's betrayal. Will Jana and Eleanor be able to face the horror of the past in order to have a future?Wow! What She Left for Me is a powerful story. At times it hit very close to home. The story is very well written, and it held my interest to the end. There were some total shockers in the story that hit me by surprise. I grew to care deeply for confused and hurting Jana, bitter Eleanor, and outrageous Taffy. I think I loved Taffy the most, since she was the anchor that kept sanity in the family, even though she was the most outrageous.I have read almost all of Tracie Peterson's books, and while they are all good, this one is outstanding. I highly recommend What She Left for Me. The story line might be difficult for some readers, but if it is, I suggest that you continue reading, as you might find healing."},{"Title":"What She Left for Me","review":"Books were shipped quickly and in good condition.

I thought it was too graphic even for me as an adult woman. I would not let anyone under 18 read it."},{"Title":"What She Left for Me","review":"I give Tracie credit for mentioning in the front cover that What She Left For Me may not be appropriate for all readers and that moms should use discretion in the decision to let their teen daughters read this book.Tracie knows how to write a wonderful story. I have read most of her books, and of those I haven't, I am constantly trying to find copies to read. What She Left For Me was well-written, but I don't believe I would recommend it to others. Tracie deals with some very difficult issues, including marital unfaithfulness and sexual abuse. I understand that some do not want to read \\"fluff,\\" so this kind of reality might appeal to them. I also understand that issues such as divorce and abuse IS sadly prevalent in today's society and should not be \\"hush-hush\\" in our churches. I don't, however, feel that these types of subjects should be for \\"fun,\\" fictionalized reading. Even though Tracie was careful in her descriptions, I just had an \\"icky\\" feeling after I finished parts of this book.I believe Tracie's intent in dealing with some of these subjects was to open the eyes of some Christians. Many Christians are dealing with hurts and issues that we have no idea of. That Christians that have no experience in dealing with these subjects tend to still shun those that have. Opening our eyes to the shameful blaming of victims in these circumstances.However, I, again, do not feel that a fictionalized story is the place to talk about serious sin issues. God gave us the perfect teaching tools in His Word and His local church. Too many churches are not teaching the WHOLE counsel of the Word of God (Acts 20:27). In God's Word we can find lessons on sin, compassion, healing, and comfort.I still enjoy Tracie's books and will certainly read another. What She Left For Me, however, will not find a permanent home on my shelf."},{"Title":"What She Left for Me","review":"Jana McGuire is a 24 year old woman married for 2 years to a 36 year old pastor in Spokane. He encourages her to go to Africa on a mission with a few other women. Upon her arrival home, this wonderful man of God has left Jana a curt note telling her he's left her for his church secretary, and by the way, whatever is left in the parsonage (not much), she's welcome to. Rob lied and told the church elders that the break-up was all Jana's idea. He's cleaned out the checking and savings account ($6,000 in savings isn't meager to some)and also stolen her family heirloom jewelry which her great-aunt gave her. And by the way, she's just found out she's pregnant.The elders tell Jana a new pastor is moving in, therefore, she must get out. She nets $1,500 in the sale of the leftover household items, plus the church gives her some money, but Jana never considers getting her own apartment and a job. Oh no. Since she can't take care of herself and her coming child (I mean, no single woman could, could they?) she must move in with her rich aunt and mean, cold mother in Montana. Her mother also has plenty of money. There's just no other alternative. Jana is an absolutely helpless, unindependent woman, unprepared to bring a child into the world.Her happy-go-lucky great-aunt Taffy gives Jana money and a room in her huge house. Everybody drinks tea, wears red or burgundy blouses, works in the garden, etc. Quite cozy. There's a lot of talk about \\"Why did God allow this to happen to me?\\" A pastor in her new town offers to answer the question, but instead backpedals, and tells her to trust in Jesus. Her mom Eleanor had a different sort of upbringing with her flower children parents living in communes, but they were mostly interested in drugs, not taking care of their kids. To avoid hurt, she didn't get close to Jana. Eleanor also mooched off the rich Taffy and her politician hubby, then started her own bookstore in NY, which she manages over the telephone from MT.There are pages and pages of \\"I don't want to talk about it\\" and \\"Why, God?\\" concerning Eleanor's past and Jana's whining about her husband leaving her. Lots (and lots and lots) of repetition. I had to wade through much muck to find out Eleanor's background (told piecemeal). Jana finally decides Rob left her because he was jealous that she wsa becoming closer to God.Taffy finally answers the \\"Why did God allow this to happen?\\" question. Because God lets us choose. Some sins have worse consequences than others, but we all sin, so we're all equal. Someone who steals a paperclip is just as bad as a murderer, child molester or rapist. It matters not that these sinners cause their victims untold misery. If they ask for forgiveness, it must be given, and they will be in heaven alongside the paperclip stealers. Taffy forgives her husband for cheating on her \\"about a hundred times\\" but I got the feeling she never really cared if he did - wonder if she'd have cared if he gave her AIDS. \\"Oh no honey, don't worry about it, it's okay.\\" The victims are just supposed to trust Jesus, and suffer. The sinners have all the fun, say they're sorry (once they get caught), and they get to go to heaven.Therefore:God, all-powerful, could stop wars, but allows innocent children in Iraq to be murdered, because Bush made the choice. That Bush does not pay the consequences for his choice matters not. God could also stop natural disasters, starvation, or any horrible thing that has nothing to do with \\"choice\\" but the author doesn't waste her time on this.In the end, all is understood amongst the women (good thing, since I didn't) and everything is happy happy. But trying to tie in the religious angle just didn't work. The characters are paper dolls and don't exist in real life. If you're looking for a book to help you through a rough patch, don't get this one. Look up your wealthy aunt instead, and hope she's VERY generous."},{"Title":"Between Heaven and Earth: A Guide to Chinese Medicine","review":"As a student of Asian energy healing, I found this book to be the best single source of information about the Chinese 5 Elements and their value in understanding physical and emotional health.The book treats the subject of Chinese medicine in enough detail and depth for the practitioner, yet is written in clear, non-technical language accessible to the general reader. Much of the writing is excellent and I found the treatment of the five personality types -- Earth, Fire, Metal, Wood and Water -- especially helpful.The book includes detailed questionnaires that allow the reader to discover his or her own type, and to use that information to help manage stress and maintain better physical and emotional health."},{"Title":"Between Heaven and Earth: A Guide to Chinese Medicine","review":"For a beginning student of of TCM like myself, this book is invaluable.

It was the first book that actually inspired me to look into acupuncture and oriental medicine. It is clear, concise and gets to the point. No it doesn't explain every aspect of oriental medicine but, oriental medicine is a lifelong learning practice. Any competant practitioner knows that there is always more to learn and that nothing can be summed up in a small book. I think the whole intention of this book was to give a broader explanation of acupuncture and oriental medicine. It is not a text book, nor was it ever meant to be. The illistrations are wonderful and the wording is easy to understand. It is a wonderful beginner book. I used to sit in a small cubicle and read this during my break and plan for the future.

I've used it, it's no substitute for going to a medical practitioner, but handy in a pinch for sure.The section on food as medicine is really great. I've used it to prevent, shorten and get over colds. I use it as a guide to get a quick little personal chinese medical diagnosis of my cold-- caused by wind, or dampness etc. and then go and make little healing meals that are quite effective. Again, no substitute for real medical help for serious conditions, I'm referring to little colds. But quite helpful.I also found the explanations of chinese medicine to be very useful to be an educated consumer of acupunture and chinese medicine.I liked this book better than the Web that has no Weaver, but both are excellent books.This useful book has a permanent home on my bookshelf, and gets looked at frequently for helpful information."},{"Title":"Between Heaven and Earth: A Guide to Chinese Medicine","review":"This book is great.

It was a joy to read. It's weakness from my point of view as a physician is that they seem to take their knowledge of western medicine from \\"a straw man\\" image of either what it was in the past or as if it was a solitary discipline epitomized by the surgical orientation of one of the author's father. Since I started in another career before medicine (biological psychology) I find that western and eastern medicine are both valuable disciplines, each with their own merits and their own weaknesses. As time marches on, with each vast system of healing having much more exposure to the other now than at any other time in history; we are also able to witness the needed and natural phenomenon of regression toward the mean. I could phrase that more poetically and spiritually as convergence toward the \\"Middle Way\\", the Tao or the balance of Yin and Yang.Despite the inward aching of \\"De Qi\\" when I felt them hit a potentially true weakness in western medicine and the times when I felt they were perhaps a little further off the grain -- overall I found the book refreshing, hopeful and ripe with wonderful possibilities for strengthening the role of the client or patient in their own healing. The latter is something severely weakened in our third-party system of western medicine whereby someone elses pays for something to be done to me by procedure or pill, but yet I don't really have to nor am I inspired to change much about how I rest, recreate, eat, exercise or relate to my fellow earthwalkers or environment.In eastern medicine these issues are all part of a larger concept of healing that has been sadly drained out of western medicine. Why this problems exists is complex and obviously western practitioners have their blind spots and exaggerations which have contributed to some but not all of the flaws. I especially think that it is not because most of us do not care as physicians. Nor is it because we have never spent time struggling with the passivity of the western model. There is no simple answer, but part of the accelerated dilemma lies with our institutionalized and bureacritized systems of delivery, now so heavily laden with other agendas that the essence of what we hoped for has sometimes been left out. Instead our \\"essence\\" became commercially packaged for mass production and profit mostly by people and corporations who never touch or sit face-to-face with the the real person made of flesh and blood (and qi) who came seeking healing.Wholeness as glimpsed here could also be lost to the practice of eastern medicine, if the painful lessons in the evolution of western medicine are not studied with more thoroughness and heart than the authors exemplify in some of their superficial cliques -- such as doctor as mechanic. Science and medicine have moved on in the lives and practice of many if not most physicians.I would point out that China in the early days of its exposure to western \\"materialistic science\\" likewise seemed to have become \\"intoxicated\\" with the grand idea that one could systematize, categorize, control and demystify nearly everything -- the tools becoming grandiose in their promise for mass production, delivery and speed. But at the end of the day, we and I believe they also ultimately realize that individual humans and complete living biological systems are always more than ... more than the micro by itself, more than a logical linear string of mechanisms, more than the isolated part, more than the quantity that is measurable by current standards and represented in group averages. Furthermore, healing done in harmony with the body's inate wisdom takes time.Everytime I prescribe a medication I do so with some appreciation for what seems to be known about it and some hesitancy also realizing that for the person sitting in front of me it may have a somewhat different effect that than promised by the manufacturing drug company. Thus, my limited experience with Chinese medicines prescribed by L.Ac. colleagues and what I read between the authors lines tells me they understand the same -- there is great variation among individuals and their response to a given preparation will vary. Some of these differences may be explained by liver enzyme systems for metabolism, renal clearance, variations in biological half-lifes, and interactions with other medications in western medicine. They might be explained by season, time of day, age, gender, and propensity toward the expression one of the 5-Elements patterns in Chinese medicine. However, all our systems of explanation are imperfect in the face of life, its diversity and its wounds.Nonetheless, I feel the authors did a very solid job of opening dialogue about their understanding of potential differences between left/right, east/west, yin/yang and ultimately eastern and western medicine. I would love to see that dialogue continued with a deeper respect between both sides -- for the greatest benefits of all of those who feel they are born and driven to be healers and who pursue with great diligence the expression of one or more healing arts and sciences from their own point of entry into the great mandala of wholeness. Such a healing of the split between healers seems likely to do even more for those who come to them for healing.There are many strong sections of this book -- I felt most drawn to the initial sections on theory, 5 elements, and the adaptation of archetypes to explain differences between people incorporating the physio-spiritual-pyschologic dimensions of the elements. I appreciated the balance in presentation of these types -- all of which have significant strengths and vulnerabilities for injury or illness. Unlike some texts I've read in which I felt the author might obviously like one type of person better than another; instead I felt a deep respect and appreciation communicated by these authors for every type of human, a recognition of equality or equilibrium between them and that all are needed to complete the human species. I also felt the emphasis on the positive side of each archetype, creating for the individual who possesses it a very important image of what it could look and feel like to be healthy. Sometimes that is greatly needed after a person has endured months or years of criticisms (even well intentioned) and chronic illnesses.I do not know enough about chinese herbal medicines to speak to those sections. I definitely carry a fear for my particular group of patients/clients who have marked kidney insufficiency and who already have to take many western medicines; I am concerned that the additional burden of interactions with herbs and just more \\"stuff\\" for their already threatened filters to manage could overwhelm them. In this situation even the foods we would normally consider healthy (fruit, whole grain breads, nuts) can become toxic or lifethreatening by overdosing phosphorus or potassium. Thus I just don't go there with the population I serve. I am unable so far to speak to how this works with other groups. Nonetheless, I find much of interest in the book -- plenty to feed my imagination in the potential use of acupuncture and qi gong for assisting with pain and the de-spiriting aspects of chronic illness."},{"Title":"Between Heaven and Earth: A Guide to Chinese Medicine","review":"As a former massage therapist with a keen interest in holistic health and wellness, I found \\"Between Heaven and Earth\\" to be a fantastic overview of Chinese medicine theory. I don't believe the authors expected any of the readers to come away ready to practice acupuncture, but their treatment of the subject was both relatively easy to follow and quite thorough for such a broad subject. It was plenty to swallow for anyone who is seeking to know more about this area of healing that is rapidly making its way in to the mainstream of accepted channels of health and healing.I particularly enjoyed the description of the 5 elements and discovering my own dominant element. It sure fit like a glove. It reminds me of the kind of analysis used by ayruvedic practitioners pertaining to dominant dosha types, yet it is a completely different paradigm.The latter part of the book has descriptions of the organ meridian channels, complete with diagrams and acupuncture points for self-care. There is a section devoted to Chinese herbs, with descriptions of their uses and some recipes. The recipes, however, looked to me to be only for those avid devotees who have the time and patience to implement them.This is an interesting book. I don't suggest the average reader will be able to \\"do it themselves\\" after reading it, but it makes the big picture clearer to anyone already working with a practitioner of Chinese medicine. Most people should be able to find a few points that are immediately usable, and walk away with a better understanding overall."},{"Title":"Between Heaven and Earth: A Guide to Chinese Medicine","review":"I have known the author, Efrem Korngold, from the 60's.

Thereby, segmenting the mind from the body which they themselves state in earlier chapters is contrary to the TCM thought process. So again, 3 stars as I felt only half the book was worth wild."},{"Title":"Between Heaven and Earth: A Guide to Chinese Medicine","review":"As a student of Asian energy healing, I found this book to be the best single source of information about the Chinese 5 Elements and their value in understanding physical and emotional health.The book treats the subject of Chinese medicine in enough detail and depth for the practitioner, yet is written in clear, non-technical language accessible to the general reader.

The Five Phase Theory, as presented in this book, can assist practicing acupunturists or students of Oriental Medicine in deepening their understanding of how to successfully handle the myriad problems and dis-eases presented by their patients.

The authors were **the** people who brought an understanding of Chinese medicine to the U.S. in the 1970s, and this book is a heroic attempt to educate us and interest us at the same time with what they had found. It's hard to tell whether they're classic five element practitioners (I've heard differing points of view on this) but they do a FABULOUS job on breaking down what's involved with that unique, and very hard to find out about, form of acupuncture. Although practitioners will say that they can only figure out your type from actually diagnosing you in person, I found that when I put my husband and me through the written &quot;tests&quot; in the book, very comprehensive, we actually came out ahead: and figured out &quot;what&quot; we were, 1.5 years ahead of the acupuncturist so doing. That gave me even more confidence in the book. Not to mention, reading and thinking about what the test revealed about us HUGELY promoted our understanding of ourselves and each other, and made for a fun adjunct to a vacation weekend. This is a great book, and I find myself referring to it again and again, though I've also read--and own--many of the other now classic books in the field. Simple enough for a lay reader, but definitely able to communicate the elegance of the practice.

I do not have a long attention span when it comes to dry manuals, but this book was written to be understood and will hold your interest. The only part of the book I found lacking was the index.

The description of five-element theory is very poetically written, so the book is fun to read. There is also a good introduction to acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine. The chapters on acupuncture and herbal medicine are fairly technical, so if you don't have much interest in these areas, you may find the sections boring.The main problem with the book is it's over-emphasis on the Five Elements. From what I understand, the Chinese five element theory is not regarded as important to diagnosis and treatment in TCM as the theory of yin/yang and chi (in fact, the validity of the theory is still hotly debated in China today) so its treatment here may be a bit over-emphasized."},{"Title":"Between Heaven and Earth: A Guide to Chinese Medicine","review":"In the first glance I couldn't get the idea of information contained in this book but after spending few minutes on the contents I decided to purchase it.

It focuses mainly of the five element theory of TCM, and it manages to explain a very complex concept in clear terms. It has nice self-test chapters to help the reader figure out their own predominant elements, and also offers good advice on simple herbal supplements and dietary advise based on the patterns.However, it is very basic. If you are looking for more in-depth information on Traditional Chinese Medicine, or if you already have a basic understanding of the five elements, The Web that Has No Weaver is probably a better book to read, since it explains not only the five elements, but also the organ networks and their associated functions and spirits in much more depth.I usually recommend Between Heaven and Earth to people who want to gain a basic understanding and introduction into the Chinese Taoist Philosophy that is the basis of Traditional Chinese Medicine.

There are many acupuncture styles (I mean Japanese, Korean, Tong, etc.), and herbal medicine is based on organ-system pattern diagnosis... you'll find none of that in this book.What is in this book is good and interesting, and perhaps an ok intro to Chinese medicine, but please remember there is much much more to even getting acquainted with Chinese medicine. &quot;The Web...&quot; is much too philosophical and scholarly for more readers. The danger there is that no one will read the whole thing.The danger with &quot;Between...&quot; is that readers will misunderstand the breadth and variation within Chinese medicine and be confused when they visit an acupuncturist who does not practice 5 phase style."},{"Title":"Between Heaven and Earth: A Guide to Chinese Medicine","review":"I read this book and used it as a reference in acupuncture school. I highly recommend it to everyone, including my patients.It gives you a basic understanding of how the organs are viewed in Chinese medicine.For example, the heart is affected by all emotions. Thus, if you experience extreme emotions for an extended period of time, you can develop a heart Qi (energy) deficiency. This would cause insomnia, palpitations and fatigue. This can be cured with acupuncture and herbs.If you have too much stress, your liver energy becomes stagnant, or stuck. This causes you to be even more stressed with each added stressor. Chinese medicine can fix that.Fear affects the kidneys.

It's his only novel with enough clues to allow readers to figure out who did it--although the identity of the killer will still surprise most readers (including this one, to be honest). What distinguishes it from a typical murder mystery, however, is Hammett's fastidious prose, scurrilous characters, noir ambience, and borderline misanthropy.Ned Beaumont, a self-described \\"amateur detective\\" with an independent streak and a gambling habit, is the loyal underling to shadowy political boss Paul Madvig, whose major concern is to see his candidate, Taylor Henry, reelected to the Senate. When the Senator's son is murdered alongside a dimly lit street, Madvig is the chief suspect, the papers (controlled by the opposition) go on the attack, and Beaumont intervenes with an attempt to clear his boss's name. While not above resorting to ethically dubious behavior, Beaumont retains a vein of rectitude under his tough-guy exterior, and he's even willing to undergo the most brutal thrashings at the hands of the criminal opposition out of loyalty to his own superiors--as long as they themselves don't cross the line.His fourth novel in three years (1929-1931), \\"The Glass Key\\" is bleaker and more cynical than its predecessors, and the mood spirals further downward as the story unfolds. (One can almost imagine Hammett's brooding temper darkening with each stiff drink.) While most of his fiction deals with the underworld and its corruption and squalidness, this work shows most effectively the seedy alliances among businessmen, political bosses, elected officials, law enforcement, media figures, and organized crime in Prohibition-era America."},{"Title":"The Glass Key","review":"&quot;The Glass Key&quot; is probably Dashiell Hammett's best-constructed novel. Our detective this time is not a professional sleuth, but Ned Beaumont, a sharp, tough, unglamorous, right-hand man to Paul Madvig, a powerful corrupt-as-the-next-guy businessman with political ambitions. Paul intends to win an upcoming city election and marry a Senator's daughter. But only a few weeks before the election, Taylor Henry, the Senator's son and brother of Paul's intended, is found murdered in the street. The police are desperate to solve this high-profile case. The city's various political forces are inclined to use Taylor Henry's death to leverage the upcoming election. Information is power, and whoever knows the identity of the murderer may control the election. Paul Madvig's now-precarious influence appoints Ned Beaumont as special investigator for the District Attorney's Office, and the newly-credentialed Ned sets out to sort out the murder before it sorts out the power structure in this unnamed Depression-era city.&quot;The Glass Key&quot; explores the interdependent cultures of politics, industry, and news media, which combine to thoroughly immerse the city in corruption. As much as I admire Hammett's themes and enjoy his stories, I've never considered the stories, themselves, to be plausible. I wouldn't have much trouble believing that the characters or events described in &quot;The Glass Key&quot; could actually have existed, though. This is the most grounded in realism of any of Hammett's novels, and it's the most tightly written. The novel is evenly paced and, like its protagonist Ned Beaumont, is spare, focused, and direct in its purpose. Despite the story's third-person narration that never reveals anyone's thoughts or emotions, the characters are well-drawn and never flat. Ironically, the narrative's objectivity seems, if anything, to intensify its brutality. By focusing its attention on the personal and professional machinations behind city politics, &quot;The Glass Key&quot; creates an insider's view of power in America, circa 1930. By keeping the identity of the murderer and the outcome of the power plays secret until the very end, Hammett keeps us interested. Although it lacks &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;'s exotic characters and more ambitious themes, &quot;The Glass Key&quot; is among Hammett's best works, and I believe it's his second-best novel."},{"Title":"The Glass Key","review":"Dashiell Hammetts creative light burned bright but for a brief 5-10 year period. In &quot;The Glass Key,&quot; his penultimate novel, Hammett melded the world of the &quot;hard-boiled detective&quot;--shady underground figures, powerful men and, of course, a beautiful woman--with a theme that recurs throughout his ouvre--of basic trust between kindred souls.Often over-shadowed in the eyes of readers by the novels that preceeded and followed, &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; and &quot;The Thin Man,&quot; &quot;The Glass Key&quot; is Hammett at the very top of his form. Writing as no one had before, or has since"},{"Title":"The Glass Key","review":"When you've finished reading this novel (and if you care anything about the American detective story, you will read this novel), think back. Can you recall even the slightest hint of emotion, or the smallest display of caring by one individual for another? I don't think so, and this is the essence of hard-boiled detective stories. Don't get me wrong. You know Ned Beaumont cares about those he is trying to help, and gets beat up for. He's much too tough to show it, though, and that's the key. That's why they call it tough-guy fiction. This story is straight-on, airtight, wonderfully written. In one eighteen-month period Hammett wrote The Maltese Falcon and The Glass Key. Amazing. We shall never see his like again. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Glass Key","review":"I was bowled over by this one. Oddly laconic with some rather awkward turns of phrase (he did it \\"difficultly\\"?!!), the writing, nevertheless, is nearly airtight and so sharply laid down that it carries and sets the mood beautifully in this strange tale of a political boss and his gambler buddy who are bent on winning their particular games of life. Paul Madvig, the boss, wants to win the upcoming elections and ensure continuation of his candidates in office while Ned Beaumont, the lone-wolf gambler, wants to get back on a winning streak, collect on a bad debt and protect his apparently dense friend Madvig who has stumbled into a situation. Madvig is in love with a senator's daughter and keen to win her hand and so has allowed his usual good judgement to become clouded. In shifting his political support to the senator, he has lost touch with his own less-than-respectable base, allowing a local gangster to muscle in on his territory. Intent on pushing the gangster back, he makes a dumb play and is soon sucked into a problem surrounding the unsolved murder of the senator's son. Who did it and why are the questions that lie at the core of Madvig's problems and only Beaumont is clever enough, and cares enough, to get to the bottom of it. Along the way Beaumont takes a bloody beating, participates in a murder and loses what he cares most for in all the world. Although the tale takes a while to get revved up and some of the transitions are so abrupt as to be jarring, this was not only a great \\"detective\\" story but one with real resonance that goes well beyond the genre in which it has been cast. I recently read Chandler's The Big Sleep and thought very highly of it, giving it five amazon stars. Well, this one's even better.SWMauthor of The King of Vinland's Saga"},{"Title":"The Glass Key","review":"This time around, the main character is not a detective, but a gambler with political friends &amp; enemies, one friend in particular. While there is a dead body early in the story, this protagonist doesn't seem all that interested in who the murderer is until the pivotal scene when he gets severely beaten for not turning on his former friend who he's temporarily on the outs with.I've noticed this plot gimmick more than once in Hammett. The rascally characters bring the protagonist's wrath upon them by needlessly attacking him. That happened in one of the shorter Continental Op stories and then again in Red Harvest and now in this one. One could put The Maltese Falcon in that class also.Personally, I had trouble liking the characters until that pivotal scene, and then only did I get involved with them. So I do feel that this had the weakest opening of Hammett's major works. However, once one gets through the first part, it becomes as riveting as any of Hammett's.So I do very much recommend this one along with Hammett's other books."},{"Title":"The Glass Key","review":"Dashiell Hammett, the legendary writer who singlehandedly made hardboiled crime respectable subject matter for American novelists, pulled no punches when he authored The Glass Key. The pages of this dark, decidedly non-uplifting book are teeming with violent acts and political corruption while vividly showcasing the basest of human instincts. The characters are largely unlikable. And that includes the novel's protagonist, Ned Beaumont. Perhaps especially Ned Beaumont. Ned is a professional gambler and the righthand man to a powerful political boss in the unnamed city in which most of the narrative of The Glass Key unfolds.The unsolved murder of a Senator's son provides the backdrop against which the numerous examples of depravity and hard edged action take place. Hammett unflinchingly tells this brutal tale using crisp, uncomplicated language that flows smoothly. The Glass Key is an ugly story, beautifully written. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Glass Key","review":"We live in a time when campaign financing makes every politician a little bit crooked --- and when some politicians, out of greed or cynicism or outright stupidity, sell their souls for a few bags of gold. This abuse of power is depressing as hell. But it's not new. And in \\"The Glass Key,\\" we see what political corruption looks like --- from the inside.Ned Beaumont describes himself as \\"a gambler and a politician's hanger-on.\\" That's too modest. He does most of the smart thinking for Paul Madvig, a behind-the-scenes power broker who controls large chunks of an unnamed city. Ned is no bruiser --- he's tall, tubercular and a sucker for a stiff drink --- but, on occasion, he's Madvig's enforcer. And there is much to enforce: a creep named Shad O'Rory is hoping his candidates will control the city after the upcoming election. Then there is the small matter of a Senator's son, found dead in street, right in the middle of Chapter One.Everyone has an angle. The Senator needs Paul Madvig's support. Madvig wants to marry the Senator's daughter. Madvig's daughter was having an affair with the Senator's son. And Madvig looks like the boy's most likely killer. Got all that?Beaumont persuades the District Attorney to give him limited authority to investigate the case. His aim, of course, is to slow that investigation down. Which he does by planting a key piece of evidence.And that's not half of it. The newspaper publisher is heavily in debt. The mortgage on his plant is held by a bank that favors a candidate not in Madvig's stable. So what? As Beaumont points out, \\"He'll do what he's told to do and print what he's told to print.\\"Dirty stuff, all of it. Which isn't to say there's no hero. There is --- Ned Beaumont. How can that be? Because there's a thin vein of idealism in Ned. Because he has a code. Because, in the end, he is a gentleman. And because he recognizes that Madvig, though corrupt, has the city's interests at heart.That's what makes \\"The Glass Key\\" so fascinating --- the way it presents a raw, ugly reality and then makes a kind of sense of it. Is moral order restored at the end? The title tells us it can't be; the glass key is a phrase from a young woman's dream. Yes, it can open a door. Once. Then it shatters. And the door can never be locked again. You don't need deep Freudian understanding to grasp that she's talking about the price of worldly knowledge --- that is, the end of innocence.If \\"The Glass Key\\" doesn't seem familiar to today's newspaper readers, maybe it's because it's more atmospheric. Ned Beaumont's fingers are always wrapped around a dappled cigar. And some of the men wear both vests and hats. They make corruption almost stylish."},{"Title":"The Glass Key","review":"Noir at its finest is not really black at all, it's really about 16 shades of gray. It's the blurring between those shades that separate the hero from villain in this story. Morals, scruples, and ethics are sub-par for all the characters here, a hallmark of noir, but the central character, Ned Beaumont, a shady gambler and right hand man of a political fixer, has at least one redeeming quality that renders him just that little bit more acceptable to the reader. He's no plaster saint, that's for sure, but he's loyal. Really loyal. And sometimes that's just as much a flaw as it is a virtue, at least in Ned's world it is. The book is written in third person but interestingly, Hammett never uses the omniscient voice: He never lets you inside the mind of any of the characters. What you know of them is only what they do and say, so sometimes the book feels a bit like it was written for the screen rather than a reading audience, but the truth is, Hammett creates a power there but has handed it over to the readers to use -- for better or worse. I really liked this book a lot, far more than 'The Thin Man,' and I did not expect that. The story and characters are complex but not stifling. The prose is spartan but not sterling, interesting but not gripping, so I gave it 4 stars rather than five. It's still better than 98% of the mysteries being published today."},{"Title":"The Glass Key","review":"This novel is about politics, his only work that doesn't deal with the hard-boiled detective that he invented. But Ned Beaumont (nee Schoenberg?) gets fixed up as a special investigator to look into the murder of the Senator's son. Ned tracks down the bookmaker who welshed and skipped town, and uses &quot;the hat trick&quot; to claim his winnings; money is power. Afterwards he acts like a private detective as well as a political crony. Disagreeing with Paul Madvig, he meets Shad O'Rory; Shad tries bribery and torture to get Ned to betray his friend Paul. Ned escapes this trap, and helps to solve the murder of an eye-witness. In telling this, the book shows how a newspaper can slant the news: &quot;they wouldn't print it if it wasn't true&quot;!This novel seems to be a variation on Hammett's detective stories, using &quot;politics&quot; as the &quot;root of evil&quot;. But there is a relationship between political power and the love of money. This book shows government functioning as a feudal system: a ruler accepts loyalty from his subjects, and in turn helps and supports them. But the ruler may accept an election loss if that will punish disloyalty and keep his personal power. Could a blue-blooded aristocratic politician sacrifice his son, pimp his daughter, and attempt murder to keep political power? You can judge how this novel approximates the real world.

Several subplots are interweaved, but none appealed much to me. I did appreciate the telegraphic writing style, but I never understood what drove Beaumont to keep going after getting beaten to an inch of his life."},{"Title":"The Glass Key","review":"The Glass Key is one of those classic gangster novels that you just cannot put down. Known as the father of the hard-boiled crime novel, Hammett creates a world where murder is common, but there is also an unwritten code of conduct. In The Glass Key, Ned Beaumont works for Paul Madvig as his right-hand man, but when the son of a Senator gets murdered and Paul is the main suspect, Ned becomes Paul's personal detective as well. Did Ned's boss really murder Senator Henry's son? How is the senator's daughter involved? Are the senator's enemies trying to frame Paul?Hammett creates the ultimate no-nonsense novel. The prose is quick, and it reads almost like a screenplay. I guarantee that if you any pick one scene of dialog, you will be able to visualize it as if you are watching a Humphrey Bogart film. (Granted, Hammett did write The Maltese Falcon, Bogart is the main character in the movie version). For the first 50 pages or so, I really did not care about any of the characters. Yet, as the novel progresses, Hammett throws you deeper and deeper into this world of corruption and chaos. Ned Beaumont becomes a sort of ragged hero. While he will never turn down a fight, he never really wins them either.Each character has his or her own quirks that you will try to discern, but then they will surprise you as soon as you think you have it all figured out. The flare of the 1930s adds to the charm of the book, but the mystery itself will keep you turning the pages. Any guy who likes mysteries will love this book, and The Glass Key is one of the lesser-known books, so dad probably hasn't read it yet!This was one of the books for my mystery book club, and we all found the book tremendously enjoyable. Fans of film noir will love this book by such an important author in the field of noir literature. Even if it takes you a few chapters to get into it, I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves mysteries.I give it a 4 out of 5."},{"Title":"The Glass Key","review":"Reading through some of the online reviews of The Glass Key, I'm a little bit surprised by all the contradictory readings. Hammett supposedly considered it his favorite among his own novels. I liked it-- a lot, even. It isn't my favorite-- I think that honor still belongs toRed Harvest. But I don't consider it (as many apparently do) one of his minor works either.There is a very nice quality of remove to this work. We learn next to nothing about the past of the characters (perhaps why some readers find it difficult to connect with the work?). Instead, their actions speak for themselves and the implication certainly is that the events of the book represent a fatal intersection of oft repeated actions. \\"You are what you do,\\" is what Hammett seems to be insisting here. I personally find this kind of noir writing much more compelling when it sticks to the surface in this way-- gives it an air of fatality and sadness that would only be undermined by too much backstory. He doesn't give us much hope for his bleak city. Only Beaumont seems to have any feeling for nostalgia, and that is undermined by his gambling nature-- his casual lack of ethics.It's an uncomfortable book, I'll give you that. Hammett keeps the reader back from any feeling of resolution, even when we learn the \\"truth\\". For me, it neatly foreshadows a film likeChinatown. The system of corruption in the world of The Glass Key isn't something that can be defeated by anything as trivial as a redemptive character arc. Hammett is telling us something about the world-- the hope will have to come from somewhere else.Wonderful, really."},{"Title":"The Glass Key","review":"Dashiell Hammett (1894-1961) essentially created the American P.I. novel, first in a series of short stories and then with five novels, many of them incorporating his earlier short fiction. Critics regard THE GLASS KEY as his weakest work; it was, however, Hammett's own favorite, a very convoluted tale of that mixes organized crime, political corruption, and a traditionally-styled murder mystery.The central story concerns gambler and tough-guy Ned Beaumont, who has been on a loosing streak until his luck turns with a major racetrack win. When the bookie goes on the lam with the winnings, Beaumont pulls strings to have himself declared a special D.A. investigator and uses a recent unsolved murder of a senator's son as leverage to force the bookie to pay up. But his success in this area entangles him in the murder itself: the senator is backed by crime boss Paul Madvig, who is in love with the senator's daughter, and who may or may not be involved in the murder.It may have been Hammett's favorite, but I have to agree with those who consider it his weakest. Like most Hammett novels, THE GLASS KEY is very convoluted in terms of plot--but in this novel he simply jumps from point to point and scene to scene without offering the reading much in the way of information. The characters are also weak. Paul Madvig is too stupid to be a successful crime boss; it is hard to understand how he manages to command such loyalty from tough-guy Ned Beaumont, and Beaumont himself is very inconsistently rendered. But the novel does have a saving grace that makes it worth reading: Hammett's prose style.It was, in a word, unique. Hammett effortlessly mixes terse toughness with unexpected flashes of poetry and insight and the result is indeed breathless and intense. Many writers would tear a page from Hammett's style, and a few--James M. Cain and Raymond Chandler leap to mind--would go on to create their own unique and equally powerful styles from Hammett inspiration, but no one ever did Hammett as well as Hammett himself. THE GLASS KEY may be the weakest of Hammett's novels in terms of plot and character, but Hammett's way with words carries him though. Ignore the book at your own risk.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"The Glass Key","review":"Dashiell Hammett, along with Raymond Chandler, reinvented the detective genre in the 1930's and 1940's. They moved the genre away from the amateurish and simple parlor detectives that had previously dominated the genre to hard-boiled action characters who knew what was what and didn't mind taking a beating to get the bad guys. And along the way they produced some very memorable literary characters as well. Nick Charles, Sam Spade and Phillip Marlowe are well known exemplars of the action detective.In The Glass Key Hammett takes a little different run at that same idea. The protagonist this time is not the usual detective but an old fashioned political \`fixer'. No, not the \`spin doctor' or \`flak' of modern media-driven politics but the older handler of the retail politics that counted in local urban scene with the added factor of a little off hand, old fashioned mob influence. Nevertheless, the \`fixer' Ned Beaumont has all the resourcefulness, toughness, loyalty, and hard-boiled common sense that we have come to expect of Hammett's real detectives.The plot revolves around the familiar problem of electoral politics-getting elected. In this case getting a Senator with a beautiful daughter, Janet, and an errant son, Taylor, reelected. Add in some political factions, also mob-dominated, a fair share of corrupt officials, an off hand murder and other crimes and misdemeanors and you would hardly know we are not dealing with a \`normal' Hammett novel. Further add in a slowly involving romance between Ned and the afore-mentioned Senator's daughter who is also the object of his boss's affections and you have quite a mix. Frankly, I prefer Hammett's detectives but any time you can get your hands on one of his books do so."},{"Title":"The Glass Key","review":"'The Glass Key' is one of Dashiell Hammett's more controlled, accessible mysteries. The number of characters involved is limited, and the characterizations are uniformly excellent. The story, about political corruption and murder, is something like Hammett's earlier 'Red Harvest'. But 'Red Harvest' was a bit excessive in scope and as a result its plot became somewhat undecipherable after a while. Fortunately 'The Glass Key' doesn't degrade in that way ... in fact it gets better as the story progresses (complete with a good surprise ending).Bottom line: a measured, competent effort by Dashiell Hammett. Not among his more famous works but certainly among the better."},{"Title":"The Glass Key","review":"The Glass Key has plenty of everything we like in a Dashiell Hammett book: corrupt power and wealth, strong characters with hidden motives, deceit and double-crossing. And, in the end, the good guy solves the thing and gets the girl. So what's the problem? Well, there's just too much of it all crammed into one book. The result is a story that demands you suspend not just belief but rationality as you wind your way to the conclusion. For some people that's fine, but not for people who actually enjoy the plot development of a mystery. At some level, the story line has to be believable, and this one isn't.It isn't a bad read...in fact it works quite nicely for a wet Sunday afternoon. But it isn't great work, either. Instead, choose The Maltese Falcon or The Thin Man to see Hammett at his best."},{"Title":"The Glass Key","review":"Great Item Exactly as described!

I was appalled to see how badly the Coen brothers ripped off Hammett. An excellent read."},{"Title":"The Glass Key","review":"The writing was typical of the times (1931). Each movement of the characters was described fully -- almost like it was intended to be a screenplay. Not one of the characters was anything other than criminal at heart, so it was difficult to relate to any of them. Historically, it was very interesting to read about the crime, speakeasies and corrupt Chicago politics. It was what I would consider a \\"guy's book\\": tough men, gangster-like loyalties (without real friendships), drinking, gambling and everyone-out-for-themselves. The men and women in this book had big city mentalities and killings were a part of the life they led. Fear and greed is what drove them. The main thing I didn't like was that it had too many things happening with too many characters -- many of which didn't lead anywhere and tended to make it a rather confusing read. I found myself re-reading passages, just to keep things straight. So, I guess there were parts that I liked, it was an easy read, but the poor character development left me disappointed. I never did guess who the murderer was until the end of the book - which probably makes it a good detective novel, in and of itself."},{"Title":"The Glass Key","review":"this was my first dip into the genre of early american murder mystery writers like hammett. i come away with the same feeling you do after watching an old black and white movie--nostaligic.usually i don't read light books like this, but i took this on a plane trip for vacation. figured it would be attention grabbing easy reading. easy reading it was, but most certainly not a page turner. let's start with what it is not. it is not a who done it! there are not enough clues given to lead the experienced murder mystery reader to solve the case (to explain more would give away the plot). it is not a serial killer, blood and guts story that draws you in. it is not a psychological study of a murderer.so what is it? it is a simple story of big city political corruption that leads to a murder which is solved, not by the police or a detective, but by a political confidant of one of the characters. never do you feel the excitment of a pending murder. never do you feel pending danger for one of the characters. the story just marches on to resolution.i do however, recommend it. it is an interesting period piece. it would never fly today in the world of paterson and all the serial killer tales, but it is a prelude to those stories. maybe it simply shows the deterioration(or some may call it the move to realty) of american entertainment tastes. we see it in murder mysteries from hammett to paterson, in tv from happy days to almost any comedy show today, or in movies from the trend of \\"G/PG\\" rated to \\"R\\". maybe its this nostalgia piece that makes it interesting. if you like old movies, you will find this book refreshing."},{"Title":"The Glass Key","review":"When my book club decided to read The Glass Key, I thought it would be a fun change from the literary, often depressing books we sometimes choose. I was wrong. We unanimously hated it. None of us cared one hoot about who did it or to whom or why. Not only that but the writing was at times laughable. Here are only a few of my favorite passages:\\"Presently a path came under his feet.\\"\\"Ned Beaumont looked, with brown eyes wherein hate was a dull glow that came from far beneath the surface, at the card players and began to get out of bed.\\"\\"Knocking sounded on his door.\\"\\"Madvig addressed to another man a question having to do with the size of the campaign contribution to be expected from a man named Hartwick.\\"Obviously writing wasn't the talent Lillian Hellman saw in him."},{"Title":"Html 4.0: No Experience Required.","review":"I was a beginner/intermediate html coder that wanted to be able to do more with html code and rely less on WYSIWYG programs.

For the experienced reader the reference section is useful, and the overall style makes it easy to locate examples.This is primarily a book about HTML. For those new to the web it provides invaluable information on how to get your site up and running, and also how HTML fits into the wider arena of Java, ActiveX, Javascript, VBScript, etc. However, for detailed treatment of any of these subjects the reader should look elsewhere.The authors have been careful to remind the reader that web site design is more than a technical exercise. There are sections on what constitutes good design, and tips on the use of the web for business. Although I bought the book primarily as an HTML tutorial I learned a great deal about all of these related areas.Scattered throughout the book are numerous URL addresses which guide the user to examples of the topic being discussed.

In between there is a lot of filler to do with an indian raid that goes sour, a scene in which Reilly pins an antagonist's hand to a table with a knife and then reads Tennyson's Ulysses to him. This is not to torture the man, you understand, but to better him. This Reilly ought to have his pretentious head blown clean off. THEN you are supposed to sit still for Reilly and his adopted son touring europe, where Reilly keeps himself in shape by \\"fencing, shooting, wrestling, etc.\\" I suppose this is historically accurate, since this would be some nineteenth century type's backward idea of how to stay in shape. You know, like \\"I warn you, my good man, I am in perfect physical condition. I play badminton every sunday.\\" But the reader is supposed to think that fencing and shooting are actually ways to stay in shape.

A sequel was needed.Some of it is very incredulous but that is typical for the author.Val Darrant, as usual for L'Amour, is an excellent shooter, very well built, lucky, macho,and of course is a great Indian fighter and cow puncher. The usual stereotype for all thebooks by L'Amour I have read ( many of them.)Just once, once, I would like a hero who is inept at something, who is not the best shotis not a rough tough guy. Who loses sometimes. Somebody real and ordinary.Darrant happens to be very learned. He even wants to read serious philosophy, as if those bookswould be found out west in the middle of nowhere! in 1880!I do not agree that this is one of his best.

Enjoyed it just as much."},{"Title":"Reilly's Luck","review":"I'm a big fan of the late Louis L'Amour. INMO one of America's great authors and the only author to be awarded the Congressional medal and the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Reagan. I've bought and read 24 of his westerns, 3 short story collections, his sci fi book Haunted Mesa, Walking Drum, The Last of the Breed, The Lonesome Gods and his first book of poems. Almost all 5 stars. An incredibly talented author.Reilly's Luck is about a 4 year old boy named Val Darrant growing up and becoming a respectable man. We see his evil, manipulating, murderous mother named Myra who does everything including prostitution and multiple murders in order to advance herself in society and make lots of money. That all she cares about and had no use for he husband, son or boy friend. She treats everyone like dirt. She tells Van her boyfriend she doesn't want her 4 year old son and to get rid of it. Its 40 below zero out and she orders Van to get rid of her son Val. Van has pity on the kid and likes Val and does not leave him to die in the cold but takes Val to the only one ( Will Reilly) he can think of that might take care of Val.Will Reilly is a professional gambler with good upbringing, manners, intelligence and is good with a gun. He makes some good investments. Val and Will Reilly go to Europe where Reilly meets a beautiful woman and falls in love but she is hounded by a low life, gambling Prince Pavel. The Price tries to bull whip Will Reilly but Reilly gets the whip and slashes and scars the prince's face with his own whip. The Prince plans vengeance and hires men to kill Reilly. Myra the evil mother plots to kill her ex boyfriend Van so there will be one less person that knows her sorted past. Also Val's now rich but evil mother must find the box sent to Val from Van that shows her killings and her sorted prostitution past. Maybe have her son killed too.Val also makes good investments ( in 1/3 of a ranch and property the railroad later wants that's worth millions)and passes the bar exam and is a licenced attorney and can practice law if he wants to.Lots of action in this great book. Its a page burner. I read the 229 page book in 2 days.The reader develops deep empathy with poor little Val Darrant and Van who would not let Val die. Also Will Reilly is shown as a real hero and a wonderful person. Lots of fighting, gunfighting, and murder. Several real evil persons are shown. Two outlaws turn out to be good. Also Billy the Kid is a minor character in the book as well as wild Bill Kickok who helped both Val and Reilly.I won't ruin the story telling the sad fate of Reilly or the great ending. Reilly's Luck is a great Western and a thoughtful look at a man trying to bring up a young boy right and teach him what he would need in life. Also shows the ultimate evil that can be in a beautiful woman with no soul, lust in some men's hearts leading to their downfall and what evil men will do to their fellow men for power and money. A great story and one of L'Amour's best. Rated 5 stars"},{"Title":"Reilly's Luck","review":"One of the best, in his well used theme of boy growing up on his own, after being brought up at an early age by someone other than his parents.

It is a little unusual for Louis L'Amour to give the title to someone other than the main character, but it works really well in this book. The real character is a young boy who was born into a terrible situation. Things looked hopeless for him when he was abandoned by his cold and heartless mother. Good fortune smiled upon him when he found his new care taker to be a gambling man with savvy and character. Will Reilly raised him right and taught him the secrets he would need to be a successful man. After a terrible killing, Val finds himself wanting revenge. Slowly and surely it will come in it's own time. When it does, it finds that a hopeless boy has grown into a good man who is well capable of settling all of the issues at hand. Facing a cold hearted mother after all those years would be enough to upset anyone, but you'll have to read the book to find out how he handles it."},{"Title":"Reilly's Luck","review":"While I could accept much of what is in here for the west I must admit, like other reviewers, there were elements in this which really annoyed me. It was mostly a good read but I felt there were too many plot elements in it which made it more like a Barbara Taylor Bradford rather than a Louis L'amour. For a start Val Darrant always seemed to make money no matter what he did, including going to university back East - he just succeeded and there was little to explain what or why he was doing - it simply seemed like a plot filler. As did the falling in love with the girl, Boston. Who really appeared out of nowhere and disappeared back into nowhere, virtually.The basic story is that Val Darrant is dumped by his mother's boyfriend - but instead of leaving him in the snow to freeze to death, he is given to a local gambler whom he trusts - Reilly, of Reilly's luck. Reilly likes him and teaches him everything he knows, but 11 years later Reilly is gunned down in a cowardly planned killing. Val gets out of town, but later kills two of the men responsible. Now Val's mother has found out who he is and plans to kill her son whom she hasn't seen for 20 years. She is now rich and powerful and Val probably knows secrets about her he shouldn't.I read this in an afternoon and enjoyed it despite holes in the plot so big you could drive a thousand head of cattle through it - it was still an enjoyably good read."},{"Title":"Reilly's Luck","review":"I actually avoided reading this book for quite a while because I didn't like the name! But as it turned out later the book is easily one of L'amour's best westerns. It is one of those rare books which has a fine balance of adventure, action, romance and sentiment. Very, very enjoyable read!"},{"Title":"Reilly's Luck","review":"This story starts off with a young boy, Val Darrant, being abandoned by his mother. Val ends up being cared for by Will Reilly who is a gambler and travels a lot. The first quarter of the book is about adventures that Will and Val have. They have to deal with outlaws, they fight off Indians, and they travel to Europe. All along the way Will is constantly teaching Val important lessons of life. Will starts teaching Val, at four years old, how to shuffle cards. Val is encouraged to study men and observe what is happening. It seems like on almost every page Will teaches Val about something, how to fight, how to think, how to be kind to people, but also the need to be careful about trusting people.Unfortunately Will is ambushed by three men and killed while Val is still a teenager. But Val has learned many important lessons from Will. The next part of the book is about Val growing up. He has some money and is able to invest the money in a couple ventures. He has some adventures along the way. Val kills one of Will's murderers. He goes back East to get an education.The story then jumps forward a couple years, and the last part of the book pulls together many of the threads. Val finally meets his mother, who is again trying to have him killed. Val kills the last two of Will's murderers. And Val financially destroys the man who hired the murderers.This book has some many of the classic western themes, like gambling, fighting, love, and so on. There is lots of different types of fighting, for example with knifes, with fists, and with guns. There is both a tragic love interest, and a successful love interest.One of the reasons this is such a powerful story is it is a story about Will's legacy. Up until Val, Will had just been drifting through life, but after raising Val for ten years, Will has made a difference. Will's contributions to the world last beyond his death.This is one of Louis L'Amour's best.

Moore, with a full dozen stories published plus three fine novels (\\"The Fairy Chessmen,\\" \\"Valley of the Flame\\" and \\"The Dark World\\"), and in 1947, sci-fi's preeminent husband-and-wife writing team continued its prolific ways. Before the year was out, the two had succeeded in placing another 15 stories into the pulp magazines of the day, in addition to the novel for which Kuttner is best remembered: \\"Fury.\\" A classic of Golden Age sci-fi, \\"Fury\\" originally appeared in the May, June and July issues of \\"Astounding Science-Fiction\\" under one of the pair's many pseudonyms, Lawrence O'Donnell. The story goes that legendary editor John W. Campbell needed a quick novel from the team, and that Part 1 of the serialized novel was in print before the story was even close to being finished. \\"Fury\\" was finally released in book form in 1950. Though hurriedly composed, the tale betrays no signs of its rushed origins, and is indeed an elegantly written (I love that line about libation inducing libration), fast-moving novel that is nevertheless multigenerational and epic in scope. It tells the story of the Landside colonization of Venus in the 27th century, long after Earth has been destroyed by atomic wars. Mankind now lives in Venusian undersea cities known as Keeps, as the surface of the planet is virtually uninhabitable, with deadly forms of plant and animal life in riotous abundance. The book's hero (or should I say \\"antihero\\"?), Sam Harker, is born into one of the families of Immortals that rule the Keeps. When his mother dies during childbirth, Sam's enraged father has the infant genetically altered so that he looks nothing like the tall, graceful folk of the Immortal clans. Sam grows up in foster care, with no knowledge of his background, his heritage, or even the fact that he will probably live to be 1,000 years old. The story of how Sam climbs up the criminal ladder, inadvertently becomes one of the most despised and influential men on Venus, and ultimately causes mankind to migrate out of the undersea Keeps, is the story of \\"Fury,\\" a book whose title refers not only to the vengeful force inherent in its lead character, but to the Landside Venusian environment as well.But a capsule description of \\"Fury\\"'s plot really doesn't do the book justice; it's like saying that \\"Gone With the Wind\\" is a story about a Civil War gal trying to get her house back. Kuttner & Moore generously supply the reader with an abundance of interesting characters, colorful backdrops and unforeseeable plot developments. Among those interesting characters are Sam's Immortal foes, Zachariah Harker and Kedre Walton; Robin Hale, a mercenary Immortal determined to colonize Landside; the Slider, a Fagin-like underworld figure who helps Sam in his illicit projects; and the Logician, an immensely old man given to dispensing homespun, commonsense oracles. Among those colorful backdrops, of course, are the Keeps themselves, nestled on the Venusian sea bottoms under their impervium domes, and the surface of Venus. Readers who are interested in seeing the various terrible life-forms alluded to in the novel's early sections will not be disappointed in the book's latter half, as the Landside settlers encounter giant lizards, foot-long beetles, the monstrosities known as the mud-wolf and the siren web, etc. (Indeed, the life-forms of Venus seem to be so very aggressive in \\"Fury\\" that they might cause the reader to wonder whether or not Harry Harrison was influenced here when he wrote his first novel, \\"Deathworld,\\" in 1960. Likewise, this reader was compelled to entertain the possibility that the vengeful Gully Foyle, of my favorite sci-fi novel of all time, Alfred Bester's 1956 classic \\"The Stars My Destination,\\" might have been patterned after the driven Sam Harker character here, in addition to Bester's admitted debt to \\"The Count of Monte Cristo.\\") As for those unforeseeable plot developments I mentioned...well, the less said, the better. I would be the last to deprive potential first-time readers of any of the many surprises that this cleverly plotted book dishes out.I should also add at this point that I recommend all potential readers of \\"Fury\\" to search out the Magnum Library edition pictured above, as this volume contains an introduction by C.L. Moore herself. In it, Moore tells us how she and her husband were accustomed to work; a fascinating look at how this famous team operated. While most of the Kuttner-Moore pieces of fiction were indeed collaborative, Moore confirms in this intro that her actual contribution to \\"Fury\\" was minimal, adding up to perhaps 1/8 of the novel's total word count. If I read her correctly, her contributions here deal mainly with colorful descriptions and sections pertaining to male-female relationships. Still, as usual, the melding of talents is quite seamless, resulting in one of the best pieces of science fiction that I've read in a good long while. The novel concludes with a two-word epilogue that is just wonderful, certainly opening up the possibility of a \\"Fury\\" sequel. Sadly, that sequel was never to be. Kuttner, who writes somewhere in \\"Fury\\" that \\"the life-span of an ordinary man was too short,\\" died of a heart attack in 1958, at the age of 44. Though the man himself was far from immortal, I'd like to think that his works may indeed be...."},{"Title":"FURY.","review":"Warning: There are spoilers partway through (You'll be warned again). But you may want to come back and read them after you read the book.\\"There is a wonderful point in many stories which comes after the characters and general lines of action are set, when things begin to move by themselves. This is where the unconscious takes over. All the writer's submerged beliefs and fears and hopes come surging joyfully to the surface to take full charge, and the writer's only function is to type fast enough to keep up. This happy state unfortunately isn't common. But when it does come, there are few greater pleasures in life.\\"The reason, of course, is that (besides the necessary money) such stories bring their writers that glorious free-fall sensation which is a kind of catharsis of the unconscious. Characters personifying one's deeply felt beliefs and values test them out in a fictional world. You don't know at the time what's happened. You just know you feel wonderful. Long afterward, rereading the work, you can see what lies just under the surface.\\"There's an obvious passion for writing in those words, and yet you won't find them in a manual about writing, or in the autobiography of some world-famous writer. They're in the introduction (sadly never to be reprinted in other editions) to a 1972 Lancer Books paperback edition of Fury, a classic sf novel that was first serialized in Astounding Science Fiction in 1947 under the pseudonym Lawrence O'Donnell, came out as a hardcover book three years later as by Henry Kuttner, and had been retitled Destination: Infinity for a previous 1958 paperback.Fury's publishing history makes the novel seem purely a matter of commerce rather than art. And yet it is a work of art, as we can tell from the work itself as well as that introduction by Kuttner's widow C. L. Moore - who therein reveals that she wrote some of the scenes, and could still recognize her part in their collaboration 25 years later. Henry and Catherine Kuttner, who frequently wrote together in relays as \\"Lawrence O'Donnell\\" and under other pen names, shared a love for sf that transcended the seemingly cynical imperatives of what was often regarded by outsiders as nothing but pulp fiction.Moore related that she and Kuttner were driven by thematic imperatives that went beyond sf itself. \\"Hank's basic statement was something like, \`Authority is dangerous, and I will never submit to it.' Mine was, \`The most treacherous thing in life is love.'\\" These worked their way into Fury, set on a Venus to which the human race has fled after destroying Earth in a nuclear holocaust. But mankind on Venus has abandoned any effort to tame a savage planet, instead retiring into a \\"luxurious Eden\\" of undersea Keeps - and, \\"with no challenges left, would slowly strangle in its own inertia if, out of nowhere, a deliverer did not come with a flaming sword to drive them back to life.\\"That deliverer is Sam Harker/Reed, a monstrous freak unknowingly robbed of his heritage as one of the elite of Immortals who rule Venus. Reed is driven only by hatred and a lust for vengeance. He was Kuttner's creation, and Moore couldn't identify with him at the time. But on re-reading the novel, she came to understand that to make the premise work - to make the story work - \\"he had to be what he was--utterly ruthless, terribly intelligent, terribly vulnerable, fighting every hour of his life by every savage form of trickery, betrayal and murder, to reach a goal he was never truly aware of.\\"The story of Sam Reed is headed with a quotation from Shakespeare's MacBeth, the scene where MacBeth learns that Macduff, his nemesis, \\"was from his mother's womb Untimely ripp'd.\\" Reed himself is \\"untimely ripp'd,\\" cruelly mutilated and abandoned at the behest of his enraged father after his mother dies in the Caesarian, thus setting the stage for a life out of a Shakespearian tragedy. But the reference to a classic of English literature tells us something else.\\"You can't write science fiction well if you haven't read it, though not all who try to write it know this. But nor can you write it well if you haven't read anything else,\\" Ursula K. Le Guin remarked on the occasion of a British Library sf exhibition, regarding what she had learned from reading Virginia Woolf's Orlando (1928) at age 17. \\"Genre is a rich dialect, in which you can say certain things in a particularly satisfying way, but if it gives up connection with the general literary language it becomes a jargon, meaningful only to an ingroup. Useful models may be found quite outside the genre.\\"It is often assumed, perhaps even by Le Guin, that genre sf writers generally don't read anything but sf, let alone find any \\"useful models\\" outside the field. But that isn't true of leading writers today, and it wasn't true of Kuttner and Moore back in the 1940's. Ray Bradbury, in his introduction to The Best of Henry Kuttner (1975), sets things straight, recalling his elder's role as a mentor - and not just by helping him put out a fanzine:\\"Along the way, he also sneaked me the names of people who might influence my life. Try Katherine Ann Porter, he said; she's great. Have you read Eudora Welty? he suggested, and if not, why not? Have you re-read Thorne Smith? Get to it. How about the short stories of Faulkner, or--here's one you never heard of--John Collier.\\"In Fury, then, allusions to the classics are intertwined with science fictional concerns about the fate of humanity:\\"Blaze and Bessi - it was a Romeo and Juliet story with a happy ending, up to the time Sam was conceived. They were casual, purposeless hedonists. In the Keeps you had to choose. You could either find a drive, an incentive - be one of the technicians or artists - or you could drift.\\"For lesser drifters, there are escapes like dream dust and happy cloaks - the latter, derived from a native life form, slowly consume their addicts. But Sam Reed, born Harker, isn't a drifter; he is a driven man, as driven as any of Shakespeare's tragic heroes, hating himself and hating the Immortals - never knowing until the end that he is one. Only, there's no coven of witches or a Greek chorus to set the plot in motion or comment on its import. Instead we have the Logician, an Immortal unknown to the other Immortals - a man born on Earth who understands what happened there (\\"It wasn't atomic power that destroyed Earth. It was a pattern of thought.\\"). He can foresee the future on Venus, but he is powerless to intervene - except in the subtlest ways.Fury is actually a sequel to \\"Clash by Night\\" (1943; the title is an allusion to Matthew Arnold's \\"Dover Beach\\"), set centuries earlier, when rival Keeps fight proxy wars on the surface through the Free Companies: bands of mercenaries bound by a strict code of honor. The Keeps themselves are never attacked, and should any ship of any warrior band break the taboo on atomic weapons, the others will turn on it and destroy it without mercy.Scott commands one unit in a war for economic advantage between the Montana and Virginia Keeps. But his loyalty to the Doones comes to seem a foolish one; the romantic ideals of the Free Companies are delusions: \\"Blind, stupid folly!\\" He longs for the hedonistic comforts of the Keeps. In the end, however, he cannot abandon his company, for it helps serve an objectively necessary end: preserving the Keeps from the danger of war, until the Keeps themselves tire of war and make the mercenaries objectively unnecessary:\\"The Doones meant nothing. Their ideal was a false one. Yet, because men were faithful to that ideal, civilization would rise again from the guarded Keeps. A civilization that would forget its doomed guardians, the waters of the seas of Venus, the Free Companions yelling their mad, futile battle cry as they drove on - as this ship was driving - into a night that world have no dawn.\\"In Fury, the season has changed: rot rather than fire is the greatest threat to mankind. The Keeps have turned inward, refusing the challenge of conquering the land; in their decadent hedonism, they have surrendered to a cultural entropy that can lead only to extinction - \\"it wasn't the individual who paid. It was the race that was paying.\\" And so Sam Reed is just what the race needs.(Warning: spoilers follow, but Fury is worth re-reading, and you'll love the novel even if you know how it comes out.)Motivated only by envy and rage, he turns to crime, at which he succeeds so well that the Immortals themselves seek him out for a murder contract against Robin Hale, a veteran of the Doones whose crusade for colonization of the land is upsetting the social equilibrium. Their mistake: Reed almost instinctively sides with Hale and therefore with Hale's cause. A ruthless cunning that once served him in the underworld now serves him in the struggle to defeat a savage environment and thus win the survival of mankind.Only, that is never his motivation; he never thinks of anything but his own survival and vengeance against the Immortals. His crimes range from blackmail to murder; when his false promise of Immortality for colonists is exposed, he sabotages the Keeps, forcing millions to abandon them or die. He has saved mankind, but now the Logician, following an allusion to Moses - who was suffered to see the Promised Land but never to go over thither - delivers his judgment:\\"Men like you are mighty rare, Sam. When they get to the right position, at the right time, they're the salvation of the race of man. But it's got to be the right time - a time of disaster. The drive never stops, in a man like you... If you can't conquer an enemy, you'll conquer your friends. Up to now, the enemy was Venus, and you licked it. But what have you got to fight now? ....\\"If you hadn't been born, if Blaze hadn't done what he did, mankind would be in the Keeps yet. And in a few years, or a thousand, say, the race would have died out. I could see that ahead, clear as could be. But now we've come landside. We'll finish colonizing Venus. And then we'll go out and colonize the whole universe, I expect.\\"You're the one who did it, Sam. We owe you a lot. In your day you were a great man. But your day's over. You got your power by force, and, you're like most dictators, son, who reach the top that way. All you could think of was repeating the things that made you a success - more fighting, more force. There wasn't any way but down for you, once you'd reached the top, because of the man you are. You had the same drive that made the first life-form leave water for land, but we can't use your kind any more for a while, Sam.\\"And so, Sam must be put to sleep, at the very moment of his triumph, lest he endanger mankind. Yet Kuttner thought he might be needed again, although he never told Catherine what he might have had in mind when he wrote the two-word epilogue: \\"Sam woke--\\"We feel for Sam because Kuttner felt for him when he created the character. We are caught up in the story of Fury because Kuttner and Moore themselves were caught up in it. In telling that story, they put everything of themselves, of their reading of the classics and science fiction alike, of their experience of life and knowledge of history and evolution and much else, into their work. And somehow, everything they put into their novel, the reader can get out of it. That's what true reading is all about."},{"Title":"FURY.","review":"This story gets down to what we think about death, immortality and those who ultimately control our lives... our parents."},{"Title":"Sex, Lies, and Rabbis: Breaking a Sacred Trust","review":"From her unique vantage point as a victim/survivor and professional psychotherapist,Dr. Charlotte Schwab clearly identifies and describes in her book the abusive power structures within the Rabbinate which mirror the picture of an \\"old boys' network\\" in other faith communities exactly. She brings us face to face with the abuse of teenaged girls and vulnerable adults, the prevailing acts of collusion and complicity, how victims are ostracised by the bystanders at disclosure of those heinous and damaging acts. She unveils the attitudes of rabbis who look upon their victims as perks, mere objects to be used for their pleasure; very much in the same vein some exploitative lecturers would see their students as \\"fair game\\". How bystanders want to hang onto their belief that their rabbi is somehow holy and the victim vindictive. How her own experiences have made her a tower of strength to others to stand up to their abusers, to recover and heal and recognise the hallmarks of pathology within the ranks of all rabbinic organisations.Dr. Charlotte Schwab was raised in a loving home where Judaism was practised as it should be which provided her with the backdrop and sheer determination to challenge the misogynistic sickness within the rabbinic organisations which leads to an abuse of power and lack of respect for the female half of God's creatures. Her diagnosis that a purely male Rabbinate is an unbalanced representation of God is spot on and her energetic drive to bring healing to the Rabbinate is remarkable and brave. She recognises that men and women need to be treated as the equals they are, each bringing their unique gifts and strengths to the whole community and only then healing can take place of all the wounds an unequal male power imbalance has brought about. This truth does not just work for faith communities in my opinion but forms a healthy basis for any society.Finally Dr. Charlotte Schwab brings very much needed clarification to the concept of forgiveness and repentance from which the Christian Western world can learn a lot. Teshuvah means that the sinner must recognise his sin, feel sincere remorse, undo any damage as far as is possible, and resolve never to commit the sin again. The onus to repent is clearly on the perpetrator of the abuse not on the victim to forgive. Demanding that the victim forgives before any restitution has taken place causes further immense damage to the victim. The Christian Church would do well to heed these principles too and leave the choice to forgive or not firmly in the hands of the victim whilst giving her the support and safety she needs and concern themselves with the behaviour and attitudes of the perpetrator."},{"Title":"Sex, Lies, and Rabbis: Breaking a Sacred Trust","review":"The painful elements of Dr. Schwab's saga have little to do with being Jewish. Neither is this an indictment on rabbis. Clergy abuse of power and sex occur with alarming frequency in all faith groups in settings where fiduciary trust placed in religious professionals meets undisciplined, self-serving attitudes. This book calls upon every reader who can exercise influence to set up proper standards, policies, and procedures to take preventive action in their own religious community. I hope and pray this book will help prevent more abuses."},{"Title":"Sex, Lies, and Rabbis: Breaking a Sacred Trust","review":"Good Book that will be enjoyed by inmates for years to come!

Most of the information came from inaccurate reporting. She tries to sensationalize the cases by cutting and pasting snippets from newspaper articles.

It is poorly written and makes one wonder how truly over-exagerated is the reporting. Some of it is so implosible that it made me think that it must be fiction rather than a memoir. After reading over 100 pages of it I could take no more and put it away. I am sorry that I spent money on this type of trash. Don't spend yours."},{"Title":"Sex, Lies, and Rabbis: Breaking a Sacred Trust","review":"Sex, Lies, and Rabbis: Breaking a Sacred Trust is a powerful book. It is a combination of memoir and nonfiction about clergy betrayal, sexual abuse, domestic violence, and even two murders related to clergy sexual sexual abuse. It outlines cases, the cover-up by clergy authorities, what has to be done to correct this, prevention, definitions of abuse, clergy-personalities likely to become predators, and a seven step healing program. It is a must-read for anone concerned about any kind of abuse, prevention, and healing, and in the words of Rabbi Arthur Gross-Schaefer who wrote praise on the book jacket, \\"a must-read for anyone seriously involved in the Jewish community who believes that it is critical that we create safe and caring Jewish communities.\\" The Rev. Dr. Nils Friberg wrote, \\"...Clergy aguse of power and sex occur with alarming frequency in all faith groups...I hope and pray this book will help prevent more abuses.\\" The cover of this book features an original drawing by Doris Lubell which starkly illustrates the subject of the book. It should be displayed by Amazon.com"},{"Title":"Just One Night","review":"Roarke Sullivan, mine owner and mayor of the small, rural town of Garden, Virginia, is determined to provide good, timely health care for the citizens of the town. He's convinced the town council to join the Rural Doctor Program, in which the town pays for the education of a medical school student with the understanding that the doctor will work in the town for a year after receiving his or her M.D. The doctor in question is Dr. Honey Calabrese, native New Yorker and Emergency Room physician at Bellevue Hospital. Although she was the \\"back-up\\" choice, Dr. Calabrese is reluctantly filling her obligation to Garden, because her predecessor seemed to have been more interested in his golf handicap than the health of the people of Garden. Luckily, she seems to get along well with her patients - all except for Roarke Sullivan, who seems to be at odds with her at every turn.This is a really fun and emotionally involving contemporary romance. The plot is simple. It is the characters, with their complex personalities and motivations, that make the story interesting. The hero and heroine are realistically drawn, and act like you or I would in the same situation. Their problems are not artificial, but problems that could occur to any of us. In addition, the secondary characters are fully fleshed out and come across to the reader as real people, and their interactions motivate the story as well. The story's setting is also carefully presented, as the author lovingly describes the fictional town of Garden, accurately capturing the ambiance of rural Southwestern Virginia. The few love scenes between the hero and heroine are not quite sensual and not at all graphic, but are very emotionally engaging and loving. I enjoyed reading this novel very much, and recommend it wholeheartedly. -- Jean, Fallen Angel Reviews (courtesy of Fallen Angel Reviews)"},{"Title":"Fortune in Your Cookies","review":"What a fun read. Investment wisdom mixed into a blend of cooking recipes and stories that cover many practical aspects of life. If you enjoy eating, reading and a few good chuckles, this book will also give you some new insights into the financial side of life that many of us find so confusing."},{"Title":"Fortune in Your Cookies","review":"What would you say if I told you that there is an awesome book available that not only gives you best financial advise as well as some super easy recipes for the most discriminating palate? Well, there is. Titled FORTUNE IN YOUR COOKIES Finding Financial Wisdom In Everyday Eating by Meena Cheng who is from the Seattle area. The small fortune cookie on the cover has the following written on the small piece of paper inside \\"Eat and be wealthy\\".Fact is this is one of those books that energized me as well as made me wish it had been around 15 years ago before my husband was disabled by a drunk driver. Oh well.... But in light of the Enron debacle and other downsizing going on it is a book I believe every person and couple under the age of fifty should read.Shy two hundred pages there is no wasted space and every page is full of usable and in my opinion, overlooked wisdom that if applied starting this week, will reap benefits both financially as well as in a less stressful lifestyle.The Chapters are as follows (I have * the ones that I found the most helpful for my life, personally.1. Cherries Jubilee or Cherry Strudel~ What is it that you dream for?2. Million Dollar Beef Stew~ Turning Pennies Into Dollars*3. The Great Tipster~ Pay Yourself First*4. Try a Sushi~ Staying Out Of Debt *5. The Waste Of Crawfish~ How to Minimize Income Taxes6. Balance and Simplicity~ Invest Wisely and Simply *7. Opps! I Burned the Eggs~ Protect Your Family from Financial Catastrophe*8. An Unusual Dish, An Unusual Time~ Gifting and Estate Planning9. I Want a Bigger Piece of the Pie~ Looking Out For Yourself in a Divorce SettlementNow I believe that anyone with young kids at home should read Chapter 7. I even wish that a friend who perished in the Pennsylvania terrorist plane crash Sept 11th had had this book since you never know what horrid thing will happen these days, leaving your spouse and children in financial straights and needing to grovel for pennies from strangers and charities. And I am a big believer in being prepared. And thankfully the authors discuses the hard issues like life insurance.I also like Chapter 4 and how the reader can start today to get and stay out of debt. This has been one of the biggest gifts we have received since adhering to a more Zen or what is called a voluntary simplicity lifestyle. NO.... not a do without and wear sack clothe and ashes. But more of a lifestyle that is all about being in the moment and savoring each new day, each new meal, and our home environments.There is also a recipe at the end of each chapter. Why? Because the food has been a jumping off point in the illustrations where she teaches the reader about money. For instance Chapter 7 is about a young father and chef who has the author over for a meal and during the preparation of the Bruschetta with Goat Cheese, Tomato and Basil they discuss the \\"what ifs\\" and he being so uncomfortable discussing the sadness of his wife and kids being left without him, discovers that there is life in being prepared. That it need not bust the family budget to prepare for the worst while hoping for the best.In Chapter 6 on investing simply but wisely I felt like I could almost taste the green tea ice cream and the prawns (even though I am a vegetarian). Having lived in the Seattle area I still savour a bowl of simple steamed cherry stone clams and a bowl of melted butter to dip them in. And I guess this is another reason why I liked the book.The author really does understand life's foundation and that good food and finances like a simple clean home and a good bed and good sleep all work together. I liked the way she made me, the reader visualize the ferry boat ride over to her friends place or the drive across town for the fresh baked bread to take to her relatives as a complement to the beef stew. I could almost hear the chop stick clicking and see the vibrant colours of the fresh sushi as she had these wonderful, informative conversations about something as \\"bland\\" as money management and investment. By books end the idea of financial management was no longer bland but was actually interesting.I soon realized that she had taught me in less than two hundred pages what my favorite vegetarian and bread baking authors had taught me about those passions. That one needs to look at the fun of the adventure and realize that using ones money wisely is not different from choosing a wise backpacking trek and being prepared.My husband and our son and his wife are now devouring the book, which is as much for men as it is for women. No sexist nonsense in this book. And even though Chapter 9. I Want a Bigger Piece of the Pie~ Looking Out For Yourself in a Divorce Settlement involves a young stay at home mother I think every male-man-husband-father-single guy should read it. As the mother of a son I am more apt to worry about the men in a divorce, since there is some cockeyed idea that they don't hurt, grieve, suffer during and after divorce.Move over Suze Orman there is a new kid on the block. This is now my #1 favorite book on personal money management.Oh and for my simply living buddies...Please.... invest in this book for your local library!Yep. Chocolat meets Wall Street......."},{"Title":"Fortune in Your Cookies","review":"Once again, as was the situation when I began to read a few other books recently, I had no idea what to expect. The title intrigued me. Also, I was curious to learn how I could find \\"financial wisdom in everyday eating.\\" Having now read Cheng's book, I recommend it highly to anyone who fits in any one of the following categories:1. Those who have no financial plan2. Those who do not understand compound interest3. Those who are unwilling and/or unable to save money on a consistent basis4. Those who are unwilling and/or unable to live within their means5. Those who have become hostage to credit card debt6. Those who do not take full advantage of a 401 (k) account7. Those who lack an appropriate strategy for their investments8. Those who either do not have a will or have a will which is no longer current with applicable federal and/or state tax code provisions9. Those who have not provided for (or even considered) (a) a Living Will, (b) a living trust, (c) \\"joint ownership with rights of property,\\" (d) a 529 plan, (e) long-term care insurance, or (f) all of the above10. Those who are about to begin a divorce processWhat we have here is a short book which is long on potential value, presented as a series of conversations by the narrator (\\"Skye\\") with fictional persons, based on the author's extensive experience with real people who fit in one or more of the ten aforementioned categories. Moreover, Cheng invokes a series of food metaphors and analogies to illustrate basic principles of \\"financial wisdom.\\" She also includes a series of recipes but a reader need have little (if any) interest in food preparation and still find this book entertaining as well as informative. It is NOT a \\"how to do it\\" manual on wealth accumulation nor on financial or estate planning. I would characterize it as a series of skillfully presented \\"heads up.\\"After reading this book, many will need to seek professional assistance (e.g. writing or re-writing an appropriate will) after checking out other sources for information and counsel which Cheng does not provide in her book. Based on the results of my own \\"homework,\\" I can personally recommend Suze Orman's The 9 Steps to Financial Freedom: Practical & Spiritual Steps So You Can Stop Worrying and Reiser and DiColo's WealthBuilding: Investment Strategies for Retirement & Estate Planning. Both are available from Amazon.com in a paperback edition and both can help their reader select those best qualified to help with various financial and legal decisions and initiatives. One final point: If Cheng's reader is motivated to pursue such information and guidance, and then professional assistance, her book will have achieved its primary objective."},{"Title":"Fortune in Your Cookies","review":"If you are hungry for &quot;Gourmet Financial Advice&quot;...then feast your eyes on the clever financial cookbook &quot;Fortune in your Cookies&quot;.

She compares the concept to her cousin's beef stew, and includes the recipe at the end of the chapter. I found myself reading this chapter out loud to my husband, the financial wizard, who wasextremely impressed with it.He was even more impressed with the stew, which I made for him one evening with a loaf of crusty homemade bread. Sublime on a mid-winter evening! In the next few days as I tried other recipes, he'd tease, \\"and which financial concept are we learning tonight?\\"Another example: In the chapter called \\"The Waste of Crawfish,\\"Cheng, as Skye, explains to her Louisiana-native friend Jacqueline how eating crawfish is like one's paycheck -- to get at the succulent meat, you've got to pinch off the head, which is almost as long as the body, and suck the meat out of the tail. So, out of five pounds of crawfish, there's very little left that you can actually eat once you get rid of those shells. From there, Skye goes on to tell her friend how she could keep more of her paycheck if she invested some of it in a 401(k), and she gives the breakdown of how much she would save in taxes. Then she follows this up with an absolutely killer gumbo recipe.Like Who Moved My Cheese?, Fortune In Your Cookies is profoundin its simplicity. And it's a practical gift for that person you know who is recently divorced and trying to rear children on one income, struggling under a mountain of credit card debt, or trying a bit late in the game to save money for retirement. Whoamong us doesn't know someone who is facing these challenges?The book is ostensibly geared toward women, but the concepts are universal.The very best thing about this book, in my opinion, is its message of hope. It's a feel-good affirmation that no financial situation is so bleak you can't rectify it with determination and common sense.The only thing the book lacks, oddly, is a cookie recipe."},{"Title":"Fortune in Your Cookies","review":"'Life is a banquet, and most poor suckers are starving to death' is a line from 'Auntie Mame.' Good food and good financial planning can help one live life to its fullest. In 'Fortune in Your Cookies,' Meena Cheng combines her expertise in both areas to create an entertaining primer on investments, tax matters, wills, ways to save, and much more, with recipes for delicious dishes. Her use of food metaphors for teaching time-tested principles of money management are quite apt, such as the one about crayfish. Anyone who has tried to make a meal out of crayfish can relate to the notion of how many days out of a year one must work just to pay Uncle Sam. Like the memory of an enjoyable meal with family and friends, the excellent advice in this entertaining book stays with you for a long time."},{"Title":"Fortune in Your Cookies","review":"Meena Cheng's excellent book is a must read for any woman (or man)not too sure about financial planning and really fuzzy about all that compound interest stuff. Ms. Cheng takes the reader along on fictional dinners (one of which is a gourmand's delight)and uses food to illuminate the principles involved in sound financial planning. This is such a fresh and charming approach, you will learn a lot and finish the book before you're quite ready to let the narrator &quot;Skye&quot; out of your head--but that's in the best tradition of writing, too. I have already recommended this book to seven of my close friends. I'll make you the eighth!"},{"Title":"Fortune in Your Cookies","review":"Meena Cheng has a winner here! The nine recipes in the book are genuinely good and appropriate: Cherries Jubilee; Million Dollar Beef Stew; Beginner's Sushi; Fiery Gumbo; Prawn Stir Fry; Bruschetta with Goat Cheese, Tomato and Basil; Linguine with Garlic and Anchovies; and Apple Pie (two recipes: one for the crust and one for the filling.)Stirred in with the recipes is sound financial advice, because Cheng is a certified financial planner and CPA. She dispenses advice on saving (&quot;Pay yourself first&quot;), how to use time to amass wealth through compound interest, the importance of life insurance for your family's benefit, and other good financial advice.One of her best pieces of advice came early in the book, when she says in the introduction, &quot;But, more importantly, it takes sensibility to recognize that no amount of money or food will bring about peace, joy and satisfaction if we fail to recognize that by themselves, they are only a means to an end.&quot;This is an entertaining book full of good advice and good recipes, both of which should contribute to a happier life if they are followed closely.Joseph Pierre"},{"Title":"Fortune in Your Cookies","review":"For a person who does not know too much about finance in general (myself), I found this book to be very helpful when it came to understanding all of the ins and outs of various financial topics.

Initially, I was reluctant to read this novel---from its outward appearance, it closely resembles a romance novel. Indeed, there is romance, but the overriding theme is the political message which the reader cannot help but relate to what is happening in (to) our country today. I intend to buy more copies and distribute them to my friends....."},{"Title":"Ceremony of the Innocent","review":"especially to any young girl for more than the reading pleasure, which will keep her pressed to the pages, as she follows Ellen Watson, but for an understanding of structural American hisory, and politics. In a unique romantic novel, Taylor Caldwell, draws you intimately closer to Ellen and, therefore, America. With an affection towards her success from her youth through the developing years into maturity and her impending destruction, you will be led into a true understanding and respect for our country.Interesting as government and politics are to me, MOST literature on the subjects are intensely boring and do not flow well. Romance novels are horrifying to me, filled with the tiniest details of someone else's limiting imagination. This book captured me WITH the romantic story and surprised me with its analogical parallel to our United States, government, and politics."},{"Title":"Ceremony of the Innocent","review":"To the conspiracy addicts, it a great book. She minces no words. She comes right out with it, from the hip and, especially, from the heart. To the romance set, she is superb. Delicately bringing man and God together, where they should have been all along.A truly fine book. One I will always cherish. She has grave concerns about our country. She has in depth insight into human nature and, above all, she places God where He belongs: in all human endeavors."},{"Title":"Ceremony of the Innocent","review":"Art is in the eye of the beholder. While some may have failed to see the \\"message\\" in this book, I think that this story tells more about human nature, and its dark side, as well as giving great insight into who is really calling the shots in the destruction of America, than any book that I have ever read. The \\"innocence\\" here, as epitomized by Ellen, is also symbolic of what Americans have become as a people.....apathetic, brainwashed, and unwilling or unable to believe that there are \\"elites\\" who would like nothing more than to control every facet of our lives by destoying the middle class, and bringing Communism/Socialism to this country. With the current political climate and the manipulation of our economy, the undermining of our morals,the brainwashing of our our youth, and the very good chance that we will soon be a socialistic country, this book is very timely."},{"Title":"Ceremony of the Innocent","review":"...actually isn't Ellen Porter, the main character, but is Maude Cummings, governess to Ellen's children. Always wise,composed and thoughtful, she is Ellen's unwavering ally, though she expects, and indeed receives, nothing but disdain and mistrust from Ellen in return. The fact that this only reinforces her determination to protect Ellen is proof of her her strong and generous spirit, which shines even more brightly than Ellen's innocence and beauty in the novel. I wish more of Maude had been written about.From seeing the reviews of others who have read the book, its obvious that it's a coin toss as to whether you will treasure it or throw it in the garbage when the last page is turned. It is true that Caldwell's political conspiracy theories and harsh opinion of human nature may make some declare the novel as the paranoid ravings of a hard and bitter woman. To them, I would suggest that perhaps they depend on more than just the nightly television news programs for their knowledge of what is happening in the world. As much as it may pain them to hear it, blindly accepting this truncated version of world's events coming to them in a neat little half hour package is just the kind of complacent attitude Caldwell confronts in her novel. \\"Bread and circuses.\\" Yes.If nothing else, read the story and admire Maude Cummings-Godfrey for the wonderful woman she is."},{"Title":"Ceremony of the Innocent","review":"A book containing some of the most lovable, hateful, complex, and narrow minded characters I have ever seen. It is the eye-opening tale of a changing country and a women named Ellen Watson - who's most beautiful characteristic is her worst and most dangerous enemy. A definite reccommend for anyone who is interested in Taylor Caldwell's books. As an avid reader, I find this story one of the most moving and memorable I've come to know -- one that will remain a favorite of mine for all time."},{"Title":"Ceremony of the Innocent","review":"i encountered this book not knowing much about taylor caldwell except she wrote a lot of books and not having any background knowledge of the text except smidgens from the reviews already posted. halfway through, i had to go back and read the reviews to say \\"what are those people talking about?\\" However, I did enjoy the book from first to last page. It starts off slow, but after about 10 chapters, the plot is a bit more interesting. Its a cycle of political commentary (which overall I am in awe of, wondering, how was Ms. Caldwell so aware) that eventually makes me think, get on with the juicy stuff of the book, well the narrative rather than the historical and philosophical. However, the mixture of text concerning the characters, the main one being Ellen, and an overview of the political station of the country at that time in the 20th century was quite enlightening. There is a lot to learn from this book, a sure history lesson, an inside look at Washington, DC and other political powerhouses of the early 20th century. The story centers around Ellen Porter, however, and the main question i held throughout the book was, \\"WHEN is someone going to slap her and tell her what's really going on in her life!??!\\" However the author does a splendid job of detailing the inner thoughts and motives of all the characters: Ellen, her husband, her second husband, her children, servants, \\"friends\\" and true friends, as well as everyone that comes in contact with her from her 13 years on. There are so many facets of character in this book, so many complex ideas and events, its hard to briefly review the text but overall, without giving away the details, the text will keep you enthralled and amazed at the human qualities we possess and how people relate to each other outwardly as well as in their own heads."},{"Title":"Ceremony of the Innocent","review":"This book is billed as a romance, a tragic love story about innocence betrayed. It is certainly that, but Caldwell's larger point is that of America as the young virginal heroine. Whether or not you agree with her politics, which sometimes veers towards the fringe, she is a force to be reckoned with as her research and historical knowledge are both impeccable. She has a detailed knowledge of many political events and behind the scenes discussions that shifted our country's (and hence the world's) destiny. Full disclosure --- many, many years ago, I had the rare opportunity to speak with her in Buffalo, and she was a brilliant woman without question, a true idealist. In fact, I believe she became such a fanatic because she had such dreams for humanity. Caldwell was definitely a woman on a mission, but one who, at the time, was definitely being shunned and therefore felt she could best speak through her novels. Obviously, her characters, particularly the female, are a bit of caricatures, and fall into the Madonna/Whore syndrome. Yet for her broader purposes, the metaphor of Ellen as America becomes an effective device, if a bit didactic. But I think Caldwell pulls it off. Her bitterness about the direction American politics and society was taking is loud and clear, and I think that is why she insists on such a brutal ending. However, there is another parallel here. Sadly, Taylor Caldwell herself was much like \\"Ellen\\", the main character, and at the end of her life she was abused and betrayed, and those closest to her were fighting for her money. Hers was a sad ending, especially for someone whose goals were so noble, even when misguided. I think she had a premonition of her ending, as she says on the Frontispiece -- this book, although a novel, details much of her life experiences. An interesting read for those who want an alternative discussion of history, other than the usual version."},{"Title":"Ceremony of the Innocent","review":"I loved this book! It was a pity of how Ellen's children despised her and at the end of the story and they wanted her to die. Ellen's children were terrible. I thought her children would poison her since they wanted her to die. but, Ellen took 25 sleeping pills to kill herself. And at the end of the story she was doing so well! But did Jeremy really love her? Everyone dies in this story, Aunt May, Walter, Jeremy's parents, Cuthburt, and Jeremy. Then on the last page Ellen dies. The only people I know that didn't die were Kitty, Ellen's kids, The Godfreys and Francis. This was an excellent book with so many surprises. It does start off slow, but in chapter 5 it gets better. I will absolutely read this book again. I am 13 and I understood this book. Encourage young people to read this book, it is very educational and teaches so much. I wish this book was a movie. I also wish Ellen was real. I will always keep this book! I was informed about this book because I read a biography about my favorite singer Stevie Nicks. She said it was her favorite book, so I read it. It became my favorite also!"},{"Title":"Ceremony of the Innocent","review":"This novel kind of drove me nuts. Ellen's complete innocence, her complete lack of self-esteem &amp; lack of any sense of how to protect herself, made me want to kick her. Taylor Caldwell could write so well but some of her books' elements (plot twists) fall into the category of soap opera, and unfortunately this is one of her worst. It tried so hard to be serious &amp; full of warnings, trying to hammer home the message, so that it basically imploded on itself. I couldn't feel any sadness for Ellen; I was too busy wishing she'd get a backbone. Of course if she'd had a backbone there would have been no story, but let me say it was a chore to get through this one."},{"Title":"Ceremony of the Innocent","review":"I think this is the worst book I have ever read to completion. The characters were all one- dimensional. The author's &quot;politics&quot; (as touted in the book) borders on the paranoid schizophrenic. Her use of foreshadowing is so heavy-handed, I was glad when the character finally died so Ms. Caldwell could stop foreshadowing it. None of the characters seem capable of learning from experience. A more detestable cast would be hard to imagine. I truely loathed this book."},{"Title":"Ceremony of the Innocent","review":"I read this book back in 1978, when I was fifteen. I wish I could read myself of that horrible memory, but I can't.This book is one long, self-pitying rant. The paranoia, persecution mania, and grandiosity in this book would make a specialist in abnormal psychology blanch; the self-pity and preening victimization (\\"Oh, poor me\\") would make the most self-pitying adolescent throw up.There is no artistry in this book; instead of allowing the reader to discover the characters and message on his own, Caldwell has her characters tell us (ENDLESSLY!) how we should feel. Rather than allowing her victimized main character to show some complexity or her victimizing supporting characters to display some humanity, she presents them as cardboard cutouts--chess pieces to be manipulated (unsubtly and crudely) across an explicitly-diagrammed chessboard.Caldwell says that the book reflects her own life experiences. But she can't render those hurtful experiences in a complex or meaningful way; instead, she just screams \\"Poor me\\" over and over into the reader is sickened, and moans about how hateful the world is until the reader comes to an obvious conclusion: The evil that Caldwell condemns comes not from the world around her, but from within herself.I have truly never read a more hate-filled, self-important book in my entire life. Indeed, reading it ranks as one of the most unpleasant experiences in my entire life.

Drawing on William Moulton Marston's original Wonder Woman stories, Messner-Loeb's has crafted a feminist tale this is an homage to the original and features familiar characters such as Etta Candy and Steve Trevor. This graphic novel is published in a slightly oversized edition (8&quot; x 11&quot;) to accommodate Phil Winslade's atmospheric drawings which recall wood engravings and are beautifully embellished by Patricia Mulvhill's subtle use of color.

It takes place in London around the time of Tarzan and has a lot of interesting parallels. This Wonder Woman is submissive until the end. The art is pretty good, though Phi used too many black lines on the faces. It was also sad to see Steve Trevor, the noble character of the comics, turn out to be a most heinous villain."},{"Title":"Wonder Woman: Amazonia","review":"this is probably the most disappointing comic/graphic novel i can recall. the art is terrific, which drew me to the book, but that makes the frustration with the story even more pronounced.Misogony is considered bad in most democratic society.

I recognized Smith's name from \`Poetry' so I went past the title of this collection to see if it would surpass my inhibitions. Based on the poems in this collection, I think he could write a wonderful poem about dirty laundry. I have to confess to reading more fiction than poetry on average, though I'm slowly correcting this.Favorite poems in here- Beautyworks- curls to recapitulation, Beds- a list poem, but an excellent ode to beds, and As For Trees, variation on a list of trees. Reading through the collection again, I could select so many as favorites.Many times when I read a poetry collection, I will flip through and read a few random poems, but Smith's collection is so readable and his voice so strong like in Fistfight, each poem is worth your attention. Almost a stream (of consciousness) that flows so well, I would follow it over a waterfall, if he kept writing. They move like Of This I Speak to No One, drawing you in close, putting an arm around your shoulder telling you something in an intimate, confessional manner.This is easily one of my favorite books of poetry in the past year. It bears comparison with Jane Hirshfield,"},{"Title":"Heroin: And Other Poems","review":"Heroin is Charlie Smith's fifth book of poetry and it falls somewhere in the middle in terms of quality. There is a maturity here not present in earlier works, but the forced quality of the previous Before and After shows itself every now and then. Fortunately for us, the majority of Heroin is not glaringly autobiographical. Unfortunately, the narrative style of Smith's poetry seems to be slipping away. Standouts in this volume include &quot;Beds&quot;, &quot;Flowers of Manhattan&quot;, and &quot;As for Trees&quot;. Respectively, these poems list all the different types of beds, flowers, and trees. But there is a music to them and a poignancy that pulls us out of that everyday fog we live in and makes us think of these things we wander by everyday. There is a sense of the disregarded here and an opening of that door. Several of the other more narrative poems work, but not in the same lyrical way as the non. Perhaps Mr. Smith has discovered his true forte is the novel. While the narrative poem might now feel forced, the poetic novel stands high overhead the sub-literary glop of the grocery store novel. And in today's market of glop disguised as lit, it is refreshing to know that someone out there is at least trying. Heroin falls way short of genius, but offers up enough promise to keep one hoping."},{"Title":"The Merry Wives of Windsor (Folger Library General Reader's Shakespeare)","review":"I certainly don't agree with many of the reviews of this play. To me it is one of Shakespeare's funniest. I truly enjoyed it. One of my favourite Shakespearean characters is Falstaff, and he appears in a number of Shakespeare's comedies. He makes an appearance in this one, and he is wonderful. The scene of this play is in Windsor, England. The play follows the merry wives in their interactions with their husbands and with their families and servants. This play is unique too, because we see Falstaff in love in this one. This may be one of Shakespeare's lesser known comedies, but it should be read and enjoyed. Don't let some of these reviews stop you from the sheer enjoyment of this play."},{"Title":"The Merry Wives of Windsor (Folger Library General Reader's Shakespeare)","review":"Book Report The Merry Wives of Windsor The Merry Wives of Windsor is loved by many people in the world because of the plentiful expressions, skillful characters' description and the natural laughable. It is not only a common comedy, but also a signpost from that we can see many things of the Elizabethan age when the author-William Shakespeare- lived. And this is one of the few works that he composed by himself, in other words, there are no any source to create it. The reason of coming into existence about this is unique and interesting. When Queen Elizabeth watched one of his historical plays (Henry the fourth), she was very pleased with John Falstaff in the play, then she ordered Shakespeare that he would make John be a hero and have him love in another play. It is said that the beginning of the story. There are lots of characters in the play as the other Shakespeare's works. The whole content is, Sir John Falstaff falls in love with Mistress Ford and Mistress Page, but the two mistresses make plan of ill-treating to him to refuse his love and to show their faithful and virtuous hearts to their husbands. Meanwhile, Fenton(a young gentleman), Slender(a country justice's kinsman) and Doctor Caius(a French physician) are all in love with Anne(daughter of Page and Mistress Page), and they think for wining her love respectively. At the end of the story, after Mr. and Mrs. Ford, Mr. and Mrs. Page and others make plans and ill-treat to Falstaff in the woods, all of them get reconciled with, while Anne Page get married with Fenton, and come to an end with joy. Besides them, some people who have strong personalities appear on the stage. For example, Mistress Quickly(Caius' servant) has a ready wit but a little stupid, or Sir Hugh Evans(a Welsh parson) who always speaks in rural accent but it makes us fanny and he plays an active part at the end of this play. We could see Shakespeare's genius in this play for there has many puns and unique accent which used by Hugh Evans. And it bring more cheerful mood to the play and laugh to the audience. Shakespeare described many men who is jealous of their wives or lovers in his works, and one of them is Mr. Ford who appears in this play. He has faith in his wife's affair and it brings some troubles. When this work was written, a woman generally could not get married to a man if he was not permitted by her father. However the times went by, many Pulitans came to insist that men and women could get married only when they loved each other. Fenton has also the pulitanical view for marriage. It was a new thought and I think Anne Page was attracted to his such way of thinking as well as his other good points. Also at that time in England, there was a tendency for every people to criticize about things which were against the social morals through passages of caricatures. For example, it was a fashion of the time for women to wear trousers but people criticized it, or they criticized for jealousy and affairs. In this play, John Falstaff is ill-treated by everyone and has a terrible experiences, and that's because he is immoral and unfair. Like these, this comedy has several points, and we can see the cultural features of the Shakespeare's period. Although I have ever read his works, I thought this one was very interesting and I came to like it the best. The character's personalities are made full use and I could see the author's abilities from that, too. The mistresses play active parts and they are very cheerful, livery and merry just as the title is. I think it made the audience(especially women) enjoy to watch, and the merriness of this play has been one of the most big reasons to attract people even nowadays."},{"Title":"The Merry Wives of Windsor (Folger Library General Reader's Shakespeare)","review":"Legend has it that the Queen herself commissioned the writing of this play, saying she wished to see a comedy in which Falstaff, her favorite character from the histories, falls in love. Shakespeare, naturally, did a masterful job, crafting not only a comedy with plenty of belly laughs in it (literally), but also a play about women in power for the ultimate woman in power.I saw this play performed recently and it brought home to me how much it really is about the character of Mrs. Hood. She is written to be a sexually powerful, or powerfully sexual, character. Powerful enough to justify her husband's jealousy despite her trustworthiness -- for if we are to receive him as one of the \\"good guys\\", we must be able to sympathize with him. Powerful enough to justify Falstaff's return again and again. He is a fool, but a lovable fool, so again we need to be able to sympathize.This is not Britney Spears sexuality. This is Mae West/Marilyn Monroe sexuality. The kind where she could be doing the most vulgar thing -- eating a cheeseburger, for instance -- and the men around her are still aroused. And she is in full control of it, even as it causes chaos in the men around her. If an actress can bring this to the role, this play sings, it swings, it sparkles and flies. If this is missing, if she is simply a normal woman, the counterpart of Mrs. Whatever, the jokes are strained, the pacing slow and the whole thing feels a bit washed up."},{"Title":"The Merry Wives of Windsor (Folger Library General Reader's Shakespeare)","review":"When rating Shakespeare, I am rating it against other Shakespeare; otherwise, the consistent 4-5 stars wouldn't tell you much. So if you want to know how this book rates against the general selection of books in the world, I suppose it might rate four stars; it certainly rates three. The language, as usual in Shakespeare, is beautiful. Still, it's far from Shakespeare's best.For one thing, this is one of those cases, not uncommon in Shakespeare's comedies, in which the play has suffered a great deal by the changes in the language since Shakespeare's time; it loses a great deal of the humor inherent in a play when the reader needs to keep checking the footnotes to see what's happening, and this play, particularly the first half of it, virtually can't be read without constant reference to the notes; even with them, there's frequently a question as to what's being said. At least in the edition that I read (the Dover Thrift edition) the notes frequently admit that there's some question as to the meaning of the lines, and there is mention of different changes in them in different folios.But beyond this, as an overweight, balding, middle-aged libertine, I object to the concept that Falstaff is ridiculous just because he is in fact unwilling to concede that it is impossible that a woman could want him. Granted, he's NOT particularly attractive, but that has more to do with his greed, his callousness, and his perfect willingness to use people for his own ends, to say nothing of his utter lack of subtlety.Is it truly so funny that an older, overweight man might attempt to find a dalliance? So funny that the very fact that he does so leaves him open to being played for the fool? Remember, it isn't as though he refused to take &quot;no&quot; for an answer; he never GOT a &quot;no&quot;. He was consistently led on, only to be tormented for his audacity. Nor is he making passes at a nubile young girl; the target of his amorous approaches is clearly herself middle-aged; after all, she is the MOTHER of a nubile young marriageable girl. And given the fact that she is married to an obnoxious, possessive, bullying and suspicious husband, it is not at all unreasonable for Falstaff to think that she might be unhappy enough in her marriage to accept a dalliance with someone else.If laughing at fat old men who have the audacity not to spend the last twenty years of their lives with sufficient dignity to make it seem as if they were dead already is your idea of a good time, you should love this play.

But, unlike some of Shakespeare's less popular plays, Merry Wives is performed frequently in Shakespeare festivals across the land.You really have to see this play to understand how well it works on the stage. Played by an energetic cast it is hilarious situation comedy and easily understandable by people unfamiliar with Shakespeare. When Falstaff says at the end, with deadpan delivery, \\"I do begin to perceive that I am made an ass,\\" it brings down the house. Just reading the play in your living room, you will probably miss much of the humor.Shakespeare was a man of the theater. He wrote for production, with little thought given to publication in his lifetime. You have to see his plays performed to get a measure of his theatrical genius."},{"Title":"The Merry Wives of Windsor (Folger Library General Reader's Shakespeare)","review":"Allright. Maybe as far as the comedies go, I was spoiled by the exquisite comical masterpiece &quot;The Comedy of Errors.&quot; But this is without a doubt my 2nd favorite comedy. I can not help but simultaneously laugh and feel sorry for poor Ford when he suspects his wife is interested in Falstaff and goes into his jealous rages. One scene I could not forget if I tried is when Ford feels bad for suspecting his wife, is humiliated in front of everyone, and apologizes.Only a bit later he finds his wife was with Falstaff and she has another arranged meeting with him! But this is only a small part of the many laughs that await. Shakespeare only had a few days to write this play, but this shows that even under pressure he wrote great!"},{"Title":"The Merry Wives of Windsor (Folger Library General Reader's Shakespeare)","review":"i've just finished reading/watching all of shakespeare's comedies and mww is one of the funnier ones. it is a lighthearted look at marital jealousy and features one of shakespeare's great fools, falstaff (of henry iv fame). the out-and-out funniest shakepearean play is still &quot;taming of the shrew&quot;, imho, but mwv runs well ahead of the laggards, and certainly well ahead of such better known plays as &quot;twelfth night&quot; and &quot;as you like it&quot;."},{"Title":"The Merry Wives of Windsor (Folger Library General Reader's Shakespeare)","review":"This is definitely Shakespeare's funniest play. This play doesn't have the great quotes or great drama or great romance or any great meaning, but it is just simply hilarious. Sir John Falstaff is one of the greatest comedic characters in all of literature and does not disappoint in this play.'The Merchant of Venice' is great if you are looking for a 'Comedy' with meaning and social significance, but if you simply want to laugh your butt off you have to read 'The Merry Wives of Windsor'."},{"Title":"The Merry Wives of Windsor (Folger Library General Reader's Shakespeare)","review":"Among critics, this is arguably their least favorite of Shakespeare's plays but with audiences it is a perennial favorite. Also, Giuseppe Verdi chose it as the basis of his very last opera, Falstaff. So there must be something in it.Sir John Falstaff, the lovable rogue from The Henriad cycle of plays, needs money and he intends to get it from a rich wife. Just to be sure he gets something, he attempts to woo two women rather than just one. Never mind that both women are already married; this is not a problem for the shameless Sir John. He sends love letters to both women but puts them in the wrong envelopes, so that each gets the one meant for the other. OK, these middle aged women might be a little starved for affection from their husbands but they aren't stupid and they would have seen through Falstaff's ruse anyway.His mistake however does give them the chance to have a little fun at his expense. Falstaff appears at one woman's home to press his suit. Her husband arrives unexpectedly, and Falstaff hides in a basket that is then carried out. It's a bit heavy...Falstaff and his ridiculous plan provides the comic situation, the confusion that ensues provides the slapstick, foreigners with Welsh and French accents provide ethnic humor. And in the end, Falstaff receives a well deserved lesson.There is nothing wrong with this play, it's a very good, very funny comedy and as close to pure comedy as Shakespeare gets with the exception of The Comedy Of Errors. So why don't critics like it? Probably because they expect more from Falstaff. He fears getting caught by the husband but that does not keep him from courting his wife. He offers no catechism in this play about the evils of adultery or of the dark side of love, unlike in Henry IV Part One where he cautions the audience against how honor in war leads to injury or death. The fat man in this play offers us a barrel of laughs but no wisdom at all.Vincent Poirier, Tokyo"},{"Title":"The Merry Wives of Windsor (Folger Library General Reader's Shakespeare)","review":"\\"Merry Wives\\" is generally loathed by scholars, and loved by audiences. The reason is not hard to detect. It is a non-serious and very funny play. Shakespeare wrote low comedy farce. GASP!First off, the 3 star rating means as compared to other works of Shakespeare. I don't feel it fair to compare him to other writers. For the other writer's sake!\\"Merry Wives\\" is a fast paced romp that would be much better to see than to read. The first act of this play frustrated me as reading no Shakespeare has done before. The play is his only comedy set in (Shakespeare's) modern day, and in England. As a result it abounds with archaic English colloquialisms and regionalisms that mean nothing to the modern American reader. You will have to look at the explanatory notes often while reading this play. The reader's frustration will be added to by the inclusion of a French character, complete with accent, a Welsh parson, also with accent, and a servant lady who speaks with malapropos and misunderstandings most of the time.If you can get over that hurdle, you will find the play picks up steam and humor in the last three acts, and there are some truly comic, and often vulgar, moments. The groundlings must have howled with delight at this play.Many critics hate this play because they say the Falstaff of \\"Merry Wives' is a shadow of the character Shakespeare created for the Henry Four plays. He is. But I guess my question is, so what? Shakespeare created Falstaff and he can use him however he sees fit. To me it seems a minor quibble, and I am not sure I understand the passion it engenders in some people.Take \\"The Merry Wives of Windsor\\" for what it is, a lighthearted farce, meant as a diversion for its viewers, and leave all the academic baggage at home. You will be glad you did.As for the Pelican Shakespeare series, they are my favorite editions as the scholarly research is usually top notch and the editions themselves look good as an aesthetic unit. It looks and feels like a play and this compliments the text's contents admirably. The Pelican series was recently reedited and has the latest scholarship on Shakespeare and his time period. Well priced and well worth it."},{"Title":"The Merry Wives of Windsor (Folger Library General Reader's Shakespeare)","review":"a horribly produced paperback- low quality coarse paper, difficult to open, note presentation muddled. Use only in an emergency, then throw out. Postage expensive."},{"Title":"The Merry Wives of Windsor (Folger Library General Reader's Shakespeare)","review":"Mistress Ford and Mistress Page are be badgered by the lecherous Falstaff, how to arrange a happy ending? As the husband of the object of Falstaff's passion disguises himself as a servant to divine the plans of the villain, the ladies defend their honor by inviting the advances of Falstaff.This is the Bard's comedy on a good day. Despite the challenges of the original language, I chuckled my way through this story/script. In the end, Falstaff got what he deserve (no sexy time with the good ladies and several beatings), the ladies' honor was preserved, and their husbands saw the highest qualities of their wives.I loved it, and recommend it highly. I just wish this one would be put on stage more often.E.M. Van Court"},{"Title":"The Merry Wives of Windsor (Folger Library General Reader's Shakespeare)","review":"As many of you know, the crooked but comical and likable Falstaff has a moderate role in 1 \\"Henry IV\\" and a major role in 2 \\"Henry IV.\\" Even though his death is mentioned in \\"Henry V,\\" Shakespeare brings him back for this play. (Also back are Bardolph, Pistol, and Nym.) Some scholars such as Asimov feel that this Falstaff: \\"...bears no resemblance to the Falstaff of the \\"Henry IV\\" plays.\\" Well, Asimov was right, but Shakespeare was trying to do something very difficult. (Recreating an artistic moment. It may not be impossible, but it is not far from it either.)Well, onto the play. Shakespeare cleverly combines 2 plots. Anne Page is a young girl whose parents want her to marry someone other than Fenton (whom she loves). But Shakespeare adds a new twist. Her parents are not in agreement here. Her father wants her to marry the nice enough slender, while her mother wants her to marry the eccentric Dt. Caius. (So the Romeo, Juliet, Paris triangle isn't exactly repeated.)Moving on, Falstaff enters, and he intends to woo Anne's mother and Page's wife not out of love, but in hopes of increasing his fortunes. Well, even Falstaff's friends Pistol and Nym are repulsed by this and Pistol warns Ford, while Nym warns Page. While we may see the adult Pages as the 'wicked parents' who wants Anne to marry someone other than whom she loves, Shakespeare expands their characters by having mutual love and trust. (A great marriage! The not so bright Othello could have learned from Mr. Page!) So, we can see that the Page marriage is happy and successful.On the other hand, Ford is not so sure of his wife to say the least. He plans to disguise himself and encourage Falstaff to go ahead. (So he can catch Falstaff and his wife in the act.) Lady Ford has plans of her own though. We know that Lady Ford and Lady Anne are trying to teach Falstaff a lesson so to speak, and we can only imagine what is going through poor Ford's mind when Falstaff reveals his plans to woo Lady Ford AND Lady Page. Ford goes through some comical jealous rages, but unlike the so called 'noble' Othello, Ford DOES NOT lay an abusive hand on his wife, and it is hard for us to not feel at least a little sorry for Ford. (We can only imagine his frustrations when he feels bad and thinks he was wrong about his wife, only to realize that his wife has another scheduled meeting with Falstaff!)Well, keeping with the comedy, no one really gets hurt, and Ford is willing to admit he was wrong about his wife. Now it does seem after all the humiliating events Falstaff went through (such as being thrown in a river and being beaten) Falstaff would have learned by now. But such is comedy. The Pages and fords decide to subject Falstaff to one more practical joke.And of course there is the matter of who Anne will marry. (Fenton whom she loves, Slender whom her father loves, and Dr. Caius whom her mother loves.) In a bit of \\"Midsummer Night's Dream\\" nostalgia, Falstaff suffers one final slapstick moment, but all is resolved, and young love triumphs. And in the often found theme of reconciliation, all of the characters (including Falstaff) enjoy a happy gathering."},{"Title":"Astrology Anyone?","review":"Astrology Anyone? isn't your usual in-depth guide to astrology, but a bare-bones beginner's handbook which provides newcomers to the topic with an introduction to birthstones, sun signs, planets and myths.

Co-edited by Wu-chu Liu and Irving Yucheng Lo. 631 pp. Bloomington &amp; London : Indiana University Press, 1975 and Reissued.In the present book, co-editors Wu-chu Liu, Professor of Chinese Language and Literature at Indiana University, and Irving Yucheng Lo, Professor and Chairman of the Department of East Asian Languages and Cultures at Indiana University, have assembled a collection of about one thousand Chinese poems in English translations.All of the poems were translated by specialists, checked by the editors against the Chinese originals, and criticized and discussed with the contributor before a final version was selected. We are told that &quot;the contributors are mostly East Asian specialists on the faculty of American and Canadian colleges and universities, or younger scholars who have received many years of graduate training in the language&quot; (p.ix).The editors also tell us that they have &quot;aimed, within the limitation of space, at inclusiveness by giving balanced representation to all major genres and periods and, within each, the chief exponents of major schools of Chinese poetry&quot; (p.ix) - no easy task when we consider that extant T'ang poetry alone runs to almost 49,000 poems by 2,300 poets. But all of the well-known names are here in annotated selections - T'ao Ch'ien, Han Shan, Wang Wei, Li Po, Tu Fu, Po Chu-yi, etc., - as well as many less familiar names.After a Preface, a brief but informative Introduction, a section of 'Explanations' which contains a handy list of abbreviations for their main sources (e.g., YSW Yi shih-wen), and a detailed 32-page Table of Contents, the main body of the book follows, chronologically ordered into six parts.One very useful feature of the book, for students who would like to consult the original Chinese texts, is that precise source references have been given for all poems (e.g., CTS, P.2476). Later, editors Liu and Lo did publish a Chinese-language edition of the present book which contained all of the original Chinese texts, but unfortunately I cannot remember the details.The book is rounded out with a detailed period-by-period Bibliography; an extremely useful 90 pages of 'Background on Poets and poems' which provides biographical information that can sometimes be a big help in undertanding some of the poems; two additional Appendices; and an Index of Authors. The book is 8vo in size (6.5 by 9.5 inches), well-printed in a clear, readable font on spacious pages of excellent paper, stitched, and bound in full cloth - in other words, a real book.What it gives us is a substantial collection, with a strong academic flavor, of Chinese poems in accurate translations by academic specialists. But, as everyone knows, specialists may be of two kinds. On the one hand there are brilliant scholar-translators of the caliber of Burton Watson, a few of whose translations are featured in the book; on the other hand there are translators who, though undoubtedly equally as sincere as Watson, are considerably less inspired.Unfortunately the book lacks an Index to its more than fifty contributors, and so it's hard to gage the relative proportions of these two very different kinds of contributors, but my impression is that, as is usually the case with such anthologies, there are somewhat more of the latter than the former.'Sunflower Splendor' is in many ways a useful and excellent book, and one appreciates the arduous labors that must have gone into it. Beginning students of Classical Chinese who are able to find the companion volume of Chinese texts will have in these two volumes a virtual library of Chinese poetry that should be enough to keep them happy for a long time."},{"Title":"Sunflower Splendor: Three Thousand Years of Chinese Poetry","review":"The translations in this book range from superb to awful. Most, by the editors, are simply mediocre. There are way too many translators (about 50) and minor poets included. Further, the editors make the puzzling decision to leave some poems out because they have already been translated many times. Why do this in a basic textbook-anthology, which will be the only book of Chinese poetry that many people read? See the Japanese counterpart in this series, FROM THE COUNTRY OF EIGHT ISLANDS, for an example of how a general anthology of poetry should be done.THE COLUMBIA BOOK OF EARLIER CHINESE POETRY is by far the best general collection of Chinese verse in its greatest period (earliest times-1300 AD)."},{"Title":"Sunflower Splendor: Three Thousand Years of Chinese Poetry","review":"This is the very best anthology of Chinese poetry, including some of t best poetry in the world.

During the sea voyage, the vessel's captain, Thor Wakefield takes a fancy to Storm and decides (after taking her virginity) that he'll keep her papers himself. Thor makes her his housekeeper/mistress at his South Carolina rice plantation 'Misty Rose'.The other reviewer loved this book. Hmmm. I didn't absolutely hate it, but I didn't love it either. The hero, Thor, has three strikes against him, in my view:a) his consistently-suspicious-of-Storm-for-no-reason attitude, which lasts nearly 2/3 through the story;b) his history of being unloved by his bitchy mother, which makes him suspicious of all women including the innocent heroine, an attitude which gets tiresome quickly, andc) he doesn't recognize the evil shennanigans of a certain subcharacter although as a reasonably intelligent man, he should have seen through that person much sooner.I will admit Thor makes a good grovel for forgiveness to Storm, and that not too shortly before the end. But (another strike) - using his possession of her beloved mother's Bible to coerce Storm into sex seemed pretty low behavior for any \\"hero\\", even in a 1980's romance novel.Also typical of 1980's romances, there is a fair amount of sexual pressure (sometimes called forced seduction) and actual violence, slapping, etc. committed against the heroine. I can sometimes overlook this when I read an older romance novel, yet here I couldn't. I will say that aside from falling into Thor's arms every time he approaches her, Storm is an intelligent character with a fair amount of spine, which keeps the story from sinking into a complete morass.I can also say most of the characters here are interestingly written, and the beginning of the book, with Storm in Newgate prison, is actually very good. But a series of too-coincidential, increasingly melodramatic circumstances weaken the story the further it progresses, and ultimately make this book no keeper. 2.75 stars."},{"Title":"Love Storm","review":"There's Something about this story that touches my heart!

Good idea, I should have thought of that!!They are NOT helpful in any way shape or form. I dont appreciate being reminded about my previous life experiences via these cards. Amazon should take them off their site so that people do not waste their money. And thats the truth.These cards would continue to make T Harv Eker a Millionaire but not You or I!

Our cards are up for bid."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Millionaire Mind Cards","review":"Another self-improvement expert I once read, (DENNIS WAITLY, if I remember correctly), in his book, \\"THE POWER OF WINNING\\", stated that it's important to have REPETITION of goodguidelines, in order to remember them. I guess that's truewith anything....good, bad, or indifferent. If there isn'tenough REPITITION of sayings, ideas, guidelines....you probablywon't remember them all that much. For instance, listening to a motivational speaker may put you on \\"cloud 9\\" for a few hours, and make you feel ambitious and eager to help both yourself and the rest of the world. But...if you don't have a tape or a book to re-listen or re-read the motivational speaker's words, most of them will be forgotten by the end of the week -- not to mention for the rest of your life.People these days are busy. Not only that -- but attention spans have evaporated to almost zero, thanks to the almost instantaneousness of movies, TV, and yes, even (at times), the Internet, as well. Look at the books and speeches of the 19th century, and compare them to todays' -- graceful circumlocution, (that means big words with great sentence structure), pervadesin the prose, say, of Lincoln and Poe....but not in today'swritten word. Compare, even, the writing in newspapers of the 19th century with today's. For better or worse, we moderns demand a simpler syntax, and more elementary writing.The book, 'SECRETS OF THE MILLIONAIRE MIND', by T. Harve Eker, is a slim, easy-to-digest volume. (It was also Number 1 on the best-seller lists of The New York Times, AND The Wall Street Journal, AND USA Today!! : ) But these cards, distilled from his book ,,by the same author, are even easier to understand -- and that is a great asset for us modern, sadly all-too-often \\"literarily-lazy\\" folk. Each card is a delightful, thoughful, and VERY succinct one or two sentence summary of a basic wealth-building principle. Most of them seem like just good common sense -- but how often are our own best instincts swayed, (and sometimes toppled!) by the negative attitudes of others? For instance, one of the cards reads:.......Rich people admire other successful peo9ple,.......poor people resent them. If you view wealthy.......people as bad in any way, you can never be rich,.......because how can you be something you don't liike?To which I add: for every J. Pierpoint Morgan, there is alsoa Robert Kennedy! It's hard to remember this, though, in a world of tabloid journalism, and paparazzi, which seem to delight in pulling down those who have \\"made it\\". One needsthese cards -- or other constant reminders of common sense,common courtesy, common decency, and all over positivity, in a world too filled with negativity and pessimism.One thing I am guilty of is believing that everyone knows everything better than I do. I've come, slowly, to suspect that this just may not be true -- there just might be some things I know better than a lot of people, (not many things...but a few.)One of Mr. Eker's cards, (which I just received today), seems to have been written just for me, (and others who think the way I do, in this instance):.......If you believe that you're 'not enough',.......you'll validate that believe and create.......the reality that you don't HAVE enough...............But if you believe that you're MORE.......than enough, you'll create more than.......enough in every part of your life. \\"Oh -- so THAT'S why I'm a shopaholic! (One reason, anyway.)True, I don't know everything...but I do know SOME things. Such aas....eat fruits, and vegetables, eat before 6:PM, eat and drink \\"volumizing\\" foods, (such as chocolate milk, instead of a chocolate bar), and keep a food diary. I've lost 30 pounds this way. I'm by no means an expert on the subject -- BUT I DON'T NEED ANY MORE DIET BOOKS, BECAUSE I ALREADY KNOW HOW TO LOSE WEIGHT...OR AT LEAST, HOW I CAN LOSE WEIGHT!So, Mr. Ekar's cards have already increased my self-esteem, and are helping me with my shopaholicism! Let's see what other cards say....hmmmmm.................Thoughts lead to feelings, which lead to actions,..........which lead to results...............If you choose to think and act like rich people..........do, you can create the ressults that rich people..........create.\\"Another self-help expert said it like this: \\"If you want tobe rich, see what poor people do, and DON'T do it!\\"So, if a show comes on TV, highlighting the life, say, ofJohn Dillinger, it's better to change the channel....or perhaps rread up on the life of Bill Gates, Eleanor Roosevelt, Helen Keller, JFK, FDR, or Abraham Lincoln!On the reverse side of each of these cards is a illustrativedrawing, by artist SARAH WILKINS. All of the drawings are truly appropriate for the subject matter. Many of them could also stand as works of art on their own. Ms. Wilkins has a moderistic bent, with a realistic touch -- her works remind me a bit of the work of Max Earnst. Many have a dream-like quality -- but all are realistic enough to discern everything painted. Some of these paintings could easily find their way into the New York Museum of Modern Art, I feel! They illustrate Mr. Eker's principles in a way no one can miss!You may agree with some of these cards more than you do others...but all the cards have the hallmark of being writtenby someone who not only wants to make a profit from selling them, but also someone who sincerely wants to help others.Maybe it's lonely at the top. Maybe he just wants to sharewhat he has. Whatever his reasons, these little cards, withtheir \\"bite-size\\" bits of wisdom, are theperfect companion to his more expansive, but still compactbook. Reading these \\"nuggest of knowledge\\" is easier eventhan reading his small volume on which they are based...which means more repetition! Like a neophyte capitalist's counterpart to the Chinese \\"Little Red Book of the Sayings of Chairman Mao\\", thesecards can mold you into a fully-formed compassionate, (and wealthy!) capitalist....one who believes in the value of people, as much as you do in the value of money. Both are important, and valuing one often leads to valuing of the other, (as who does not want to ultimately aid his or her parents, or other kind relatives, friends, and others you'd like to help?)So, buy these cards, and shuffle and read them! Every day!If their 3\\"x 4 1/2\\" size is too big to take to work, copy them down in a smaller notebook. No, these cards are not as mystical as Tarot cards. However - they are filled with common sense...and probably, good fortune, too! Remember, repetion is what gets ANYTHING across.... And these little cards...to be read at home, during lunch breaks..and even on the bus to work....make the repetition easy!IN THE END, YOU'LL FIND, AS I DID, THAT RICH PEOPLE ARE NOT ADIFFERENT SPECIES! THEY ARE HUMAN BEINGS, JUST LIKE YOU AND I, WHOT H I N K....A LITTLE....D I F F E R E N T L Y. READ THESE CARDS,(EVERY DAY!), AND YOU'LL FIND OUT ...H O W...THEY THINK DIFFERENTLY.JUST A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY, ACTUALLY....BUT THAT LITTLE BIT MAKESALL THE DIFFERENCE. Buying these cards COULD easily be the firststep to fulfilling the wise adage: LIVE LONG AND PROSPER!!!!!!$ : ) $ ; ) &lt;---Happy Rich Man, Happy Rich Woman! )"},{"Title":"Secrets of the Millionaire Mind Cards","review":"I went to the Millionaire Mind Seminar for Free. For more than a year Eker had a two free-ticket offer in his book, and I bought the book and went with a friend. Obviously the people who gave the negative review didn't take that opportunity.The MM seminar was an absolutely amazing experience! I would recommend it to anyone. For the person who said Eker isn't spiritual, he/she obviously never met the man. Eker is spiritual and wholistic. One of the ways he teaches people to become financially free is by changing their way of thinking from a negative \\"I deserve to suffer\\", \\"rich people are the devil,\\" \\"If only I had enough to pay the bills ontime\\" mentality to a positive and uplifting \\"I deserve to be rich,\\" \\"My time and life is valuable and I will only do things that honors me,\\" \\"I can do BOTH, not either or\\" mentally. Eker brought a room filled with more than 1,500 people to their absolute best state with positive, coaching, and forward-thinking talks. In his book, he talks about overcoming fear and breaking an arrow -- a real arrow -- with your throat, and I did it! (It would take a book for me to explain all that I learn during those three days.)The cards are great, they are beautifully colored and the messages are right on.

In my opinion, financial cards are as valid as angel cards or self-worth cards or any others.If you learned from Eker's book and/or seminar and don't want to write his thoughts on Post-Its (as I was doing), these cards work great!"},{"Title":"Secrets of the Millionaire Mind Cards","review":"I look at this deck of cards as a nice gift to myself, another little investment in myself and my future. There's a lot of cards. Someone said there's 50 of them? That sounds about right. The cards are big and nice looking. They come in a nice, sturdy box made of thick, glossy cardboard. They remind you of Harv's principles without you having to write them down yourself. I don't think this deck is as critical to have as his book, but it's nice to have and use. What the heck, it's only $15. That's nothing compared to how much more money you'll make as a result of Harv's teachings. One of my big problems was having limiting subconscious beliefs, which I have been dimly aware of for many years. I had this vague feeling that I must've been holding myself back for some unknown reason. Now I am finally freed to have great goals and to pursue them very aggressively! I also found Brad Yates e-tapping recordings to be very helpful to free my subconscious even more. He's a hypnotist and he uses EFT techniques and he's AWESOME at it. So I recommend everyone also look into Brad Yates on the web. Harv is not the only one who helps you free yourself of subconscious limits.

And I&#8217;m not talking about nickel-and-dime stuff. There are times I think the author literally made things up about the Army and the JAG Corps.For example, Imelda's rank, Specialist Seven, hasn't existed in the Army for ages. Anyone remotely familiar with the modern Army should know that. Moreover, no JAG would head up such an investigation in the first place; it would be a regular officer doing either what&#8217;s called a 15-6 investigation or an Article 32 hearing. (At one point, Drummond does say he is the Article 32 officer. If that were so, he was inappropriately collecting evidence outside the setting of the actual hearing and thus invalidating his own investigation). There are no \\"career\\" prosecutors or defense attorneys like Delbert and Morrow, respectively; every JAG officer does rotations through various positions: prosecution, defense, administrative law, civil law, environmental law, etc.I could go on and on, but my point is that Haig's sole source of research on the JAG Corps seems to be the TV show \\"JAG\\" and the movie \\"A Few Good Men.\\" Needless to say, both are rife with their own Hollywood-inspired concoctions and inaccuracies.What's so odd is that people think this is a semi-genuine portrayal of the way military justice works! Check out the comments here at Amazon.com and on the book&#8217;s cover. Some have compared him to Tom Clancy, which is absurd, considering that the hallmark of Clancy&#8217;s writing is its technical accuracy.As mysteries/thrillers go, this book isn&#8217;t bad, but the frequent mistakes and outright misrepresentations of the Army were too distracting for me."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"First time I've read this author trying to get use to his style.

The characters come alive and the dialog feels authentic (no surprise given Haig's military background).Major Drummond (who is the narrator in this first person novel) is a wisecracking soldier turned lawyer, who is very descriptive and creative in describing his experiences, in particular his scenes involving the paralegal Imelda. The story itself is about an A-Team that hasn't escaped to the Los Angeles underground, but instead are under arrest while Drummond figures out how the team was involved with a massacre in Kosovo.

There was little investigating.

The story was okay."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"I read this first novel by Brian Haig after immensely enjoying THE KINGMAKER (five star review of 5/13/03), the third novel with Major Sean Drummond as the central character. I wanted to understand the character development of Drummond and surmised that this book would be a fast paced easy read. If you are interested in the military/legal thriller genre, you will probably enjoy this story by Haig, a West Point graduate and the son of former Secretary of State (\\"I am in charge\\") Alexander Haig. The obvious reason is that Drummond's previous experiences are relevant to the later stories in the series, but in addition I would guess my recognition of the flaws in this book was substantially increased (and perhaps my rating influenced negatively) by the progress the author has made as the series has progressed. In my review of THE KINGMAKER, I labeled Drummond \\"The James Bond of the Legal Profession\\"; in this book his skills are not nearly as developed, the action is less intense, and his personality is not as appealing.The storyline is straightforward. Drummond is chosen to lead a team investigating an apparent massacre of thirty-five Serbs by an elite Green Beret team in retailiation for the slaughter of a group of Kosovars who they were advising during the Balkan war. His team also includes a beautiful but aloof defense attorney, Lisa Morrow, and a by-the-book prosecutor, Captain James Delbert, both of whom possess more impressive credentials than Drummond. In addition, given the high profile and potentially explosive nature of the incident, they have been given a very tight deadline in which to complete their report. As you might imagine, they are met by a wall of noncooperation if not complete silence. However, the physical evidence certainly calls into question the official version of events. Additional violence and intrigue occurs, and it isn't clear whether it is related to attempts to hinder their invetigation or just misdirection by the author.This is what might be termed a military investigation procedural, and unfortunately I am not an expert in a lot of the areas with which this book deals. (E.g, JAG procedure and rules of evidence, Army ranks, etc.) and thus cannot address the criticisms of some other reviewers about the technical aspects of this story. But it is fast moving and certainly plausibly plotted. The major positives were actually the knowledge imparted by the discussion of some of the history and geography relevant to the Balkan conflict and the examination of the moral ambiguities often highlighted in retrospect by such events as that portrayed in this book. Drummond is conflicted by his role in not only trying to assemble the facts but present his conclusions in a way that balances all the competing interests involved. At the same time, tensions develop within his group and along the chain of command above him.The major negative was the straightforward presentation of the story and the seeming inevitablilty of the eventual conclusion. The plot is neither particularly complex or intrinsically interesting. Thus, the tension involved the interactions among the participants (including Drummond and Morrow's evolving relationship), whether and how the truth could be assembled, and how the \\"greater good\\" embodied in the major geopolitical considerations involved would interact with the determination of the details and \\"small truths\\" of this particular event. And this is done in a very balanced and thoughtful way. (I imagine such issues as what ends justify what means are of great interest to the author, and they are certainly playing out in the military engagement in Iraq today although in a very different way.)I enjoyed the book enough so that I also plan to read MORTAL ALLIES (the second book in the series) in the hope that the evolution of Drummond's character and the author's skills will have proceeeded meaningfully by that point. In summary, I was satisfied but not excited by this book, while I loved THE KINGMAKER (now available in paperback). So, if part of your enjoyment is finding new authors and following their development and the evolution of their characters, then read this series in order. But if you want to read only the best story and to meet a really intriguing fictional character combined with a fascinating plot, go straight to the third book in the series."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"Brian Haig (son of Alexander Haig) is a fresh new &quot;voice&quot; in popular fiction. His style of writing -- part witty, part sarcastic and always interesting -- makes Secret Sanction a book to put near the top of your &quot;To Be Read&quot; list. I think you'll be captivated by the story (which moves along at a very crisp pace), the characters ( which are believable and multi-dimensional), and Haig's knowledge of military honor, tradition and politics. Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to Haig's first effort. There's no doubt in my mind that you'll like Secret Sanction a lot and be looking forward to Haig's next book. The only reason I didn't rate the book a &quot;5&quot; is that I anticipated the ending a little too far in advance of where I would have liked, since the earlier reviews I read on Amazon led me to believe the ending was a major surprise.

All of the characters are memorable, the dialogue and plot are fast-paced, and the ending will leave you feeling satisfied yet uneasy.The plot is as believable as it is relevant and timely, and for those with a sense of history, it will inevitably cause you to recall the horrific tragedy of My Lai.Mr. Haig is one of the most original and enjoyable storytellers that I have discovered in a long time.

As an Army Judge Advocate myself, I have to suspend disbelief to a certain extent, but I do expect authors to do enough research that basic principles remain intact. For example, no Army officer would EVER say &quot;OORAH&quot; or &quot;HOORAH&quot; when referring to the 82d Airborne. &quot;Proximate cause&quot; doesn't get you a search authorization anywhere--PROBABLE cause does. Military suspects being interrogated by CID would know what crimes they are suspected of because of Article 31, UCMJ. And the list goes on (and on, and on). The predictable plot I can forgive; the rest I cannot. Please do not read this book thinking you are getting an accurate insight into the world of military law."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"Every military officer knows that some assignments almost always lead to retirement such as the critical but deadly role of garrison commander. That is how Major Sean Drummond of the Judge Advocate General's Corps feels as he stops at Fort Bragg to catch a flight to Bosnia where his next case awaits him.In Bosnia, someone executed thirty-five Serbs gangland-style. The bodies were all found containing bullets in the brains. The international media quickly jumps on the Serbian claim that an American Special Forces team of nine people committed mass murder. Sean will prosecute the case against the accused American soldiers in a military court of law. However, as he gathers information and realizes that at least one of his two aids is a &quot;spy,&quot; Sean knows that there is more to this mass execution then the brass will tell him. Several of the higher ranking officers advise Sean on the record (tape recording on) before warning him about going too far and destroying his career (tape recording off). Can Sean truly prosecute a case that his superior officers want him to lose?SECRET SANCTION is a powerfully fresh military legal thriller that provides sub-genre fans with insight into a different form of justice as well as a close up look at Bosnia. The invigorating story line centers on military justice and wondering if Sean, who believes in the Army values including justice and honor (while higher ranked officials use the values as a convenient facade) can fairly prosecute the case? Brian Haig shows insider information of the working of the US Army in a peacekeeping scenario. This adds spice to a well-written, issue-raising thriller.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"Haig writes from the foxholes. His clear cut attention to detail with regards to military tradition and ceremony weaves seamlessly with courtroom drama and Special Forces codes of honor. Haig takes us on a ride from Serb controled Bosnia to the inner circles of the White House with a master story-tellers keen eye for the unexpected. A summertime &quot;must read&quot; that you will be placing under Christmas trees as well!"},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"Major Sean Drummond is a nonconformist, cynical and self-deprecating JAG lawyer...a wonderful character with wit, charm, smarts.Before JAG, he was a member of super secret covert \\"outfit\\" in the US intelligence community.In Brian Haig's \\"Secret Sanction\\" Drummond is assigned to what appears to be a straightforward case. Someone has committed a massacre of 35 Serbian troops who were led by a brutal, sadistic warlord.The army brass fears this will get attention on a par with Vietnam's My Lai massacre.Once in Tuzla Air Base in Bosnia-Herzegovina, what appears to be a giant cover-up/conspiracy greets Drummond and his legal team.NSA, CIA, Green Berets, Drummond's mentor (two star general Clapper) and on up to the Commander-in-Chief are possible members of the whitewash.The pace is fast, the dialogue electric, the characters real and fully fleshed out. It is muscular legal thriller...perhaps John Grisham in army fatigues.Each clue unearthed leads to another seeming dead end...but Drummond is relentless in finding out what really took place.The journey to the d&eacute;nouement is a breathtaking voyage and the ending will take you by surprise.A winner on many levels!"},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"Secret Sancation is a great little read. A great look at the modern military and our militaries job in places like the Balkans and in these other 3rd world conflicts.The main character in this story is right out of a Nelson Demille book. He could have been the main character of Plum Island or Up Country, but regardless it still works.This is a great book and a fast read. I enjoyed that the main characters father in the book was wounded in the rear, i wonder if the author is making a joke about the relationship with his father, the famous general and politician Alexander &quot;I'm In Charge Here&quot; Haig.I enjoyed this book and it is worth your money"},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"As a first novel from Brian Haig, I must say I was fairly impressed.A group of 35 Serbian soldiers is massacred; some with close in headshots. A group from the Special Forces A-Team is arrested for this atrocity. Sean Drummond, a JAG lawyer, is put in charge of the investigation, to find out whether it was self-defense or outright murder. With his witty and smart-alecky way, Drummond weaves from cover-up to cover-up in what seems an endless pursuit of justice.I felt really comfortable reading this book. The writing style was fluid. There was not as much suspense as other military thrillers but the manner in which Drummond investigated and interviewed potential suspects kept me on edge. I got a pretty clear picture on the Serbian/Albanian relations and some of the politics involved with NATO operations. Military operations with the KLA brought some insight also.Overall a satisfying read, especially for military buffs.Inside the covers:He said, &#8220;Sometimes those principles they teach at West Point about duty and honor and country, sometimes they clash against one another. The world&#8217;s not as pristine as West Point makes it out to be. Sometimes you have to decide which of those three is most important. You have to decide which principle you need to sacrifice.&#8221;I said, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t go to west point, so I don&#8217;t know about all that. I tell you what I do know. I know what makes us different from the Serbs. We don&#8217;t coddle our murderers. We don&#8217;t lie to the world when our troops commit a massacre. We wash our laundry in the open. That&#8217;s duty and honor and country, all in one.&#8221; At least that&#8217;s what I thought."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"I read a lot of debut thrillers and I'm usually disappointed with them. But I thought SECRET SANCTION was a great debut -- one of the best debuts I've read recently. After reading this novel, I'm surprised that Brian Haig isn't a bigger name in the business.I won't summarize the plot, since that's been done by others. This is basically a story about a JAG lawyer named Sean Drummond and the cases he investigates. This novel is surprisingly funny. Drummond is a rather cynical, sarcastic character who has a love/hate relationship with the military. This novel is therefore includes wisecracks on pretty much every page. In fact, Haig's writing style reminds me a bit of Nelson Demille and Robert Parker, because he blends a lot of biting humor with a fast-paced plot. Luckily, Haig has a good sense of humor. I laughed out loud many times at this book.SECRET SANCTION is a lot of fun and provides quite a bit of insight into the culture of the military. Contrary to what you might think, Haig is not afraid to criticise military culture, and I found some of his insights quite interesting.Although Brian Haig is the son of former Secretary of State Al Haig, he aims barbs at both Democrats and Republican politicians in this novel. I didn't feel this book had a partisan edge to it at all.In short, I highly recommend this book. A great debut by a writer who has not gotten his due."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"I belong to a book club and we've never selected a \\"mystery\\" for our discussion until I suggested \\"Secret Sanction\\". The plot is absolutely current and riveting. It will force you to think about all the military actions going on today. The characters are realistic, believable and have depth. The objectivity with which the author approaches the subject is both intriguing and enlightening. The women of my book club thought the book was terrific and it certainly generated quite a lot of discussion."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"This is the first of Brian Haig's books about legal matters in the US Army. Faced with another legal novel, I would normally yawn, but this story has two things going for it. First, the US Army's Judge Advocate General's office is not your usual law operation. The military has iis own rules, based on the Articles of War, so things run differently. Second, the protagonist, Major Sean Drummond, is a cocky, fast-talking lawyer, who sees the wry humor in military life. Of course, if you don't see the humor, you will likely become sorely depressed, because peacetime life in uniform is boring, and wartime life is terrifying. In the present tale, Major Drummond and two captains go to Bosnia to investigate charges that a Green Beret team ambushed and executed 35 Serbian soldiers, although the United States was at peace with Serbia. The Green Berets have devised a big cover-up, which Drummond detects immediately. But as he investigates further, the crime is not as clear-cut as it appears, and it extends all the way back to Washington, DC. The story unfolds nicely and should keep you entertained during those long waits in an airport terminal."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"I picked this up on the clearance rack at a local store, and therefore did not expect much from the story. Once I begain to read I could hardly put the book down. The story seems written as if Sean Drummand were telling it, and it lends a very easy readability and flow to the book. Read it if you have a chance"},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"I do not have any military background but Mr. Haig's writing made it appear interesting and easy to understand. Fast paced, very witty and can't help but admire his lead character. I have grabbed the rest of his books...I am hooked! Can't wait for the next installment."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"Brian Haig is the sond of the former Secretary of State. This is his first book (though I read Mortal Allies a while back) and it's a good book, a complex thriller involving international politics and military operations.Major Sean Drummund, the main character, is an army lawyer assigned to investigate what appears to be a massacre of Serbian soldiers. The army is running a semi-covert operation inside Bosnia, with Green Beret teams advising Albanians in nearby Kosovo in the fine art of guerilla warfare so they can fight off their Serbian oppressors. One of the Green Beret teams discovers that the Albanians they were training have all been killed, and they ambush a vehicle convoy in retaliation and kill 35 Serbian soldiers. The difficulty is that almost all of the Serbians have been shot once in the head, just to make sure. This could constitute a war crime.When Drummond is first assigned to the case, he gets a lot of on-the-record covering from his superiors, and a lot of behind the scenes pressure to make sure the whole problem goes away. However, he's a stubborn character, pretty much born into the military, and he insists on taking his own path and finding the truth. When a reporter shows up to try and follow the case, and is almost immediately killed, things get complicated even more. And naturally there's a girl, and Drummond can't decide if she's on his side or not.This is a good first effort, and while it's not going to win any awards, if you like this kind of book you could find many worse things to spend your weekend with."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"Fast moving , well written, extremely enjoyable. I have just completed his second book and Brien Haig is an articulate and accomplished author with an upside to rival Coyle and Clancy.. A must read!"},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"As an avid reader and chaser of military fiction I enjoyed Haig's version of secret military courts-martial investigations. I think that if he did a little more research into the procedures and effort required by the \\"Book\\" he would be able to earn the 5th Star. It appears that he desires his character to be a swashbuckler and hero going his own way, doing the process his own way. It doesn't work that way. I ask him to pay a little more attention to required detail, not so much as to slow the pace, but enough to put Sean Drummond in a position that his case would be won no matter who prosecuted. Another thing, Mr. Haig, you gotta give Sean a sex life. No wonder the Major is short and curt with everyone. I patiently await his next effort, hoping that he will grow in the direction of W.E.B. Griffin."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"This story of Serb soldiers allegedly being brutally executed by an American SpecFor away team was quite a hook. Being presented with the &quot;evidence&quot; by the Serb News Media, the US top-brass send Army lawyer Sean Drummond and his team to investigate the truth of the matter. The tale is told using Drummond's cynical and sarcastic voice which whilst initially witty becomes grating. The cast of characters seems well-rounded and plausible, but for Spec7 Imelda Pepperfield; if I'd come across someone like her in MY military career, she'd have been on a charge of insubordination immediately!I can't comment on the accuracy of the JAG investigation or whether lawyers would actually DO the investigation rather than line officer's and military police investigators. However, the story does drive on at a fast pace to a satisfying conclusion and the book is exciting. For that alone, it's worth the purchase.My reservations lie in language accuracy, some spelling errors. If the author is prepared to allow these to creep into his book, how accurate are the details on which a book like this hangs? Fow example, Haig invents a neologism,namely &quot;conspirational&quot;. What does that mean? We also are faced with the absurd picture of a man having a single thick eyebrow which is PERPENDICULAR to his moustache. That would be a sight! Of course, Haig meant to say parallel.Despite these problems the book was an enjoyable romp."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"Secret Sanction captured my attention on page one and never let go. I thoroughly enjoyed all of the characters Haig has created. All were very well developed and very believable. Major Sean Drummond has a biting sense of sarcasm and quick wit that makes the lead character come alive. I will not divulge any more of the story than has already been by other reviewers, however I will say that you will find that there are more layers to this cover up than you would ever imagine.This is a must read in my book!!Can wait for Brian Haig's next offering. Keep'em coming Mr.. Haig."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"After seeing Brian Haig interviewed on Larry King, along with another first time author, Georgia Durante, I decided to purchase both books. Being an avid reader, I was pleasantly surprised by both books, Mr. Haig's being fiction and Ms. Durante's, non fiction. These two books kept me captivated for 4 days. A reader's delight! Couldn't put them down. Larry King must screen his author's well to come up with such fasinating stories. I will never hesitate buying a book that Larry tauts on his show. Do yourself a favor and pick up both &quot;Secret Sanction&quot; and &quot;The Company She Keeps.&quot; You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"It is unique to come across a book that is both a legal and political thriller, but that is what Brian Haig has accomplished in his latest work. The book is full of unanticipated plot twists and political and military conspiracies. The lead character, Major Drummond, is both aggressive and irreverent, which I found refreshing in this genre. He uses these uses qualities to look past the calm and organized setting and ferret out the turbulent and ugly reality beneath.The book cleverly develops complication upon complication,generated by one disobeyed order, and leading ultimately to an intractable disaster. I found this book to be a bold and extraordinary thriller full of suspense and surprise. A wonderfully satisfying read."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"Don't usually get into the military novels, but this one is an exception to the rule. Lots of twists and turns that are a little predictable but very entertaining nonetheless. Written in an entertaining way that makes you laugh out loud at some points and keeps your eyes riveted to the pages thru-out. Definitely would (and have) suggest to others for a \\"good time.\\""},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"I bought this audio book after reading all of the Amazon reviews. At the same time I ordered this book from Amazon I ordered his other 3 books after reading all of the reviews about them. I won't bother to rehash the plot line since so many reviewers have already done that. As suggested by several reviewers I will read them in the order that they were written. Even though the books are not a continuation of each other, it was suggested it was better to read them in order since some of the same characters return. I have to say that at first I thought the book would be boring in that I have absolutely no interest in the military. Turns out it was not the least bit boring and it was a great mystery that just happened to have a military plotline. I can't wait to listen to the second book (Mortal Allies) which I will start on my drive home tonight. I am always happy when I find a new writer to listen to. Since I listen to so many audio books it is imperative to point out that no matter how good the book is if the person reading the book isn't also very good the audio book turns into a dud. As soon as I started listening to John Rubinstein (the reader of this book) I realized I had heard this voice many times before and that he was one of my favorite readers. Then I realized he is the reader of a lot of Jonathan Kellerman's books. If you like audio books, another great &quot;reader&quot; is Joe Mantegna. He has been the &quot;reader&quot; of a lot of different authors including Elmore Leonard. They don't get any better than him."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"Jag Officer Major Sean Drummond has just been assigned to the kind of case he loathes - one that is neither black nor white and carries the weight of negativity no matter what was decided. In other words, a no-win situation. And Sean Drummond (along with partners Morrow and Delbert) was in charge of choosing whether there was enough evidence to proceed with a court-martial or not.The case involves a group of nine Green Berets known as a Special Forces A-Team. They were in charge of training a team of Kosovar Albanians to fight the Serbian army that had driven them out of their homeland.This all was to be done secretly because there was no official war which involved American forces. Basically, the Americans were to keep their hands clean while still finding ways to help the Kosovars defend themselves.Seems fairly cut-and-dried...until something went horribly wrong, resulting in the massacre of the Kosovar team and a group of thirty-five Serbian soldiers. And if Drummond thought the case wasn't complicated enough to wade through as it was, he hadn't seen anything yet. Questions would multiply into more questions and the answers were pointing to more than one conspiracy . Ones larger than what Drummond could handle on his own, especially when there was a mole in his own team.Brian Haig's breakthrough novel, Secret Sanction, may seem geared more toward hard-core military fiction fans at first glance, but it easily grabs the attention of a larger audience. While there are a couple occasions in which the investigating team uncovers something they find to be groundbreaking information that the average reader isn't able to pick up right away, it all opens up and becomes clear in the end. And this slight confusion only adds to the feeling of empathy toward what Drummond himself is experiencing.This is a novel of intrigue, suspense, murder and large-scale conspiracy. Add all that to the adorably cynical and smart-mouthed Major Drummond and Brian Haig has a winning novel sure to earn him a large following."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"Had a few feelings at the beginning of the story but as it progressed the plot rounded and became a great and believable story. I will read more of his books as he comes along and I am sure that I will enjoy them."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"Of all the military/legal 'thrillers' I've read, this one takes the cake. This is a great piece of work, stylishly devised to both entertain and educate the reader. Brian Haig's method of drawing the reader into the first-person, understated personna of the narrator is captivating and compelling. I found myself wanting to get to know Sean Drummond a lot better, and hoping future Haig novels will take me there. Mr. Haig has a rare and important gift, and I am a bonified fan, breathlessly awaiting his next effort . . ."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"This book is like a summer thriller movie: you can pick apart the plot 9 ways to Sunday, but when it is all said and done, you realize that you've been entertained. Considering this is Haig's first book, I'm willing to give him a lot of latitude and only wish that I could put forth such a first effort. The book was enjoyable, the main character was likable, the plot was basically plausible and, frankly, I couldn't put it down the last 200 pages. I look forward to Mr. Haig's future offerings and I only hope he continues his main characters in the mold of Sean Drummond."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"If you like Nelson Demille (specifically Plum Island and Word of Honor) then you're going to love this tightly written and well honed thriller.

This is a keeper and I'm coming back for more."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"Brian Haig's mistakes in depicting the military justice system ranged from the picayune (disrespect by \\"apportment\\" - how about \\"deportment\\") to the gross (since I'm limited to 1000 words, I won't even get started on investigation procedures), and I couldn't wait to turn the page and see what topic was the next victim in his massacre of military law.

I will say that this was my first book by Brian Haig, and I enjoyed it very much. I usually don't like first person narration (too self indulgent and self analytical), but this book flowed well, and the story moved.The Kindle edition was formatted just OK, with no Typos. BUT, there were many instances where different lines of dialogue by different characters were in the same paragraph and not separated out. I asssume this was only in the Kindle and not the paper edition (but I can't check that out). This was distracting and should be corrected.

An Army JAG is heading the investigation assisted by two othr JAG's, they are challenged to find the truth in a convuluted coverup.

Special Forces teams are made up of 12 men (not 9) the Specialist Seventh was impossible (and the Army has not had a rank above Specialis Four since 1985) there is no GS 17 rank and it goes on and on...Haig should be ashamed of himself to write such thrash.

S. government in this, his first novel. Who else would have the courage (or, in today's world, foolishness) to follow through on his convictions.It appears that he's entered the mass market paperback arena for most of his succeeding books; he's been on a roll, so to speak, and some sound inviting. He's really gone high tech with digital versions; apparently, he has 'publishing savvy' to get so many out to the public in only two years. Could it be he has a ghost writer as an aide?A West Point grad, he served as special assistant to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. That's heady stuff, but as a career military strategist this was his destiny. Though his dad showed gross arrogance during his stint as Secretary of State, the son -- due to his military lifestyle, no doubt -- is more down-to-earth.I didn't care for his use of \\"Yep,\\" \\"Un huh,\\" \\"Nope\\" and such as dialogue, his story line moves along satisfactorily. Actually, it was two stories in one -- a major scandal of a government coverup involving our special forces called Green Berets and the resultant botched investigation, and a crime closer to home as a consequence.A vast conspiracy to keep details under wraps by devious political leaders and maneurvering generals at the Pentagon seems to have roots in the Oval Office. Living that close to the inner workings and observations of those in power, he knew first hand of the secret \\"wars\\" kept from the public. Where was Dan Rather then?! It's best (and safer) not to probe too deeply into military affairs, especially those chosen by officials not to pursue. The system has rules and everybody has to obey them.There were references to Hollywood movies, 'Mutiny on the Bounty' and 'The Caine Mutiny' to show how the underlings rebel at times of great stress. That's life. He inserted some references to Delbert of the comics and Johnny Carson/Ed McMahon spiels (also Ed Morrow) on t.v. to relieve tension from so much military \\"justice.\\"This was his first novel, though some of his articles previously have appeared in national publications and the 'Harvard Journal.' His use of mild vulgarisms seems normal for a soldier but hard to overlook by an average reader. These multi-faceted characters were not intellectuals, that's clear, with many things glossed over.Maybe his writing style is a \\"nice mix of wit and wisdom\\" as Nelson DeMille avered, but if he'd clean up his language, he might just become a first-rate novelist to match the glowing endorsements on the cover of this incredible story. Metaphysically speaking, of course.I like \\"first novels\\" as they incorporate much of the writer's personal experiences and beliefs. If I had a military background, I would probably have gotten much more to appreciate and less to doubt the \\"searing honesty\\" as presented from that viewpoint. I've learned that it is best to doubt until the real facts are proven and substantiated. This is not the kind of \\"suspense\\" fiction I've spent a lot of years enjoying. Yet, the larger print was a feast to my sore eyes.This is a son one could be proud of, but he will burn himself out before his time if he continues to release his creative efforts at such a rate. Take it from Gregory Macdonald, it is best to pace oneself in this industry."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"Haig has rather blatantly imitated Nelson DeMille's style, and has also ripped off plot elements from two DeMille books, &quot;Word of Honor&quot; and &quot;The General's Daughter&quot;. The plot of &quot;Secret Sanction&quot; is completely unbelievable and the characters are cardboard cutouts. Don't waste your time with this pathetic imitation, go for the original--both of the two DeMille books named above are excellent. Haig's book is junk."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"Brian Haig's protagonist is possibly the most obnoxious fictional character I've come across in a long, long while. He is involved in a pedestrian, by-the-numbers plot and works with a wooden supporting cast. Is there anything that could make this novel worse?Yes, there is -- its being read by Scott Brick. In his reading, every character sounds exactly the same; the middle-aged Black female sergeant from South Carolina is interchangeable with the young New England-educated JAG officer. Worse, Mr Brick has a distinctive and highly annoying idiosyncrasy -- a rising tone at the end of certain sentences, and, again, it crops up irrespective of character. After that, the fact that Mr Brick has no clue regarding the pronounciation of the few French phrases common in English comes as no surprise. (He renders \\"sang froid\\" as \\"sang Freud\\", and transmogrifies \\"coup de grace\\" into \\"coup de gras\\" -- although, presumably, a cholesterol hit wasn't exactly what the author had in mind.)In short: Avoid this audio book like the plague!(Note: I rated this product with 1 star, because Amazon wouldn't allow 0 stars."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"ALthough this is Haig's first, it is a good one.

The book is set during the late 90s Kosovo war in which the US and NATO tried to prevent the genocide of Albanians. That conflict is pretty recent yet I remember little about it. Anyway, Milocivich and Serbia are claiming that a group of US soldiers murdered a batallion of Serbian soldiers. Drummond is the impartial JAG officer sent to determine if charges should be filed. Before he goes, he meets with representatives from the White House and the army basically telling him to be impartial but it would be best if these charges went away.From the first moment Drummond sets foot on Bosnian soil, he knows he's being lied to. He just can't prove it. The novel progresses as Drummond and his colleagues review the evidence and interview the team accused of committing the massacre. There are a few twists and turns but the plot moves only as fast as Drummond's first person narration can take it.The bad news is this book isn't great. The good news is that the series gets better. I've only read Private Sector in the series but thought it was much better than Secret Sanction. When you decide to read a series, it's important to start with the first book. Drummond is an interesting character, full of witty insights and deep thoughts, yet I think that reading a story from Drummond's point of view prevents the reader from getting fully immersed in the story. Yet Drummond is fun to read, so I'm not complaining.For those looking for a new series, I highly recommend the Sean Drummond books. They are in-depth legal thrillers that aren't hard to read. A lot of fun too. This book probably isn't the best in the series, but it is the first and sets the stage for what is too come. On a side note, it taught me a lot about the war in Bosnia."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"The first in the Sean Drummond series, has him off to a good start.

Haig's protagonist the wise cracking and self deprecating Major Sean Drummond was a former U.S. Army Special Forces infantry officer who due to disabling injuries was steered into law school and eventually JAG (Judge Advocate General) service by his mentor General Clapper.Drummond was serving on a clandestine judicial tribunal that monitored and prosecuted special forces involved in black or secret operations who had gone beyond official limits committing punishable crimes. He was ordered to head an investigation based in the Balkans, specifically in Kosovo to determine whether a court martial was warranted. He was assisted by Capt.'s Delbert and Morrow respectively the most successful Army prosecuting and defense lawyers.The action is question was the ambush and massacre of a troop of 35 Serbian soldiers by a nine man U.S. Army Green Beret team. Officially the Special Forces were stationed in Kosovo only to observe and train Kosovo Liberation Army forces and not intiate any offensive action. The troubling aspect of the massacre was that each Serbian soldier was shot with a coup de grace to the head.Almost immediately Drummond realizes that this questionable action is being covered up at the very highest levels. Commander of American Special Forces General Murphy, a youthful Army boy wonder is making it difficult for Drummond to manuever. He is also being flummoxed by Jack Trethorne, a high ranking member of the CIA posing as a member of the NSA, who is feeding Drummond phony satellite imagery meant to justify the action. The nine man squadron sequestered in Aviano Air Force base in Italy haven't been individually isolated, allowing them to manufacture a story that all recite verbatim to Drummond.If things aren't bad enough a Washington Herald reporter presumably in Kosovo to cover the potential court martial is found murdered. The forces that be attempt to frame Drummond for the killing.Despite being stonewalled at every turn with his every move being recorded by wiretaps, Drummond plods forward in his inquest to a conclusion that puts his sense of morality to the ultimate test."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"Brian Haig has written 5-6 books. We purchased 4 of them from Amazon.com. My husband and I read all four in a one week period. They were all page turners.The primary character is a JAG lawyer, formerly Black Ops. He is not your traditional Jag person. He is flip and stands up to his superiors. His former profession gives him good defensive reflexes that no one expects from a lawyer so when he gets in sticky situations, which he often does, he can extricate himself.One word of caution, every Haig book that we have read has twists. When you think the main character, and you, have it figured out, up pops a surprise. Buy it, read it, enjoy it.This is the first one of the series. It had special meaning for us in that it takes place in Bosnia; we used to live in Bosnia so places were familiar and we found the details to be accurate. Basic theme is a special ops operation goes bad and someone has to investigate."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"I am always pleased to find that the first effort of a succcessful author may be right up there with his best works. I discovered Brian Haig by reading his must recent novel, The President's Assassin. As a result of that I ordered and have read all of his novels that preceeded it. This one was the last read and the first written. The other modern author whose first effort I have been this pleased with was John Grisham. I still believe that his first novel, A Time To Kill, remains his best work. I would rank this one as Haig's best also. For character development, the way the story spins out, dialogue, intrigue, etc., it is all there. After Tucker Anderson's review sets the story, I can not improve on that, although we disagree on it's merit. As a trial lawyer all my life, although not a JAG attorney, the study of the situation, the interrogation of the witnesses, the dealing with the politics of the situation and the very real issues that arose as a result of all of that, I found the story compelling and one I hated to put down before I got to the last page. Brain Haig is a true talent and an author to look forward to."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"While I normally enjoy the military and legal genre, this combination written so brilliantly by Brian Haig should elevate him to the bestseller list regularly. The character development is excellent and scenarios are very realistic. Being an Army veteran, I can attest to his details being exact. Finally please don't be put off by the author being the son of former Secretary of State, Alexander Haig. He does not mix any political viewpoints in the book. Don't miss out on a great read unlike someone I recommended the book to."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"In the book Secret Sanction by Brian Haig, he tells the story of a young Army lawyer named Major Sean Drummond. Drummond is assigned to investigate the massacre of thirty- five Bosnian men by American soldiers. Along with two other American Army lawyers, Delbert and Morrow, he is sent to Bosnia to find out the truth of what happened that day. As Drummond tries to figure out this case, he finds out that there is a big conspiracy out to cause him troubles in the investigation. This conspiracy is so big that there is even a murder, a member of his team and people in Washington D.C. that are involved. This book was very easy to stay focused on and had a very interesting plot. The plot had many twists and unexpected events happen. It is interesting to try and figure out the case and all of the other elements right along with the main character, Sean Drummond. Haig does a great job with characterization in the book as he describes the lawyer Morrow and how good- looking she is. There are very real elements such as the way that Drummond feels about Morrow but does not have the courage to tell her. The conspiracy that is made to deter Drummond from solving the case is so real it makes the reader wonder if it is something that is actually going on in the world today. All around this was a very good book that will keep your attention even if you are not big into reading I would highly reccomend this book for all people especially those interested in mysteries or stories about the Army."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"Excellent author. Discriptive but not flowery and rambling. I would compare his writing to Grisham. Baldacci, Connely and Lescroart. I would encourage readers to go to his website and view the video of his speaking engagements, his background and personal views are remarkable. For those who are old enough to remember, he is Alexander Haig's son. The only thing negative is that in his first book there was no objectional language but in each book following the language becomes more course. The foul language does not inhance the fabulous plot lines, so I am not sure why he finds it necessary."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"Many books having to do with the military are strongly plot driven but have one-dimensional characters. A fewer number have strong characters but plodding action. A very few, like Haig's Secret Sanction, have the whole package. A legal drama when reduced to its most basic element, this is a riveting book that points out vividly that in war the line between who the good guys and bad guys are is often hard to decipher. The twists are many and Haig does a good job of making the moral grayness of war apparent."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"read it, love it, wait for the next page, then wait for the ending you'll never figure out and then wait for his next BOOK.it's that good"},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"Very good firstie by the son of Al Haig.

That I don't quite know where Haig (or his lead character) stands politically is testament to the fact that he's written a novel, and not a treatise. Looking forward to the balance of his books. (I've already started number two.) It will also be interesting to see how his character develops as the \\"real life\\" world Presidency changes (this novel features an unnamed Clinton White House - we'll see how a Bush White House is handled)."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"OK I couldn't resist the title of this review. I am so glad Amazon offered a \\"freebie\\" deal on Brian Haig's books (buy one, get one free) or I would never have discovered this wonderful author. His style truly reminds me of a mix between Nelson DeMille and Robert Crais. I LOVED the character of Sean Drummond.First, the plot, which has probably been covered extensively since this book was written so many years ago. Drummond is a JAG attorney assigned to determine whether a group of special forces troops in the Balkans should be prosecuted for crimes (they supposedly massacred a bunch of Serbs).You should know a bit about Haig. He is the son of Alexander Haig, former SecState to Reagan. He also worked under Nixon. Some of this seeps through in Brian Haig's writing. He refers to Drummond's father as someone who loved Nixon, but he also seems to respect him very much.This book is about duty, honor and country and could easily be written today. Those who march for peace will probably not like parts of it. I'd have to say, get over it. This is war. Granted the time period and the fight was a humanatiarian war, but the atrocities were very real and only become clear as the novel progresses. Drummond is witty, sarcastic and self-deprecating. I look forward to reading more about this character, and certainly more from this author. So glad I discovered him.

Drummond is his sarcastic self in this episode of his career and it takes his unorthodox behaviour to crack the case.

Since childhood, doctors have told me to take B vitamins because I do not have enough vitamin B 6 and B 12.On pages 217-218, the section called, \\"Homocysteine: An Unknown Risk Factor,\\" explained things fully. It also told me exactly how much of these vitamins (plus beneficial foods) that will keep my homocysteine in check. That section alone was worth the price of the book!Another little known fact about the human body is that folks with advanced gum disease are twice as likely to have a heart attack and 3 times more likely to have a stroke (than others with little or no gum disease). Ignoring your dentist can be hazardous to your health!There's so much in this book that it is hard to cover it all. However, here are some life-saving sections I found helpful:- Your medications and surgery can be a deadly mix. Which meds to stop before surgery (and how long before surgery to discontinue them). Obviously, you must discuss this with your doctor - including ALL supplements, vitamins and herbal preparations.-- Why you should avoid the Emergency Room and what to do if you cannot!-- Side effects of over-the-counter drugs. Remember, ALL drugs have side effects.-- What/where is the best hospital for my particular surgical procedure?-- Which hospital has the best anesthesiologists?-- Which medical tests are most accurate?

Through this book we have learned so much about the history of holidays, as well as recipes, crafts, and activities. Even more importantly the author has helped our own family develop holiday traditions that are both fun and meaningful, even for that toddler turned teenager! Holiday traditions are comforting and bring families closer together, and this book is a tremendous help if you are looking for inspiration.

I am definitely adding it to my home collection to use with my own family. The only negative note I might have is that the persona the author writes with has some strange sayings &quot;Dear Reader&quot; this and &quot;Dear Reader&quot; that.

And I own a whole LOT of them! I have had it since its first publication twenty years ago, and it still delights me to read it. Now my children have grown up and had children of their own; and I have just sent a copy to my daughter-in-law who is expecting a new baby [#4] in the autumn. My only regret is that my children were teenagers when this book first came out. But even so I was often able to take the basic ideas of the seasonal 'joys' and adapt them to their age level.The first section of the book is a spectacular 'review' of how 'normal' life used to be and how to make it that way again. Ideas for mealtimes, bath times, Sunday dinners, keeping life orderly [especially helpful in these hectic times] etc. is advice that will still be practical a hundred years from now.So many ideas are contained in the book that it is impossible to list them all. But I find the attention to each month and season to be genius. Sarah/Mrs.Sharp manages to make appealing even the inclusion of history and old customs, which many of our children of today probably know little or nothing about. This in itself would make the book a great read.Aside from the information and ideas contained in the book, the art work is enchanting! Reminders of a simpler time help to drive home the reality that 'a picture [really] is worth a thousand words'. When I first came upon this book, I, too, was a working mother wondering how to divide my time into equally productive and yet comforting segments. This book filled me with so much joy and creative ideas that it literally changed my life. AND it helped me to grow closer to my children by sharing my time and energy with them.I believe there is a real hunger in 'middle class America' for a return to some sort of sanity in the family circle. If you are looking for a book that will help you find your way back to such a comforting place, or even to introduce you to it for the first time, this is definitely the one. I can't recommend it highly enough.

It includes crafts, recipes, games, and holidays I've never even heard of. Some of them are fairly elaborate, but most are simple and easy to implement.I am especially impressed by her consistent message that gentle parenting is the best kind of parenting, and that family togetherness is precious. It even includes sections on what to do on those of days when children are simply impossible, how to comfort a sick child, and making travel with children fun.It does remind me a bit of the Waldorf philosophy of education, since it incorporates an observance of the seasons, emphasizes creativity, and includes lots of fantasy play and fairy folklore."},{"Title":"Sarah Ban Breathnach's Mrs. Sharp's Traditions: Art of Domestic Bliss","review":"This book gives you a step back in to the Victorian era and some ides of how to bring that slowed down comfort to your own home.

This book though is very different from Simple Abundance. She has taken on another identity and written the book as the character \\"Mrs. Smith\\". The book pulls traditions from the Victorian Era for just about every holiday and celebratory occasion you can think of, and offers unique ways to create traditions for your family on those occasions. But the tradition setting is not limited to celebratory occasions. She also addresses ways to make otherwise miserable times into pleasantly memorable times such as sick and rainy days. While some of the traditions suggested do seem a little archeaic and old fashioned (which I find to some extent in Simple Abundance), it is a great book if you have young children and want some ideas on really fun, memorable ways to celebrate special occasions.My New Year's resolution was to slow down and live in the moment (to the extent possible for a working mom of three children heavily invovled in extra-curricular activities!)and this book is really a helpful tool in fulfulling that resolution.(I LOVE the book but gave it 4 stars because I also purchased a used copy of an earlier edition of this book which is now out of print which has more stunning illustrations.)"},{"Title":"Sarah Ban Breathnach's Mrs. Sharp's Traditions: Art of Domestic Bliss","review":"This is an excellent book!

Although initially intrigued by the &quot;legends&quot;, those I checked looked stupid to me ... e.g., about how a pansy's petals tell the story of how a wicked queen mistreats her stepdaughters, with no positive (much less fairytale) ending, nothing remotely uplifting, no moral, etc. DEFINITELY not the type of thing you'd print to give with a pressed flower pansy, or other form of the flower. The recipes are equally impractical, since few people use suet in desserts these days.And all the stories in the voice of the mythical Mrs. Sharp just seemed stupid and contrived. Although the premise was excellent, the book just didn't follow through."},{"Title":"Sarah Ban Breathnach's Mrs. Sharp's Traditions: Art of Domestic Bliss","review":"Probably through no fault of her own, the author writes from the voice of a middle or upper class perspective. As a low-income homeschooling mom, I felt frustrated with how many of \\"Mrs. Sharp's\\" suggestions read like an old-fashioned Martha Stewart-style advertisement. This is no big surprise if you realize that the author got most of her ideas from a trunkful of antique victorian-era ladies magazines (quoted liberally throughout the book). Apparently women's magazines have always had that cutesy-positive \\"you should just buy this/make that/organize the other thing and your life will be soooo happy!\\"Here's a quote describing the fictitious Mrs. Sharp: \\"wearing a pretty apron to putter in while she tidied her house as she listened to opera, using freshly laundered Irish-linen dish towels to make her glasses sparkle, or writing down her voluminous \\"To Do\\" lists in enchanting floral notebooks tied with a ribbon.\\"What about wearing old jeans and stained shirts to do the farm chores in, putting on a library-copy Swan Lake CD so the ballet-loving kids can dance while I'm making breakfast, wondered where I am going to get more washcloths after the threadbare ones finally get tossed out, and using the back of an old shopping list for phone messages? I was hoping to get some good ideas on incorporating ritual and routine into our lives, and while there are a few of these, for the most part I get totally sunk reading about how I should have a \\"Rainy day cupboard\\" that only gets opened on rainy days. Where am I going to get a house big enough for a cupboard dedicated entirely to rainy day projects?Here's my favorite idea: On April Fool's Day, kids and adults switch rolls, so the adults act like children and the children take care of the adults. That sounds like fun, and it doesn't cost any money, or require infrastructure that is out of our reach. Thank goodness! And too bad this is one of very few ideas that don't need bought materials.Also, if you are not Christian, you may have trouble with the repeated references to prayer, godliness, and Christian holidays. These references are accepted within the text as cultural mainstream fact, and not looked upon in an anthropological way.I should have just stuck with \\"Circle Round\\" and decided I had enough holiday ideas."},{"Title":"Intentions (Bonibooks)","review":"One day this summer I went Wild about Wilde!

Included in it are four essays: \\"The Decay of Lying,\\" \\"Pen, Pencil and Poison,\\" \\"The Critic as Artist,\\" and \\"The Truth of Masks.\\"\\"The Decay of Lying\\" -- from 1889 -- is an essay couched as a dialogue that Wilde once called it a \\"trumpet against the gate of dullness.\\" The substance revolves around Wilde's Aestheticism, and he argues (through one character and another) that Art is superior to Nature. . . .\\"Pen, Pencil and Poison\\" -- from 1889 -- is a biographical essay on the notorious writer, murderer, and forger Thomas Griffiths Wainewright, who used the pen name \\"Janus Weathercock,\\" and here Wilde puts forward the notion that that Wainewright's criminality reveals the soul of a true artist.In \\"The Critic as Artist,\\" -- 1890 -- The Wilde's contends that critics must reach beyond the creative work that he considers.\\"The Truth of Masks\\" (1885) is an argumentative response to an article of Edward George Bulwer-Lytton's which put forward the notion that Shakespeare had little interest in the costumes that his characters wore.Brilliant and (as always) so well put, Wilde is a joy to read - food for the mind and soul. This is a nice well put together edition - all Wilde lovers well want."},{"Title":"Intentions (Bonibooks)","review":"First, this is a lovely edition and well worth the money, and it arrived right on time, actually faster than I expected.Second, the book.Not just a wit, Wilde was an intellectual power house. You don't have to agree with him on everything, just enjoy his ability to make his own argument. In \\"Pen, Pencil and Poison\\", read how Wilde playfully argues the question, 'is a criminal an artist?' Fascinating!Superior book, lots of wit and it will stretch your mind."},{"Title":"Intentions (Bonibooks)","review":"During a timid spring day inside a small library somewhere in Nottinghamshire, there is an ongoing debate about the philosophical meaning of Art.Cyril is a cultured man a lover of art it seems that he lives inside a painting , he usually describe in detail what there is around him entranced by the beautiful of the nature.Vivian on the contrary is a girl of essence; her vision of the world is characterized by cause and effect, everything is well organized, by the mother nature.Her philosophy is those of a world in decadence where every behavior is dictated by our selfishness rather than appreciation of things.In the first pages of this short story, there is an interesting debate in telling that nature and visual art are two different and incompatible entities, in the sense that a paintings is nothing else that the perception of the artist.A painting is nothing else the visual preferences of the artist that does not represent the image or better the intrinsic message of the observer.Vivian is writing an interesting article \\"The Decay of Lying\\" for a prestigious and intellectual magazine.Her personal consideration of the visual art has not a positive valence, because according to her thought a painting is nothing else that a personal projection of a particular detail, chose by the artist, without considering its complex context.This does not happen regarding the novels as a tool for analyzing people under different and variegate point of views, with a risk of nullify supported by her phrase;\\"The more one analyses people, the more all reasons for analysis disappear\\"The essence of this phrase is the description of a complex and interconnected world, where everything must be defined in detail like a surgeon.In my opinion for her the art is a sort of metaphor of the modern world that is going to in the wrong direction, for instance the art under the metaphysical prospective is a sort of Darwinism where the main risk is for the next generations which will be based on the art to judge their present.The main reason is that the \\"Art never express anything but itself\\" in brief the art will influence the realism giving a negative social model, the art does not represent what the artists see but they depict the ideology of the commitment.CheersItalo"},{"Title":"Intentions (Bonibooks)","review":"Building up my library so no time to read-then-review but looks good at first glance.

Each of the 9 chapters of the book offers intuitive insight while developing the main text and it does so without lacking in rigor. The first 6 chapters (which deal with manifolds, vector fields and dynamical systems, Riemannian metrics, Riemannian connections and geodesics, curvature and tensors and differential forms) make up an introduction to dynamical systems and Morse theory (the subject of chapter 8). Chapter 7 is devoted to fixed points and intersection numbers. The last chapter is an introduction to hyperbolic systems.This enjoyable and highly instructive book contains a large number of examples and exercises. It is an incredible help to those trying to learn dynamical systems (and not only). It teaches all the differential geometry and topology notions that somebody needs in the study of dynamical systems.The authors, without making use of a pedantic formalism, emphasize the connection of important ideas via examples. It completely enhanced my knowledge on the subject and took me to a higher level of understanding."},{"Title":"Differential Geometry and Topology: With a View to Dynamical Systems (Studies in Advanced Mathematics)","review":"It was a great pleasure to read the book &#8220;Differential Geometry and Topology With a View to Dynamical Systems&#8221; by Keith Burns and Marian Gidea. The topic of manifolds and its development, typically considered as &#8220;very abstract and difficult&#8221;, becomes for the reader of this outstanding book tangible and familiar. This joyful aspect of the book was achieved by the authors by setting the advanced material of differential geometry and topology as if on a &#8220;mobile bridge&#8221; or a &#8220;crossroad&#8221; that associates a(n) (primarily) unfamiliar abstract part of the text with elementary math theories. The latter pedagogical approach was mostly carried out through carefully prepared examples, in which, for essentially abstract structures and mathematical topics, well known familiar elementary settings serve as obvious motivations, which make the transition to a higher level of an abstraction smooth. Nevertheless, the scope of the main topic in this book, differential geometry and topology, is pretty far advanced. Besides the basic theory, centered around analytical properties of manifolds (mostly endowed with additional, in particular Riemannian, structures and vector or tensor fields defined on them) and their applications, it also provides a good introductory approach to some deeper topics of differential topology such as Fixed Points theory, Morse theory, and hyperbolic systems throughout the rest of the book.The main stream of the applications that always follow or motivate the theoretical context is dynamical systems. Excellent examples reveal the close ties of this beautiful mathematical theory with common problems in theoretical physics, classical and fluid mechanics, field theory, and, most importantly, the theory of general relativity.The book by Burns and Gidea is also be strongly recommended for those readers who wish to enhance their mathematical tools to make possible a deeper insight into these fascinating physical theories.Jerzy K.

(For readers unfamiliar with Zevi, a brief summary: in the mid-1660s, Jews throughout the world came to believe Zevi was the Messiah; after being threatened with execution by the Ottoman Empire, Zevi converted to Islam. Nevertheless, some Jews continued to believe in him until the 19th century).Scholem proposes two possible causes for the survival of Sabbatianism after Zevi's apostasy. First, 17th-century kabbalah (the Jewish mystical tradition) saw Messianic renewal not just as a nationalist rebirth of a Jewish state, but as a more spiritual process transforming all of creation, ultimately leading to Messianic deliverance. Scholem speculates that kabbalism made it easier for Jews to trust their own personal experiences over historical reality; as a result, some Jews could not admit \\"that their own personal experience had been false and untrustworthy.\\" Moreover, many Jews had left countries (most notably Spain) where they were forced to practice Judaism in secret; thus, they found it easy to believe that Zevi was doing the same.Scholem also addresses the Sabbatians' split-up into multiple factions. \\"Moderate\\" Sabbatians continued to follow halacha (Jewish law) believing that they were bound to do so until Messianic deliverance reappeared. But more radical Sabbatians either followed Zevi's lead by apostasizing, and/or by secretly rejecting halacha (Jewish law). The radicals believed that since the Messiah had come, the commandments of the Torah were abrogated, based on the idea of a \\"mystical Torah\\" of absolute freedom predating creation. Some radicals even suggested that Zevi (or even later Sabbatian leaders) was an incarnation of God. But as the memories of Zevi grew fainter and fainter, Sabbatianism decayed; some Sabbatians assimilated into Christianity and Islam, while in the 19th century, others embraced secularism or Reform Judaism.Like Sabbatians, Hasidim embraced mysticism. But they focused on individual redemption rather than universal social redemption, thus reducing the temptation to expect imminent messianic deliverance. Scholem also points out that both Sabbatians and Hasidim embraced the concept of leaders \\"descending in order to rise\\" into the world of the less-holy. Where Sabbatians saw the \\"descent\\" of their Messiah as apostasy or as violations of halacha, Hasidim saw their rebbes \\"descending\\" into the realm of the mundane by teaching and leading their flock (rather than engaging in solitary communion with the Divine).Most of the last third of the book is less interesting than Scholem's essays on Sabbatianism and Hasidism; to a greater extent than the first few, they focus on issues which require a very high level of cultural literacy (such as a book review of a now-obscure book, or a discussion of Martin Buber's German translation of the Torah). A fortunate exception is Scholem's essay on the Star of David; he shows that the hexagram was not a purely Jewish symbol until the 14th century, when the Jews of Prague placed it on a flag (perhaps because its use on magical amulets was then common). The symbol did not spread to eastern Europe until the 19th century, when the emancipated Jews of Europe wanted to show their respectability by having a symbol in their synagogues as simple to understand as the Christian cross."},{"Title":"The Messianic idea in Judaism and other essays on Jewish spirituality","review":"A fascinating collection of lectures. The discussion of some of the more bizarre, and yet intellectual followers of Shabtai Zvi into the 20th century is amazing. I had never understood antinomianism, but Scholem explains the thinking and rationale behind it brilliantly."},{"Title":"The Messianic idea in Judaism and other essays on Jewish spirituality","review":"The large majority of this book discusses the rise and fall of messianism through the medieval period and how it affects Judaism today. There are also other essays present that discuss the history of the Star of David symbolism and the mystical golems.The author presents the case of how Sabbatianism and Hasidism influenced the messianic themes that are prevalent in today's Judiasm. Some of the more interesting readings cover the notion of Sabbatianism and its transformation to a sect that believes in a messiah that pointed the way to redemption through sin as a result of its heretical leadership.Identifying some of the religious inadequacies of Sabbatianism and how they gave rise to Hasidism and the notion of a messianism that focuses on self and personal redemption, the author presents a plausible argument worthy of serious debate for years to come."},{"Title":"Sonnets from the Portuguese","review":"Barrett Browning's sonnet sequence is far from the sloppy, sentimental doggerel it has been made out to be. Instead, the poems examinge Barrett Browning's guilt over her brother's death, her awakening passion for Robert Browning, and her fear of an inability to love.

To read them, so intimately sweet as they seem, is almost to feel EBB herself there, her small form snuggling happily in your arms. Of course nobody would have known better than EBB herself what dulcet love songs these sonnets were, since she had never intended them for publication. They were secret, often quite confessional, love poems she wrote about her Robert while he was courting her, all unawares, and then for awhile after their marriage, in which they continued carrying on as two of recorded history's most passionate lovebirds.It was only after Robert Browning somehow discovered and read them that he managed to convince EBB that they were really too good not to be published. He was right, of course. Even so, Elizabeth was sensitive enough about the matter to want to screen the work off under a somewhat misdirecting title. SONNETS FROM THE PORTUGESE might hope to create a casual impression that they were foreign translations of some mysterious sort ... which, of course, obviously they aren't, but who's philologically analysing; read and enjoy!In fact, the name settled on was a mere lover's in-joke.

Its 246 pages are a granola bar packed with nutritious examples that help the ethnocentric business professional taste the reality and consequences of cultural difference. The breadth of the book is surprising, given its size. It touches on just about everything, and does so in a hands-on, practical way.Hodge briefly sets up the case for why we should busy ourselves about culture by surveying its critical role in business success and failure in the age of globalization. She offers no extensive intercultural theory. It lurks in the background, but is almost transparent to the end user. While there is the obligatory chapter on \\"What is Culture?\\" it is a scant 7 pages long.The rest of the book is how to: how to manage everything from entertaining to expatriation and culture shock, how to communicate and negotiate, and even how not to take a bribe. She explodes myths about women abroad. Hodge may venture into the university from time to time in real life, and her tools as a trainer often show up in the illustrations, but it is clear that she has both feet solidly planted in the world of making it work.Often a touch of humor, always a carefully chosen short anecdote to bring a point home-these in themselves are Global Smarts, as modeled in the book. It is definitely written for US Americans, at least if one defines them as people coming from or framed by the dominant values of the US business world. It talks their language, even at times their slang. Of course, US Americans are very, very diverse, but if we assume that those who are part of a culture, though they may not be always hold or act out its values, at least recognize them, then the target audience is right for the book.Global Smarts is too rich to absorb in a sitting--even on the non-stop from Chicago to Seoul--though a worthy companion for the flight. Rather than breaking new ground per se, the book applies mature intercultural knowledge to common and critical situations, and that will break new ground for many US businesspeople.No doubt more books on succeeding globally will be written, but, in a sense, this one sums up both the possibilities and the limitations of the print medium. As a book, it is a personal, engaging, and satisfying individual experience. On the other hand, despite a good index, it is just begging to be an online resource, with the anecdotes turned into vignettes, with interactive ways of testing comprehension and reactions and comparing ones experiences and feelings with others, and hypertext to take you where you need to learn, instantly."},{"Title":"Global Smarts: The Art of Communicating and Deal Making Anywhere in the World","review":"I teach a college course on cross-cultural business, and I have used this book as one of my textbooks for the past 2 years.

In the center of the story stands an eccentric, introverted boy called Birdy, who's entire life is driven by an obsession with birds, and a dream - to fly and be free. The book opens with Birdy in a military mental hospital, traumatized by his experiences in WWII. His childhood friend, Al, has been called over to try and bring Birdy back to reality. At a loss of what to do, Al begins telling Birdy stories from their childhood, and recounting all the adventures they lived through together. Through Al's narrations and the remembrances they trigger in Birdy, the fascinating story of a most unlikely friendship unfolds. Al is a handsome, athletic Italian girl-chaser, with an abusive father and an obsessive need to prove himself. Birdy on the other hand, is a wild spirit. You can sense throughout the story how he feels caged, and reveres the birds he sees to be free. He constucts an aviary and raises canaries in his bedroom, studying them, learning their language, getting to know each one personally, and losing himself in their world. The descriptions of the canaries are so intense that the reader himself feels as though they are human, or he is a bird. Birdy is an amazing character - brave, self confident, a mechanical genius, who struggles to fit himself into human life, but who's mind works in a completely different way than anyone else's. The book tells the extraordinary story of the two friends, and is simply a pleasure to read and a refreshing change from the conventional."},{"Title":"Birdy","review":"I first read BIRDY when it was published in 1978; I was going into the ninth grade. Since that fist reading, I have read it two other times--once in college while pretending to work at the library and once just recently for a book club I'm in. It is an amazingly memorable book about friendship and war and our definition of what is sane. Some of the scenes are so vivid that they have become a part of my own memory. I have explored other books by William Wharton, but none of them have equalled BIRDY. (DAD and MIDNIGHT CLEAR are also worth reading, though.) I remember the first copy I bought had a blurb on the front cover which read, &quot;a classic for readers not yet born.&quot; I hope those words come true."},{"Title":"Birdy","review":"This is an incredible and beautifully told tale of friendship, sanity(&amp; insanity,) obsession and the horrors of war. The second reading is even better! As a bird lover and owner, I especially enjoyed the details of what the experience of being a bird is really like. I can only suppose that William Wharton has spent time as a bird, or has some very close friends who are birds and were willing to describe the experience of &quot;birdness&quot; to him for this book. The story of friendship and growing up is quite moving and enjoyable with much humor and insight. The section dealing with the boys' job as dogcatchers should be skipped or abridged by the squeamish, (or animal lovers, such as my spouse, who take fiction for reality too easily!) Highly recommended! Two enthusiastic wings up! (P.S. Also recommended; &quot;Dad&quot; by William Wharton.)"},{"Title":"Birdy","review":"Birdy, as a novel, does not so much tell the story of friendship and its associated triumphs, or eleviate common support for the horrors of war. Instead, Birdy acts as a wake-up call for traditional notions of insanity, human behaviour and the traditional belief that individuals, as varied and complex as they are, can be labeled.&quot;We all have our own private kinds of craziness. If it gets in the way of enough people, they call you crazy.&quot;Birdy is a disturbing insight into the minds of two men, each effected by the past, war and their own calculated decisions as rare individuals. I believe it makes the reader think twice before labeling the people that occupy their lives. Such a positive result can be no better applauded by a second reading .. and a third .. and a fourth.&quot;Sometimes you cant take it anymore yourself, so you tell somebody else you're crazy and they agree to take care of you.&quot;-Dade"},{"Title":"Birdy","review":"Thats right. One of the best books I have ever read. I have already purchased some 5 copies for my friends - to share the beauty of the book with them too.

There are many concepts discovered here, and it makes the reader ponder. Issues such as war, friendship, love, dreams, insanity and sanity.I especially got involved in Birdy's dream. I am a bit of a dreamer too. He goes onto explore the fact that maybe we living now, is a dream. And the dream that both you and I will have tonight, is actually our real life. I liked this view.Buy the book, its very much out of the ordinary, and I hope you really enjoy it as much as I did! Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"Birdy","review":"I just happened upon this book in my school's library one day last week. I decided to get it out if only because my own facination with flight seemed somewhat similar to the storyline. I read the whole thing that day, and I still can't get it out of my mind. I went back to the library maybe hoping for a sequel (I always do that), but since there was none I got out the only other Wharton books they had: Dad and A Midnight Clear. While they were both great books and I enjoyed them greatly (even though I'm usually a strictly scifi fan and this really far from my range), none of them are even half as good as Birdy. Theres something about that book that makes you think about it long after you've turned the last page. Now I need to get the movie."},{"Title":"Birdy","review":"I've read a lot of books in my day, but Birdy is easily one of the most memorable. A traumatized World War II veteran trapped in a VA hospital stays sane solely through his preternaturally detailed recollections of raising canaries as a teenager--and through the perfect loyalty of his closest friend.Wharton's better known World War II novel, A Midnight Clear, comes nowhere near this one in terms of originality and emotional truth.Birdy is a beautifully written, most unclassifiable story, unsentimental, sometimes painful, but extraordinarily life-affirming and imagination-affirming. Some day it will be recognized as a genuine classic of American fiction."},{"Title":"Birdy","review":"I saw the film \\"Birdy\\" twice when it first came out. At that time I did not yet have any of my own birds, but I was captivated by the storyline and especially by Matthew Modine's character in the title role. Since then I have become a caregiver to my own flock of budgies and can see myself in the role of Birdy to a certain extent, especially in the shared view that birds should be free and not forced to live in a cage for humans' entertainment.Over a quarter century after seeing the movie, I decided to read the novel Birdy by William Wharton. Birdy drew me in from the first page. I usually struggle through the first pages of any new novel, acquainting myself with characters, plotlines and the author's writing style. With Birdy, as I turned from page one to two, it felt as natural and as engaging as turning from page 301 to 302.Birdy is told from two points of view, that of Alfonso Columbato (played in the movie by Nicolas Cage) and \\"Birdy\\", his childhood friend whose real name is never revealed. The text distinguishes the two, with Alfonso's in normal type and Birdy's in italics. Alfonso and Birdy seem to be an unlikely pair since they are opposites in every way (physical appearance, popularity with girls, sports prowess) yet are lifelong best friends.Birdy and Alfonso start to breed pigeons, and they build five-star aviaries for them. Birdy grows to develop an obsession with the birds, and Alfonso notices that he is becoming birdlike in his appearance and behaviour. Birdy builds bird models, flying machines and he even exercises for hours each day to develop his arms for flying in the future.After Alfonso abandons the hobby, Birdy takes it to the next level and beyond. Birdy decides to care for canaries and then sets up an elaborate aviary in his own bedroom as he develops a lucrative breeding program. Birdy grows as an adolescent with a bird's-eye view of the world. Alfonso sets him up with a prom date and Birdy reluctantly agrees to go, much to the delight of his parents who are thrilled to see him take an interest in something and someone other than his birds. If only. The girl Alfonso sets him up with, Doris, has a reputation which is anything but virtuous and throws herself all over Birdy after the prom is over. Birdy, however, does not look at Doris as a sexual young woman but instead compares her physical appearance and behaviour to the attributes of his canaries. He gets out of having sex with Doris by claiming that he wants to save his virginity for his wife.Birdy does, in a way, save himself for his \\"wife\\". At night he has erotic dreams but not about girls. He fantasizes about one of his newest female canaries, Perta. They nest together and hatch several clutches of eggs. At this point late in the novel it gets boring, as Birdy confuses his reality as a young man with his version of reality being married to Perta. The chapter goes on far too long and furthermore, there is another dream within this dream which made it all the more confusing trying to distinguish between the two.Both Alfonso are drafted in WWII. This is changed to the Vietnam War in the movie, and I did not realize the time change until later on in the book, after noticing the primitive creature comforts each boy was living with. When I realized the novel was taking place in the 1940's and not the 1970's, it all made sense. Alfonso is disfigured in the war, and Wharton's description of bodies sliced apart by bombs and skin peeling off and eyeballs popping out of sockets left me wincing on the bus with limbs restlessly probing the air. I haven't read anything as gruesome since American Psycho. I read these war scenes while commuting and could not go on any further at times. The last thing I wanted was to faint while on a bus of all places.Birdy suffers from wartime post-traumatic stress and is institutionalized. He believes he is a bird, squats like a bird and can only be fed like a baby bird. Alfonso is contacted by Birdy's mother to see if he can help her son in any way. Alfonso, heavily bandaged and barely able to talk, reluctantly agrees to try to bring Birdy back to reality by triggering memories of the times they had spent together. This is the basis for the movie: the boys' reminiscences while Alfonso and Birdy are in the mental institution.I likely enjoyed Birdy more since I have become a bird owner like the lead character. The rituals that we must go through: cleaning cages, washing the toys, feeding and talking to the birds made me feel that it could have been me Wharton was writing about. That Birdy and me are both social misfits did not go unnoticed. The descriptions Wharton gives of canary breeding and bird habitat leave me with the impression that he himself must have first-hand knowledge of the subject. I want to borrow the library's copy of the \\"Birdy\\" DVD and revisit the movie that I fell in love with twenty-five years ago."},{"Title":"Birdy","review":"Birdy is William Wharton's 1978 novel about life's biggest issues - love, friendship, death, and (above all) finding meaning. Though I believe that there are a few flaws in the book, I strongly recommend it to readers. Birdy is very good - and like nothing else that I have ever read.The plot concerns two young friends - Birdy and Al - and their experiences in high school and World War II. Birdy is a strange boy who obsesses over the birds he keeps in his back yard. Birdy believes that he can fly, if only he can understand the birds well enough. Al is an Italian-American boy who present himself as a jock, a tough guy. The novel reveals, however, that Al actually is a deep, sensitive person. Wharton does an excellent job of developing the characters of Birdy and Al. The unlikely relationship between the two men is a central part of Birdy.What makes Birdy remarkable, however, is something else. If the story described only the friendship between Birdy and Al, Birdy would be a good novel, but nothing special. What makes Birdy unique is that Wharton uses the story to ask us to consider the ways that we lives our lives. Birdy's desire to fly, then, is a symbol of his desire to live a meaningful, \\"elevated\\" life.It is these little pieces of philosophy that make Birdy so special. Consider the following lines from Birdy: \\"I have the feeling you could pull all the feathers out of him and he could still fly. He flies because he isn't afraid and not just because it's what birds are supposed to do. He flies as an act of personal creation, defiance\\" (page 77).There are a few negatives in Birdy. Readers who are not interested in birds will find that the narrative drags a bit in places.The best thing about Birdy is that it is different. It took nerve to write a book like this, and I admire Wharton's courage. Birdy will \\"stay with\\" its readers. For those seeking something different, it is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Birdy","review":"\\"Birdy\\" has been often compared to such novels as Heller's Catch-22, the tendency for the book to be read as a war novel was strengthened by the movie based on the novel in 1985, directed by Alan Parker, which moved the time of its action to the days of the Vietnam War. The book, however, concentrates on the issues of adolescence, growing up, and reaching maturity.\\"Birdy\\" tells a story of two friends Al and Birdy who met in pre-war Philadelphia and who friendship survives the war when Al is invited to a mental ward where Birdy is kept after his traumatic war-time experiences which which brought about his mental-breakdown. The reader becomes gradually acquainted with their adventures in flash-backs and witnesses Birdy re-awakening.The book rings true both a nostalgic description of the pre-war working class US which no longer exists, a chronicle of friendship and a description of mental disorder. Must read - you can follow the reading with the movie and there is Peter Gabriel's CD to accompany the novel!"},{"Title":"Birdy","review":"Just as Moby Dick is not all about whales, Birdy is not allabout pigeons and canaries. In the novel, two young boys inpre-WW II Philadelphia become strange but geniune friendsand grow to manhood sharing wonderful and bitter experiences.That many of these experiences center around the charatcerBirdy's desire to fly and become even more birdier is onlypart of the story.Told in a wonderful original style that gracefully shiftsin narrative perspective and language, the novel -- like abird in flight -- soars to uncommon heights from which wesee life from a new view.Fantastic and artful writing."},{"Title":"Birdy","review":"I will quickly say that although this is somewhat of an acclaimed book I can't seem to get through it. This has been one of the few times in my life that I couldn't finish a book. It's so uneven I couldn't follow the plot. I will say this: this book is different and that's not necessarily a bad thing. It's a friendship story and a good one in the sense that it's unlike a conventional one. I just can't seem to digest what the author is getting at.(Hey, I didn't go to Harvard and I'm not going to pretend that I know everything under the sun.) I'm sure others will love this book, I didn't. I'll give the author the benefit of the doubt and give two stars because I didn't finish it.

I put, &quot;BIRDY&quot; away for a while, and didn't get a chance to read it untill I started to commute on the subway to school. I couldn't put it down! This book is so inspiring! The tale of Birdy and Al is as real as it gets. If you like birds and WWII, then you must pick up this great book! I caught a glimpse of the &quot;BIRDY&quot; the movie on a idependent film channel..but now I'm dying to check it out!"},{"Title":"Birdy","review":"I have to say, I feel the entire world has missed the point of William Wharton's book, Birdy. It took me nearly to the end of the book before it hit me like an explosion, what the book was about. It is a metaphor, not literal. \\"Are we sleep-walking through our waking state or wake-walking through our dreams?\\" Who do we think we are? If you are minded to believe the theory that we are both the creator and the created, that we are the creator's dream, and that we dream within the dream.... that through lucid dreaming we can change our dreams to how we want things to be (I have managed this on occasion), thus in our 'waking state' dream we can apply the same principles. I could go on paragraphs and pages, but I think everyone should re-read the book. Wharton has produced an incredibly deep and profound explanation of the Great Mystery of Being. It is not about friendship, suffering or war, it is much much more deep and profound. I'd like to lead you back to the water. Drink this time."},{"Title":"Birdy","review":"Birdy a skinny kid obsessed with birds and flying, and his muscled atheletic friend intrested in girls are an unlikely pair, yet they spent much time together growing up having interesting experiences as boys. They keep pigeons for a while then Birdy becomes obsessed with canaries. He builds an avariy and breeds canaries. He spends hours watching them wishing he could fly, could be a bird himself. He falls in love with a female canary, Perta, and nightly dreams that he is a canary and is Perta's mate. They raise a dream family.Birdy and Al join the army in world war II. Birdy ends up in a mental ward, catonic and acting like a bird. Al is badly injured and is sent back to the States for operations and plastic surgery. Al visits Birdy in the mental ward and talks to him eventually bringing him out of his catatonic-birdlike state. They both have discovered things about themselves they don't like to face, but they talk things out and help each other to face the their futures.There are discriptions of horrible combat which have a viceral impact on the reader. Why must mankind throw their young men in front of cannons, mines, machine guns, sharpnel? It is horrible.A facinating readable book."},{"Title":"Birdy","review":"The story is that of two men who have known each other since childhood, both of whom are locked up in a military hospital. The book goes back and forth between present day and the past. The past mostly involved one of the boy's obsession with breeding canaries and learning how to fly. This is the kind of book with a plot I don't even want to discuss because if you knew what it was about you'd likely have no interest in it. 10 pages of detailed descriptions of tending to canary breeding? It should be dull but it isn't. It's fascinating, and engaging, and everything an exceptional book should be. This is definitely a very unique book, but one that manages to be unique without the use of gimmicks or manipulation. The narrative voice reminded me very much of John Irving, and overall it was a surprisingly exceptional read."},{"Title":"Birdy","review":"This is a wonderful novel about a boy who, in many ways, is bird-like. He thinks he is a bird and wants to fly. His obsession with birds ultimately lands him in a psychiatric institution after World War I. This book is told partially through the eyes of a friend who tries to revive him from his catatonic birdlike state.The writing is beautiful and this book is one to be treasured."},{"Title":"Birdy","review":"If a book is really true, you'll always need it. You'll always come back to it. \\"Birdy\\" is one of those books; my copy is a yellowed and dog-earred paperback with the front cover torn off, yet I find myself year after year coming back to the novel, digging into it, nibbling on its tasty paragraphs, savoring its language and cool understanding of the world. I'm convinced that \\"Birdy\\" will rank one day as a truly original American classic, right up there with Salinger's \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" and Kesey's \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.\\" There's so much energy and passion in the story: it literally overwhelms. You live inside the character of Birdy as you listen, all ears, to a guy named Al speaking about his friend. You begin to soar, to fly, to be free, just as Birdy is trying to be all those things himself. Truly an extraordinary work!-Tom Maremaa, Author of the Forthcoming novel \\"Metal Heads\\" from Kunati Books in Spring 2009"},{"Title":"Birdy","review":"\\"Birdy\\" is a novel with a shared narrative; on the one hand there is Al, and on the other there is Birdy himself. This is one of the specificities of the book. Birdy as a character is quite interesting in his weirdo/loner/genius/freak kind of personality, and because of the divided narration, you get both the outer and inner approach on his obsession, birds, and flying.On the whole, this is a very readable book, and quite enjoyable. Not a page is a bore and one cannot get enough of Birdy's featherly obsession and how far it will go.However, the ending left me rather unsatisfied. I thought it starkly contrasted with the rest of the novel and didn't live up to everything that came before; as if something deep was ended on a joke.Another critic concerns the back of the book, where you find the following words: \\"While fighting in World War II, they find their dreams become all too real - and their lives are changed forever.\\" Well, that gave me the idea that these two friends would end up fighting together in Europe or something and the birdness of Birdy would come into play. Contrary to those lines, there is very little concerning World War II - although there are a few pages of Al's warring, there is almost nothing of Birdy's. So do not put too many hopes there. I never really trust blurbs, but I still find it stunning that so many of them tell things that are just wrong.This being said, and excluding the ending (of which I'm not too hot but in general, not the final lines, which aren't so bad), this is a good read. I never was all that crazy about birds, but this novel was very informative as far as canaries are concerned; and bird life in general. The psychological aspects of Birdy (whose real name I don't think ever comes up, which I like because it's as if his birdness erased his human identity) are also of interest; for instance, Birdy prefers birds to people, he even fantasises sexually about birds rather than girls. It's fantastically weird."},{"Title":"Birdy","review":"I enjoyed this book, this novel was apart of my major assignment where I contrast the novel with it conterpart (the movie) I found the novel to be touching.

The pacing is good, and the Yale setting interesting, but Thomas's characters are one cardboard trope after another. She relies much too much on archetypes: the nosy amateur detective, the &quot;things are not what they seem&quot; academic, the repressed blue bloods, the obnoxious rich people, the chic and lovably eccentric grad student, the dysfunctional gay man, the angry activist, and the oversexed blonde. I cared little about any of the characters, felt almost no dramatic build-up, no tension, no suspense. Why have others lavished such praise on this barely adequate book?It's hard to take seriously a mystery that is prefaced by three pages of &quot;acknowledgements&quot; and ends with an extensive list of the author's non-literary achievements. Is Thomas's role as a trailblazer supposed to insulate her from criticism of her cliched characters and suspenseless plotting? I was a little put off by being reminded of how Thomas was the first this and the first that, and how she's on the board of this and on the committee for that. Who cares? She's not writing a memoir, she's writing a mystery novel.I hope she does better with her in-the-works Princeton mystery (which is based on the defection of Cornel West from Princeton to Harvard). As a minority alum of that school, I look forward to reading her spin on it--but I must say that my expectations are not high."},{"Title":"BLUE BLOOD (Ivy League Mysteries)","review":"After reading Thomas-grahm's first mystery at Harvard (Darker Shade of Crimson), I was eager to see if she could capture the conflicts of race and gender at Yale. She's done it brilliantly in &quot;Blue Blood&quot;. The Harvard book was more of a challenge to read because it did not move as quickly as Blue Blood's story line. What I liked most about this book was that it really told you how black women have a foot in two worlds when they are trying to succeed in the mostly white and male world of the Ivy League. I know that there are a lot of black folks (including myself) who originally were suspicious of Thomas-Grahm's writing because we see her in TV interviews, on covers of business magazines and read her bio. I hate to admit it, but after reading about her 3 Harvard degrees, her Phi beta kappa, her Harvard Law Review, her lawyer/writer husband (he wrote about the black upper class--&quot;Our Own Kind of People&quot;) her McKensey consulting firm partner stuff, her opera board and her first black running a division of NBC yadda yadda, I wanted to hate her because I was so jealous. Then I read her book and I said &quot;Wow!&quot; I realized that not only does she write really well, but it occurred to me that we're always complaining that talented blacks are never given their due. Well, I can say that here is a black renaissance woman that deserves what she's got. We should be proud of her rather than cutting her down. &quot;Blue Blood&quot; was a great book and it would be an even better movie. Thomas-grahm really understands how to write about the integrated world that so many of us middle class blacks have to deal with. She also seems to know a lot about the upperclass WASP world. Her books introduced me to a whole new world of campus intrigue. Great stuff."},{"Title":"BLUE BLOOD (Ivy League Mysteries)","review":"Although I read the book in a matter of hours, I was a little disappointed in the authors writing style and depth of delivery given her list of accomplishments ( contained extensively on the last page of the book) I would like to have seen more thought go into the development of her characters. Notwithstanding the story lines' focus on the death of a &quot;typical white female&quot;, I was somewhat disappointed that the author did not see fit to put at least one positive black male role model in the book. After all, I am sure there is one in the New Haven area! Just reminded me of Nancy Drew novels that I read some 20 years ago. Not particulary appealing to mature audiences."},{"Title":"BLUE BLOOD (Ivy League Mysteries)","review":"I usually don't like the idea of seeing my favorite murder mysteries turned into movies, but by the time I finished reading &quot;Blue Blood&quot;, I was ready to go to the video store and rent the movie!(hope one is in the works) Not only was this a clever story, but it was great to see a smart Nikki Chase go head-to-head with rich Yale alums as well as aggressive black ministers without losing her sense of humor and without turning into a ball-busting man-hating woman. Nikki is classy, smart and very funny. I first heard of author Thomas-Grahm when People Magaizine picked her first book &quot;Darker Shade of Crimson&quot; as &quot;page-turner of the month&quot;, but I figured she'd only be able to write about life at Harvard--where she went and where she set the first book. But I went to Yale, and I can tell you she really got our school right. I'm embarassed to say that I was one of those white Yalies who really was afraid of the black people who lived outside campus in New Haven. The author balances the race issues, class issues and a supremely clever murder of the blonde, conservative professor that we all kind of loved to hate. I'm looking forward to the next volume in the author's &quot;Ivy League Mystery Books&quot;. My husband went to Dartmouth, so we'll be on the look out."},{"Title":"BLUE BLOOD (Ivy League Mysteries)","review":"I found the characters to be one-dimensional. They were either all good or all bad.

Pamela went to Harvard; I went to Yale. And I can only say I hope she did better by her own alma mater than she did by mine. Sorry, Pam, but you blew it. The book is a swift read, but mostly because it's so pat, so facile. Many of the details of the Yale campus and the city of New Haven are accurate, but so much is just wrong and sloppy and badly researched that it was hard to take anything seriously. One main character is described in one chapter as a stage manager at the Yale Rep and in a later chapter as a set designer (and his alibi for the night of the crime is that he was in NYC buying costumes). No, no and no. That's just bad research or bad writing. If you are going to write about a real place, you have the obligation to be accurate, and PTG is not. Designers at the Yale Rep are usually students at the Yale Drama School; a stage manager has nothing to do with designing the sets or the costumes; the set designer wouldn't go anywhere near the costumes; NO ONE in a professional theater company has time the day of an opening night to be hanging around their apartment watching Rikki Lake; and NO Yale Rep actress playing Lady Macbeth would arrive at the theater 40 minutes late because of a fight with a boyfriend. (Believe me, I've acted at the Yale Rep, and it is just way, way more professional than that... unlike Pamela Thomas-Graham's detective fiction, which is more like the self-congratulatory living-room showing off of a precious wunderkind than it is a Dashiell Hammet or Agatha Christie or Walter Mosley). But it's more than mismanaged details that deamage this book-and an apparently ongoing problem Pam T-G has with fully fleshed characters and/or time (this Nikki Chase detective does WAY too much on any given day to be believable): The plot turns on so many convenient coincidences that nothing is difficult enough to merit attention. Nikki has a penchant for overhearing conversations that explain plot points to her (and to the readers) that is just plain galling. Add to that the cardboard characters and the Introduction to Racism, Sexism, and Class in American Society &quot;politics,&quot; and it's a pretty damn annoying book. I don't what Yale did to Pamela to make her hate it so much, but in my experience (five years at Yale and in New Haven), she has not only misunderstood the place, but misrepresented it, which is a shame because the Yale/New Haven social problem (rich school, poor town) is more than a matter of snobby White WASPS vs. oppressed people of color. The Yale I lived in was open and multicultural (and even THAT was 20 years ago). I think that if you are going to call a detective series the IVY LEAGUE series, you are also required to be smart, and these books are not nearly smart enough: Call them the Community College Wanna Be Ivy League series. The most damning thing I can think of to say is that they fail utterly at the one thing great detective fiction does well, which is walk a tightrope through murky moral territory. Everything in these books is too easy for economics professor turned sleuth Nikki Chase, and everything seems far too easy for writer Pamela Thomas-Graham. Apparently the next book in the series is about Princeton. Well, I know that campus, too, and I think I'll pass on Pamela's trashing of the place. I read a lot of mysteries, and I give any writer two chances to win me over. Pamela Thomas-Graham (even her name is annoying) has had her two chances with me. I assume that the glowing reviews by others are a sad indication of just how bad most books are, and how few works of fiction (and especially popular fiction) are willing to address race, class, and gender at all. But to be so glib, so pat, so easy on yourself as a writer as Thomas-Graham has been, helps nothing."},{"Title":"BLUE BLOOD (Ivy League Mysteries)","review":"In her first book a Darker Shade of Crimson there was some sense in the story because Nikki Chase was operating in her home environment. This book deals with a murder at Yale of a righr wing law professor. It is hard to understand why Nikki even was around. It also missed the interesting characters from the earlier effort.

T-G writes very entertainingly, but her character development and plot structure leave a lot to be desired. We get only a superficial view of the characters, and the plot has too many unlikely coincidences, such as Nikki repeatedly being close enough to overhear others secretly discussing their actions or motivations yet hidden enough that they don't even realize she is there. Has the overall feel of Ludlum's books, which I also find tediously one-dimensional (although T-G can write a better sentence.) Blue Blood is more of a thriller/page-turner than a serious detective novel such as those produced by Sara Paretsky, whom T-G claims to greatly admire. There is just not enough depth here for me to recommend this to anyone."},{"Title":"BLUE BLOOD (Ivy League Mysteries)","review":"I read some of the previous reviews and while I can agree that there are some issues--Nikki's point at Yale is somewhat confused and the thing with Dante seems ambiguous and at points frustratingly random, but it was still a good read.

What I found was an excellent portrayal of New Haven, the university, and the issues that hold a certain gravity on campus.

She pulls it off without pulling punches or standing in judgement - a risky feat to say the least, which is refreshingly honest.

Assistant Professor Veronica \\"Nikki\\" Chase is the only black person in her fifty-person department at blue-blooded Harvard. Nikki knows prejudice first hand when she and a fellow black person Gary Fox were students at Yale. Their relationship ended when Gary informed her he was marrying white aristocrat Amanda Engusol.Eventually Nikki and Gary reconcile and begin to attend the GAME together. Their relationship changes again when Gary informs Nikki that Amanda has been brutally murdered. Nikki tries to comfort her friend. The killing of a prominent individual like Amanda demands a quick arrest and one of Nikki's black students is accused of the crime. Nikki and much of the black community feel the police rushed to judgment by choosing a black patsy. Nikki begins her own investigation that takes her through an ugly maze while placing her own life in danger.Pamela Thomas Graham demonstrates she fully understand the negative impact of racism on individuals. However, her female protagonist cleverly uses that learned knowledge as a tool to obtain what she wants, making Nikki a likable character playing the system for all it is worth. Ms. Graham paints campus life as a place filled with dirty tricks in which the ends justify the means.

Due to Ben Aaronovitch's hard drive crashing, it also proved to be the last NA, since publication was delayed. And what an ending! In many ways, although rescued by Kate Orman, 'So Vile a Sin' is typical Aaronovitch Doctor Who. The story is vast and huge, involving elements left behind from the Time Lord war with the Great Vampires, to the 30th century conflict between various factions in the Terran empire (home to Roz and Cwej). Manipulating everyone is a particularly nasty bunch... Because this novel comprises so many elements (from previous NAs too), it can get a bit confusing in places. Especially when the Doctor fills the ill-effects of a 'probability intercession' . This involves thousands of Doctors being created throughout time and space, each one having made a different decision than the current incumbent (i.e. like one who took Salamander's place as dictator of Earth). A multitude of Doctors is confusing enough, but the action also takes place over what seems to be a vast number of places. But the novel is never less than very entertaining. You read on, confident that these puzzles will be resolved. There are nice touches, like the inclusion of the Unitatus soldiers, but there are also irritations. The Doctor kills the Empress of the Galaxy just because she asks him to. This killing, which is later, absurdly, swept under the carpet - the Doctor could have been accused of 'treason' for not doing so - is quite reminiscent of the destruction of Skaro, but without the big guilt trip. If there's one reason for preferring Terrance Dicks, it's that his version of the Doctor doesn't do this sort of thing. A large part of the novel is also quite derivative, stealing a lot of the style of Frank Herbert's work. 'Dune' had Dukes and the Landsraad, 'So Vile a Sin' has Dukes and the Landsknetche. Still, 'Dune' could hardly be described as 'original', as it also derives from a great number of other texts, knowingly employed. The 'Dune' element seems to be continuing in the current strand of novels (i.e. 'Dead Romance'), where Chris seems to be turning into another Duncan Idaho, and maybe Babylon 5 has influenced too. This is the novel where Roz snuffs it. This may be one huge spoiler (it certainly ruined Roz's day), but the book has been out for two years, and is now out of print. This does make the end a bit mawkish though. Bernice Summerfield seems to lose all character in her diary entries, and the Doctor has a rather embarrassing heart attack at the funeral (all leading to 'Lungbarrow', I suppose). All in all, it's a glorious piece of space opera , in the style of Iain M. Banks (yes, another influence!). But it still proves that great fiction can be crafted from the deviations of derivations. In this, 'So Vile a Sin' is typically Doctor Who at its (his) best."},{"Title":"So Vile A Sin","review":"This was supposed to be the \\"It\\" novel of 1996. The Virgin \\"Doctor Who\\" New Adventures had been given their death sentence, a victim of the US TV movie which regenerated the Doctor. The NAs promptly adjusted by crafting together a series of novels which brought the 7th Doctor right up to death's door, while closing out the storylines and themes of 60 well-received books. _So Vile A Sin_ had the task of writing out companion Roz Forrester and sealing the NAs' version of \\"future history\\" with an ironic little bow.So what happened? The novel died. A victim of author Ben Aaronovitch's ambitions and the much ballyhooed \\"hard-drive crash\\" that torched the original publication date. Four subsequent Roz-free books hit the market, and indeed the Virgin license had technically expired, by the time a restored \\"Sin\\", now written by Kate Orman, hit the shelves, sans the \\"Doctor Who\\" logo.It remains to this day hard to judge just how good \\"So Vile\\" is. Orman and Aaronovitch have vastly different styles, but they essentially write to the same purpose. Their \\"joint\\" novel takes us to the ends of the Earth Empire in the late 30th century, from the moons of Jupiter to the planets of the distant sun Agammemnon, from the Time Lords' darkest secrets to the death of Doctor Who. And yet, for all that travel, we barely see a thing.Properly set up at 400 pages as intended, this book may indeed have been a wonderful epic. Instead, it feels more like a string of disjointed episodes. Many characters are introduced in a sprawling, harshly-written prologue that must have been written by Aaronovitch (drenched with military speak, cultural annotations, and a too-long history of 30th century prostitution -- \\"Doctor Who\\" was originally a kids' series). However, the chess pieces fade in and out for hundreds of pages at a time, and their role in the grand finale is unclear until you read the book at least twice.And then there's Roz. Clearly this was meant to be her apotheosis. The book's third and final segment shows how the honorable yet disgraced 30th century cop is torn between her sister's Imperial ambitions and Doctor's unique sense of justice (\\"You might be asked to choose sides. Do you want my advice? Don't.\\"). We learn of her family's history, and rise to nobility. Roz has hard decisions to make, and her exit from the series is heroic and boneheaded all at once.Where's the problem? Well... Roz *had* no character, for the 18 or so novels before this one. News of her death was well-known to fandom, long before her first adventure belatedly hit US bookshelves. If all of her books had been like this, her finale may have been grandly moving. Instead, there's a bit of an \\"eh\\" to it. Ben Aaronovitch clearly understood her better than anyone, but he only wrote for her twice. Kate, in his place, merely ramps up some aimless sexual tension between her and the much younger Chris Cwej. There's a very muted family tragedy that I'd completely forgotten about, again probably due to missing text.Surprisingly, the psi-powers element of SVAS is well done, even as the preceding stories in the psi-powers arc were among the worst the NAs gave us. The book's first great scene (all the way along on page 111) shows the root cause of psychic powers in the Universe, and there's a great mini-speech by the Doctor later on about how Time Lords came to be. These are grand visual moments, what DW always did best.Other things of note: old companion Bernice Summerfield's return for Roz's funeral; Roz's young 30th century clone; and the \\"alternate\\" Doctors accidentally released by the book's psi-powered bad guys, the Brotherhood. But in the end, it's a space opera, with lots of cramped spaceships and dark tunnels and claustrophic marketplaces. In this one instance, less was not more, and the best version of \\"So Vile A Sin\\" probably still resonates in Ben Aaronovitch's head. Or on his computer."},{"Title":"So Vile A Sin","review":"As a teenager reading these novels I was doing my best to read them in order. I was doing a pretty good job at it too, until I reached Matthew Jones' Bad Therapy, which opened with just the Doctor and Chris Cwej. Where was Roz Forrester, the other Adjudicator companion? Dead, as it turns out. Oh. Frantically I checked back to see if I had missed something in the last book I read. I hadn't. I scoured the bookstores for the missing link book and found no success (I don't remember if this book was listed in the list of novels in the first few pages and I'm too lazy to go look through my copy) not realizing that the book hadn't been released just yet. When it did come out, it came out after the Virgin New Adventures line was dead and gone and thus it was sort of shuffled out and then disappeared, unable to be reprinted. So I missed it completely and was only able to acquire it through a recent mad rush of purchasing. It's probably the rarest of the New Adventures (the last several are pretty rare actually) and as such this is the first chance for me to read it after ten years or so. I was a little worried at first reading it because it's the climax of the \\"Psi Powers\\" storyline, a thread that ran through several novels and a bit on the complicated side but I got the gist of it fairly quickly. This book is one of the longer ones in the series, rumor has it that it was even longer but had to be cut short due to a hard drive failure on the part of original author Ben Aaronovitch, leading to Kate Orman stepping in to help him finish it. Their styles do mesh pretty well, better than you'd expect. The plot seems to concern the Doctor and company putting an end to the Brotherhood of people with psi powers who are trying to use a Nexus of realities to remake the universe into one more of their liking. In the meantime the Earth Empire is entering a rather messy period where the Empress is killed and houses are aligning to decide who gets to stand with the new Emperor, whoever that is. The plot is decently complex but a bit fractured at the same time, verging on space opera at times and having very much a widescreen feel. The scattered vistas and crazy ideas are probably the product of Aaronovitch's original plot, which is the type of thing he was known for, while the smaller character moments are more Orman's forte, especially the set pieces. The plot hangs together well but by not giving any real focus to any one of the many elements making it up, it gives the book a bit of a fragmented feel . . . you have moments with N-forms and old Gallifreyan technology sitting next to people with psionic powers and maybe a longer novel would have helped to iron that out, but I'm not sure. Where the book really scores is atmosphere and mood, rarely do Doctor Who novels feel this weary and doomladen, the novel opens with Roz' funeral (where the Doctor has a heart attack, in one of the starkest and most poignant scenes involving the character) and it goes from there. Everyone gets great moments, from Chris to the Doctor to the Forrester family, and it manages to overcome the at times confusing plot. Roz comes into her own here, not that she hadn't before, but she makes a case for being the companion closest to the Doctor in attitude, for being able to do the same things that he does without becoming squeamish. Their relationship is sketched out nicely and while I think he was close to Roz and Chris, you can see that the loss of Roz (in a very well done moment) hits him harder than you'd expect. One thing I always liked about the New Adventures was that gritty complex feel, and the Doctor here is calculating and whimsical, old and mirthful, with the kind of nuances that make you wish all these people had been writing the TV episodes (actually Aaronovtich wrote \\"Remembrance of the Daleks\\" and \\"Battlefield\\"). It feels like a novel and it feels like good SF and at the same time it has that distinctly British feel that only Doctor Who novels at the time had. We'll never know how the novel should have turned out, but what we have is this and I think that's good enough, all things considered."},{"Title":"So Vile A Sin","review":"Everyone reading this review doubtless already knows the story of how two names came to be on the spine of SO VILE A SIN. I have nothing to add to the tale other than to relate that I always picture Kate Orman coming to the rescue as a Doctor Who version of Harvey Keitel as the tuxedoed Winston Wolf in PULP FICTION. (&quot;You're sending the Orman? Rebecca, mother-editor, that's all you needed to say!&quot;)Vastly different images come to mind when I think about the past works of Aaronovitch and Orman. Saying &quot;Kate Orman novel&quot; to me conjures up thoughts of many heartbreakingly touching character moments strung together in a tight plot. &quot;Ben Aaronovitch novel&quot; makes me think of solar system-sized transit mechanics, solar system-sized civilizations, and armies dropping big things out of orbit onto the heads of other armies. However, these caricatures of mine do both authors a disservice, as each has his or her particular strengths and weaknesses. A fan of their previous individual work, I was extremely curious as to how their styles would mesh. Although it's perhaps a little unfair of me to judge this as a true collaboration, given the circumstances behind the pairing.The combination of their two distinct styles is very interesting. Some of my favorite moments in Orman's novels have been when she concentrates on illustrating a single setting, such as the human colonies in SLEEPY and THE YEAR OF INTELLIGENT TIGERS. Here, she does much the same thing, only instead of confining herself to one place, she has several of Ben's Really Big settings to populate. The first hundred pages are spent warping from one gorgeous setting to the next. Although these are great locations (and superbly brought to life) I kept wondering when the story was going to settle down and get started. (My thought processes: &quot;Wow! This is a great location; now the story will start here! [A few dozen pages later.] Wow! This is another great location! Now the story will start here! [Even more pages later.] Ooh, an even more interesting location... with robots and hardware! Now the story will surely begin here!&quot;)The impression that this gave me was (and I am likely completely wrong in this evaluation, but it's how it felt to this reader) that it was a struggle to get all of these great individual pieces into the final manuscript. More thought may have gone into determining how to flesh out each of these components with little time available to figure out how they fit together and whether they were all really needed in the first place. It's not that all these things jar with each other, more than they just don't quite mesh smoothly.I think the biggest problem is that there's just too much going on. Indeed, I was surprised when I got to the end and realized that the Ormanovitch managed to fit everything I had just read into a mere 312 pages. We aren't given the chance to really dwell on anything, and this is a pity because there's a lot of great stuff going on. This is why I find it difficult to be too critical of the content; it's the structure that doesn't seem to work. The character of Vincenzi, to take an example, is given quite a bit of build-up, but then just seems to fade. On the other hand, the galactic politicking is mentioned early, but so casually that the later power struggles seem to come out of nowhere. Roz's death (no spoiler this -- it's mentioned on the first page) is indeed haunting, epic and powerful. But while the sacrifice itself engages on the emotional level, the actual events leading up to it seem somewhat cold and detached.Before I sign off, I should point out that despite the paragraphs I've spent complaining (I find it strangely easier to analyze flaws than to praise successes), I ultimately did enjoy reading this. In addition to the aforementioned settings, the characters are fantastic. I enjoyed seeing Roz interacting with her family, even if their motivations baffled me. The plot, although wandering and disjointed, is ultimately satisfying. The development of the book's alien races and the future history that builds upon what we saw in ORIGINAL SIN are also both a lot of fun.Given the circumstances surrounding the publication of this novel, it's almost ludicrous to suggest &quot;oh, if only they'd had more time to iron out the problems&quot;, because, obviously time was not a luxury available. But, oh, if only they'd had more time to iron out the problems. Although it suffers from some flaws, I can't help but love a lot of the pieces that make up this novel. At times it touches brilliance, which is exactly what we would expect from a book with those two names on the cover."},{"Title":"So Vile A Sin","review":"This is without a doubt one of the best in the series, it's breathtaking. The story moves along with enough speed to keep you interested, but also gives you a deep look into the characters personalities, especially roz's, which the book focuses on. The story line is well thought out and presented superbly. It focuses on Roz's and her family but also her relationship with her companions and her strong moralistic views, which by the way end up getting her killed. It takes her character to many different dimensions which many of the other books failed to do, thinking of her and Chris as mere replacements for Benny and Ace. Kate and Ben really managed to make this character shine in her final moments. Be warned though that if your not careful your room will be turned into niagra falls in no time! The main plot Focuses on the last of the psi power stories with the Doctor trying in vain to finish the brotherhood for good, but as usual has no idea what is involved ( or at least it appears so). While Chris is his usual energetic self, Roz focuses on her future as well as her past.

I read the first poem, then the second and the third, until it was midnight and I had finished the whole thing. I couldn't put it down. It's full of gorgeous, heartbreaking, brave, unflinching work. Few poets, especially first-book poets, are capable of writing as sonorously and rhythmically as she does. And the powerful music in her work is married to intellectual questioning. Some of my favorite lines, although they won't make much sense out of context, will give you a flavor:\\"Once I was nothing: once we were one.In the unborn world we heard the years hurtling past,whirring like gears in a giant factory --- time time time---\\"\\"Bittersweet the wine of one flesh they drank and drank.\\"\\"I didn't know who or what I was, only that I was,each question answered by the echo of my voice alone: I, I, I.\\"\\"What was it I sawin your gaze, the mazeof you: corridors of years, corridors of war, black wheat-hair ripening ---the last shape sown in closing eyes.\\"\\"I wish you could see what I seewhen I look at you . . .murmur of umber, bloodwings beating in bone.\\"\\"I hear spume soaking a bowsprit crisped with salt. . .\\"\\"Play on a streel of eelgrass plucked from the troughs of the sea.\\"I heard the author read recently at Brazos, although I read the book beforehand.

Poems from her second book, Disorient, have appeared or are forthcoming in The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times, Slate, The Nation, The New Republic, on National Public Radio and the PBS NewsHour. \\"Private Property,\\" a multimedia play she co-wrote, was showcased at Playwrights Horizons (NY) and produced at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe (UK). Her work has been performed by the Tokyo Philharmonic Chorus, reprinted in 24 anthologies, and translated into Russian, Spanish, Italian, German, Korean, Japanese, Arabic, and Bengali. Currently she is a professor in the MFA program at the University of Massachusetts-Boston.In addition, she received Fulbright and Stegner fellowships.My first time through the book, I really didn't like it. Then, I gave it another go, and this time, it worked better for me.Perhaps it was because I read a book I really didn't like before it; perhaps it was because the opening poems didn't move me. She describes her embryonic entry into this world that just felt overblown to me, and had some lines that I just didn't like. For example, she describes newly forming flesh and arteries as \\"tunneling tissue like tubes hooked to an IV\\". That just doesn't work for me. There were some very good poems, and then poems like \\"Monologue for an onion\\", which any potential reader of this book should google. If you like that poem, well, then you will probably really like this book. I hated the last line. Can your heart really \\"beat you to death\\"? Is the reader to be left with an image of a heart brandishing a club and going to it? Puh-leeze. Or is this the metaphorical heart or core, that is inherently divided and must necessarily tear one apart? I suppose, but the image still feels flaky. On top of that, it's hard not to laugh at a poem that takes an onion's complaints about mankind seriously. I was reminded of some poet's writing from the point-of-view of Judas, who he describes as Jesus' polar opposite and opponent. But here we have an onion and mankind. Hmmph.I found many of the poems to be diary-like, journalistic, inventory-of-vocabulary-words prone. Something was lacking, perhaps feeling or resolution. I was hoping for a real laying out of \\"the divided country\\", the Koreas, and some kind of resolution. Her description of war-wounds is an important one; yet somehow it feels superficial; a ghastly list of physical horrors evoking mental horrors, a shattered core, and - no exploration of a resolution, whether in spirit or deed. How does she feel this conflict? She also says she wishes she had never been born - and I didn't find an exploration of that - but could intuit it based on the traces of family and historical tragedy.Perhaps the resolution has to happen in the reader's mind and sentiment; Kim hasn't gone there, yet. In her last poem, she evokes a garden (an earlier poem is titled \\"tree of knowledge\\", about the tragic beginnings to her siblings' lives); the last lines are\\"may...their gardeners in the old world,who kill for warring dreams and warring heavens,who stop at nothing, see life and paradise as one\\".That's a stab at resolution - in the new world. Is it too much to ask to want more of that - and more depth in her examination of history - not simply a cataloging?I don't know. Maybe I'll like this book better in a decade or two, which is as soon as I'd like to revisit it. What's amazing is that I could agree with most of the reviews - from 5 to 1 star - in at least some way. Hence the 3 stars.I read part of the book in an Italian restaurant, and the menu was often more appealing than this verse.Witness: \\"Butternut squash cake, banana caramel, smoked maple; spice crumbs.\\"That - is satisfying."},{"Title":"Notes from the Divided Country: Poems","review":"The apparent success of this book isn't dumbfounding, just dumb. I believe that there are people who turn to poetry like this to feel as if they are sensitive, engaged, softly aware of the weight of history, liberal-hearted, kind. With that in mind, it doesn't really matter how poorly or well the book is written, provided that it touches here and there upon topics that excite that special feeling, drops the dazzling ethnic reference, chops the scallion, gets gingery in the threatened kitchen. There is nothing wrong with that, provided that it be seen for what it is. If you make no special demands on poetry, if you are one of the many unimaginative indolent readers from Cambridge to California who want to read the verses indistinguishable from diary and journalism, here is the book for you. Reading it, you will think you are a better person, and you probably should be. You will be unguilted of your bourgeois fanny packs of ugliness. But this is not great poetry by any stretch: skimpy, sloppy, trite. Simplistic. Something you could put together in a month. It's easy to imagine poets of a more valiant variety getting all worked up over the enthusiasm fat white people attach to this dump. If I were a poet, I'd be angry too. As it is, I can sit back in sad wonder as we pave over the site where language's most amazing feats could be taking place. This book is sort of beatifully produced, but it is a parking lot. It is an SUV. You will pay for it."},{"Title":"Notes from the Divided Country: Poems","review":"Ms. Kim writes with appealing fluidity and natural intelligence. Some poems are no doubt elegant displays of her erudition and, for the most part, she has a good ear and a strong sense of the line. However, the content is shallow and ornamental, and it's impossible not to notice the egotism beneath the conceits. Not only does Ms. Kim position her conception and birth as the point of all creation, she casts herself as the voice of Korea (its history, its people, its American dislocation). She is the voice of all suffering and her forced tone of wisdom is rife with cheap cliches. What she ultimately achieves in this book is a fulfillment of almost every Asian stereotype. As hard it as she tries to stir the reader with descriptions so overwrought and violent that they might appear truthful or authentic, the most stirring--and shocking--aspect of this collection is how ruthlessly the poet exploits the Asian diaspora."},{"Title":"Notes from the Divided Country: Poems","review":"It's a mystery to me as to why this book is so lauded. The language and sentiment are so trite -- haven't I read this kind of disappointing work in a hundred other poetry books deemed \\"four stars\\" by the unimaginative mainstream?"},{"Title":"Notes from the Divided Country: Poems","review":"I was prepared to be blown away after reading the first poem in this collection, which I think is very good, but I'd have to agree that many of the poems afterwards are a little too maudlin and emotionally manipulative for my own taste (for the record, I'm neither a poet myself or an interviewer cozying up to poets but just a reader of poetry). Nonetheless, there are plenty of good phrases and some lovely description in this book, which is more than I get from a lot of younger poets writing these days who are more interested in word games than writing about important subject matter, which Kim at least has the guts to take on. I would definitely read a second book by this author (albeit with the hope that she loses the somewhat weepy and self-important manner that occasionally creeps into her words)."},{"Title":"Notes from the Divided Country: Poems","review":"There are some good lines, but there is not a single great poem. Some are ... well, just awful -- maudlin, trite, cliched, devoid of any freshness of imagery. This seems utterly like the work of a privileged and successful woman exploiting her cultural heritage, and not even being convincing in the process. The faux-authenticity seems so second-order that anyone with a decent education regarding the history of Korea cringes at the melodrama:I'll never understand it.I wonder about the others I see on the sidewalks,each soul fathomless --Yes, that is an actual passage. The coy allusions, the downtrodden affect, the preponderance of Asian artifacts ... this from a Stanford grad, Fulbright scholar, Yaddo-ite, many times getter of grants? Sorry, the whole thing smells like a put-up job."},{"Title":"Notes from the Divided Country: Poems","review":"For me, this is a worthwhile (mostly good) book that happens to have a lot of flaws. That it is maudlin in parts (a fact that can't be dismissed so easily as rhyming maudlin with shmaudlin), seems obvious to me. Kim sometimes tries too hard to eke out the last ounce of pity from a reader for her relatives (who have suffered things, we can assume as we read her privileged resume, that she has only heard about at the dinner table) but the poems are also heartfelt, careful and obviously more interested in communicating than dazzling with a bunch of worthless postmodern hocus-pocus. But who says a first book has to be perfect? I reccomend this flawed and sometimes wonderful book."},{"Title":"Notes from the Divided Country: Poems","review":"I'm an editor who has followed this poet's work in literary journals for almost 10 years, and I'm struck by how easily she could have published two books by now. Notice how many poems originally appeared in top-rank magazines like The Nation, The New Republic, Paris Review, etc. She isn't a kid. She's put in her dues. She must have thrown away a slew of published poems, working hard and writing new pieces, taking a long time to put this first book together. I can't emphasize enough how admirable and rare this is in the literary world. It reflects a drive for aesthetic purity that deserves the highest respect. I'm also struck by how unpredictable she's been over the years, from poem to poem. I never knew what she was going to send in next, and I still don't know. This is not to say that the book is without flaws; to my mind, they lie in the occasional, misguided attempts at formal, syntactic and tonal experimentation in the last section (Levitations, RICE, etc). But her vices are inseparable from the virtues I just mentioned: her staggering range, her variousness, the way in which she challenges herself constantly as a writer, and hence, her seemingly unlimited poetic potential, are exemplary."},{"Title":"Notes from the Divided Country: Poems","review":"I saw a review of NOTES FROM THE DIVIDED COUNTRY in the Sunday L. A. Times a week ago, and went out & bought it at the L. A. Festival of Books. I loved it! I just bought another 2 copies as gifts for Mother's Day.I don't normally read poetry, so I'm not very articulate when it comes to technical terms, etc. But let me just say that this book is wonderful, and I loved it.I'm going to borrow some of the reviewer's words:\\"I wish I had space in which to consider at length the important debut of \\"Notes From the Divided Country\\" by Suji Kwock Kim. It seems to me that this first book (already acknowledged by the 2002 Walt Whitman Award) deserves close and celebratory attention.Suji Kwock Kim has written a book of unforgettable poems; she has found a way, through the medium of language, to allow readers into a double consciousness that is, finally, the poet's undivided mind. She writes of the \\"old country\\" reborn in the New World, of her ancestors in Korea during the Japanese occupation and her immediate family in America: the Trees of Unknowing and Knowledge. She writes of her mother's death with lamentative, bitter restraint.In one of the most inspired and brilliant poems, she considers sparrows and their symbology: \\"How to stay faithful / to earth, how to keep from betraying / its music \\" she wonders - and brings us full circle here - as she, too writes of the Earth that both divides us and brings us together.\\" (LOS ANGELES TIMES BOOK REVIEW, April 27, 2003)"},{"Title":"Notes from the Divided Country: Poems","review":"The previous review is clearly motivated by that pettiest and basest of emotions: professional envy. Who else would be obsessed by an author's awards and achievements, let alone use the term \\"Yaddo-ite\\" -- except a resentful fellow-author? None of that matters.What matters is that NOTES FROM THE DIVIDED COUNTRY is a beautiful, utterly heartfelt, utterly heartbreaking book. The self-accusation, the guilt at surviving, and the ambivalent, conflicted love that Miss Kim feels for her family is painfully apparent in every line of her poetry. There is nothing easy about it, no \\"exploitation of cultural heritage.\\"Most importantly: as a Korean living and working in Seoul, it's extremely offensive to be told by some Westerner in the United States -- who obviously doesn't live in Korea, or know the first thing about Korean literary culture -- what constitutes \\"faux\\" and \\"authentic\\" Koreanness. We're perfectly capable of deciding on our own, thank you.Readers in Korea know that there have already been features on Miss Kim in two of the three major national newspapers. (I conducted one of the interviews.) Another colleague of mine is translating one of her poems for a Korean literary journal. Frankly, none of us would take the trouble of doing this if we didn't absolutely love her work.If an author's biographical facts must be mentioned in a review, let them be accurate ones: a childhood of immigrant poverty, not privilege; a younger brother and sister who were born mentally retarded and physically handicapped, thanks to poor medical treatment; a father who is a war orphan.But it's the writing that is first and foremost. I especially recommend \\"The Tree of Knowledge,\\" \\"Borderlands,\\" \\"The Chasm,\\" \\"Fragments of the Forgotten War,\\" \\"Monologue for an Onion\\" and \\"On Sparrows.\\" In \\"Montage with Neon, Bok Choi, Gasoline, Lovers & Strangers,\\" about walking around Seoul during Buddha's Birthday, the poem's ambivalence, moral complexity, and precarious balance between empathy with and distance from others, are remarkable:if anything's here at allit was builtout of ash, out of the skull-rubble of war,the city rising brick by bricklike a shared dream,every bridge & pylon & girder & spar a miracle,when half a century agothere was nothingbut shrapnel, broken mortar-casings, corpses,the War Memorial in Itaewon countingMORE THAN 3 MILLION DEAD, OR MISSING --still missed by the living, still loved beyond reason,monument to the factthat no one can hurt you, no one kill youlike your own people.I'll never understand it.I wonder about others I see on the sidewalks,each soul fathomless ---strikers & scabs walking through Kwanghwamoon . . .riot-police rapping nightsticks against plexiglass-shields . . .hawkers haggling over cellphones or silk shirts . . .fishermen cleaning tubs of cuttlefish & squid . . .the grocer who calls me \\"daughter\\" because I look like her . . .bus-drivers hurtling past in a blast of diesel-fumes . . .men with hair the color of scallion rootplaying paduk, or Go,old enough to have stolen overcoats & shoes from corpses in the war . . .whose every breath seems to say:after things turned to their worst, we began again,but may you never see what we saw,may you never do what we've done,may you never remember & may you never forget."},{"Title":"Notes from the Divided Country: Poems","review":"I was blown away by this book. It isn't easy reading poems about wishing not to have been born, so I don't know how the hell she wrote them. She doesn't pull punches.

You hate the body/ because it can be broken,/ stabbed, shot full of holes.\\" \\"We didn't want to be born we didn't want.\\" \\"I think of the loneliness of the dying,/ the bodies I saw along the way, rotting separately.\\" \\"Last thoughts, last dreams crawling through his skull like worms.\\" You don't hear writing like that every day. It fuses intelligence and emotion at the highest level. More importantly, she isn't afraid of strong feeling. The passion in many of her poems is astonishing. Maudlin, schmaudlin. That's the risk you take, if you don't want to write safe, skillful, emotionally bland, cerebral, forgettable work. The risk pays off here. A few poems in the 4th section falter a bit for me, but the rest of the book flies."},{"Title":"Notes from the Divided Country: Poems","review":"I was blown away by this book.

I heard the author on NPR, reading poems and giving an interview --- and she took my breath away. Her actual, physical voice is mesmerizing: musical, gorgeous, full of feeling and song. Her metaphorical \\"voice\\" is even better: the language precise and powerful, the imagery unforgettable and haunting, and the overall vision of her poems fierce and unflinching. I was especially impressed by how intelligent she was about the representation of historical events, the influence of Brecht on her work, the slippages of translation and bilingualism.Most of all, she made me reflect on the consequences of culture being passed from generation to generation --- or not --- and the narrow scope through which we Americans often live our lives. She's the real thing."},{"Title":"Notes from the Divided Country: Poems","review":"This is one of the most riveting and brilliant books of poetry I've read this year, and I look forward to many more. It's a first book, so of course it's uneven. Some of the poems feel overwrought and in need of editing. Some of the poems could have been dropped. But overall, I'm deeply moved and impressed, not only by the difficulty and sheer range of subject matter, but also by the musicality and beauty of the voice. (Ferocity and delicacy, as Frank Bidart puts it on the back of the book.) The strongest pieces are extremely strong. Maybe it's just taste, but I have to disagree with some of the other reviewers. In my opinion, this book tackles hard questions with great courage and restraint (not always, but most of the time):BorderlandsCrush my eyes, bitter grapes:wring out the wine of seeing.We tried to escape across the frozen Yalu, to Ch'ientao or Harbin.I saw the Japanese soldiers shoot:I saw men and women from our village blown to hieroglyphs of viscera,engraving nothing.River of never.River the opposite of Lethe, the opposite of forgetting,dividing those who lived from those who were killed:why did I survive?I wondered at each body with its separate skin, its separate suffering.My childhood friend lay on the boot-blackened ice:I touched his face with disbelief,I tried to hold his hand but he snatched it away, as if he were ashamed of dying,eye grown large with everything it saw, everyone who disappeared:pupil of suffering.Lonely O, blank of an eyerolled back into its socket,I was afraid to see you:last thoughts, last dreams crawling through his skull like worms.____________________By the way, I've noticed some things about this whole online review business. My two cents:First of all, I don't understand why people fixate on an author's bio, pro or con. It's irrelevant. A book is a book.Second, I've read lots of books by white authors who write about family members who've survived the Holocaust, WWII, and so on, in far more gruesome detail. But no one cares whether a white author's present-day life is \\"privileged\\" or not. Are authors of color supposed to live in the ghetto? It's a double standard, and it's weird.Last, if we were great writers ourselves, I suspect we wouldn't be wasting our time scribbling these things . . ."},{"Title":"Notes from the Divided Country: Poems","review":"In the shadow of such resilience, daily endurance is worth celebration, as Kim demonstrates when she builds subsequent poems out of and finds music in the junk of ordinary American life. In \\"Fugue for Eye and Vanishing Point,\\" she wants to see \\"things that are plainly themselves,\\" things like \\"Bleach-fumes. Urine. Cement./ Bus-exhaust,\\" but she can't hold her vision to just those things and imagines something beyond, ending the poem with an \\"Infinite engine trapped in skin.\\" One infinite engine must be the imagination, working through love of language as in \\"Prelude for Grains of Sand,\\" when she makes the language crackle through \\"bladderwrack,/ where beds of mussels clack,/ where barnacles and wentletrap crack the green hooks,/ where cockle and quahog drift through dulse\\" on the shore where she addresses her \\"angel of unknowing, angel of nothing,\\" who, she writes, \\"sang me beyond song.\\" That sense of beyond-ness drives poems like \\"On Sparrows,\\" in which she hears the disembodied voices of sparrows singing from \\"the dump guttered with toxins and tar\\" and builds from those sounds a series of accumulating metaphors.Her attention to things external parallels her frequent use of personae. With those voices, Kim avoids the fashionable self-indulgence of overly intimate confessionalism. In \\"Monologue for an Onion,\\" the onion speaks: \\"Taste what you hold in your hands: onion-juice,/ Yellow peels, my stinging shreds.\\" At the same time as she tastes the world she can hold, she also pushes through it, as she directs herself in the epigraph to \\"The Tree of Knowledge,\\" borrowing from Marilynne Robinson: \\"Fact explains nothing. On the contrary, it is fact that requires explanation.\\" Kim loves facts and things both for what they are for what they are not, so that a desire to reach further into experience constantly pushes past the observation of life's possible bitterness and inevitable dissolution; for her, as for her neighbors constantly keeping up their home and garden in \\"The Couple Next Door,\\" we find \\"each chore undone/ before they know it,\\" yet she keeps at her chores and sometimes the imagination trumps that perpetual dissolution.The last poem, \\"The Korean Community Garden in Queens\\" [is] a fine culmination of Kim's concerns; like the plants in that garden, she \\"wrings crumbs of rot/ for water.\\" She yearns for a way to accept her transience, desiring to learn \\"How not to mind the end/ we'll come to.\\" She helps readers not mind byconfronting the terrors of dissolution and creating, in spite of all the evidence to the contrary, the ability to \\"see life and paradise as one.\\" Her comment on the garden echoes my own sentiment toward her poems: \\"I love how nothing in these furrow grows unsnarled,/ nothing stays unscathed.\\" She does what more contemporary art should --- fends off the inevitable to offer moments of beauty in the midst of the world's junk, thus redeeming those moments and even the junk itself. (Robert Grotjohn, SHENANDOAH Winter 2003)"},{"Title":"Notes from the Divided Country: Poems","review":"Suji Kwock Kim's title NOTES FROM THE DIVIDED COUNTRY refers not only to the Koreas North and South and to all the Americas, but also to the countries of the mind. Travelling between past and present, Kim's powerful fictive imagination creates almost unbearably realistic enactments of war-zones once inhabited by her parents, grandparents, and even her great-grandparents. If \\"death is no remedy for having been born,\\" as she says in \\"The Tree of Knowledge,\\" then perhaps poetry is: poetry as expiation, history, memory treasure trove. In highly sophisticated verse, with lines long and lean or short and subtle, an exorcism seems to take place through the precision and music of her language. In poems about the couple next door in San Francisco, or the poet on the road to Skye in Scotland, or in the streets of Seoul on the Buddha's birthday, Suji Kwock Kim celebrates being alive and well in the complexities of the present moment. (Griffin International Poetry Prize, Judges' Citation)"},{"Title":"Notes from the Divided Country: Poems","review":"The literal subjects of NOTES FROM A DIVIDED COUNTRY are easily ascertained: warfare, occupation, racial assimilation, family tragedy -- in other words, the scourges of the twentieth century. But Kim attempts to sculpt these events into lyric; her goal is to shape-change trauma into art without losing emotional ferocity . . . By skipping back and forth from the flat diction of factual truth to lusher figurative language, she unites the worlds of narrative and lyric: \\"immigrants driving to power plants in Jersey,/ out of measowsweet and oil/ the chaff of unlived lives blowing endlessly. . .\\"Kim seems interested in investigating legions of subjectivities: the immigrant self, the child self, the victim of war, the lover, the mother, and others. \\"I've never been one soul,\\" she writes in a poem after the Korean poet Ko Un.Kim's techniques of colliding voices enlarges as the book goes on; in later sections, she alternates poems of lyric intensity with poems of plain speech. The latter works particularly well in her persona pieces, written variously in the voices of parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents. These are arguably the most powerful poems in the book, as Kim settles her gaze on a century's worth of war in Korea to offer witness: \\"remember the coal miners ordered to war in Manchuria/ . . . Remember the \\"Comfort Corps\\" raped forty times a day,/ the woman screaming who could not scream because she was on fire.\\" In these works, she thoroughly avoids the temptation of easy redemption, of easy reconciliation, even when she does employ metaphor: \\"At night a sickle glinted in the sky, sharp and pure. What did it reap?/ Summer wind sang through the corpse- forest.\\" Summer winds may blow, and sickle moons may shine, but there is no quick healing in this damaged landscape. . .Kim's book does represent an achievement; she manages, almost throughout, to unite the divided countries of personal experience and political truth without relying on the easy bridge of sentimentality.

Actually...I confess, when they went to bed after the third evening of reading aloud, I sat and finished reading the entire book because I couldn't wait to see what happened!I would highly recommend this book to anyone seeking a worthwhile read that is exciting, entertaining and kid-safe......But be sure to read the book 1 in the series first!"},{"Title":"The Palace (The Adventures of Jecosan Tarres, Book 2)","review":"Why would you want to read \\"The Adventures of Jecosan Tarres\\" yourself?

Reading this thoroughly enjoyable story will change you, if you let it. It illustrates the basic principles of integrity, honesty, loyalty, and reaping what you sow. After finishing Book #2, I found myself comparing different aspects of the plot to my own life. By experiencing the story I was encouraged to improve myself and my own disciplines.

He accepts work as a kitchen helper at the palace, but is confused as there is no indication of anyone preparing for battle. Still he patiently waits figuring the Elgur messenger of the heavens would not have sent him on this quest if the danger was not real.The former blacksmith apprentice soon obtains a job in the royal library where he meets powerful Lord Farizel Narr, who likes the youngster's enthusiasm and begins tutoring him on languages and the history of his country. The intelligent lad appreciates the lessons, but also realizes how important his mentor is to the kingdom; as Narr along with the royal sister Princess Arvelina keeps King Alvard III from invading neighboring Tirgan as the monarch wants to crush the followers of the Book of Light going so far as to hire Henky-Roo a magician in league with demons to advise him on things the ruler considers supernatural.The first book is an excellent coming of age fantasy, but is straightforward as for the most part readers follow Jeco's escapades. THE PALACE is as exciting and entertaining, but much more complex as multiple story lines provide the reader with activities that the young hero is unaware of such as the plotting of the vile sly magician who persuades his employer to steal the Book of Light. Readers will enjoy this middle tale as the battle of good vs. evil seems imminent as Jeco realizes he is in the eye of the storm with the heavenly objective of his mission seemingly headed to failure. This is a terrific tale better enhanced by reading Jeco's journey first.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Palace (The Adventures of Jecosan Tarres, Book 2)","review":"I rarely take the time to read fiction because I have much other reading and writing to do for my profession.

Jecosan is a wonderful role model for any adolescent. We live in a time when excellent character examples are few and far between. The book is interesting, exciting, captivating, and well written.

The story of the young blacksmith Jeco and his unusual quest is continued in the same captivating manner, with more depth added to it and fascinating new characters introduced. Since this is a trilogy, not a series, and the plot of the second book heavily depends on the previous one, I recommend that you read Book 1 first.There is so much I could say about this book, but I don't want to spoil the reading for you, so I will not reveal the plot. I will only share about one of the many sub-themes I enjoyed - the relationship between Lord Farizel and Princess Arvelina. The life of the nine-year-old princess is defined by strict court etiquette and scheduled to the minute. In many ways, Arvelina is forced into adulthood. While she does show more maturity than a typical nine-year-old, she is still just a girl, a child who wants to be loved. Lord Farizel, her former teacher, sees that. Although he is no longer responsible for the princess and has many other duties, he steps in to fill the void whenever he can."},{"Title":"The Palace (The Adventures of Jecosan Tarres, Book 2)","review":"The Palace needs major proofreading.

This is probably because we need to know so much more about how Jeco might prevent the war and he must have time to grow into a capable and confident player. The story does an excellent job of introducing new characters, like the king, his sister and others necessary to the saga, including the unknown warrior. It is completely absorbing to discover their motivations and personalities, strengths and failings, as revealed through their actions in a range of circumstances. For example, we find out who are the experienced wise ones and who are the hot-headed, power-hungry ones.The desire to keep turning the pages is ever present and there is a very good suspenseful, cliff-hanger ending. There is plenty of scope for the reader to enjoy pondering the 'what if's' and 'if only's' of the story and its intricate threads. Also to imagine which characters will have further important parts to play and how others will find their way back to the path they should follow.These books have really caught my imagination, with their visual style and heroic struggles.

By this point, as Genet's biographrer Edmund White has pointed out, Genet was conciously incorporating the use of Sartre's theories in his work (as Sartre at that time was Genet's friend - and sort of replacement for Jean Cocteau). The novel lacks the inovation of 'Our Lady' - but at the same time it has many more direct personal references to Genet himself.What makes Genet, for me, one of the greatest writers of the 20th century is the way he embraces fate. He is always so clear in his novels about what is going to happen and the significance of what is going to happen. Thus, his writing always sounds so inevitable and profound - and his characters are like shrines of worship - he creates mythology. This is what makes Genet so refreshing to me - and he is, in my opinion, an equal to authors like Proust, Joyce, and Kafka - a gem of self-concious literature.The Thiefs Journal is a good place to start with Genet. It is very clear and detailed and he pours the same great poetic prose into it - that he gave books like 'Our Lady' and 'Querelle'."},{"Title":"The Thief's Journal","review":"Jean Genet's absorbing work of literary autobiography traverses the boundaries of genre with stunning ingenuity and imagination. This work is in some ways similar to Capote's use of the so-called \\"non-fiction novel,\\" in that it recalls apparently true events through the lens of fiction. This is the reflection of a petty thief, and vagabond. Genet is a young man wandering Europe and immersing himself in a world of crime and depravity. He fuses his homosexuality with nefarious hooliganism to play off of our civilization's utter contempt for effeminate males. Genet blurs the boundary of morality with Nietzschean fury as he revels in his self projected \\"evil.\\" Perhaps what is most astonishing about 'The Thief's Journal' is the way in which Jean Genet comments on his own commentary with startling frankness and lucidity. In many ways this work established many of the literary mechanics of what is now referred to as \\"post-modern,\\" though Genet achieves the same level of complexity without sacrificing clarity or beauty in the process."},{"Title":"The Thief's Journal","review":"Both during and after my reading of Jean Genet's semi-autobiographical memoir of life as a criminal (later turned writer), I have been attempting to place its protagonist (aptly named \\"Jean\\") onto a psychoanalyst's couch. Here is a fascinating and often times sleezy character who has captured my imagination in a way that most central figures of a novel never have. Jean describes himself as having a very lonely boyhood; when he was not living in foster homes, he was out stealing from people, spending time in juvenile reformatories and prisons. Most of his friends have been individuals that he met while in jail or as collaborators in his crimes. These individuals were often pimps, drug dealers, thieves, and other such low lives.I believe that the key to Jean's nature, a natural extention of his feelings of utter aloneness, is his desire for the love and approval by the most brutal and in his eyes, most masculine, of these malefactors. His robbing of unsuspecting, more well to do older \\"queers,\\" as he calls them, who hire him for sex, gains Jean the respect and admiration of some of his friends. Interestingly, Jean is also a homosexual (probably self-hating). Although many of these men become his friends, only a few actually return his love. In Jean's unconventional society betrayal of those you most love is a common principle, and Jean desires to do just that._The Thief's Journal_ also has its moments of pathos, especially notable in the episode where Jean and a number of his acquaintances are homeless, in utter squalor, and middle-class tourists visiting their terrain comment on their \\"charm.\\"This book is not for every taste, but it is a very enthralling look at a world many of us may read about, but never see close up."},{"Title":"The Thief's Journal","review":"This book -- a first-person account of the author's life as a down-and-out lowlife in Europe between the wars -- had the potential to be one of the most engrossing, original books one would ever want to read.Unfortunately, this author has got to be the most pretentious ding-a-ling ever to walk the earth. Why couldn't he have just rendered a straight account (no pun intended) of his misadventures? Did he really have to cast everything in his heavy-handed philosophy? Boy, did that ruin everything. What life was like for a gay sleazeball in Europe at that time, the evocation of the characters, the places . . . holy cow, it could have been so great. Genet had everything he needed to fashion one of the great picaresque novels and he totally blew it.Instead, it's like Genet couldn't be honest with the reader. I know this sounds strange since he spends the book making all sorts of humiliating confessions. But none of that counts: he still keeps the reader at arm's length by blurring everything with a pompous, highblown smokescreen of language that, I suggest, was intended to shield the author against criticism, as if to say, \\"There's no way you guys can understand the high moral purpose I was fulfilling, so don't even judge me!\\"Sheesh. Betrayal as the ultimate form of devotion? That doesn't make sense even given Genet's own terms. Did somebody hit him on the head?Yes, folks. I'm actually angry at Genet! I feel he ripped us off! His pretentiousizing his material has got to be accounted one of the great literary crimes. In the hands of a more sincere author, this would have been a spellbinding classic: about crime, about gay life, about failure, about being on down and out, etc. As it is, we'll never have such a book: instead all we have is 200 pages of nauseating, self-justifying treacle.(And I can just imagine Genet's reaction to this screed: \\"You're disappointed? But disappointment, don't you know, is the highest form of fulfillment!\\")Brother."},{"Title":"The Thief's Journal","review":"I've read the Japanese translation of this book several times some years ago. It is a well known fact that western languages are so very difficult to transltate into Japanese language, but this book did not seem to suffer as much as others.It is intellectually very satisfying, the language is exceptionally beautiful, and more than anything else, it is very gentle.It does not have many dialogs, and not a story, since it's a journal, but it's a very readable book and easy to follow even for someone like me who can only read books in a story-telling format.If you feel like something gentle, this book is a good companion."},{"Title":"The Thief's Journal","review":"In Jean Genet's complex novel The Thief's Journal, the author has modeled his protagonist, Jean, on himself, and the loose, conversational plot after his own experiences as a young thief, drifter, and poet in thirties and forties Europe. 'Jean' is Genet's fictional recreation of himself; but readers should keep in mind that Jean's relationship to Genet is to some degree imaginative. The book provides an excellent illustration of how even when speaking or writing with as complete an honesty as believed possible, man is still caught in a process of creation, structuring, and discrimination---a process of fictionalization. Therefore, honesty, sincerity, and truthfulness always retain elements of artifice, and, as pure states, remain ideals only.Abandoned by his family as a boy, sentenced to reform school at sixteen, as a young man, Jean is still \\"alone, rigorously so,\\" he lives \\"with desolation in satanic solitude.\\" Realizing early that he is, in status and nature, completely at odds with the social order, Jean learns through trial and error how to care and not to care, how to make all possible outcomes to his actions reasonably acceptable. \\"Rejecting the world that rejected me,\\" Jean exacerbates his position: identifying with his rejectee status, he feels it appropriate that he should \\"aggravate this condition with a preference for boys.\\" Thus his homosexuality is at least partially an act of self-creation, part of his perverse desire to transgress the rules of order as broadly as possible. Jean decides he will henceforth admit to guilt whenever accused, regardless of the truth or the nature of the crime, and thus rob his accusers of the ability to jeopardize his fate.\\"Betrayal, theft, and homosexuality are the basic subject of this book,\\" he says. For Jean, theft becomes a means of survival while simultaneously representing a daily blow against society. If caught and arrested, he readily throws himself into the homosexual life of the prison, making himself available to those in authority as well as to fellow inmates. Jean allows himself a somewhat desperate game of searching for a dominant male partner who is completely, impossibly powerful. Submitting physically and emotionally to men he believes meet this standard, Jean repeatedly proves himself the more powerful by betraying the men when he inevitably senses a definitive crack in his exaggerated conception of them. Once he has glimpsed some \\"inelegant,\\" unforgivable portion of their imperfect humanity, his slavish masochism fades and sociopathic indifference replaces it: the abandonee becomes the abandoner and assassin. For Jean, a well-planned, keenly-felt personal betrayal is the ultimate show of toughness and \\"a handsome gesture, compounded with nervous force and grace.\\"As in Genet's other novels, homosexual love and physical interaction is a given between all of the male characters--pimps, prostitutes, gamblers, gangsters, and thugs--each of whom has a theoretical set of rules and limits concerning the degree of their own participation. But regardless of their speeches and proud macho denunciations, they loosen their belts for one another at a moment's notice if they feel so inclined. Genet cleverly has Jean reacting and reporting in the same indeterminate manner: Jean identifies Michaelis as wholly homosexual but then denies it; one-armed stud Stilitano, who wears a bunch of artificial grapes buttoned inside his fly to lure strangers and enhance his mystique, routinely denies Jean access to his body at night but coyly raises the subject repeatedly during daylight hours. Regardless, Stilitano and Jean live and share a bed together, affectionately plucking one another clean of head and body lice. Ugly Salvador strikes Jean on the street for kissing him in public while simultaneously whispering, \\"tonight, if you like,\\" in his ear. When hairy Armand decides he respects Jean too much to be anything other than friends, Jean sleeps between his open legs, Armand's colossal sex organs resting nightly on his forehead.Only gorilla-like, Paul Muni-faced Java is wholly unconcerned with the nature of his acts or words. He provocatively exposes himself to other men in saloons, daring them to hold and guess the weight of his genitals, and repeatedly forces himself on willing Jean, who, gloriously obliterated by Java's assault, finds it a blissful but inevitably temporary salvation. Java \\"cringes in fright\\" during a fight, and Jean sees even his cringing as beautiful. But then \\"yellow diarrhea flows down his monumental thighs,\\" and--well, so much for Java. Clinging to his masochistic illusion, Jean continues drifting, his submissive position a seeming necessity. When discovered sleeping in a beachfront shack by a guard, Jean services him automatically and the guard accepts it automatically as a given in turn. These are the strange, all-encompassing rules of Genet's world. But free or imprisoned, single or partnered, masochist or sly sadist, Jean is ultimately self-fulfilling and independent.Jean, who says \\"metamorphosis lies in wait for us,\\" is an almost unknown quintessence, a mass of animal meat and instincts coupled with emerging homo sapien characteristics. Constantly in a liminal state of becoming, he atavistically prefers stepping sideways or backward instead of forward; for long periods his existence seems mere ostensible movement through time and space. But Jean, who in fact secretly enjoys and protects his isolation, really seeks only to fulfill himself \\"in the rarest of destinies,\\" a kind of quest for \\"sainthood,\\" one born of reducing himself to pure essence and thus becoming his own temple, savior, and deity. On this final road, which Jean sees reachable by both subjective and objective methods, including sacred betrayal, there is in truth no room for anyone but himself, as there will be none afterward when he has attained his goal of becoming a selfless but self-complete being, like Jung's psychological, alchemical, and hieratical hermaphrodite.The Thief's Journal is a full-frontal, multi-layered book that should be read several times to be fully appreciated. One of the finest portrayals of the introverted character in literature, The Thief's Journal has a great many things to express about man's nature and psychology, most of which should be revelatory if somewhat jarring to the general reader."},{"Title":"The Thief's Journal","review":"I don't think I would categorize The Thief's Journal as Gay fiction. I would allign it more with existentialism/metaphysics in that Genet's sensibilities and motives lie in other areas than solely his own homosexuality. Genet seeks to travel deeper and deeper within himself in order to reject &quot;your world&quot; as well as its inherent value and morals systems. I think his own homosexuality is among one of the many plateaus or steps that he uses in his &quot;journey&quot;. As he says, his life was open to his own interpretation; the signs were interpreted in his own way for his own purposes. Sometimes Genet's prose is heavy in that his lines are long and he uses run-ons separated by commas. He takes great care in his descriptions (necessarily so) such as the gob of white saliva in the corner of someone's mouth. The work is another bold gesture by a man who brings the reader as close to the author as is seemingly possible. Another reviewer here says to check out Celine.

The distinction between the beautiful and the obscene is folded inside out like a velvet glove. Abjection has never seemed so appealing."},{"Title":"The Thief's Journal","review":"Jean Genet suffers a lot, I think, due to popular culture...the fact that his works necessarily involve homosexual activities leads mainstream culture (including even university professors!) to marginalize him beyond all rational limits, and leads conversely, the gay community to celebrate him possibly a little too much...but that's just my opinion. The fact is that he's a master of language, and when he writes about almost anything, it's transformed into an incredible landscape of experience, thought, desire, motives. In most of his purely fictional works he acts as an omniscient narrator to describe exactly why the characters do as they do...and in a way that not only makes perfect sense, but also in a way that the reader probably never thought of. This work being mostly autobiographical differs, actually, not much. If all you asked of this book was to take you into the world of small-time crime and skid row activities of barely post world war II europe, you'll be more than happily surprised. If you demand more, direct transportation even, to the world he was living in, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Thief's Journal","review":"Genet's &quot;the Thief's Journal&quot; is to me his greatest novel-if that's whatyou want to categorize it as.The only reason I don't say its his greatest book is because of a wonderful book called &quot;Prisoner of Love&quot;, and who knows what may turn up altho I doubt much of anything as he was so private and transient. Anyway, it clearly maps out the genesis of his artistic, sexual, and criminal life. For any gay male reader, it is essential, higher in priority than almost any other gay fiction. Of course, it is essential not just to gays but any serious reader. On a final note it is also quite accessible. so if you tried reading &quot;Our Lady...&quot; or others I think you will be pleasantly surprised and absorbed.

So there you are"},{"Title":"The Thief's Journal","review":"Genet, as this his first book aptly proves, is understood best when he has an interpreter: ideally the iconic Jean Paul Sartre (or as I later discovered in the review section as I was about to post this review, Mr. J.E. Barnes). Thus, I feel like I have cheated in having first read Sartre's \\"Saint Genet, in which all of Genet's works are put in a proper psychological context. I am not sure I could have gotten the full import of this book without Sartre's (and now Mr. Barnes') help.Genet's dark, exquisite interior prose occupies a higher dimension in a universe on the plane above the heads of our normal understanding of the human condition. He treads on much forbidden terrain: thievery, homosexuality, treachery and betrayal, societally inspired structural and overt violence. His craft exists and extends far away from and on the outskirts of the normal socialized and socially adjusted human mental frame. Yet, because of this vantage point, he and his writings are more alive, more aware of the limitations of this (the external) world, more in tune with normal human weaknesses, more real than any normal mind could ever be, or ever even imagine.This, the first of his many criminal's confessions, is not just a clinical baring of an interior soul, but a living reflection of how the soul is organized and lived from the inside out, and, more importantly, how it is incrementally corrupted as a result of normal societal rules. Yet, Genet does not claim a defense or an excuse for his societally produced criminal mind and behavior: Although he is the purest of a socially produced incorrigible, he revels in his station in life; he takes it and remakes it as his own. He refashions it so that he can own it fully: it is his choice to own it. He populates it with characters, including himself, as Jean, that reflect and alternative moral universe. This alternative criminal moral universe is his counter-cultural kingdom, his existential domain. It is his psychological, spiritual and physical home.Yet, even though Genet owns the universe he creates and so vividly describes, and reports to us, curiously it is us too. It is our reflection as seen through a truly authentic mind. One cannot read this book without the voyeuristic understanding that Genet's soul is but a \\"stand-in\\" for the inner torment, violence and fear that lives hidden just beneath consciousness in each of our souls. Genet is our true psychological doppelganger. He exposes the myth that our moral ideals and standards are real, inviolable and pure.His \\"slow-dance\\" towards his own interior oblivion, the criminal abyss; a slow walk down to nihilistic authenticity, is as exquisite a representation of who we are, as we are ever likely to see in printed form. He describes what we would see if we had the courage and strength to see, that is if we had the true courage and strength of true introspection; if we had the courage and strength to confront our deepest fears, our deepest inner selves; in short, if we had the courage to be authentic beings. His descriptions remind us of how deep our socially adjusted cowardliness really is. He reminds us of what a truly authentic existence really looks like from the inside out.The world of the \\"existential thief\\" is inhabited by a slow dance between a quest for heroism, a quest for an easy route to spiritual glory (the same quest we all have), and a fear of the limitations of our inherent human weaknesses. It is an interior struggle that ordinary people do not normally get to see, because socially organized mental barriers carefully insulate, wall us off and protect us from, ourselves.An absolutely exquisitely crafted Freudian and existential tour de force: Ten stars"},{"Title":"The Thief's Journal","review":"Well, the other review here is great.

Not only did it boast some half a million rolls, but it was comprehensive, covering all subjects, and open to any scholar. What truly aided in the growth of the library was the famous Museum, which, at least at first, provided noted scholars with food, lodging, and even money.Naturally, this soon degraded into providing various civil servants with food, lodging and money.It was the library of Alexandria which first began sorting works by alphabetical order. In 270 AD Aurelian was engaged in bitter fighting in Alexandria which laid both the palace and, sigh, likely the library as well, to dust.The second most famous of the ancient libraries was at Pergamum. Famously, the awful Mark Anthony took 200,000 rolls from Pergamum to send as a gift to Cleopatra. What is not known whether or not this number was the entire content of the library.Although many libraries were known to be in ancient Rome, maddeningly, we have little information on just how extensive the collections were. We also know that many members of the elite had large libraries.Booksellers, too, flourished in Rome. Cicero grumbles about the miserable quality of some of the books available from those booksellers, saying \\"the copies are made and sold so full of errors'\\" (p 78).Tiberius' library appears to have been sizable, but the remains of the one built by Trajan are especially impressive--airy, two stories high, lavish with marble.Christian libraries grew apace during the time between persecutions. Pamphilius helped collect \\"an impressively large collection, over 30,000 volumes at the church of Caesarea\\" (p 139).In the fourth century Pachomius began a monastic community in Egypt in which it was a rule that all the monks knew how to read in order to be admitted. This became an entrenched rule throughout Christian monastic communities, at least in the west. Typically, in 612, Columban founded a a monastery \\"at Bobbio...that included a scriptorium and a library, both of which quickly grew to be important features of the institution\\" (p 145).Christianity proved to be a great boon to booksellers, who happily provided such popular reading as the biography of Martin of Tours by Severus as well as copies of the bible."},{"Title":"Libraries in the Ancient World","review":"In 642 AD the library holdings of the Serapeum at Alexandria supplied the public baths with six month's supply of kindling. To the city's Muslim Arab conquerors, these thousands of books and scrolls were clearly worthless: if their contents agreed with the word of the Prophet, they were superfluous; if they disagreed, they were blasphemous. And so the last great collection of antiquity was consigned to the flames.This account of the end of the second great Alexandrian library is less than established fact - it is equally possible that the collection of the Temple of Serapis was destroyed somewhat earlier, in 391 AD, on the orders of a Christian patriarch. What is not in dispute is the existence of great collections of writings at Alexandria, the first of which was the Library of Alexandria founded by Ptolemy I around 300 BCE. The Library was the foremost of its kind throughout antiquity, boasting a collection of perhaps 490,000 scrolls. It was established as a research library for the first \\"Museum\\" - a kind of ancient think tank stocked with intellectuals lured from every corner of the Hellenistic world. Dedicated to the Muses, the Alexandria Museum and its Library were also semi-sacred places associated with religion. To learn and to study was to worship.The Library of Alexandria was the greatest though certainly not the only literary collection of antiquity. In fact, as NYU classicist Lionel Casson demonstrates in his book-length essay _Libraries in the Ancient World_, widespread literacy and pride in cultural achievement ensured that few cities of the ancient Mediterranean were without libraries of their own. While Alexandria holds a central position in library history and in Casson's account, his book seeks to cover a far wider scope.In fact this book sets out to relate \\"whatever is known\\" about ancient libraries \\"from their debut in the ancient Near East... down to the early Byzantine period.\\" Considered in terms of this goal narrowly defined, the book is a success. With modern text search technology and the availability of research assistants, a complete list of references to libraries, scrolls, codices, administration and collection can be readily extracted from the corpus of surviving classical literature. All that remains is to arrange the source material in thematic and chronological order and provide an elegant prose framework on which to hang the pertinent information. This is, I think, a very fair description of the author's methodology and achievement with _Libraries in the Ancient World_.The history of ancient libraries begins in the near east with the Mesopotamian and Egyptian civilizations. The first library worthy of the name and of which we have direct knowledge belonged to an Assyrian king of the late 2nd millennium BCE. Lacking papyrus, the Mesopotamians had no books or scrolls; records were kept on clay tablets. \\"Records\\" is by and large the appropriate term - Assyrian libraries were mainly archive collections, though some literary works have come down to us - the Epic of Gilgamesh is the most significant example.No library collections survive from ancient Egypt prior to the Hellenistic period. While Casson's conclusion is that nothing can be known of Egyptian libraries, it seems like the extensive papyrus literature recovered from Egyptian burial sites would suggest something about the kinds of works Egyptian collections contained.From Mesopotamia the scene shifts abruptly in space and time: to Greece and the Mediterranean world of the 5th century BCE. There is some brief discussion of probable Mycenaean palace archives. However the transition is too abrupt to do justice to the strong eastern influences at work on Greek civilization during the 8th and 7th centuries - that era of ancient Greek history known as the Orientalizing Period. Greek libraries, like Athena, spring full-grown into the light of day. Our knowledge is severely constrained by the fragmentary state of the historical record. But the presentation also suggests perhaps an idealized view of the classical era no longer in fashion.Certainly Casson shows that great library collections were renowned throughout the classical world. The Library of Alexandria was the centerpiece of the Ptolemaic kingdom's cultural identity and its agents were famous for their acquisitiveness. Aristotle's library, said to be the inspiration for the Ptolemies, was sought out and seized by Sulla in the Mithridatic Wars of the 1st century BCE. Through the Republican period Roman generals and proconsuls included the library collections of conquered Hellenistic kingdoms among the spoils of war. In fact Casson suggests that Rome's first significant library collections were not home-grown but carted back as loot from newly conquered provinces in Greece and Asia Minor.Substantial library resources existed at Rome by 150 BCE; by the imperial period, public and private library collections were widespread. As early as the time of Julius Caesar, libraries were seen as prestige projects by Rome's absolute rulers. Tiberius, Vespasian and Trajan each contributed large libraries for the betterment of the capital city. It turns out that Trajan's Column was flanked by the Greek and Latin wings of a giant three-level library facility - lending a new dimension of interest to an already impressive monument.The segregated layout of Trajan's Library was typical of Roman libraries - Greek on one side, Latin on the other. The body of works in Greek was vastly larger than the Latin literature, but the Romans improbably allotted equal space to both, in a physical layout not necessarily conducive to serious research. All of this suggests something about the Roman approach to literature and Roman culture in general.Casson's short book is conceived and executed as a strictly \\"just the facts\\" approach to the subject of ancient libraries. That is more than fair, but one can't help but think that there is more to explore here. What do the architectures of Greek and Roman libraries say about their respective societies? How did the library function within the carefully plotted urban plan of the Hellenistic city, or the Roman town? Questions such as these go unexplored here, but this carefully researched and nicely crafted work will no doubt serve as a valuable aid to future scholars."},{"Title":"Libraries in the Ancient World","review":"\\"Libraries in the Ancient World\\" will make an excellent TV mini-series, perhaps even a full-blown movie. I seriously wish someone in Hollywood finds this little book and shows it to the wider world!Reading the book brings to mind vivid images of institutional phenomena we now call libraries. I love libraries; they are a profound invention, and a natural consequence of writing, reading, and the evolution of the modern alphabet. I would put libraries in a group of technologies which Professor Hal Varian (of UC Berkeley and Chief Economist for Google, Inc.) named \\"combinatorial technologies,\\" like the internet. Profoundly enabling inventions that are no more expensive than a paper clip, but like a paper clip libraries will never go away. The paper clip has just morphed into an e-clip. Similarly, companies like Cisco have already made extensive use of the library concept.Lionel Casson traces libraries to archeological finds of tablets (another ancient technology that found new applications) in the ancient Near East. For instance, in 1980 a library structure was unearthed near Aleppo \\"at a site of ancient Ebla in Syria\\" (p. 3). Just amazing - you literally get goose-bumps looking at the pictures of the tablets and what they had on them! The world would have been very different without libraries.The book shows that from the Near East libraries spread to Greece. The Ashurbanipal's library was among the first and largest, but highly specialized and utilitarian ancient libraries. Moving southward from Greece the library of Alexandria in Egypt was even larger than the Ashurbanipal, and consistent with the Hellenistic Age - larger perhaps because at the time Egypt was richer than individual Greek city-states.By the second century BC the growth of libraries moved from Alexandria as the center to Pergamum. As literacy rates increased, libraries became both non-utilitarian and public. Soon libraries sprang up in Sicily and southern Italy as apparent from the writings of Livius. And there were the Macedonian library established by the Scipio brothers and funded by King Archelaus, the Lucullus library which was a military loot from Asia Minor, Cicero, Atticus, and Sulla had libraries as well. In the Roman Empire and beyond library growth was rapid and depended on gifts and donations, both made easy by the fact that \\"there was no such thing in the ancient world as copyrights or royalties\\" (p. 105). Private property rights are not the only incentives for innovations and spread of innovations.This book is excellent scholarship, full stop. I have only two thoughts about it, one regrettable and the other wishful. Regarding the wishful, I hope someone finds and reproduces this book for a wider audience. As for regret, it is too bad the book says nothing about ancient libraries in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Americas. Archeological research shows evidence of sign communication in these areas as well. Such a regret, however, is not strong enough to make me withhold my enthusiastic recommendation for this book.Amavilah, AuthorNational Wealth Accounting and Baseball Player Exports: Economic Implications for PerformanceISBN: 978-3838330099Economic Versus Non-Economic Dimensions of the Well-being of Nations.ISBN: 9783838320984Modeling Determinants of Income in Embedded Economies.ISBN: 1600210465Quotable Arthur SchopenhauerISBN: 9781430324959"},{"Title":"Libraries in the Ancient World","review":"No DJ, but shown with one in ad. no mention that book did not include DJ...but came with pieces that were cut up of the dust jacket..very tacky!"},{"Title":"Libraries in the Ancient World","review":"I'm a dilettante when it comes to study - I'll research one aspect of history deeply and them move on to skim through other entertaining bits, dropping that subject forever. This book is obviously the work of someone who spends far more time researching one subject than I ever will, and has kindly condensed it down into a fascinating book of knowledge that isn't too thick or intimidating. This deceptively slender volume takes you on a journey through history and knowledge across empires and ages, to peek into their library systems and see how they developed. It's like a world tour through time for people who adore spending time with big public collections of books. It's romantic, in a way not often seen today.One of my favorite parts in reading this book is purely a quirk of chance: While reading I saw a piece on the development of a double-checking system still used today in every level of inventory and accountability.

Libraries in the Ancient World answers all these questions and more, from a professor's perspective, ergo in immense detail that is unrivaled.Crossing a long spectrum, from the early days of Babylonia, into ancient Egypt and its papyrus, crossing over to ancient Greece and Rome, looking into the early Middle Ages and how monks continued the flourishing art of bookkeeping.Lionel Casson has written a book that is short and to the point, not filled with fluff and boring verbiage, just details, both colorful and immensely interesting.Originally published on October 15th 2001Originally published in the Long Beach Union.For over 500 book reviews and exclusive author interviews, go to [...]."},{"Title":"Libraries in the Ancient World","review":"The New York Times gave this book a huge rave, so yesterday I scampered just as fast as I could to buy two (count 'em -- 2!) copies. But what a disappointment it is! How dispiriting!Yes, it tells about the libraries and that's interesting. It tells about the birth and infancy of writing and that's fascinating, of course. It shows library architecture and gives plenty of historical insights. That's all absolutely great! I'm just a general reader, not a scholar at all, but I found a true shiny nugget every couple of pages.But it seems the book wasn't edited. Jeezum crow! The very first things I saw were two maps of the Graeco-Roman world, the western part labelled &quot;the east&quot; and the eastern part labelled &quot;the west&quot; (pages xi, xii). Huh? How come? Or maybe the book intends at last to throw off the old oppressive grammar. For example: if a name ends in &quot;s,&quot; then let's always form its possessive with an apostrophe only --&quot;Pappus' incumbency,&quot; &quot;Dionysius' background.&quot; And, hey! Let's relax the rules about the subject and object of a sentence -- now they can sometimes disagree in number: &quot;They spent their lifetime in it.&quot; (All these on page 95.)Am I a pedant merely? Maybe. But trivial errors of this kind -- and there are tons of 'em -- made me distrust the book's details and made the book disappointing and difficult to read."},{"Title":"Libraries in the Ancient World","review":"There were libraries before there were books. A fascinating survey, _Libraries in the Ancient World_ (Yale University Press) by Lionel Casson, explains how the libraries were similar and different from our own, and how they managed without printing and without books as we know them. The similarities are reassuring and often delightful. We suspect there were Egyptian libraries, but we have never found one, because there are no masses of papyrus documents; such collections may have been lost in fires. The Sumerians, however, had written records were in cuneiform letters, pressed into clay. Some of the collections of these tablets offered the privilege of borrowing, and librarians then seem to have been bothered by two of the same problems that beset librarians now, theft and damage. Tablets bore warnings or curses calling upon the services of the local gods: \\"Whoever removes the tablet... may Ashur and Ninlil, angered and grim, cast him down, erase his name, his seed, in the land\\", \\"He who carries it off, may Adad and Shala carry him off!\\", and \\"Who rubs out the text, Marduk will look upon him with anger.\\"It was the Greeks who instituted libraries with aims similar to our own, shelves full of books on a wide range of subjects, available to readers who could come in and consult them. There was a demand for books, and by the fourth century BCE, bookselling was a flourishing industry. The booksellers probably employed scribes to turn out copies of works. There were no such things as royalties or author's rights. Rome conquered all, but Greece held intellectual sway over the Romans, who continued the library tradition. Roman libraries had bookshelves of a particular type set into the walls, and archeologists can spot the tell-tale imprint of the bookshelves and thereby identify a chamber as a library. Independent public libraries faded as the libraries became incorporated, surprisingly, into other structures, the baths. Here they served as part of a recreational and cultural center. Casson ends his story with the codex and the great monastic libraries. The codex is very much like a modern book, not a scroll, but a mass of pages sewn together with covers (perhaps of wood). It was less bulky (both sides of the paper being used) and could be held in one hand, with the other hand taking notes. It took a long time for the scrolls to die out, except among the Christians who used codices for their scriptures, possibly because of the pagan association to scrolls.Casson, a Professor Emeritus of Classics, has gathered together an important tale not just of libraries but of reading and publishing. It is the first full study of libraries in the ancient world. If you love libraries and books, this is a fine book for learning about their earliest foundations."},{"Title":"Libraries in the Ancient World","review":"For a book that could have been unspeakably dull, Libraries in the Ancient World is a fascinating (and easy to read) look at a neglected aspect of the classical world. Starting with Ebla and the Sumarians, it travels through Greece, Egypt, Rome and up into the Medieval world providing insight and amusing anecdotes about historical figures from ancient times. Most people have heard about the burning of the Library at Alexandria -- not many might realize it burned several times, and was rebuilt until the last burning finally destroyed it. One of Marc Antony's gifts to Cleopatra was scrolls to replace some burned in one fire. Early clay tablets show that one thing never changes for libraries; there is an invocation to the Gods asking that they wipe from the earth -- book thieves.

A very informative and detailed description of early libraries and, to an extent, their role in the ancient world.

It is amazing to learn when and where certain libarary conventions we take for granted today, come from. This book is a great starting point for further exploration of early libraries or libraries in general. It is also sufficient by itself as a quick survey of the first 1000 years of libraries and texts.Casson also keeps the work interesting by including the derivation of certain words such as &quot;ostracism&quot; and &quot;parchement&quot;. He also gives an important sense of how scrolls and tablets were used in ancient times and by whom.This book would probably not be adequate for a library scholar but I did not think it was intended as such.

Most of the chapters are about the libraries of the Classical World from the library of Aristotle to the library of Alexandria to the libraries of Rome to the libraries of the far parts of the Empire. The reader will find out how libraries gained books, who read them, and how they were maintained. There are additional chapters on the rise of libraries in the ancient Near East, the development of the codex, and libraries after the fall of Rome.What makes this book captivating is that each chapter is filled with anecdotes. For example, a tablet from Uruk warns that anyone who fears Anu and Antu will return the tablet to the owner the same day. In ancient times library fines were not just 10 cents per day."},{"Title":"Libraries in the Ancient World","review":"In this amazingly complete 150-page volume, renowned author Lionel Casson, takes us on a wonderful journey of discovery of the role of libraries in the ancient world, from their origins in the Near East in 3000 BC through their evolution until the fall of Roman Byzantium in 1453 AD.Written in a lively prose, this well-researched, fact-filled book explains when, where, why, and how the forerunners of today's modern libraries were created and developed, treating in detail topics such as:*How did they acquire their materials?*How were they physically organized?*Which, if any, system of cataloguing they used?*Who had access to their holdings?*How they solved problems like theft and damage of their collections?*What was their connection with the rise and fall of education?The author also presents a concise account of the history of books from clay tablet to papyrus roll to parchment codex to our modern day volumes. He shares fascinating insights into the development of writing and the evolution of writing technology, including:*What was the purpose of writing?*Which topics were more commonly written about?*Which materials were used and why?*Who did the writing?The best part of this book is the entertaining and charming way in which the author illustrates his exposition. By employing captivating anecdotes from sources contemporary to the facts, literary sources that have survived to this day, and archaeological finds combined with modern technology that make possible the reconstruction of ancient library buildings, he makes what would otherwise be a very boring topic feel like a true adventure.As a bonus, the book also explains where many modern words related to libraries and books come from, and includes many drawings and pictures, which perfectly illustrate the points being made, and a thorough bibliography that is an excellent starting point for further exploration.If you are at all interested in the history of writing, books, and libraries this pleasurable and compact volume is definitely a must-read.--Reviewed by M. E. Volmar"},{"Title":"Libraries in the Ancient World","review":"Libraries in the ancient World is a honest introduction to the argument of book collection and text transmission in the ancient classical and pre-classical world.It tells the story of ancient libraries from their very beginning (the royal libraries of the Ancient Near East) down to the first Christian monastic institutions of the Middle Age, focusing on the topic of library, both as building and institution.As far as the analysis of archaeological data is involved, Casson is able to build a strong argument with detail and precision of analysis: he reviews all the relevant evidence and is able to balance and present the different hypotheses and the sources of his study.Exposition is far weaker when it comes to take into consideration the extant literary testimonies and appraise the place of libraries in the larger context of literacy and books in the Greek and Roman Civilization.Graeco-Roman Philology is a fascinating field, since it is open to almost unending surprises.It is also a field that can command enormous appeal as well as almost infinite boredom, depending on how it is presented. This is due to the distance - both temporal and cultural - from our world and that society.It is natural that when we think about a library, a bookshop, a writer, a book - we ask for the help of everyday experience. A bookstore is a bookstore. A book a book... like in everyday experience. .And yet, under the surface of apparent similarity, we come to discover a far different truth.This truth is unendingly announcing the miracle of historical, literary, medical, philosophical, ... texts, most of them dating back about 2500 years that have been able to reach us in adventurous and often incredible ways.The strong archaeological approach, is probably responsible for the difficulty to present is a comprehensive analysis of libraries, books, literacy in the larger context of a far different society and the problems of text transmission in an age still far from Gutenberg.Ancient World was different from our own (and different as well the Latin World from the Greek)Just to name some differences that are not considered in the exposition:- Problems in reading and spelling - contrary to our books, the ancient rolls and codices were written in almost exclusively in capital letters, and with no spacing between words. This presented insurmountable difficulties for people with low literacy and asked for far better knowledge of language and language skills than we have today. Besides it made text corruption far easier.- Reading aloud - today reading conveys the idea of a quiet space and of silence. Actually one of the most astonishing differences between us and them is signalled by Augustine, when he writes in the \\"Confessions\\" that his master Ambrose (bishop of Milan) was capable to read \\"without emitting any sound nor moving the tongue\\".... that is: reading in the classical times consisted only in reading aloud... in turn the act of making a copy of a text is to be more properly described as being dictated, and libraries were not the silent sanctuaries we know today, but rather different noisy places more similar probably to modern Koranic schools.- Spreading of illiteracy. In this, Greek and Latin world were probably different. In the west, literacy resented early of a progressive decline, that coupled with the passage from roll to codex created a momentous phenomenon of deterioration, especially in some fields (not just many technical and scientific books were lost, but as well many less read writers (it is funny that a technical innovation ended speeding the process of decadence). This phenomenon of progressive narrowing of scope was further aggravated by the spreading of illiteracy during the early Middle Age: in many mosaics of this period painters end up to represent books as closed, both because unable themselves to write and because people around them are no more able to read. Illiteracy, difficulty in text reading, all coupled with a worsening of Latin and Greek knowledge (specially in the West), had big impact on the transmission of texts.There is also a second trait of the account I do not agree.This is the over-simplification according to which we have a Greek and Latin Culture in total opposition to other \\"barbarian\\" (i.e. of lesser species) cultures, that contributed more or less to the decline into the Middle ages.Actually this is not so.And especially so for the main opposition presented: that between Greek Byzantine Empire and \\"Eastern\\" cultures.There's an implicit assumption (sometimes annoyingly made explicit) according to which Arabs erased all sign of Greek culture in the newly conquered lands - a newly presented argument for a learned and cultured West versus inferior and unsophisticated East.Actually there are strong indications this is far from correct and that an osmosis between Greek culture and \\"Eastern\\" cultures was well established at least since the reign of emperor Justinian. Not only does the contemporary historiographer Agatia tell us the story about translations into Persian commissioned by Corsoe I, king of Persia (Historiae, B28.1), but the same king did give sanctuary to many philosophers of the School of Athens, after this pagan institution was forcibly closed by order of the emperor.As for the Arabs, since the very beginning of their rule, there was a momentous activity of translation (at least three great waves are recorded of this phenomenon) from Greek to Arab (often through Syriac) that in turn caused a new osmosis from Arabic lands to the Byzanthine empire since the IX century and from Arab Spain and Sicily to the Latin West as far as XII Century, well before the fall of Byzantium and the looming of European Renaissance (the Salernitan School, St Tomas Aquinas,...).We must thank all these Arab scribes, philosophers, booksellers, translators and enlightened rulers if we can enjoy today so much of the Greek literature.One of my passion (if you did not guess already) is the history of the transmission of books - specially in the larger context of classical western culture.If anyone does share this interest, could be interested in a few books I had the chance to read in the past about this argument:- \\"The Vanished Library\\" by Luciano Canfora (possibly the most authoritative story of the Royal Library in Alexandria),- \\"Scribes and Scholars\\" by L.D. Reynold & N.G. Wilson, still unsurpassed introduction to classical philology. One of the few books in which academic and poetical are not incompatible adjectives- \\"Greek Thought and Arabic Culture\\" by Dimitri Gutas, a very interesting survey of the continuous exchanges from East to West and back from the rise of the Persian Empire to the advent of Islamism- \\"A History of Reading\\" by Alberto Manguel, brilliant and entertaining, written by a disciple - and in the dense style -of Borges- \\"A Gentle Madness.Bibliophiles Bibliomanes and the Eternal passion for books\\" by Basbanes, a mine of anecdotes that is both fascinating and witty"},{"Title":"Libraries in the Ancient World","review":"Brisk, compact study of books and libraries from ancient Mesopotamia, through Greece and Rome, to the threshold of the medieval era.

I agree with the previous reviewer: this book could have been unbearably boring, but Casson enlivens his subject, and you really do learn a lot about the architecture, scope and content of ancient libraries, beginning with those found in ancient Mesopotamia and continuing up until that most ambitious and learned of monks, Cassiodorus, founded his monastery--Vivarium--with its many books in 551 A.D.There is everything of importance in between, including the history of the most magnificent of libraries--the Library of Alexandria--and the lesser known but very important library in Pergamum. Though this book is about libraries, you can't help learning about literacy, writing, the difference between papyrus and parchment, and the rise of the codex.This is an invaluable little book that contains within its pages a collection of information that is rarely found between two covers (i.e. it's usually scattered among various books). For this service, Casson deserves praise."},{"Title":"Libraries in the Ancient World","review":"In \\"Libraries in the Ancient World\\", author Lionel Casson traces the history of libraries from the 3rd millennium B.C. through the 4th and 5th centuries A.D. The libraries discussed are those in the Mediterranean and Near East regions, from which our modern Western library systems ultimately derived. This book includes chapters on the oldest known libraries in the ancient Near East, the Greek libraries in which we begin to see the roots of our own, the extraordinary Library of Alexandria in Egypt, the growth of libraries beginning in the third century B.C., the first truly public libraries in Rome and its empire, the evolution from rolls to codices as the preferred literary medium, and the rise of monasteries as literary repositories in late antiquity. As Casson describes these ancient libraries, he also discusses literacy, publishing, bookmaking, and bibliomania in the ancient world, thereby providing a glimpse into the social history of these cultures from the unusual perspective of their literary values. Through ancient literature, itself, and through archeological finds, Casson is able to piece together a reasonably detailed picture of what early libraries looked like, how they functioned, and whom they served. I recommend \\"Libraries in the Ancient World\\" to anyone interested in ancient history or the history of books or literacy. This is a small, easily absorbed volume packed with fascinating facts and insights into the role and reverence of books in the ancient world."},{"Title":"Libraries in the Ancient World","review":"While Casson's study is short, only 169 pages includes endnotes, it is well written for a general audience or an undergraduate audience. Beginning with the Near East and ending with Late Antiquity, Casson describes the surviving evidence, both literary and archaeological, about libraries, books, and book making/selling. By refering to specific anicent authors and evidence I think Casson demonstrates a good historical approach to the question of when libraries began and how they functioned in their respective cultures. Thirty illustrations or photographs help show his reader some of the evidence and in a very visional world this is very important. Certainly not the final word on these issues but a good, easily accessible introduction."},{"Title":"Have You Seen the Crocodile?

Excellent first-hand journalism."},{"Title":"Inside Central America: Its People, Politics, and History","review":"Krauss was one of those reporters who worked Central America in the 1980s and 1990s and reported as an independent news correspondent. In this book, he gives his views on the six countries of Central America (he left out Belize) and gives a brief history of each nation. I think Krauss was both fair and objective in his views of each of these nations. Krauss details the violence endemic in El Salvador and Guatemala. He also finds the less violent ways of Costa Rica and Honduras amazing in an area so prone to violence. Nicaragua and Panama are the middlings in terms of violence. He also tries to view recent events through the prism of each respective nation's history. There is a lot of insight in this book. Other reporters would have just reported what they saw and mixed in their own political viewpoints.The book is an interesting read with some very dry spells. I found the 60 page chapter on El Salvador a hard slog to get through and understand. The other chapters seemed to be OK. One has to be interested in Central America to read this. Since I have visited all these countries, I found the material in this book of interest in understanding these countries.

The small pleasures, the difficult trips in an open boat to get supplies, the child's sweetness in his friendship with a magpie, all these and more stories are told in a daily journal. And illustrated as Kent always does, with insight and style. Kent as a writer is equal to Kent as an artist, intellectual and candid in his telling a story and sharing impressions. If this is your first reading of a Kent book, you have a long list of other books ahead for this was his first book done as a &quot;first person&quot; storyteller. His desire for remote and wild landscapes to paint took him, and then takes us, through his work, to many other places over many decades. But none are any more delightful and majestic than this trip to Alaska. To check out the validity of this remote place, I took a trip to Fox Island several years ago, and though I didn't see it in the winter as Rockwell and his son did, it was dramatic, beautiful and matched the feeling I'd gotten when I first read the book years ago. The nice touch of this edition is that the editor, Doug Capra, has a very fine introduction to the book and Capra knows his subject. He has been researching Kent for years, but more than that, he has something to say and says it well. Few Kent editors do. But the book--it makes a wonderful Christmas gift because it has a really fine description of what a meaningful Christmas celebration can be in a remote place, shared with a hermit on the island, the father and little boy. There are some delightful details in this story: the food taken for the trip; the books for father and son; the rigerous baths when the bay freezes and the ice cold waters no longer are available. Kent is no ordinary artist, writer or father. And this is no ordinary adventure. It makes you wish, even yearn, for that place, that time, those people. I knew Rockwell Kent in the final few years of his life and he still carried that energtic view of life, that love of beauty and nature that comes alive in this small work. And three cheers to Doug Capra for bringing this new edition to life for it is of the quality for which Kent was famous in his published books. (A wretched edition of this treasure of a story was published a few years before and this edition puts to rest a Kent lover's dispair about having a bad edition of a Kent work on the shelves, any shelves. I almost never throw books away but this earlier paperback with bad design from cover to cover merits polluting a garbage pail.) So, invest in some good reading, some laughs and some wistful thoughts about what a wilderness adventure could be. And for those who have courage, still can be."},{"Title":"Wilderness: A journal of quiet adventure in Alaska","review":"You can pick this book off your library shelf any time, open it to any page, start at any paragraph and begin to feel a mantle of peace settle over your jangled nerves. &quot;Wilderness&quot; is the record of artist Rockwell Kent and his 9-year-old son spending a winter in Alaska on Fox Island in Resurrection Bay, near Seward, with only one elderly Swede as a neighbor.

Except for the occasion, unknowing, encounters with Kent's illustrations--for Moby Dick, for Shakespeare, for Random House--I was completely unaware of Rockwell Kent or his work until the Portland (ME) Art Museum had a summer retrospective of his work--including paintings from the Pushkin Museum--a couple years ago. The immediately seized my imagination. They work much like the symphonies of Sibelius work, vast expanses of barren landscape, as intimidating as they are compelling. It was with such a background that I purchased Wilderness. What an intriguing story: a father goes to Alaska to paint (and create a set of illustrations for Nietsche's Zarathustra) and, with his wife's permission, takes their 9 year old son (also named Rockwell) along for the company and the sheer adventure of it. How amazing is that? How envious of the young Rockwell I am. What hay would I have made of such an opportunity to escape the world with my father for seven months on the verge of puberty and participate in an adventure I'd wonder at the rest of my life. No wonder the book was a best seller upon its publication (1920). No wonder the book was compared, hyperbolically I'll admit, to Whitman's Leaves of Grass in terms of its potential influence on American literature. The 1996 edition by Wesleyan University Press includes many additional illustrations, including some of young Rockwell's drawings and letters. Altogether, a very satisfying experience. It does exactly what it set out to do."},{"Title":"Wilderness: A journal of quiet adventure in Alaska","review":"Make sure this is the last of the Rockwell Kent books you read....It is nothing in comparison to his others (I have not yet read Salamina). Self-exiled (somewhat) to an island south of Seward, AK with his 9-year-old son and an old Scandinavian down a piece, we see how this fellow slowly develops a case of apparent \\"cabin fever\\" (who wouldn't -- except his neighbor -- who has his goats to keep him company) His illustrations are so-so,and he seems to be increasingly fascinated with his son's nakedness, which he likes to sketch and load this book up with. We are told by him that he is constantly stretching canvases and painting, but we see only one painting on the cover of the book.Rockwell Kent, for sure was a strange fellow, and I presume his interest in his son's anatomy is really an artistic one, but it does seem to become a bit of a fixation as the sojourn draws near and they make ready to return to wife and mother back in the lower 48. The book may be of interest to a psychologist studying human isolation and miserable weather, but for the rest, unless you are a devotee of naked children, it is not really worth the candle.."},{"Title":"Wilderness: A journal of quiet adventure in Alaska","review":"I found this book to be very informative about the land and extream weather of Alaska but it ran a little dry quickly. This is a journal of around 9 months of Rockwell kents life while in Alaska. I have read other books that were written from journals and Kents does fair better then most. I can understand that a journal in Alsaka can run out of new and interesting things to write about and this book seemed to try to fill in the gaps with Kents thoughts and many philosophies. All in all I do recomend this book to anyone who really want a real veiw of what Alaska is actually like."},{"Title":"Secret Seven win through","review":"I like Secret Seven a lot and I really like this book!

I loved the first book, liked the second and tolerated the third. Probably more an issue with the publishing racket than anything against the author. While I enjoyed this third installment of the Kovac's book, this one is very far removed from the gritty nior feel that the first one was able to engender in it's readers.

A very fast and engrossing read - hopefully he'll do more of them.

(Morgan, are you paying attention?)"},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"Back on his home planet of Harlan's World, Takeshi Kovacs is trying to mind his own business -- which happens to be a personal open season on the priests of a fanatical religion. However, he soon becomes a target of the Yakuza, hiring on with some machine-killing mercenaries, on the outs with the ruling family, in bed with a resurrected legendary rebel prophet, and throwing in with surfer revolutionaries, all while being hunted by a younger version of himself. Despite being so darned adorable Kovacs just can't get an even break, but he does kind of bring it on himself.Woken Furies is Richard K. Morgan's third and latest TAKESHI KOVACS novel. Raw-edged violence, graphic sex, and bad attitudes continue to be a mainstay of this series. (Can you say awesome?) Altered Carbon is still my favorite but Woken Furies comes in as a very close second. Without risking a spoiler, I will say the conclusion of Woken Furies is the most satisfying of the three books.If you've read the proceeding TAKESHI KOVACS novels, you already know that the most crucial element of this series is the technology that allows a person's consciousness to be uploaded into a \\"cortical stack\\" which in turn can been implanted into another vacant body or \\"sleeve.\\" As long as a person has the means to acquire their next sleeve and as long as their cortical stack remains intact, they will never die. What makes Mr. Morgan's take on immortality different is that except for the extremely wealthy who can afford to be cloned, there's no telling who, or sometimes what, someone will be \\"re-sleeved\\" as. This makes for intriguing twists because Takeshi changes bodies like we do cars. Sometimes he gets a top-of-the-line, high-performance model. Other times, his sleeve is just something he's stuck with until he can do better.Kovacs has got to be one of the angriest and self-loathing characters in fiction. He racks up a body count that rivals CONAN THE BARBARIAN. If that's not enough incentive to stay off his bad side, Kovacs makes revenge an art form of which he is the master. Just like the Pale Rider of the apocalypse, where Takeshi Kovacs goes, Hell follows.Harlan's World is a very interesting setting with its high ocean-to-land ratio and ancient Martian satellites that blast most everything out of the sky. The largest landmass on Harlan's World is currently uninhabitable due to evolving artificially intelligent machines which mercenaries called deComs make a good, but dangerous, living destroying. Not to mention that the planet's three moons make for a courageous -- or maybe suicidal -- surfers' paradise. Three centuries previous, after a failed revolution, the all-powerful Protectorate granted the rule of the entire planet to the Harlan family, who has a truce of sorts with the rampant criminal underworld. Also a twisted religion -- much like the beliefs of al Qaida -- has been growing steadily. And this is Takeshi Kovacs' hometown. Add that to an abusive father and it's no wonder he's so screwed up.While Kovacs' antisocial behavior, violent tendencies, and authority issues may make him self-destructive and a danger to society, they make one helluva a dark adventure for readers. Kovacs holds a special place in my jaded heart."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"I listened to the audio version which I borrowed from the library.An excellent listen.

This book is worth the read..."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"Reading the cyberpunk-inspired first third-to-half of WOKEN FURIES is like listening to a late 90s band performing an original song written in early 80s New Wave style. It's catchy, retro, and fun (like Elastica's \\"Connection\\"). But it's not the 80s any more, and, like us, Morgan's anti-hero Takeshi Kovacs needs to grow up. For Kovacs, growing up means facing some of his many contradictions; he's part Japanese/part Hungarian, part heartless killer/part bleeding-heart humanitarian, part elite soldier/part low-life criminal, part man of (relative) privilege/part enemy of the ruling elite, and part citizen of the galaxy/part homeboy. As Kovacs faces himself (literally and figuratively), the fun starts to drain away. In place of the fun is politics; specifically, the vaguely eco-feminist/social democratic/libertarian politics of Quellcrist Falconer. This is not necessarily a Bad Thing, and I think there's something useful to Quellist notions about the accumulation vs. the diffusion of social power, but I don't think either Kovacs or Morgan get over their cynicism about politics very convincingly. One wish: More Martians! WOKEN FURIES does not have the purity or the dynamism of the two previous Takeshi Kovacs novels, and it does drag at points, but it is more thought-provoking than its predecessors while still being enjoyable and well worth reading. Warning: Adults only."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"Takeshi Kovacs, an ex-Envoy now working for his own agenda, has returned to his homeworld of Harlan's World on a personal mission of vengeance. During his task he falls in with a gang of freelance mercs assigned to cleaning out the continent of New Hokkaida, where intelligent robots left behind from an old war are still making the land too unsafe for re-colonisation. A chain of events is set in motion that will transform the face of Harlan's World and bring Kovacs face-to-face with his own past in a very literal way.Woken Furies is the third and, to date, final book featuring Morgan's protagonist Takeshi Kovacs. This time Kovacs is out for blood on his own terms when he is swept up in a very different and fuzzy chain of events which focuses on his own past. If Altered Carbon was a detective story and Broken Angels was a war story, Woken Furies is more of a political story and offers more of a glimpse into Kovacs' mindset, brought into sharp relief as he encounters old friends and enemies on his home planet. These events also allow Morgan to explore some more of the consequences of his body-swapping, re-sleeving universe, with subtle nods towards its implications for consciousness, sentience and what it precisely means to be human (a slight and barely perceptible nudge compared to Bakker's Neuropath, which yelled it into the reader's face loudly until we got it).As usual, this is an ultra-violent, bloody, sexually explicit and generally pretty hardcore story of revenge, rebellion and fear, with some exploding robots, surfing and extreme rock-climbing thrown into the mix. Those who've followed Kovacs' adventures before will be at home here, although given that the events of the first two books do impact on the story here I would advise newcomers to start with Altered Carbon first.Woken Furies (****) is the last Kovacs novel for the time being, although Morgan has not entirely ruled out a return to him later on. The book is available from Gollancz in the UK and from Del Rey in the USA. Morgan's latest novel, The Steel Remains, is out now in the UK and in February in the USA."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"Like the other books in this series this one is excellent.

By the same author, but not part of this series, I recommend Market Forces."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"this book was as nice to read as the first two in the series. also...i do hope that the author writes one more book for this series, as he creates great possibilities for a fourth novel."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"If you have enjoyed Altered Carbon and Broken Angels, then you will enjoy Woken Furies. If you have not read the first two, it is recommended for although this isn't a directly sequential trilogy, the first two books set up Morgan's universe and Woken Furies will read easier and make more sense with the first two books under your belt.That said, Woken Furies ends the Kovac's books (at least according to Morgan). Morgan ends his small group, military tactical operations novel series by expanding the scope to events with implications throughout the Protectorate. Kovac's has to grapple with his inner demons while dodging an onslaught of yakuza, military and religious opponents. In the end, Kovacs' attempt to become something more than an ex-Envoy criminal, and his struggle against his own pessimism, lifts this novel from what would otherwise be a typical SF adventure novel.Like the previous books, there's a brain and a heart here. Recommended for readers who enjoyed the previous novels and whose looking for fast-paced SF adventure with more brains than average."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"In the distant future, Takeshi Kovacs heads home to repressive Harlan's World to eerily confront himself when he was an Envoy working for the UN as a super soldier to keep people on the remote planets in check. Since he could afford to leave that body behind, Takeshi downloaded his personality into a new \\"sleeve\\" and left for another world to start life anew.On Harlan's World, Kovacs soon finds himself protecting Sylvie, an apparent reincarnation of a long dead messiah, from the First Families, who need her dead as her message interferes with the power they yield. The First Families send an Envoy to kill Sylvie, but Kovacs believes the killer is a younger healthier him.This is an action-packed science fiction Noir that starts in hyperspeed before accelerating into faster than light velocity. The suspense laden story line is all action except when Richard K. Morgan chooses to pontificate against any form of religious fundamentalism, which Kovacs believes by its essence means its burden requires either altering carbon structure or breaking the angels of those of other belief systems. Kovacs is at his best when affirming you can't home, at least not safely. Fans of electrifying futuristic thrillers will appreciate the award winning author's latest triumph.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"Look gang, obviously almost everybody likes the work. Here's why my review might be different: It's literary.Morgan's newest work in the series brings about a character meltdown for Kovacs and if you think about it, it was about time. The character has his usual action packed kill fest, but the events of his life and the previous 3 books are changing him.Now if you like character driven books then you will like this, because the Kovacs series (and Morgan for that matter) had a choice to make, either become a one dimensional outlet miliporn or become a real science fiction series. Morgan decided he wanted to be a writer, not a hack.So here we have a being who has done the lousy evil work for years through multiple bodies, all the while with only a version of super advance analysis to keep him from being a psychotic serial killing sociopath. Remember in the other two books, Envoys are directed sociopaths, but they have their conditioning to keep them from going all the way. Kovacs on the other hand has had to go through more than the average Envoy so it stands to reason he will face a reckoning.And to be honest who would want to read a constant, silly, innane rehashing where the main character just kills with no thought or regret? A long formulaic series of empty books with no real plot? (Drake, Webber, and Sherman fans aside of course)So here is Kovacs event and it is a doozy. What will the result be? I'll tell you this: The possibility of a sequal is not a given.This is a good work, yeah it echoes Flandry of Terra and All My Sins Remembered, in that you have a writer asking, What happens when your despicable acts reshape your soul? I am happy to say that Morgan answers the question in a different and new way than his two excellent predecessors.Get the book."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"After reading Altered Carbon (from here on let's call it \\"AC\\") and Broken Angels (\\"BA\\"), and having read so many positive reviews on amazon, I ordered Woken Furies (\\"WF\\"), too. AC was not quite a revelation, but I liked it - especially the Kovacs character. BA was quite another thing. It didn't feel like a waste of time and money, but the positive qualities of AC went slightly downhill here. All in all, I think I wouldn't read it again, and I gave my reasons in a detailed amazon review. Still, three points out of five.And now Woken Furies. Whatever went wrong in in BA, here the author really blew it big time. WF reads like a cheap rip-off of AC and BA, only that it was the original author who wrote a bad copy of his own books. A first-rate ghost writer might have done a better job.In terms of genre writing, WF is kind of a cross-over between SF and a military spec ops thriller, just like BA. Crime and the mob are part of the story, Kovacs does some reconnaissance work, but it's light years away from being anything like a detective story. Compared to AC, Kovacs as a character has now totally lost his edge. The slick and cool detective is gone, Kovacs starts out as a pathetic, embittered tragic-romantic hero on a desperate and psychotic murdering spree against those that wronged him. On the first pages he's going astray into quite another thing, on no other grounds that he's got nothing better to do in that moment, and because some woman reminds him of his demised sweetie pie. At that point I should have stopped reading, really. But I didn't.Like Kovacs, also the dialogues lose their cutting edge. One-liners, rest in peace. In BA, Morgan succeeded from time to time in creating fascinating moods and had one or the other interesting idea, but in this respect, WF is a total waste land. As for me, the only memorable scene in the whole book is in the middle when the deComs are \\"negotiating\\" with the machine life-forms they're hunting. Great and funny as it is (in a sombre way), after a page Morgan drops the idea, and that's it. Obviously the author doesn't know how to make use of a good idea. At least not while writing WF! Or take the idea of Kovacs being hunted down by the \\"re-ensleevement\\" of his own younger self: open the book and watch this fascinating and most promising idea crumbling into dust under Morgan's very hands. He's totally unable to turn it even into a single interesting scene. The publisher is trying to sell \\"Woken Furies\\" on the strength of that idea, but Morgan's inconsequential and anti-climactic treatment of this story line is actually one of the book's greatest weaknesses ...The plot progresses more or less arbitrarily and is overly inflated. Usually there is no compelling reason for one step of the plot developping out of the other. It consists of three strands hinted at, no, given away in the first pages of the book and in the flap text: 1) Kovacs' romantic-psychotic vendetta; 2) his new love interest's mind being inhabited by something else; and 3) the powers that be taking an interest in \\"something else\\" and producing another incarnation of Kovacs, pirated from a younger version, to hunt them down. Most of the plot is somehow being prodded forward by (2) and (3), and that's the best you can say: \\"somehow being prodded forward\\", without end, just to fill the pages, it seems. To inflate the book up to 500 pages so that a certain segment of readers gets more \\"immersion value\\" for their money. I'm quite positive that the whole thing could have been written as a kind of short novel with no more than 150 pages. And that could have been some book!There's no added value in lengthening the book, especially from a literary point of view: The places Kovacs goes to have no faces, no moods, they leave no impressions. Anyway, he is constantly hurrying from one place on Harlan's World to the next. In terms of places, there's no focus here, no resting point, and let no one tell me that it serves to create a mood of breathlessness and being on the run. It doesn't. It's just one bore after the other. After some time all those places feel the same and exchangeable, and you have to force yourself not to start speed-reading their descriptions when Kovacs reaches still somewhere else.Back to the plot: it remains inconclusive for most of those 500 pages, and it could have gone on like that for a thousand more if Morgan hadn't cut short at the publisher's page limit and invoked - I'm taking a deep breath now - the Deus ex machina on the final pages to kill it all off. Could the story-telling possibly become more corrupted? And it's really a BIG and BAD Deus ex machina, text-book style, blatant, and stupidly implausible! On those last pages you can really see Morgan sweating and toiling to remind us of all the obscure hints that he had left in the previous 500 pages for the reader to notice and guess (if he/she was just bright enough...). My theory goes like this: first Morgan wrote the whole story, then killed it off by DEM, and then went back in his text file and interspersed a bunch of obscure hints /ex post/, like, one line every ten or twenty pages.How to explain the point? Let me try and give an example: It's like reading a whodunit, and in the end the murderer was the gardener. No, that's not like it. Had it been written by Morgan, the murderer had been the gardener's nephew's other uncle. We saw that guy, like, once on page 107 walking on the street /and making a face/. Now in Morgan's book, Kovacs would have recalled this situation on page 513 thanks to his incredible Envoy powers of recall (Morgan even explains it like that!), and we'd have been given to read (in italics): [line break] \\"he was walking on the street\\" [line break] \\"making a face\\". Go on with all the other meaningless \\"hints\\" in italics and with line breaks, go on like that for another one or two pages given as Kovacs' inner monologue, and in the end we're supposed to accept that it wasn't the big, bad DEM, but an obvious and utterly logical conclusion to the whole story after all - case settled.But it doesn't work that way. Even for a trashy SF rip-off like this, that is. Just. Too. Pathetic.The characters: there is not a single one among them that you possibly come to care about. Even Kovacs himself, I'm not sure whether I cared about him in any way. They are all flat, all two-dimensionial, while Kovacs himself is just a shadow of the guy he used to be in Altered Carbon. That Nadia- or Quellcrist-character had some potential, but Morgan chose to limit her to three or four short conversations with Kovacs. I liked her much better in AC and BA, because there she was a fascinating sort of motif, an expression of Kovacs' subversive side. In WF, the author really burns her. If you still want to read it, you'll see. Same with Virginia Vidaura who used to be a kind of mother figure and role model for Kovacs in AC and BA, where she figured just as a reminiscence, as another expression of Kovacs' interior. Morgan's giving a coming-of-age angle to her and Morgan's relationship in WF, but well, I've seen better-working literary fig leafs as a pretext for, let's say, recreational scenes. Mr Morgan, your baggage shows here.Erotic scenes in WF: trashy, needless and utterly unimaginative. Every single one. I already ranted about that in my amazon review of Broken Angels, and what I wrote there could also be said here, to the last letter. Whenever Kovacs meets a female of the species, chances are very good they'll soon ... enact a recreational scene. Moreover, Mr Morgan seems to have an extremely unsavoury fixation on the aspect of bodily fluids, but maybe it's just me being prudish here. But as for me, constantly revolting it was. What in the world does Morgan have in mind when he's concocting that trash? My theory is that he is imagining a target audience consisting mostly of extremely \\"undernourished\\" young males. [PS. I just found a great term for what I mean somewhere else on the net: \\"teen-masturbatory erotica\\".] Those scenes being devoid of any other merit (like e. g. narrative significance), I'd be at a loss for another explanation. By the way, in Morgan's books they're more or less always performing the same routines, so maybe Morgan is always taking the same erotic scene and just re-wording, re-constructing it? I think that even for those readers who really, really need to have that stuff, it's gonna be rather boring and frustrating after scene number two ...And finally I'm summing up another rant from my BA review, also true for this book: Morgan's literary device of breaking up sentences with full stops. Well, still. Works not. Neither here. Please make use of triple-dots. When people are stopping. To think. And neither do you use full-stops. To emphasize! Might have been a nice idea to give flavour to a particular character, but if everyone in the novel talks like that, it becomes such a pain to read. Dear author! Please find other ways to make your books look like literature. Thanks.To sum it all up: Woken Furies. Don't waste your money on that bore. Just don't!"},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"\\"Woken Furies\\" was an interesting novel that packed in a lot of ideas and characters, some of which (the stacks and the Envoys) are carried over from \\"Altered Carbon,\\" and most of which are new. There's something new on every page, just about. By and large, it is entertaining and holds your attention.However, \\"Woken Furies\\" is badly in need of editing. Where \\"Altered Carbon\\" was taut and well-plotted, \\"Woken Furies\\" meanders quite a bit. Part of the problem may be Morgan's movie contract. The book jacket indicates that Joel Silver bought the movie rights to both books. As a result, \\"Woken Furies\\" at times seems to read like a series of big SF action-adventure movie set pieces written with the movie-to-come in mind.Nevertheless, this book is at least worth checking out from the library."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"Altered Carbon was a thrilling murder mystery with themes of morality and immortality, and it was amazing.Broken Angels was \\"Aliens\\" without the aliens, and it was awful.While Woken Furies is better than Broken Angels, it still makes the same mistakes and doesn't live up to Altered Carbon's genius.Morgan is in love with the word \\"Shrug\\"Characters constantly shrug, occassionally grinning, and that's the extent of their physical reactions. Sometimes they shrug 4 times during a converstation. During the novel a character even feigns shrugging. In 450 pages I estimate the word shrug is used over 300 times. See how annoying the reading the word shrug is in this paragraph? Now imagine reading it over and over and over on every page of a novel.Kovacs is no longer a compelling character (even if there are two of them, it was done better before). In Altered Carbon, he was ruthless and calculating, driven by his Envoy training. Here, as in Broken Angels, Kovacs is half the man he used to be. He follows instead of leads. He seems not as smart. He makes mistakes that go against his original characterization. He lets things happen to him instead of making them happen.He's more human, which is understandable when trying to make the reader relate to the character, but ultimately boring. To me, Kovacs was Superman in Altered Carbon. In the sequels he's Clark Kent.Morgan's supporting cast are for the most part one dimensional and clitche. You've got the big tough guy who is always angry. You have the soldier chick who's a lesbian. You have the sly grifter type. You even have a salty old sea captain. None of them are compelling and almost all of them are throw aways. In fact, most of them are thrown away.The most compelling parts of the Kovacs universe again are not used to their potential. Sleeving, needlecasting and storage take a back seat to long winded descriptions of seaside towns and boats. Most of the time this novel seems like a guided tour and history lesson of Harlan's World, and it's just not interesting.There are moments that save this novel from being bad. Morgan writes action scenes better than most, and the parts where Kovacs acts like the super soldier that he is are amazing. Too bad there's just not enough of them."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"This is Richard K Morgan's third Takeshi Kovacs novel and it's a winner.

The pace is fast, plot holes exist but don't slow the book down, and the characters can be stereotypical but they fill necessary roles and allow Kovacs to grow and it is his book after all.We get some questions answered:1. What is Quelism and who is Quelcrist Falconer?2. Why is everyone scared of the Envoy Corps? What can they do?3. What would it take to turn Takeshi Kovacs into a priest murdering serial killer?4. What would happen if you took an earlier backup of Takeshi Kovacs from his days as an envoy and sleeved him with the assignment to track down and kill the Takeshi of Altered Carbon and Broken Angels?It was such a fun read, Takeshi against religious fundamentalists, Takeshi against himself, Takeshi against the Envoys. The twists come so fast and they throw him on a journey that feels like a planetary tour of his home, Harlan's World, if such a tour had the guide ducking bullets and screaming out, \\"that streak off to the left of our rocket ship is a town, I think, but it's taking heavy fire.\\"Keep 'em coming, Mr. Morgan, Keep 'em coming.- CV Rick"},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"What an amazing new cyber punk writer! This series (three books so far) is the most imaginative tale of the far future I have ever had the pleasure to read. The characters (not just Takeshi) are well drawn and believable, however dubious their cyborg-like existence and immortality may be, and the plots of all the novels are superbly developed and so fast paced as to leave one breathless. This third venture has less graphic sex than its predecessors, but all the action is intense and gripping. The author's \\"Market Forces\\" was a cousin to this series, and I look forward to other wildly imaginative tales in years to come. Guaranteed to banish boredom!"},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"Woken Furies is fast paced romp'n'stomp across Takeshi Kovacs' home, Harlan's World. The author, Richard K. Morgan, has spent probably more time in this book than in his previous on world building. We learn a great deal about Harlan's World, Kovacs' earlier life there, and about the mysterious Martians.I won't replay the plot or character bits here, they are in the publisher's notes and in other reviews. I agree with some other reviews that the emphasis and content in this book does differ from the previous two incarnations. However - I found it a natural and perfect complement to the other volumes. From the first two books you're left really wanting to know both more about Kovacs and the universe in which he lives. Morgan is one of the absolute best, and perhaps the best of his time, at interlacing world-building detail in his narative in a fluid, almost off-handed manner. The background is rich and multi-dimensional. That tapesty is vividly filled in in this book, while successfully whetting your appetite for more. The path he took in this novel was quite deliberate, as you can find in this interview from before Furies was completed (http://www.randomhouse.com/delrey/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780345457714&view;=printqa, read down to the bottom). The other reviewers who chafed at Morgan challenging them should stick to Kevin Anderson, Steven King, and whoever is writing Star Trek novels this week."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"This book is so many kinds of incredible I don't even know where to start. First, the Worldbuilding is just amazing--not just one planet, but a Protectorate of planets; amazing technology (implanted stacks that download your consciousness so that if you're killed you can be \\"re-sleeved\\" into a new body, unless your stack is destroyed, then you are \\"really dead.\\" Throw in a labyrinthine political and personal quest, and the double- and triple-twists/betrayals are non-stop right up to the very end. And lastly, our hero, Takeshi Kovacs, mega-violent and with his own set of morality who we should not like, but do. This whole series is both breathtaking and amazing."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"Brilliant, original, completely engrossing. Mr. Morgan never disappoints. There isn't a single superfluous word. This man's brand of talent can't be learned, can't be bought, and sadly, can't be plugged in and soaked up Matrix style. Either you have it or you don't, and most of us don't.

Then suddenly, his big hero, the ueber anarchist, Quel Falconer seems to be back. Well... She could be back. But what if it's not her?It's a 3rd Takeshi (and there really, really, really should be more). It's the same old Takeshi, but more bitter. More reclusive. More distant.

I say \\"sort of\\", because most of the characters are able to change bodies over time (re-sleeve), and the stories take place on different planets. These stories are far-future sci-fi action thrillers, with a large amount of violence and political intrigue.This book is big - coming in at over 450 hardcover pages. It is bigger than previous Richard K. Morgan books I've read (including MARKET FORCES), and I found it to be of higher quality as well.The bountiful amount of action sequences are what make this book a real success... there is one sequence which I found extremely interesting, which involves the Takeshi Kovacs main character's body able to \\"hang on\\" to a cliff-hanging dangling cable, even though the character himself has been knocked out.I give the book 4.6 stars, round it to 5."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"Don't get me wrong, I liked this book and would recommend buying it. But if you're looking for the kind of 'yowsa' feeling that came from reading Broken Angels, it's not quite there."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"\\"Woken Furies\\" is the third in Richard Morgan's Takeshi Kovacs trilogy, a series that draws strongly on the cyberpunk movement of the late 80s and early 90s, complete with technology and capitalism running out of control, and a hard-bitten, alienated hero struggling to maintain his humanity in an alienating world.All three books are set in the near to mid future - technology has developed to allow people to upload and download personalities and memories into different bodies, and to transmit those personalities at faster than light to the scattered planets. The rule of law is maintained largely by the \\"Envoys,\\" a team of UN enforcers trained in combat, intuition, and, most essentially, the ability to manipulate others. Faced with a rebellion on a world that starships couldn't reach for decades, the UN transmits its Envoys, who then download into local bodies and use their human capital to crack and reshape society to the UN's mandates.Takeshi Kovacs is a former Envoy, putting his skills to use to stay alive in a society that holds less and less interest for him. In the first novel,Altered Carbon, Kovacs was called on to solve a film-noir murder. In the second,Broken Angels, he found himself trapped in the middle of a war that was far too much like the one that caused him to quit the Envoys, desperate to escape.\\"Woken Furies\\" is the most ambitious of the three books, and the most personal. Kovacs is back on his home planet, carrying out a personal mission that he doesn't fully explain until halfway through the book. In the course of that mission, he finds himself caught in the middle of a conflict he can't immediately understand, involving the Yakuza, the planet's elite, several groups of mercenary \\"decomps,\\" and, just possibly, the reloaded personality of his planet's revolutionary hero/martyr, Quelcrist Falconer.If that plot sounds complex, I still haven't done \\"Woken Furies\\" justice. The plot leaps around, from setting to setting and from flashback to present day. It's a daring attempt to break out of the structure of the first two books, and it gets deeper into Kovacs' character than the first two, but I suspect that most readers will find it to be the least satisfying of the three. The plot, while intricate and thoughtful, is much less linear and much harder to follow than Morgan's earlier works. I'm glad I read Woken Furies, but can't help thinking it could have used a few more editing cycles."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"I really enjoyed this novel, which is the third in Richard K. Morgan's series about a mercenary, Takeshi Kovacs, who lives in a far future where personalities are digitized, stored in metal canisters called \\"stacks,\\" and downloaded into a series of \\"sleeves,\\" or bodies. Although this novel does not have as profound an impact as the first in the series, Altered Carbon, it is a big improvement over the second book, Broken Angels, in terms of plotting and the cast of secodary characters.This time, Kovacas is back on his home planet, Harlan's World, where the \\"first families\\" -- decendents of the original settlers from a dying Earth -- are running a repressive oligarchy that (what else is new?) lives off the backs of average workers. It has been centuries since the workers rose up in revolt, originally led by the mythical Quellcrist Falconer, a sort of female Che Guevarra figure. Now, it appears, Falconer is back, having been digitized and stored for almost 200 years in a data dump somewhere in the depths of a Harlan's World stack warehouse. Kovacs runs into Falconer and, skeptical though he is, eventually finds himself helping her and the descendants of her followers challenge the first families' dominance of his home planet.There are lots of sidelights in the plot, including a group of surfers who are underground Quellists, Japanese yakuza gangsters and their Slavic equivalents called \\"haiduchi,\\" and a bunch of \\"deComms,\\" who are teams of young risk-takers that go around disarming war machines left over from the last time that Quellcrist Falconer led a revolt against the first families. While all of this may sound a bit confusing, it is not; in fact, the plot lines make perfect sense and are totally believable, which I would argue is the single most important mark of a great science fiction story.Morgan's characters are well drawn and his attention to detail is impressive, particularly in the way he provides realistic explanations for things such as the weather patterns on a planet that is 98% water and has two moons. He endows Harlan's World with interesting plant and wildlife too, such as the swamp panthers that are raised to fight one another to their deaths in gladiator-like pits run by haiduchi, or the formidable ripwings, which are reptile-like creatures that fly pteradactyl style around \\"the World\\" preying on mountain climbers and other unwary humans.The novel ends in a perfect set up for the next installment in the adventures of Takeshi Kovacs and the presumptive Quellcrist Falconer -- Is it really Quell, or is this personality a mere trace copy left floating around in the planetary data banks? Will Takeshi ever find the stack of his great love, Sarah, who may be drifting somewhere at the bottom of the Harlan's World sea? Are the ultra-high tech Martians still alive and, if so, where are they? Can a far-future mercenary find happiness in a cheap, synthetic sleeve without neurochem and a gecko gene splice for climbing cliff faces? Some, or perhaps even all, of this will be revealed in the next installment, which I hope comes very soon. Kovacs is addictive, and Morgan a welcome supplier of top flight story-telling."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"I found this disappointing after the first couple of books. The format worked better in the first book when it was much more of a cyber punk / detective style. This story just did not engage me as much and seem confused as to what the main driving point was. The two underlying plot lines of revenge and political intrigue overlap without ever really combining in a convincing manner. I'd stick with Altered Carbon and leave it with that if I were you."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"I enjoyed Altered Carbon, but have been disappointed in the sequels, including this one. As before, the world is constructed in exquisite and credible detail. However, the story line lacks momentum, coherence, and most of all lacks motivation and purpose, and I found it hard to keep my attention from wandering. I came away from reading this novel thinking that some aggressive editing could have done a lot of good."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"Unfortunatly Morgan has not written a follow up to \\"Woken Furies.\\"That is the only down side to an EXCELLENT book.

I have even gone as far to email Morgan and practically beg him to continue this series.Buy this book, and hope that Takeshi Kovacs makes a swift return!"},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"I like visions of the future, Morgan's isn't very bright but I could easily see it as accurate. This is the third or forth book of his I have read and I can already tell that I will finish his body of work long before another comes out. Tak is one cool character."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"I originally heard about \\"Woken Furies\\" on a \\"Tech Nation\\" podcast interview with author Richard K. Morgan. The universe he described sounded intriguing so I picked up the book last December and have been slowly reading it ever since. I don't tend to rush through books I'm enjoying as I like them to last as long as possible.I originally did not realize that this was the third in a series or I probably would have gone and picked the others up first so that I could grow with the story. As it turned out the book does a very good job of standing on its own.I won't bother to summarize the plot here, others have done a much more thorough job on Amazon and elsewhere than I could hope to, what I am expressing rather are my impressions of the book.It's relatively and graphically violent in portions, which is fitting given the history of the pro-(an?)tagonist. In real life he would not really be someone you'd want to meet... ever. But it is interesting to spend the book inside his head as he recalls past experiences that involve quelling far-flung planetary uprisings with a ruthlessness reserved for those who are trained to kill and are very good at it.Of greatest interest to me is the culture of a civilization where death is a rarity. By choice or by accident you can \\"resleeve\\" and have a brand new body to use to carry on your existence and that body can be tailored to your personal or business needs. Starting with that premise, how do casual folks deal with relationships and their attitudes toward the everyday travails of life?Mutually agreeable divorce or separation is much more to be expected as it is possible for centuries to pass across which your growth as a person may be expected to diverge from that significant other with whom you shared so much so long ago.I found this a satisfying read and have added the preceding books to my Amazon wish list and anticipate that they will be equally satisfying."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"After enjoying the first two books of the Takeshi Kovacs Series, I'd gotten started on Richard Morgans next task in Woken Furies. Insert again everyone's favorite anti-hero in Takeshi Kovacs as Kovacs finds himself back on his home world this time after a lengthy and exhausting campaign on Sanction IV.Kovacs is in bad shape after being on the run after making several attacks on priests of The New Revelation, an extremist religious order semi-responsible for the death of his one love, Sarah. Kovacs has made it his personal mission to kill every member of this New Revelation as a measure of ultimate revenge.Kovacs meets a very interesting woman in the bar named Sylvie Oshima in the process of protecting her against some trouble-making members of The New Revelation Order. One sudden act of chivalry later, Kovacs begins his journey by taking refuge with her mercenary crew as they head out to decommission living military hardware gone awry on a nearby continent. During one of these mercenary missions, Sylvie collapses and upon recovery her personality appears to have been replaced by that of long dead revolutionary leader Quellcrist Falconer herself. From here Kovacs goes on a thrilling journey which includes battling against government bio mechanical machines gone haywire, searching for three centuries old weapons systems, and battling the yakuza in a bitter blood feud over a member of their family that was killed by Kovacs.As the journey goes on, Kovac's relationship with Sylvie Oshima/possibly the Quellcrist Falconer earns him a very deadly enemy that is on his trail - a younger, stronger, and straight out of hell version of himself. As Kovacs tries to figure out just who this Sylvie Oshima really is, he must stay one step ahead of his younger sleeved self as he attempts to sort this mess out.My only qualm with this book was that it was a little hard to follow Morgans descriptions sometimes of all of the weather patterns, places, etc. Then again that could possibly be the ADD kicking in at times :). I found Woken Furies to be a throughouly enjoyable book and towards the end Morgan sets up the story well for a possible second set of books in the Takeshi Kovacs Series.Kovacs ends up finally figuring himself out towards the end and what all of his adventures have led him to at this point and makes some decisions based on the books ending. There are some intriguing questions towards the end of Woken Furies. Will we ever figure out the Martians and be able to communicate with them/understand their technology? For that matter, why did they ever leave Harlan's World and are they still alive somewhere? Will the cortical stack of Kovac's lost love Sarah be retrievable one day? In addition, some very interesting information is made about the orbitals which ends up tying a lot of ends throughout the series together and ends up being a real eye-opener for the reader. Like others have mentioned here, I definitely hope Morgan decides to write another installment of the Kovacs Series soon. He's left himself plenty to work with based on the end of Woken Furies.-Travis"},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"I have been hooked on Richard K. Morgan's hard-boiled science fiction sinceAltered Carbon. I was quite pleased when I heard that Woken Furies, the third book with Takeshi Kovacs as a main character, was available. These books mix cyberpunk with noir detective novels in a very effective way. They are moody, violent, and have some fascinating world building involved. The basic concept involves personality as embedded in cortical stacks which can be backed up, moved to another body (\\"sleeve\\"), or destroyed for real death. The Morgan universe is a host to a whole array of problems around class, militarism, wealth, exploitation and violence. A really interesting and entertaining series.I have heard folks say that Woken Furies is the weakest of the three books. I would tend to agree with that, even though it also has some of the most interesting elements. The beginning is particularly slow. It took me quite some time to engage with the work. I could not tell you exactly why it felt so slow, but I really had to give it 100 pages before I had warmed up to the text. Again in this book, I really like the thread of Quellism (a political theory) that runs through the work. What I think is great about Woken Furies is that Quellism gets explored more thoroughly.I actually think that you could read this book without reading the first two. However, I suspect that you would enjoy them more in order. If you don't know Takeshi Kovacs yet, you are in for a treat. If you are already a fan, expect some bumps in this installment but it is still a worthy entry in the series."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"The third Kovacs book is not as good as the other two. It has taken a jump forward in time. He is back on his homeworld. Kovacs has had a relationship, lost a woman, and to pass the time, is going around slaughtering those involved in the crazy cult that led to the actual murder and stack death of the woman he loved.A little shallow, but soon he gets pulled into something deeper. Investigating very strange AI, and finding out that one of the women he is doing this with just may have a famous revolutionary's consciousness on board.This has serious political implications, and Kovacs joins the side of the locals, not the Envoys. He is getting a little slower on the uptake in his old age, it seems, but does soon realise that the situation would call for an Envoy presence.He also gets to take up with the woman we have come to believe is the Modesty Blaise or Wonder Woman of the Envoy corps, Virginia Viadura. We soon realise she is a bit more human and flawed than that.Kovacs experience does tell in the end, and even a bit of hope at the end amidst all the violence and terror."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"Somewhat different, more textured than the previous two -- but spectacular in its own way....maybe better. I listened to it on MP3 -- halfway between Spillane's Hammer and Nick Danger.

But, it's kind of annoying to get a new voice for the end of a series, not the end of the world, but annoying.But, the problem is the whole style changed, adding voice effects is just cheap and distracts from the enjoyment of the book, not to mention makes it hard to hear when commuting.And I know it's a personal pet peave of mind when a reader mispronounces a word or words, but it happens in every book, you;d think the producer or director or editor would notice at some point... Anyhow, the first 2 books mispronounced Maori (saying May-o-ree instead of Maw-ree), and used it a lot... But this new guy, someone should have said something, he mispronounces the name of the main character, when there is whole paragraphs in the first two books where the main character comments on people commonly mispronouncing his name and how it should be pronounced. Yet the new reader, with his voice effects has Kovacs calling himself Kovaks. And also mispronouncing many of the regional names on Harlan's world, that are from Central European places and names, somthing the first reader was careful to pronounce correctly...It is grating to my nerves to keep hearing Kovaks, when the character himself says in the book that he is Kovacs."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"Another good book from the Takeshi Kovacs series. The ending left kind of wanting more. But covered alot Kovacs past and early childhood that made him what he is today."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"Up until last year I hadn't read a sci-fi themed booked in over 6 years. The genre, it seemed to me, had fissled out after years of rehashing plot, characters, and tech. Then a friend of mine suggested I pick up Morgan's first book Altered Carbon because it was \\"wicked sick\\". So, I did. And to my surprise I was hooked almost immediately. I read the book in a day and then went out and bought Morgan's second Takeshi Kovac's novel Broken Angel's. I read it just as fast and enjoyed it almost as much.8 months went by before I had the time to read Woken Furies and I went into this novel fully expecting a book on par with the last one...but was disappointed. I'm not an English Professor or major so I can't pick apart the book in minute detail and tell you what elements were lacking. It just was. After finishing the novel it felt like Morgan had used Woken Furies as vehicle to exercise a pseudo proxy midlife crisis instead of furthering a great character and story."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"The third book in Morgan's Takeshi Kovacs series ought to be a lot worse than it is. The main character, basically a techno-tough in the Philip Marlowe tradition, returns to his homeworld where much is revealed about his obscure and disturbing past. Kovacs' appeal is, of course, his shadowy and disturbing past, and shedding light on said past would seem to be a foolhardy tactic for an author.Morgan, however, continues to employ his considerable talents in this novel, and delivers a powerful and surprisingly meaningful story that deftly mixes political intrigue, social commentary, and some inventive motifs regarding the longing for youth. Sure, we dig up lots of the history of Kovacs and his homeworld - but Morgan takes his sweet time getting us there, and in the end the excavation uncovers evidence of even more mysteries.I found his handling of the Kovacs vs. Kovacs plot very clever - considering one of the central conceits of the novels is a man who only has his identity, and yet hardly knows who he is. It would have been easy to make the contest a match of youth vs. wisdom, but Morgan turns it into a reflection on the amplification of flaws as we grow older.Fans of the two earlier books, beware - this novel is much more complex and full of substance than its predecessors. If that works for you, dive in."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"While I liked Altered Carbon for its new content, and somewhat the second book, this one was kind of tired. While the storytelling was good and the SF strong, the character was tiring, especially with the double running around. It could have been more exciting, but still deserves a read as part of the series."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"I rarely read \\"series\\" novels, as I tend to get tired of the main character, but Morgan keeps Kovac's adventures interesting.I also like the political undertones (much better done here than in, say, Market Forces, which hit you over the head with it).However, I'm no prude but I could do without the exceedingly graphic sex scenes. Sure, let 'em have sex, but it doesn't need to read like a porn flick. Would love to pass this on to my teenage nephews but this precludes that."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"This is my third Takeshi Kovacs novel and I'm still asking myself the same question: In a world where you cary around a backup of your mind on a disc drive (aka \\"cortical stack\\") in your spine why doesn't anyone think of MAKING A BACKUP? I have 5 and 1/4 inch inch floppies of old Zork games that I store more securely. The big and constant threat that everyone's avoiding throughout the trilogy is Real Death (RD) --getting your hard drive erased. But even though they check out cortical stacks like books in a library nobody really tries making a few thousand backups of themselves. It's the big elephant in the middle of the room Morgan chooses to ignore to maintain the threat of Real Death to his characters.Much more time is spent explaining how people keep multiple \\"sleeves\\" (bodies) as insurance against bodily death--which is really no threat since they swap bodies like changing socks--and live without them completely. Near the end Morgan at least gives a sideways glance at the elephant by mentioning a character having \\"remote storage\\", but never explains why obtaining such storage wouldn't be a primary and obvious goal of every character in the book--even if it were illegal or expensive. I enjoyed all these books, but with a big technical asterisk. I've read too many other authors who've faced the \\"backup\\" issue head on and dealt honestly with the ramifications."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"What to say other than this book was perfect. I've read all three Kovacs novels one after the other (I came in on this game late, obviously) and while none of the books followed any style I've ever read before - this is what made them all so great. In Altered Carbon Kovacs was a weird, over-qualified gumshoe thrown into a world of political games that he could of care less about. His only thought - do the job he was hired for and free his partner in crime Sarah (who is still light years away in storage). It really was one of the strangest science fiction books I've ever read. But while I really really liked Kovacs in the first novel it wasn't until the second novel that I began to love him. This character is like no other in science fiction - past or present. Anyone who thinks the characterization isn't there was not paying attention. By the time we get to Woken Furies we only know a few things for certain - 1. Kovacs is a killing machine 2. Kovacs will do anything for money 3. Kovacs will do EVERYTHING to stay alive 4. He has very few loyalties that cannot be broken and 5. Do not cross this man or the one person he IS loyal to. Ever. Which makes the personal vendetta theme throughout the final novel so compelling. Who was Sarah? We don't know - nor will we ever. But we don't need to. The only thing we need to know is that this killing machine of a man has a truly undying loyalty to her that potentially spans hundreds of years. The rest of the plot is just background - it happens around his quest and he allows it to happen for the simple reason that he can benefit from it. This story is about how far a man will go to make a point. And he does it beautifully. Read it - you won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"Woken Furies is the kick ass third title in the Kovacs series. This installment yields many interesting nuggets. Firstly, Kovacs finds himself on the run from a younger, cloned self and bedding not one but two female love interests, including, but not limited to Virgina Viadura herself. Our intrepid mercernary does much soul searching in this book and goes slightly overboard with his sympathies for the female suffragette plights of the century, but all in all, it was a much better read compared to Broken Angels. In fact, if you haven't yet read BA, then skip it entirely as you didn't miss a thing. But do read Altered Carbon if you have not done so yet."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"Woken Furies (2005) is the third SF novel in the Takeshi Kovacs series, following Broken Angels. In the previous volume, Takeshi Kovacs took down Isaac Carrera on the Martian dreadnaught, giving Tanya Wardani enough time to shut down the gate. Although Tanya stayed behind on Sanctuary IV, Duprez, Sun, Vongsavath and Kovacs departed the system in Angin Chandrea's Virtue -- a Wedge battlewagon -- for Lattimer. There Tak had a half share in twenty million UN dollars to spend and tasks to perform.In this novel, Kovacs is back on Harlan's World. After a raid on the New Revelation Citadel, he is leaking blood as he returns to the warehouse district to change sleeves. There he finds a stranger talking to his contact, Plex, and his degear/regear equipment missing.Apparently the local yakuza has preempted the gear to replace some that had incurred seawater damage. Setting the yakuza thug straight on who is top dog, Tak talks to the thug's exec and gets a promise that his gear will be returned within four hours. While waiting, Tak goes to breakfast with Plex at the Tokyo Crow.There he sees a woman acting weirdly. Then some New Revelation priests enter the bar and harass her for having loose hair. When the priest start to punish her for ignoring them, Tak intervenes and takes out all five priests. Then he quits the bar, leaving behind a hallucinogen grenade to remove any interest that others may have in the fracas.Outside, Tak joins the woman within the shadow of a loading crane and she invites him to crash in her place. Sylvie Oshima is a command head with deCom, clearing out the military machine intelligences in New Hokkaido. Back at her pad, Tak meets two of her team: Orr and Jadwigo. After the yakuza shove their way into the pad and blast Jadwiga, Tak also meets Kiyoka while removing stacks from the yakuza bodies. Later, Tak meets Lazlo onboard the hoverloader Guns For Guevara on the way to Drava.In this story, the deCom team works their way inland, taking out karakuri co-ops as they go. Sylvie seems to be doing all right, penetrating mimint software and diverting smart shells with her command dataware. However, she keeps quoting Quellist dogma every now and then. After a close call with a self-propelled scorpion gun, Sylvie falls into a coma and runs a fever for longer than normal. The team decides to cut the search and destroy mission and return to Drava.While tending the unconscious team leader back at the base, Tak discovers that another persona occupies Sylvie body.

Jordin"},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"I really enjoyed Morgan's first two Takeshi Kovacs novels, \\"Altered Carbon\\" and \\"Broken Angels,\\" and I was really looking forward to this one. But ultimately I was disappointed. The protagonist isn't very engaging anymore, he just seems to be wallowing in his own bitterness. Maybe if Richard Morgan decides to write another book in this series, he'll present Kovacs with the greatest challenge of all: Finding some genuine love and happiness in his life. I also didn't think this novel ended very well, too many questions and loose ends."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"The narator is so incredibly bad, there are not words to discribe. This is the first audio-book I want my money back, and I have listen to a lot of bad productions, but always found some redeeming quality. The singlar good quality to this one is Richard K. Morgan's writing, but even that was not suffient to overcome the awful naration. His reading skills are about as bad as my writing skills (I am not being paid), he mispronounced just about everthing including the main charactors name, and his tempo did not fit a suspence novel. Awful do not buy.....please Amazon give me my money back for this one."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"Two nights ago I tried reading \\"Woken Furies\\" at the Barnes and Noble in New York City where Frank McCourt made his first public appearance for his new memoir \\"Teacher Man\\". The fellow sitting to my right, an English teacher from another distinguished New York City public school, wondered whether I had gotten the right book (I already had a copy of \\"Teacher Man\\" buried in my knapsack.). After trying to read through the first fifty pages, I was asking myself the same question.With \\"Altered Carbon\\" Richard Morgan wrote a spellbinding murder mystery/cyberpunk thriller which introduced the enigmatic Takeshi Kovacs caught in some strange political and corporate entanglements on a future Earth; stylistically, his writing most reminded me of Michael Swanwick's \\"Vacuum Flowers\\", not William Gibson's or Bruce Sterling's. The sequel \\"Broken Angels\\" I found somewhat more interesting with its discussion of the extinct \\"Martians\\", written in a style more reminiscent of late 1980s to mid 1990s Bruce Sterling. Now, here in \\"Woken Furies\\", Richard Morgan has written a novel which I can compare unfavorably to the best from the likes of Frank Herbert, Gordon Dickson, H. Beam Piper or Isaac Asimov, to name but a few; Takeshi Kovacs's return to his homeworld \\"Harlan's World\\" is a journey I didn't want to finish, simply because Morgan's imagination and skillful plotting have run up against a creative dry well.Richard Morgan has earned some praise as the United Kingdom's latest answer to William Gibson or Neal Stephenson, but his writing isn't nearly as polished as either distinguished American author. Furthermore, he is not nearly as impressive a storyteller or literary stylist as fellow British science fiction authors China Mieville or Alastair Reynolds. If you're desperate for some good cyberpunk fiction, I guess you'll have to choose the usual suspects, including Gibson, Sterling, Stephenson, Swanwick and Cadigan, to name but a few. If you want to read a brilliantly realized space opera series, then may I suggest that you look at Thomas Harlan's new alternative history/space opera series about an interstellar human empire ruled by Aztec emperors and Japanese samurai? And if you want to read some great military fiction, the best example has to be the late Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey/Maturin series set during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars.

But if you liked the first one you should probably grab this one too. The book starts great with some awesome classic cyberpunk sexy action but then it devolves rapidly (spoiler?) into this endless riff on Kovacs lost innocence and past lives.I felt like nearly a third of this book was Morgan searching for his character's motivation, which is not what I signed up for. Morgan does this a few times and it is repetitive and doesn't advance the plot enough to warrant the amount of pages he uses to explore TK's feelings. I don't really care *why* TK has to take out some resleeved yakuza skull tank surf droid. I am much more interested in *how* he does it.Bottom line: If you liked the first two TK books this one is worth it.

I had to get the book elsewhere. If you know where to look, it's $7 elsewhere. It's a bit slower than the first, and way overpriced."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"I'd been waiting for quite a while to read this third entry in Richard K. Morgan's series of Takeshi Kovacs novels. It was worth the wait, and in some respects it may be the best of the series so far. Tak travels through some dark, dark territory here.Don't be fooled (or put off) by the pace. Where _Altered Carbon_ was a rapid series of body blows, _Woken Furies_ is more like being dragged down very slowly by a very large weight. There's a lot going on here, but quite a bit of it is in the background and between the lines. If you don't get into Tak's head pretty early on, the novel may read like a travelogue.Not that that's necessarily _bad_. Probably a lot of us were curious about Harlan's World, and we get to see quite a bit of it here. We also finally get to put faces (the faces of their current sleeves, anyway) with some familiar names from Tak's past. All of that will probably be interesting enough to entertain the casual reader.But if that's all you get out of this novel, then you're missing the meat of it.The surface-level plot opens with Tak on Harlan's World in a synthetic sleeve, trying to get back into his own body. He's also, as we gradually discover, on some sort of mission, the details of which we don't really learn until some 250 pages in. And not too far into the tale, we meet someone who just _might_ turn out to be Quellcrist Falconer . . . or maybe not. Furthermore, Tak is being pursued by a younger version of himself, decanted from a backup copy he didn't know existed. Things build toward a final revelation with implications far, far beyond Quellism and the local politics of Harlan's World.The pace, though, is generally slow. Oh, things do happen (and people start dying horribly within the first twenty-odd pages), but a lot of the action is off-screen. We spend the bulk of the novel the way we spent most of _Star Trek: The Motion Picture_: Going Somewhere.The really interesting stuff, and the real, behind-the-narrative content of the novel, is what happens to Tak. I'm not going to give you any more clues about this; I'm just going to warn you to listen with both ears as those titular furies awaken and the possibilities of redemption come and go. There's a lot of internal turmoil going on here, and Tak isn't necessarily going to tell you about it directly. Hell, despite his Envoy training, I'm not sure he's even fully aware of all of it himself.Readers who keep wanting recycled versions of _Altered Carbon_ will continue to be disappointed, as they were with _Broken Angels_; Morgan clearly isn't going to keep rewriting the same book for us. Now, me, I think that's a good thing."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"The book itself is pretty good, I'm not knocking the book. It's just that the narration in this audio book version is terrible. I travel a lot for work and took to listening to audio books and I am saying this is actually the worst one I have ever heard.The first two books, Altered Carbon and Broken Angels are narrated by Todd McLaren and he does an amazing job. I HIGHLY recommend these two audio books.William Dufris cannot stack up next to Todd, but that's not even the problem. The whole first part of the book is in italics and several flashbacks to old advice throughout the book are also in italics. To indicate that to you, they distort the audio with an echo effect that makes it grating and downright infuriating to listen to. They didn't do that for the other two books, what made them think it was a good idea this time around? Fine whatever it's only a tiny fraction of the book. But then Dufris mispronounces the protagonist's name. The main character in the book makes a point of noting how to pronounce his name in the first two novels, several times. Dufris is supposed to BE the main character, make me believe he is Takeshi Kovacs and here he is blatantly mispronouncing his own name. Words cannot describe how annoying it is.One of Dufris's other failings is the occasional screw up of cadence and tone of the character, but that's mostly in the beginning. It's like he didn't read the book before he narrated it; he certainly didn't read the first two books or he wouldn't have screwed up the protagonist's name."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"I have to admit, I'm hooked. I can't get enough of Richard Morgan's distopian future. I was so eager to read Woken Furies that I arranged to get a copy from Great Britain (because it was released months earlier than in the US). I cannot recommend this book highly enough. Like Altered Carbon and Broken Angels, it treats you to a highly-charged whirlwind of a story centered on the activities of Takeshi Kovacs.In this episode, a Yakuza family have hired an earlier version of himself to track him down. Complicating matters are a personal vendetta against a particularly vicious religious group, and a woman who may (or may not) be a re-embodied revolutionary named Quellcrist Falconer.I don't want to give too much away, but I will say that you see more of Kovacs' humanity than in previous novels. NOT that Woken Furies is a \\"group-hug\\" kind of book. Far from it. In fact, Kovacs seems even more violent and misanthropic than in the first two books. However, we understand \\"why\\" a bit more and we see more of the effects 2 centuries of war and crime have had on him.Kovacs has firmly established himself as my new favorite literary character. As in his other 2 Takeshi Kovacs novels, Richard Morgan gives us a character of suprising depth and humanity that is still capable of incredible savagery; in addition to a perfectly-realized vision of a future in which technology hasn't eliminated war or crime, but has grown with it."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"It's always a delight to find an author who creates characters in three dimensions instead of the more usual two; Morgan seems to stretch his people to five or six. This is the third novel in the series about Takeshi Kovacs, ex-Envoy, stone killer, freelance renegade, and very dangerous man to be on the wrong side of. It's been three centuries, objective time, and Kovacs is back on Harlan's World, where he originally came from. It's also been a couple of centuries since the Resettlement, the failed Quellist revolution that gave the Harlan family oligarchy a run for its money, and Kovacs -- who only wants to continue killing fundamentalist priests (it's personal) -- finds himself caught up, first, in the attempt to reclaim the nanoware-drenched continent the revolution produced, and, later, in a new revolutionary plot. Because it's part of Quell's teachings, that when things go against you, you retreat and you wait -- for generations, if necessary. But now, just maybe, Quellquist Falconer might be back, in the flesh. But that's just this novel's top-level plot. There's also Kovacs's vendetta against those who let die the only woman who mattered to him -- Real Death, no resleeving. And there's his longstanding relationships with the several criminal cultures of Harlan's World, and with his old Envoy trainer. Not to even mention being hunted by a younger, smart-assed version of himself. And, just out of sight, there are the vanished Martians, about whom we learned a lot in Morgan's second book, Broken Angels. There's military and political philosophy here, all of it cynical, there's imaginative anthropology, there's a certain amount of gruff sex, there are some great quotes, there's considerable death (some deserved, some not), and there are breath-grabbing battle scenes like you haven't read in years. Morgan's second Kovacs novel was twice as good as his first. This one is three times as good as his second. If this one doesn't win both the Hugo and the Nebula, there's no justice. But, hey -- Kovacs already knows that.PS -- I was astonished a previous reviewer compared this to Bester's _The Stars My Destination_. A great book, don't get me wrong (I even own a First Edition copy of it), but Gully Foyle is pretty and pale and poetic beside the dark and blistering Takeshi Kovacs!"},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"But this book just didn't hold my attention. About halfway through I skipped to the end to find out what happens.I loved Altered Carbon, and liked Broken Angels, but couldn't get into this book. I enjoyed Thirteen also, and am half way through Market Forces, which is 'ok'. (A friend of mine is a big fan of Morgan's and loaned me the books) Every character is like a bristling rabid animal. Everyone is over the top, and I guess it just gets tiring. It sometimes feels that people get angry and there is tension... but there isn't much reason for the tension to be there. Or at least, not enough reason for there to be SO much tension and anger in the scene. Not much happens in the first half of the book, maybe it got better in the second half but I just couldn't keep reading.Compare Kovacs to say... Tony Soprano from the Sopranos. One of the interesting things about the show was that Tony would be happy and smiling and jovial for part of a scene, and then in an instant 'turn gangsta' and you would see his dark side.Kovacs just broods a lot and is ultra serious in every scene. You would think after a few hundred years of life that people would mellow out a bit, but apparently for some teenage angst just never goes away. For an example, there is the scene where Kovacs is going to rent a boat and is talking to a kid (son of the captain of the boat) and gets angry with him because the kid is apparently more involved in his virtual world/matrix style life than real life. Kovacs is over the top as usual, but again, you would think someone with as much life experience as he has would just smile and shrug and maybe try to give the kid some advice. Getting *emotional* over it seems a bit ... melodramatic. Which is typical of the whole book, and really my main gripe with Morgan's writing overall."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"(Some spoilers)First, the things I thought were well done1) Slick, terrific prologue. Sets the stage for fireworks to come.2) Some great concepts. The decom idea is fantastic (Jurassic Park for war machines), or battling with your younger self.I wanted to like this book, having read altered carbon and its sequel. But it falls flat on characterization, and I even prefer action to characterization in my novels. He spends 100 pages developing a core group of characters only to have them go poof with nothing more than a cursory one-liner from another character about their fates. The main story motivations for the protagonist like why he wants revenge on the church, or why he becomes angry with the neo-Quellists both turn on two barely characterized individuals (Sarah and Isa). Why are they so important? Here was material for gripping reading, but he only spends 1-2 paragraphs on each, completely out of proportion to how much impact they have on the protagonists actions. Midway through the book, yet another core group of characters get introduced. Do I care at this point? Will they suffer the same one-line fate as the first group? Really, they exist simply as props. Even the antagonists are simply not characterized. There are almost no immediate scenes with them.Even the main attraction, the battle with his younger self is wasted. Again, this would seem to be material for intense dialog and action. Instead they trade a few barbed quips with each other at the few points when they actually do meet, hardly the stuff of drama.There are other problems, like too much authorial intrusion to provide social commentary. I wouldn't mind if there was a gripping story, but without one I found myself skipping swaths of text to get back to the main thread.Unfortunately, as much as I enjoyed his earlier books I don't think I will be going back to this author. There are simply too many other good reads out there."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Altered Carbon and was enthusiastically looking forward to reading his other novels. I thought I had discovered a new genius of Sci-Fi; a vein of gold. I then read both Broken Angels and then Woken Furies. Broken Angels is a slight bit better than Woken Furies, but without giving a detailed literary review, on a scale of 1-10 for Morgan's works, Altered Carbon is a 10 and these aforementioned other two novels are 7's at best. They just don't have the tension, vision, plot arcs and characters of Altered Carbon. In addition, I found the futuristic erotic and sexual imagery of Altered Carbon an excellent ancillary backdrop to the plot. These other two novels didn't come close in that regard. I couldn't put Altered Carbon down, but with these other two, I had to struggle to finish them both. Poor pacing and some very droll extended abstractions of the characters thoughts as well. I was very disappointed. I'm finished with Morgan until I hear he has something as good as Altered Carbon. It's reminds me of a rock group that has one hit song and then builds an entire career off of it. Altered Carbon was It!"},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"Before I read the last 100 pages of this book, I would have given it 3 stars. Woken Furies suffers from a common affliction among many sci-fi series: same-samey-ness. Once you're introduced to the world, the technologies, the aliens, whatever, unless the author can keep the creative curve balls coming (Peter Hamilton often has the ability to keep things fresh), the joy and surprise of discovery quickly fades. And so it goes with Woken Furies. Two thirds of the way through and I thought Harlan's World just wasn't different enough from Venice Beach to keep me riveted. And assembling the deCom team, going into battle, using the cybertech - I might as well have been re-reading Broken Angels, Morgan's best by far.BUT! Just when I was resigned my disappointment, the last few chapters cranked the book out of its nose dive. Morgan lets loose with some Big Ideas, and the final showdown is spectacular fun. Sci-fi writers often have problems ending their books (Stephenson, Gibson anyone?), but Morgan always ends with a satisfying crunch, and this one wrapped up the nicest of them all.A word of warning - this is by far the most violent book I have ever read, and that includes Morgan's previous books. If you can't take the heat, stay out of the kitchen. And Morgan's graphic sex scenes seem gratuitous and perfunctory to the point of being boring porn.In Morgan's favor, as usual his prose is taut as a drum and hits hard. Characterization has always been his strong point, and this is perhaps his best: Kovacs's anger seethes off every page. The self-loathing loose cannon may be a clich&eacute;, but with Kovacs you can feel it, to the point where character is basically a psychotic serial-killer, and you're right there with him.I think Morgan was wise to retire Kovacs with this novel. One more and the sameyness would have made the series a bore. (I've given up on Hamilton and Reynolds for that reason - I get it already.) If you're a fan of the Kovacs books, this is definitely worth some tedium (albeit entertaining tedium) to get to the payoff. I'm looking forward to what Morgan will do next."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"The prodigal envoy has sleeved home and Harlan's World is awash in violence - nothing new for a planet that is 10% dry land and 90% rebellion. Takeshi Kovacs is back and has scores to settle, scores to kill, and scores to sleeve. Now that he is in the comfort of his home world, Kovacs has assumed a more focused, more mature, and more deliberate persona for his latest vendetta of annihilation and revenge. Troubles soon escalate for him and his colleagues-du-jour. Quicker than you can shoot \\"angel-fire\\" he is throttled into an epic conflict between the ancient, the past, the present and the future where ultimately humanity itself hangs in the balance. This time however, he confronts an enemy that is more than a match for him... himself.Richard Morgan weaves a lavish tapestry of characters, storyline and mayhem in his latest tour-de-force, \\"Woken Furies.\\" The characters come fast and furious and are all quite memorable. The pages of the book drip with neura-chem as the storyline grabs you not only by the throat, but also by your heart and mind as well. As usual, Morgan creative talents present a tale of murderous intrigue, complex social interaction and wonderful science fiction. This time Morgan augments his literary repertoire with deep psychological drama. On a personal level, we witness the Furies awaken once more, unleashed on society in order to fan the passions between dogma vs. change, conformity vs. revolution, justice vs. revenge, safety vs. sacrifice, loyalty vs. expedience.Morgan explodes the bounds of science fiction and produces a tremendous literary effort. Morgan transforms extreme violence, shocking brutality, carnal lust and ultimate technology into an Odyssey-like adventure with a Quell twist. Kovacs' torment is exposed and his guard is dropped as he tumbles into ever-intensifying physical conflicts and emotional rage. He comes down to earth, so to speak, from his UN-envoy conditioning and must confront his demons and measure the scope of his humanity."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"I'll restrict my comments to the audiobook production of this title. The first two audiobooks were well produced and well read, although there were quite a few mispronounciations of words. This audiobook is read by a different narrator, and it suffers for this change. While I can dismiss the mispronounciations of Japanese words as the theoretically normal evolution of any language when transported to another planet and time, i.e., \\"Hawk-aido\\" as opposed to \\"Ho-kkaido,\\" the one inexcusable mispronounciation is that of Takeshi Kovacs' name: Ko-vacks instead of Ko-vatch. The author goes out of his way in Book 1 to specifically state how the name should be pronounced and that it is not as it appears phonetically. However, the narrator mispronounces it from page 1. Whose fault is this? While I would like to blame the narrator, ultimately, it is the responsibility of the producer, who presumably hired the narrator, to provide basic instructions on how to prounouce important words in the book and to provide some minimal quality control.The \\"reverb\\" effect used to separate past discussions or internal thought processes is annoying and distracting. I admit that if I had read the hard-copy book, I would have been annoyed by. the. breaking. up. of. sentences. that I have seen mentioned in other reviews. Thankfully, the narrator does not let this odd punctuation affect his reading.Still, the story itself is riveting and well-written. While I may not always like his actions, I really like the main character, Takeshi Kovacs. I find myself totally drawn into Kovacs' world and story. Some of the really bad reviews are just a bit too harsh, I think, considering most of the people giving those reviews probably never have and never will write a book of their own. The creativity involved in the process is certainly beyond me.Believe me, this book doesn't even come close to being one of the worst ever written, and I count the series as one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"Mick Serendipity has a dilemma to deal with--his life. Though it is probably not too unusual to begin to feel a little identity muss when you're seasoned with the ripe old age of two-hundred. Especially for a character who has gone home to find a love dead, a friend corrupt, and a former military commander converted to neo-Quellist hippie worship.Yet there is more trouble brewing as Serendipity meets a woman with an artificially enhanced brain. A brain that can interface with certain things on a world that is orbited by alien weapons platforms and infested with centuries year old AI that will kill any creature that invades their territory. This woman's brain is a Yin to Serendipity's Yang. A brain that claims an impossible identity. An identity that is revolutionary in the making.Not to mention that there is someone hunting Serendipity. Someone with all his military sponsored skills.A friend?An enemy?The former Tekashi Kovacs was always his own worst enemy.This is very possibly my number one scifi novel as it ends the epic that is Takeshi Kovacs, ie Serendipity. Though much of this cyberpunk tale is very noir, it cannot be read like \\"Altered Carbon.\\" Whereas \\"Altered Carbon\\" was a very fast paced detective story, \\"Woken Furies\\" tastes more like revelation. This books does have good action, but that is not the focus. The focus gravitates around the imperfect protagonist who is struggling with life back home on Harlan's World. The author, Richard Morgan, once suggested to savor this book like savoring a drink. I can think of no better comparison for \\"Woken Furies.\\" You have to take it in slow. Use pace to get the full intoxicating effect. If it is thrown back too quickly you might just need another body to resleeve. For my first time ever, I'm giving this book five stars."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"I didn't like Woken Furies as much as Altered Carbon or Broken Angels for a few reasons. First, I thought that the content of the first two novels played too large a role; therefore, if you had read them when they were originally published (as I did) you may not recall the significance of Sarah and Innenin. Second, the pace was uneven. The action was crammed into a few chapters, while the rest of the book was exposition and slow buildup. Third, I think that Kovacs is a simple character who thrives on action and revenge. He is the perfect player in a noirish mystery (Altered Carbon) and a military adventure (Broken Angels) but he seems over-his-head in an ideological work like Woken Furies. The novel delves into ideology and politics, and for most of it Kovacs cannot care less as he pursue his various personal vendettas. I think the scope is almost too big; I prefer Kovacs in action and crime-solving modes than in thinking-about-life's-important-issues-mode. Fourth, at times it almost felt like a travelogue as Kovacs traipses all over the bizarre geography of Harlan's World and other locales. Fifth, the supporting characters are almost all cannon fodder, to be introduced and conveniently dispatched so Kovacs has more souls to atone for. Sixth, the conflict between Kovacs and his younger self seems pointless. Not only is their confrontation anticlimactic, it almost makes sense that it would be. Wouldn't Kovacs, with an extra two centuries of experience and guile, easily outthink and outact his youthful clone? The physical differences are nonexistant, since sleeving negates any advantages of youth. Despite my qualms, Woken Furies is still mostly enjoyable. Morgan is a gifted writer, and the action (including the sex scenes, which are full of action) is top notch. I look forward to reading his next, non-Kovacs work. Furthermore, I'm interested in the prospect of a Kovacs film. Sleeving adds a captivating element: More than one actor would have to play Kovacs."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"Richard K. Morgan's fast-paced story, Woken Furies, is the third novel of a series featuring Takeshi Kovacs, and is set in the twenty-fifth century. Kovacs has experienced varied lives: marine, gang member, and as an envoy that doesn't negotiate much of anything. He mostly wrecked havoc.Kovacs has returned to his home planet, Harlan's World in a pique--to say the least. He's been awakened from an almost-two-hundred-year digital storage and readied for a new mission. But Kovacs has his own idea of what his mission is to be. He protects a woman who may be someone from an earlier century, and he must fight what he believes is a younger version of himself.Morgan's novel has a little bit of everything: feuds, madness, crazy machines and questions of who can be trusted and who is untrustworthy. This is a wild ride and if you really enjoy science fiction, this is science fiction at its best. Be prepared to force yourself to breathe; it's that exciting.Armchair Interviews says: You'll be excitedly awaiting the next Morgan outing."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"Altered Carbon was a solid blending of cyberpunk sci-fi with noir crime fiction. Broken Angels was more complex, combining the same hard-edged cyberpunk/noir sensibility with war, archeology, and revolutionary politics. In Woken Furies, Morgan has matured his style and come into the full flower of his ability.The characters are rich and colorful, complex and flawed. The dialogue is razor sharp, echoing the cadences of Dashiell Hammett or Raymond Chandler. Exposition is sketchy, patchwork, hinted at and then taken away; you won't find anyone saying \\"As you well know...\\" followed by three pages of explanation (an atrocious habit among sci-fi authors). Morgan doesn't pull any punches: the fights are brutal and the sex is graphic; if you're like me you'll appreciate that none of the action is merely implied. The tech is slick, from engineered \\"sleeves\\" in which humans download their consciousness to mysterious alien artifacts.But where Morgan really shines--especially in Woken Furies--is the brilliant complexity of the plot. Suffice to say, Woken Furies doesn't rely on surprise endings; the action changes course and refocuses so many times it will make you dizzy. Throughout the alliances, betrayals, and other journeys, the focus stays solidly on the characters. They are both brutally violent and emotionally fragile, filled with love and lust and longing, searching for justice or money or vengeance. They are gut-wrenchingly human, and you will come to love them.For fans of the Kovacs novels I would recommend checking out Spin State by Chris Moriarty and The Stars My Destination by Alfed Bester. The former is a recent book that is similar in many ways to Morgan's work, particularly Altered Carbon. The latter was written in the 50's and features an amoral hero bent on revenge, with a frenetic pace that makes even Morgan seem plodding."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"Morgan always enthralls me, always draws me and drops me right in the midst of the world he has created. It is almost unbelievable how well crafted the world of Takeshi Kovacs is. Right from page one I don't want to put the book down, and there is never a dull moment. This is no easy task to complete, and yet Morgan has done this with all his books thus far. This is mainly because of how descriptive he gets with such depth that you can imagine exactly what is happening. I couldn't even begin to count the number of images that jumped to my mind's eye and showed me exactly what was described. Unbelievable.And Morgan seems to be getting better with each book. Woken Furies has yet again a great plot as we get to watch the book's hero hunted by none other than... himself? Great twist with originality. Additionally, we know the world from the first two Kovacs' books, but with this book we get to view more of the world, get to view and uncover some of the mysteries, and to have new mysteries created that will be great fuel for another Kovacs book.My only complaint, and this has always been the case, is that Morgan always, and I mean always and a lot, has to add full on pornographic scenes into his books. I can understand it at least once because it adds to how certain characters interact with one another, but why do it two, three, four times? It is just gratuitous and eventually adds nothing to the story. But, alas, this too is becoming a trademark of Morgan and it should be expected that he will continue to do this in all of his books.A definite recommend.5 stars."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"Takeshi Kovacs is in trouble. That's nothing new as with his Envoy skills, he's put into difficult situations every time he's hired. This time, however, he's being hunted by himself--a younger version that is much more ruthless and will kill him if necessary. Kovacs resleeves after decades in hybernation only to find that he's caught protecting someone with something very valuable in her head that she isn't even aware is there. When he returns to his home planet of Harlan's World, he discovers a radically changed landscape where some of his old friends are no longer friends and he's gained new enemies.Morgan's third novel with his anti-hero is his best featuring Kovacs to date. Kovacs for those who haven't read Morgan's first novel (which I'd recommend first--ALTERED CARBON is a terrific and fast paced read well written and well plotted)echoes classic noir anti-heroes like Philip Marlowe and Mike Hammer without being a pale imitation of either of these characters. Morgan clearly has thought out and plotted Kovacs' background as he may be in the tradition of these noir heroes but he is a full blown character all his own.As usual Morgan creates riveting action sequences. Personally I felt that this is probably the best Kovacs novel that Morgan has written although all three are very strong works. Morgan's hardbitten world may recall the cyperpunk world popularized by William Gibson and Bruce Sterling but he brings unique character to his novels with his Chandleresque prose style.I'd recommend Morgan's two other Kovacs' books first although it shouldn't stop you from picking up this book and enjoying it. Morgan deftly fills in the background on Kovacs and his universe without making it seem like he's giving us a recap of the other two books. This is his second best novel (his best to date is the recently released THIRTEEN which I'll be writing about shortly as well).I'd highly recommend this book and don't think that fans that enjoyed Morgan's other novels will be disappointed. He continues to grow as a writer and still hasn't lost the desire to entertain his readers."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"Hi there. I really enjoyed the other two Kovacs books, but this one is just far too tedious for me. Does the story line EVER evolve? Very intricate detail spent on things which don't advance the story I feel....I've got it in audio format, and enjoyed the reader in the other two stores much better, so maybe that has something to do with it. I am some 3 hours into the story, and nothing much has happened. I read to be entertained and captured, and this one doesnt do it, so perhaps if you are listening to this in audio format, the abridged version may be the better choice."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"In this third installment of the Takeshi Kovacs novels we have Kovacs back on his home planet of Harlan's World, where political intrigue and organized crime exist practically side by side. Kovacs has been an ex-Envoy for some time and is now involved in some shady deals at times. The Quellist political movement, after being mostly forgotten for hundreds of years, is now being revived, with their leader possibly out of data storage, but the question being, is she a cheap copy, or the original? The First Family, the Harlan's, will not stop at anything to destroy the Quellist movement and keep their position at the top. Into all of this Kovacs tries to make sense of many different people and their loyalties, which are sometimes vague and misleading. In this novel are many twists and turns that will surprise you. And taking place many hundreds of years in the future things are much different, such as storing minds in cortical data stacks that can be later re-sleeved into a new body, needle-cast minds across vast distances of space, advanced A.I. weaponry, this list can go on and on.The action and plot always kept my interest, it was fast moving with lots of action, what you would expect from a Takeshi Kovacs novel. There is lots of detail everywhere and you have to keep this all sorted out in your mind or it can become confusing. The descriptions of Harlan's World in it's various aspects were well done by Morgan, at times it was almost like being there. I did find this novel on a par with the two previous Kovacs stories, very enjoyable indeed."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"Great extrapolative imagining of future tech with strangely believable, evocative, gritty emotional weirdness stemming from the mechanization and extension of humanity.

You're left wishing for more as the characters and their universe feel compelling."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"Richard Morgan has saved the best for last in what he has described as his final Takeshi Kovacs novel. Woken Furies perfects the noir feel of Altered Carbon but skips the traditional SF elements that he introduced in Broken Angels. This is a brutal, complex look at anti-hero Kovacs and his home planet of Harlans World that we've never seen before. There is some reliance on elements introduced in the earlier books and it may be tough to understand if you are new to Kovac's world. As a reader returning to this series, I found it almost impossible to put this book down.Woken Furies starts off slowly but quickly ramps up into the hyperkinetic plot twists, sex and violence that Morgan does so well. By the grand finale, justice has been served, the body count is high and the history of Kovacs and the Quellist rebels has been artfully revealed without killing the pace or forcing it down our throats like so many SF novels. Morgan has once again created a lethal mix of complex plot, high concept fiction and compelling characters written in a style that takes no prisoners. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"As with Altered Carbon and Broken Angels, I just couldn't put this exciting, action-packed. surprised-filled book down. And as with those previous two books, Morgan manages to create an exceptionally rich, vivid world for his characters. The plot and action in this novel speed right along, since the reader already knows a bit about its setting, Harlan's World, from the novel Altered Carbon.In Woken Furies, our anti-hero Kovacs finds himself teamed up with mercenaries hired to decommision autonomous war machines left over from the Quellist uprising on Harlan's World centuries ago. But things get out of hand quickly when the mercenaries' leader begins channelling the long dead Quellcrist Falconer (or something like her). From there, the plot gets much more convoluted.In fact, I'd like to take away a half-star to give this book four-and-half stars for its convoluted plot. Its certainly lacks the extraordinally tight plot and pacing of Altered Carbon. By the end of the novel, it feels like Morgan is wrapping up too many loose ends. Nevertheless, it's ripping good fun!"},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"Takeshi Kovacs resurfaces on his bleak home planet of Harlan's World in a novel which marks a terrific return to form for Richard Morgan after the rather disappointing Market Forces. Woken Furies mixes violent action, incredibly cool high-tech gadgetry and political philosophy in a story which is somewhat convoluted in its first two thirds but picks up and straightens out nicely later on. Great news for those of us who enjoy our futuristic toys, contains profanity and violence which may put off some. Has its thoughtful moments which lift the book well beyond the category of mere actioner.

The main plot is a good one, but there are certainly underdeveloped segments which could use better development, I won't elaborate so as to be a spoiler.

Add a strange holy man and a world which blends virtual worlds with reality and you have a fast-paced story with many unexpected twists and turns: a satisfying read, indeed.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"Here's the rub - the author throws so many terms, phrases, abbreviations, ideas and jargon at the reader that at times I found myself asking not what was going on but what the heck he meant. Altered Carbon was one of my top sci-fi books of all time, just incredible. Broken Angels was not quite as good but still a superb read. I like the Kovacs series - very punkish, depressing although the science may be behind the times. I fully expect the stuff he talks about (nanotech, smart matter, brain downloads, imbedded \\"stuff\\") to arrive in this century - some of the first inklings are already around.Once again, Morgan excells at character. When the book ends you can almost believe that he and Sylvie will walk through the door, arguing and then kissing. The whole idea of the \\"sleeve\\" was such a good plot device it can be recycled over and over. Still, the pace is challenging, as others have noted. It seems to slide around rather than jump but that only increases the darkness and languidness of the mood."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"This is our third encounter with Takeshi Kovacs ex-envoy and ronin from Harlen's Planet (I'm still waiting for an moon named Ellison).The story itself is one we've heard before, but with the time jumping and resleeving, it's hard sometimes to keep track of who is or was who, what their doing now, and what their involvement was in the past.Try to keep in mind that anyone named Harlen, who is Yakuza or Haiduci are going to be bad and try to screw you; and anyone who is at one time or the other a deCom or envoy is going to in someway be you friend and help you out at your most inconvenient moment.Short summary: Tak is busy getting back at a religious group for murdering (practically read death) a woman he loved (and her child), as a side story he gets mixed up with a deCom group who are trying to clean up the mess left on New Hokkaido during the Quellist Uprising (Unsettlement) three hundred years before, her eternity Quellcrist Falconer shows up (though she only here part time, and we still don't know why she picked her full nom de guerre)... and then things really get weird!Am soo looking forward to the next installment, not to mention the movies, if they are ever produced ... supposedly \\"Market Forces\\" is supposed to be filmed late this year or next year."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"Altered Carbon is one of my favorite books from the last 10 years. The world created by Morgan was fascinating, full of potential. However, the second book Broken Angels, was a major let down, and now the third book Woken Furies is worse still. If you liked the first novel, and are looking for more of the same, DO NOT READ WOKEN FURIES. You will be horribly disappointed. The plot is a rambling mess. Kovacs is a mopey character that you can not feel any connection to. Basically, there is nothing engaging about this novel. My interest in these Tokeshi Kovacs novels had been fueled by my admiration for the first novel, but now that is over. No more Kovac novels for me."},{"Title":"Woken Furies: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel","review":"Very uneven plotting and pace. Reads like part Harlan's World tour book, part Quelcrist Falconer political science tome, and part actual Kovacs novel.

Make sure to have read the over two Kovacs novels recently to have the backstory and references in mind."},{"Title":"The Lizard Who Followed Me Home","review":"I have been fascinated with lizards since early childhood. One of my first memories was setting on our screened in back porch with my mother watching five-lined skinks scurrying about doing their \\"lizard thing.\\" When I was about four years old I composed my first poem; the first in very long cannon of really bad poetry that continues to be written by me to this very day. Anyway, the poem was as follows:\\"There were five lizards on the wall.One fell down and that is all.\\"Around seven or so decades later I am still setting on a screened in back porch watching lizards being lizards. I spend a great deal of time in my dotage communicating with the little critters. Note that it is a different house and porch now. A few years ago the old house; the old home-place of my childhood burned to the ground. It is strongly rumored that it had become one of those places where meth was being cooked and something in the cooking process went dreadfully wrong. I had little sympathy for the couple who blew the house up, but I do hope the great, great, great, great, great....grandchildren of my lizard friends were able to escape harm. Harsh? Yup...but then I am that kind of guy.Anyway, when you consider my long attachment to the lizard clans you can imagine my delight when I stumbled across the book that is being reviewed here. It is absolutely delightful and tells a wonderfully cute little story about a little girl, her family and a hitchhiking lizard.The family is moving from Kansas to California. Why anyone in their right mind would make such a move was not explain, but that is beside the point). As they pack they decide they will take a quick side trip and visit grandma in Florida - and off they go. While in Florida the little girl who is telling the story notices a green lizard watching her and her grandmother intently. He seems to want to tell her something. Anyway, the family leaves Florida to return to Kansas to get on with their move. You guessed it! The little lizard makes the trip with them!Packing, traveling, unpacking...new home; a home in California; and yes, the little green stow-a-way is with them all the way...thank you very much! The story ends with the traveling lizard from Florida setting on a toadstool in his new California garden telling the west coast lizards of is amazing adventure.The art work by Jim Harris is quite creative. As a matter of fact it is hilarious. While it is extremely detailed, it is also extremely eye catching and simply fun and funny. Both kids and adults will have a pleasing time trying to spot the little traveler hidden there and there is most of the frames. The expressions on both human and reptile faces make the written text pop. We have a wonderful blend of vibrant illustrations and well written text which makes the book perfect for a one on one or group read.This is a well written and well illustrated book. As another reviewer has so well pointed out, it does have a hidden message and somewhat addresses the anxiety of a young child facing a move...this is good stuff folks.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"The Lizard Who Followed Me Home","review":"One look at the cover of this book and I couldn't help but pick it up. \\"The Lizard Who Followed Me Home\\" is about a family who unknowingly picks up a stray lizard on their move to California. It is told from the point-of-view of the young girl who rescues the lizard from the dryer (after it escaped from the washer of course) and then can't seem to shake it lose. The illustrations are funny and eye-catching with lots of detail to absorb after the text is read. Keep an eye out for that sneaky reptile... he's good at hiding.The author also explores the emotions involved in moving away from a familier home and saying goodbye to family. She mixes these details in with the humor of the storyline fairly well, although I tend to feel that kids don't appreciate being tricked into reading a self-help book. This book is targeted for ages 9-12, but it seemed more appropriate for my four-year-old son (who thoroughly enjoyed it by the way)."},{"Title":"The Fundamentals of Pa Kua Chang: The Methods of Lu Shui-Tien As Taught by Park Bok Nam Vol. II(Fundamentals of Pa Kua Chan (Unique))","review":"My personal feeling on &quot;The Fundamentals of Pa Kua Chang&quot; is that I wish another student of Lu's had written it; in essence, I wish an inherently nice person had written it. I glanced through both volumes of Park Bok Nam's &quot;Fundamentals.&quot; If Nam had removed all the anecdotes and rhetoric spread throughout both volumes such as why Lu threw an Aikido instructor friend of his when he confronted Lu, he probably could have compressed all the information into one book.In the introduction of the first volume, he is a confessed bully. He would use his training in Korean Karate to get into fights along side his gang during his younger days. Park Bok Nam would always fall back on his father, who was obviously rich because he paid for all his training - including that which he received from Lu. Nam's father told Lu what kind of trouble maker his son was. As a result Lu exercised special disciplinary action on Nam such as making him ask humbly many times to be admitted to the school and making him rake leaves in the rain for many weeks before actually allowing Nam to train in Pa Kua.My experience with bullies is that once a trouble maker - always a trouble maker. No matter how reformed you think a bully might be after so much discipline - looming in the back of his mind are ways to get vengeance on the world for all his suffering. That's what Lu did to Park Bok Nam; he made him suffer. Nam paid special attention to write about all the ways Lu made him suffer. Nam did not write about Lu torturing any other of his students. My argument is that Nam's torture did not necessarily make him a better student. If you ask me, I believe Nam's father provided the financial backing, so he could find a segueway to an English publisher for getting rich off a two volume set of &quot;Fundamentals.&quot; Nam's father being the slick businessman that he was probably suggested it and procured all the necessary professionals for putting &quot;Fundamentals&quot; together. Unfortunately, looming in the back of my mind is how Nam's trouble making ways may have sublimated into this book by missing or distorting a step some where in Pa Kua philosophy or stepping techniques.Nam most certainly seeks to appeal to the Anglo-Saxon mind set with all his anecdotes and rhetoric. He knows how the Anglo-Saxon mind set enjoys &quot;stories&quot; and gossip a l&agrave; &quot;National Enquirer&quot; or &quot;Weekly World News.&quot; He knows that the convenience oriented, Anglo-Saxon mind set loves to get its information on a silver platter and think inside of a box, so Nam provided. Any Chinese martial artist will tell you that a book can only supplement one's training - never replace it. Nam seeks to replace live instruction and alternate points of view with his two volume set; one might say they're a &quot;box&quot; set because they teach inside of a convenient, &quot;complete&quot; box of thought. Kudos to Nam. His next book should be &quot;How to get rich off martial arts books.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Fundamentals of Pa Kua Chang: The Methods of Lu Shui-Tien As Taught by Park Bok Nam Vol. II(Fundamentals of Pa Kua Chan (Unique))","review":"To find volume one search under Dan Miller, the other person listed as author.

Sifu Park is a wonderful teacher and holds nothing back in imparting the system which he has inherited. Volume II of Sifu Park's book contains yet another wealth of information while emphasizing the basic and fundamental concepts laid out in the first. It is meant to read and used as a written reference for those who have already learned the content of the first volume. I write &quot;learned&quot; rather than &quot;mastered&quot; because it takes years of practice to truly master the contents of the first volume. In the second volume, Sifu Park begins to build up the student's repertoire of techniques, fundamental exercises, and theoretical concepts. Generally speaking, in Sifu's school and study groups, it takes about a year to two years (depending on your background and willingness to practice) to get a handle on all of the teachings from the first voume. The second volume could easily take six to seven years of practice before one learns everything. Sifu also begins to show some fighting applications and the &quot;variations on a theme&quot; concepts that are Pa Kua trademarks. If one wishes to learn the exercises within these books, the videos are essential if a student group is not readily available. However, without the videos, the books give excellent insights into not only what is known as the most effective internal martial art created but also into general martial arts practice, applications, and the building of good fundamentals."},{"Title":"The Fundamentals of Pa Kua Chang: The Methods of Lu Shui-Tien As Taught by Park Bok Nam Vol. II(Fundamentals of Pa Kua Chan (Unique))","review":"This book presents a lot of information, and presents it well.However, it makes VERY frequent references to techniques presented in Vol I, and it does not present those techniques again.

Emphasis is on the complex biomechanics behind Ba Gua stepping, striking, and training methods, including introductory chi kung. This is not a book describing Master Park's Ba Gua Palms or advanced forms, but it is a DETAILED description of fundamental techniques appropriate as a learning aid for the beginning or intermediate Ba Gua student.Along with Vol. 1, Mr. Miller and Master Park take the reader through step-by-step descriptions of body motions for various strikes, stepping techniques, circle walking, and basic chi kung. Especially valuable in my opinion were the detailed descriptions of the strikes-- concentrating on the all-important pelvis and trunk as the generators of power.For the intermediate-advanced student, there is not enough (in my opinion) description or discussion of body structural alignments, power generation while moving, or combat theory. I also would have liked to see sample lesson outlines-- typical training progression over a ten year period, for example.

Without the explosive power, the forms are almost useless in self defense.The companion DVDs are excellent in showing the intricate movements of the body to deliver real power. I know why these are impossible to find...nobody wants to give their copy up.You can't learn a martial art from a book. But if you are already in training, this fills in a lot of gaps, and takes your training to a higher level.You know when your instructor shows you a strike and his power seems almost supernatural?

If you are a foodservice professional, this book is for you. If you are an average home cook, forget it. Note that the copyright date is 1998; all recipes are identified by restaurant and chef, but since then, virtually all chefs listed are no longer with the restaurants listed, and some restaurants have since closed.If you are a professional pastry chef, you should immediately buy this book if you do not already have it. It is a collection of the actual production recipes of the many wonderful chocolate desserts from the PBS series. The recipes seem to be reliable, time-proven, and battle-tested. Just bring in a photocopy of a particular recipe, and any restaurant with a full-time pastry chef should be able to execute the recipe without a problem. Note that all recipes include garnishing and plate presentation instructions (of course, there is no reason you cannot substitute standard, in-house decorating techniques). Note that you will find the original recipe for individual, warm chocolate cakes invented by Vongerichten.For the home pastry chef, the situation is a little more difficult, but this book is still a valuable resource. Many of the complicated recipes are really multi-component assembly jobs that require many preliminary steps, patience, and planning, but not culinary skill per se. Many recipes contain advanced garnishes that are beyond most home pastry chefs, but in these cases you can simply substitute your favorite garnishing techniques (indeed, many of the recipes only need a spritz from a can of supermarket whipped cream, or some in-season raspberries or strawberries). It is a useful exercise to pick one particular dessert component (ganache, mousse, flourless cake, chemically leavened biscuit, egg foam based biscuit, etc.), and do every one in the book to find ones that you wish to add to your repertoire. The recipes work, and many are of extremely high quality.If you are the average home cook, you should avoid this book. In the introduction, the editor states that some of the recipes are simple to do. Indeed, some of them are so simple that anyone who has baked a cake before can do them. Sadly, there is no way for the home cook to know which are which. A difficulty rating system or a separate section of recipes suitable for home cooks would have been a big help.The format of the book has significant shortcomings. Some of the recipes have pictures, and they are indeed labeled with the recipe they come from. Unfortunately, there is no listing or cross-reference of the pictures. So, if you are going to do a recipe and want to know if it has a matching picture (not all recipes have a matching picture), you have to physically leaf through all the pictures to see if one exists. A listing of the page numbers on all recipes that have matching pictures or a picture page reference with each recipe would have been helpful. The table of contents is virtually non-existent. The book has 200 pages with at least half that many recipes, but the table of contents lists only the four chapters of the book: cakes, tarts, souffles, and white chocolate. A complete listing of recipes in each chapter or some sort of chapter sub-division listing would be a big help; as is, if you are looking for something particular, you have to either leaf through the whole book, or comb the index.Many of the chocolate decorative touches require either tempered chocolate or artificial chocolate \\"coating\\", but the subject is never mentioned. The instructions in the last chapter on melting and then sculpting semi-sweet or bitter-sweet chocolate are wrong. I suspect that the editor does not understand the subject of chocolateering (the editor should also note that by definition, a mousse is not baked; see page 129). Also note that there is positively no information on brands or types of chocolate, techniques, or necessary equipment; therefore, you must already have this info before using this book. The same ingredient is spelled differently: p. 14 has \\"poho berries\\", while p. 154 has \\"poha berries\\" (FYI: I have never tasted them, but both recipes list raspberries as a substitute); a case of sloppy editing. Speaking of sloppy editing, some recipes are missing the odd step or two; I expect that a professional pastry chef or a talented amateur to be able to fill in the missing information. Creme Anglaise is consistently listed as \\"English Cream\\" (huh?). The cooking instructions for custards and creme anglaise are inadequate unless you have done them before and know what the correct endpoints are.The last chapter, apparently done by the editor, is full of incorrect recipes: chocolate garnishes, pulled sugar, simple syrup (the correct ratio of water/sugar is 1/1 by weight, not 2/1), coulis, and creme anglaise, not to mention the ridiculous notion of shelling your own macadamia nuts.There are also a number of recipes from Hawaiian restaurants. These are probably meant as a promotion for a brand of chocolate produced by a plantation in Hawaii. I find these recipes to generally be of lower quality than the other recipes; indeed, there are only a couple of recipes in the entire book that I suspect of not working, and they are both from Hawaiian restaurants. I have taste-tested the brand of chocolate they are trying to promote, and find it to be inferior to chocolate produced locally in SF, namely Guittard and Ghirardelli, not to mention Scharffenberger."},{"Title":"Great Chefs, Great Chocolate: Spectacular Desserts from America's Great Chefs","review":"Modern baking clearly explained with easy to find ingredients, that can be made having basic knowledge.

Sociology lecturer Gail Hawkes discusses such topics as how early Christianity handled the problem of desire, medieval practices, how pleasure and desire are perceived in the modern age, and more. In-depth and detailed without being lurid or sensational, Sex & Pleasure In Western Culture gives a balanced, objective scrutiny of one of the more controversial forces shaping human interaction and civilization since ancient times."},{"Title":"The Old Man","review":"I'm always wary of books published through non-traditional means, i.e., through iUniverse, Xlibris, etc., but after reading the first few pages of The Old Man (love that Search Inside the Book feature), I was impressed enough with the writing and intrigued enough by the titular character to consider it worth ordering. My hunch was right: This is an excellent book. While it shows some of the signs of a first-time author (as Mr. Hayes reveals on the back cover), this is an excellent debut. The beginning is a little slow, but in fairness it's somewhat necessary to establish the mood and the characters. It's in those characters, though, that Hayes scores. What is in fact a very old story-unrequited love between a man and a woman in a loveless marriage-is enhanced by an interesting historical setting (one of my favorite periods), an appealing leading couple, but most especially a refreshingly insightful look at the nature of love, in all its manifestations. While this is classed as a romance, and indeed it is, I doubted from the first few pages that it was a typical bodice-ripper, and indeed it isn't. This is an intelligent book, with intelligent thoughts about life and love and the manner in which fate forces us to learn about both. The Old Man gives me a little more hope about non-traditional publishing, and ensures that I will check out Mr. Hayes' forthcoming novel."},{"Title":"The Old Man","review":"Well, I did anyway.... And after reading the book twice, I feel as if Ben and Abby are old friends of mine. I was there when they met and when they fell in love. I was with them while they despaired of ever being together. I wracked my brains to think of a way for that to happen, forgetting that they were characters in a book and unlikely to ask for my help....I'm usually pretty good at guessing where a story is headed, but Delmer Hayes managed to surprise me several times. I was also pleasantly surprised by a couple of keen insights on falling in love.And here I have a confession to make: it may be unfair, but I really wasn't expecting that from a male author. Action? Sure. Interesting plot? Sure. Lots of sex? Probably.... Good dialogue? Why not? But a complicated, emotional romance? I hate to say it, but I just wasn't expecting it from a man. I'm very happy to report that my expectations were much too low on that front.If you want graphic sex scenes, you'll have to find another book to read -- if you want likable, believable characters and a story that'll pull you in and keep you wondering, I can highly recommend this one."},{"Title":"The Old Man","review":"I was given this book by a friend so I'd have something to read on the plane coming home. From the moment I opened the first pages, I was hooked. Finished half of it and a couple of days later read the rest in the car on the way back from a meeting in Ft. Collins. Couldn't put it down. Was reading the last page as we drove into the driveway...practically in the dark as it was around 6 pm, but I refused to wait till I got in the house to finish it and find out the ending. Outstanding and engaging love story set in historic times. Even a day or two later, memories of the characters seemed to live in my thoughts and flashbacks. I felt I'd somehow met these characters in real life."},{"Title":"Charlemagne: from the Hammer to the Cross.","review":"I see Charles the Great and the Carolingian renaissance that he brought about as a bridge between the ancient and modern worlds. I see this man with one foot in ancient Rome and one foot in modern Europe and his bridge connects me to the ancient empires that reach across time to influence the modern West. Winston says it best describing the Pope's gift to Charles of a copy of the Canons of the Roman Church which was a distillation of a thousand years of Roman jurisprudence as a thing to \\" fuse the disparate Roman and Teutonic traditions into one Europe and the person of Charles represents at once the raw metals and the end product of the alloy.\\" This incredible biography, without question the best ever written about Charlemagne in the English language and one of the greatest biographies of the 20th century, is a thrilling and poignant chronicle of the greatest of Medieval kings. I loved reading this book."},{"Title":"The Classical Cookbook","review":"Excellent book for both its recipes (easy to follow with directions given for both the English and American cook) and its description of Roman life, for both the Roman commoners and the citizens of stature. If you want to have a Roman banquet, or a simple, traditional Roman meal, this is an ideal book. I especially enjoyed the well-written sections on Roman history, which perfectly integrate the recipes with what we know about the people's lives and the ingredients which were available to them. I looked at every Roman cookbook I could find, in both the USA and England, and my three favorites are: Classical Cookbook, by Dalby and Grainger, and, A Taste of Ancient Rome, by Ilaria Giacosa, and Roman Cookery, by Mark Grant. The latter two have more recipes than the first, but Classical Cookbook is a quality book with exquisite pictures, illustrations and explanations."},{"Title":"The Classical Cookbook","review":"Fifteen years after it's original release this book remains one of the best on the subject. I would like to clarify that, as the authors point out through references to Odysseus, Philoxennus, Macedonia etc. it explains very cleary that the Greeks were those who elevated cookery into an art,through trial and error and endless experimentation. It focuses primarily on techniques and recipes that originated in ancient Greecemuch later to be passed on to ancent Rome. I make this point as a reviwer has incorrectly given the impression that the book focuses primarily on Roman cookery. One might argue that they at that time in history they were one in the same as Romans brought Greek slaves and free Greek cooks to prepare their meals for them ultimately consuming the same dishes. Over time, the simple dishes introduced by the Greeks became more complicated and lavish, an evolution that has continued till today. There are several other books available that cover this period in detail.Having made the above points, the author has done an excellent job in the first 30 pages of the book to explain the intricacies of the recipes that follow, explaining the ingredients used, where to find them and substitutions that can be made in order to get an approximate idea of what the Ancient Greeks and later the Romans enjoyed at their tables. It is a good read regardless if you plan to execute the recipes or not."},{"Title":"The Classical Cookbook","review":"An excellent historic cook book. Solid history. Author is careful with the reconstructions, explaining what is known, and what is inferred, for each recipe. And the recipes are good. I especially like the mushrooms with fish sauce and honey. Try it."},{"Title":"The Classical Cookbook","review":"I probably enjoyed the history rather than the recipes as they can be quiet unusual to first time tasters. There are lots of strong flavours with wine, wine vinegar and fish sauce in many recipes, sometimes offset by the sweetness of honey or figs. It makes more of a conversational dining experience rather than gourmet food. But the results are quite nice and have been adapted to modern palates and techniques well."},{"Title":"The Classical Cookbook","review":"I got this recipe book for an ancient mythology class I was taking in college.

The recipes for holidays are identified such as St. Joseph's Cream Puffs (Sfinge di San Giuseppe) and Christmas Eve Cake (Torta Vigilia di Natale).The Italian name is given for may of the recipes along with the name in English and both are indexed.

If everyone read this book, our society would be markedly different, and much less superficial. Unfortunately most humans are not critical thinkers. It is not one of those mystical 'new wave' - &quot;how to improve yourself&quot; texts. It is information that can be applied to your everyday life from the trivial to the vastly important. It is a very basic building block on how to really understand what is going on and if what is being said has validity.

The issue is who is it who defines \\"highest\\" and what do they do as a result.Utopianism may refer literally to the absence of all conflict, peaceful co-existence and so on, but human beings are human beings and when utopianism takes hold, true believers are either spat upon or spit upon those outside themselves. On the positive side we have the Oneidans, the Shakers, and other such peaceable groups, many quite small and short-lived, although that is certainly not always the case. On the other side, we have many historical horrors.From the Puritan's (and Ronald Reagan's) \\"Shining City on the Hill\\" to Hitler's Aryan nation to the Crusaders' \\"salvation\\" of Jerusalem (the original 'shining city on the hill'), to the Muslim vision of paradise, to the apocalyptic vision of the \\"Rapture\\" -- wherever a powerful sense of exclusive idealism, religious or not, has taken root, believers frequently have behaved savagely toward those they deem \\"not worthy\\" of experiencing that ideal.These \\"others,\\" whether Jew or Christian, Hugenot, Hindus, Muslim, black, women or indigenous peoples of colonized lands, have been systematically and often brutally excluded from experiencing idealized human and religious glory both in concept and in fact.It is in his description of this process as it regards native peoples that Ifound Mohawk's book an excellent, if disturbing read."},{"Title":"Utopian Legacies: A History of Conquest & Oppression in the Western World","review":"I have to disagree with the previous review. Although Christianity, in theory, may not carry a utopian view, it certainly conducts itself thusly. This book targets many important issues and explains the many \\"whys\\" associated with our history. It is an important contribution to anyone's collection of Native American history. It outlines quite clearly how objectives based on religious beliefs often foil themselves and result instead in calamitous outcomes."},{"Title":"Utopian Legacies: A History of Conquest & Oppression in the Western World","review":"I greatly looked forward to this book but couldn't have been more disappointed. The author correctly identifies Utopianism, the belief we live in a perfectable world, as the dominant source of mischief and tragedy throughout history.Utopian zeal shapes nations, political parties, education, law and people's lives, on a moment to moment basis. From Darwin to Marx to Freud to Stalin to Hitler to the 60's culture to modern hate groups, socialists and activists. All these things share the belief humans can &quot;progress&quot; to a perfect world.The book's failure is in identifying Christianity as Utopian when it has actually been the primary force opposing Utopian impulses throughout history. I don't know where the author could have gotten his understanding of Christianity (or history), but &quot;The Kingdom of God&quot; he describes Christians as referring to is something to be established by God, not people.Because of the existence of sin (specifically, Original Sin), Christians recognize no human action can possibly create Utopia. We do not live in a perfectable world. Christians see human thought as being so corrupted by sin, people cannot even IMAGINE a perfect world. All attempts will lead to ruin. Further, Christians view the Utopian impulse of humanity as evidence of and reflecting the desire of a fallen mankind to return to fellowship with God in the Garden of Eden -- something no human action can bring about, only the Grace of God.Thus, Christians, and those operating under Christian thinking, have been the historical force OPPOSING Utopianism. The author's scholarship and understanding is so wrong, he misidentifies the only historical solution to the problem he is talking about.[The Puritan intent to set up an example of a shining &quot;city on the hill&quot; wasn't Utopian -- no group was more conscious on a moment-to-moment basis of the unavoidability of sin than Puritans -- but rather a demonstration of what could be done when adhering to God's given laws for a fallen, corrupt people]Recently, Utopian idealism, the denial of human sin, has been reformulated on the assertion humans are only mechanically derived animals; complicated bits of matter to be manipulated to a higher state by an elite which believes it has higher vision (replacing God with their own desires).Modernity is Utopianism, made scientifically plausible by Darwin whose Victorian-era studies seemed to eliminate God, thus Original Sin. The result was predicted and predictable (by Christians): Karl Marx quickly folded Darwin's science into communism and the attempt to perfect human nature scientifically, to create a Worker's Paradise (60 million killed in Russia, 50 million killed in China). Then the Nazi's (National Socialists) trying to create an Aryan super-race, also based on the science of Darwin (20 million dead &amp; Holocaust). And eugenics and abortion: the modern world.Utopianism, rationalized as science, has killed 200+ million and enslaved billions in the great secular socialist states we live in. This is why Christians advocate decentralization of power; to avoid its concentration in the hands of corrupt humans. And why the Utopians seek to centralize it, so the elite can shepherd us to Utopia. The modern Left are INTERNATIONAL Utopians while the Right are NATIONALISTIC Utopians (my country, my race). Same thought process, different implementation. Christians oppose them both; WW II, Cold War, etc.The author barely discusses socialism and Marxism while attacking Christianity. For this reason, the author's error makes the book perverse. Wrong history, wrong analysis, wrong conclusions. Just wrong."},{"Title":"General Chemistry: Principles and Modern Applications (7th Edition)","review":"This was a great buy!

It is barely highlighted, no torn pages and the cover is not worn at all! Shipping was pretty fast too."},{"Title":"General Chemistry: Principles and Modern Applications (7th Edition)","review":"While there is a great deal of convergence about the concepts taught in a one year general chemistry course, the way those principles are taught, to what depth, and the kind of vocabulary used in teaching them varies from text to text. This allows the authors to focus their teaching in ways appropriate to different kinds of students.This text is geared towards a one year course in general chemistry for students going on to careers in engineering, biology, and other technical fields. The vocabulary of the text is adapted to build up comfort with the technical terms of chemistry and familiarity in working with formulae rather than being content with intuitions about chemistry. It also has a nice addition of the actual people whose names are given to various laws and concepts in chemistry. When the name is presented there is also a picture and a sentence or two about who they were. I enjoyed this a great deal because it brings the text to life a bit more.Pedagogically there are several nice helps that show the experience the authors have in teaching real life students and the kinds of misconceptions they tend to have. In the margins there are notes called \\"Keep in Mind\\" that help students avoid those common traps that come to easily to beginners in any field. There are well chosen diagrams, drawings, and pictures that aid in teaching rather than being content with decoration. The text also has notes entitled \\"Are You Wondering\\" that help students deal with questions that are probably arising in their mind as they are working through these concepts for the first time.The problems in the back are grouped according to the concepts taught in the chapter and the problems numbered in red have the answers provided in the back of the book. They also provide an Integrative Example that shows the concepts in a more real life problem. After these come a series of integrative problems and advanced exercises. These are followed with feature problems and self-assessment exercises. When learning these concepts it is essential to do lots of work with them in order to be sure you understand them and to develop comfort with working with them. It will make learning later in the book easier and allow you to take more from the course after it is completed.This is an excellent text for students who have had at least a bit of chemistry before tackling this course. And for technical students it will be more rewarding than other more basic texts even though they both cover similar ground. The more technical approach taken here will be more enriching to them."},{"Title":"General Chemistry: Principles and Modern Applications (7th Edition)","review":"I have taken many chemistry courses throughout my highschool and college career. This book has by far been the worst chemistry book I have ever read. The extremely poor organization of examples and confusing diction is not helpful to anyone taking a general chemistry course. You will have a much more successful time using your old highschool chemistry books as references."},{"Title":"General Chemistry: Principles and Modern Applications (7th Edition)","review":"The text assumes that the reader has a background of at least one year of high school chemistry. It would be best for students to have two years of high school chemistry before approaching the more complex concepts introduced in the textbook. However, there are some nice details about the scientists involved in the scientific discoveries introduced. Notes to students and instructors are useful and the example problems are excellent. The self-assessment exercises are an excellent tool for the student to evaluate their progress. The exercises at the end of each chapter dramatically increase in difficulty as one works through each section. Some of the most difficult problems require skills not introduced in the text. Compounding this issue is the fact that many problems worked out in the solutions manual employ shortcuts that confuse even very bright students, along with some typos.The Petrucci 9th Edition has undergone a significant number of changes from the 8th Edition. The 9th Edition suffers, to some extent, from some cumulative effects from numerous revisions. For instance there was a section added of Organic Chemistry early in the text, but it was too ambitious with too little background given to benefit the average student. In light of the recent revisions, it would be useful to reorganize the order of the chapters to facilitate learning. For instance, much of the information concerning the Periodic Table would be more useful earlier in the textbook.The text is designed for a one year Freshman Chemistry course, but an instructor should understand that all of the material will not fit easily into two semesters. The instructor then has the option to focus on areas of their personal interest in greater detail than typically available in the Freshman text and reduce some of the detail in other sections. Exposure to some of the more advanced material in the textbook should be interesting to motivated students. Overall, the Petrucci 9th Ed. is a good Freshman textbook for students with a strong science background."},{"Title":"General Chemistry: Principles and Modern Applications (7th Edition)","review":"I have taken several chemistry courses in high school and college. However i find this book to be very difficult in understanding. I find myself refering back to my old notes and books. There are surely more chemistry books out there that could explain chemistry itself in a more efficient manner. This book does not contain any clear cut directions on how to solve many problems, in addition to containing many problems in the exercises section which was also not explained the lecture part of the book. The practice problems also does not help in solving many of the problems because it is simple and straightforward as opposed to the exercises which is very misleading and unclear. I, as a science major, do not recommend this book unless of course you are required to purchase it by a professor who does not care for you to pass the class."},{"Title":"General Chemistry: Principles and Modern Applications (7th Edition)","review":"Incoherence is not an opinion but rather a fact when it comes to associating that word with this book. Petrucci although as a long history with writing chemistry textbooks, still has not been able to provide an adequate explanation to some of the MOST basic concepts of chemistry.I think he is probably a brilliant chemist as the questions in this book can be challenging; I found them trivial however. This is not because I deem myself intelligent (that goes without saying :) but the fact of the matter is that I had better books to rely on when I was studying undergraduate chemistry.Silberberg and Malone's Basic Concepts of Chemistry where to two that got me through. I initially was given this book to study from and I found some of the chapters deadly boring.How Petrucci explains and expounds and Acid-Base, and Quantum Chemistry is satisfactory, however organic chemistry, the concept of the mole and redox are chapters that accentuate the inarticulate nature and the overall dullness of the book.This is not good becase fundamentally chemical reactions are about the transference, absorption and dissipation of energy which is normally expressed as the \\"movement of electrons\\". One of the principle topics in chemistry which first introduces this is redox.Secondly the concept of the Mole and basic calculations are required and if an individual has only this book to rely on then there is not much hope that the student would get a good enough grasp of what is at hand.Better Books:Basic Concepts of Chemistry by Malone. A tried and tested book which takes a layman or (laywoman for that matter) and makes a chemist out of them.Chemistry by Silberberg: very detailed explanations on various concepts.Chemistry by Olmsted, if you are short on cash and need a book that does both of the above, then this is it.

Taylor's \\"Not Without Anna,\\" is a gripping, hard-hitting, thought-provoking look at the escalating crisis of teen alcohol and drug abuse.Psychologist Katherine Marshall is devastated when her daughter drowns. The apparent accident quickly turns into a murder investigation when the date rape drug is found in Anna Marshall's system during the autopsy.Anna's boyfriend Mike is arrested and tried, but found not guilty in Anna's death, but his son's release does not stop Charles Beckett from continuing his personal attacks on Katherine and her parenting skills in his daily newspaper column. And when Katherine discovers Anna's journals and her daughter's secret life while going through her room and emails, she begins to doubt and blame herself.Author Vicki M. Taylor digs deep into heart and soul, dragging the reader through the fear, the loss, the self-doubt and self-blame, the devastation, the denial, and the tragic results of alcohol and drug abuse in the compelling story of \\"Not Without Anna.\\" The writing is tight. The pacing will keep your heart racing. The characters are your kids, your neighbor's kids, your friends, and maybe even yourself. Each one lives and breathes depth and reality onto the pages. \\"Not Without Anna,\\" is a story that haunts from an author to watch."},{"Title":"Not Without Anna","review":"As the mother of 3 teens I typically read non-fiction to learn about the stages of children. After reading Not Without Anna I may switch to fiction. I experienced the voices of teens in a way I never had before, and I'm grateful.I highly recommend this book for parents, teachers, counselors, and teens.Readers get a peek at the secret lives of teens and their emotions through dialogue that is alarming, gripping, and honest. I appreciate how the author takes a horrendous situation and creates a solution that involves interaction between teens and adults. She awakens us to the fact that teenagers need boundaries and love from adults. If you have a teen in your life you need to read this book.Dotsie Bregelwww.boomerwomenspeak.com"},{"Title":"Not Without Anna","review":"Yes indeed, author Vicki M Taylor has breached the generation gap, meaning, although I am an older woman, almost from a different galaxy, she has made me understand and care about the teenage characters in the novel. Ms. Taylor's writing style is clear, without frills, and so streamlined that her story flows and flows and flows, without taking a break, to its satisfying conclusion. It's strongest point is that NOT WITHOUT ANNA is a no-nonsense wake-up call for mothers! Fast-paced enough to be a beach-book (or a pool-side book), nevertheless NOT WITHOUT ANNA is an eye-opener (for parents and children-alike), presented in a straight-forward manner. I cared about all of her characters, from Anna, to Jessie, to Katherine ... especially Katherine, who has lost the two most important people in her life, her husband and her daughter, and manages to pick herself up with such courage, such admirable purpose! I wondered about her choices for the future, even long after I turned over the last page."},{"Title":"Not Without Anna","review":"This book is a very enjoyable read - I read it in a weekend.I found it to be a &quot;page turner&quot; - very believable characters, lots of little twists as the story unfolds. I really felt the mother's grief - well written, not over done.I could see where this would be a book that both adults and teenagers could read, and get different things from the story."},{"Title":"Not Without Anna","review":"This is the second book of Vicki Taylor's that I've read. I have to admit, I like it when an author sends more than one book for me to read. It gives me a better sense of who they are as an author; gives me more examples to base my opinions on.Of the two books I read, this one and \\"Trust in the Wind,\\" I have to admit I liked this one much more. This one had more of a definitive plot line, and more of a struggle to it. The plot appealed to me more on a personal level I guess.This story is about the death of a young teenage girl named Anna. The story is about the lives of those left behind; from her best friend, to her boyfriend, to her mother, who soon realizes she didn't know nearly as much about her daughter's life as she had once presumed. As Katherine, Anna's mother, struggles to accept this new knowledge surrounding her now deceased daughter, she realizes that she has a greater purpose in life. Determined not to let her daughter's death be in vain, Katherine embarks on a crusade to reach out to the teenagers in her community. The very same teenagers whom her daughter had previously bonded with--the ones struggling with anger and feelings of lonliness; turning to each other and drugs to ease these feelings of pain.Katherine's community isn't entirely receptive of her new ideas, and we follow along as Katherine becomes more and more determined with each obstacle she faces and attempts to overcome. We're there as Katherine finds unlikely allies, is betrayed by those she thought she could trust, and as she ultimately begins to accept the loss of her daughter.The story moves quickly, and is compelling in its own right. To me, its a pretty accurate portrayal of a part of teenage America. Its no secret that the drugs are out there, and that there are certainly those who abuse them. The book is well written, in a way that you connect with each character that is introduced, not just one or two of them. I'd recommend it to any parent, teenager, or anyone just looking for a quick yet quality read."},{"Title":"How Do Octopi Eat Pizza Pie?

It truly is the definitive text on the subject. Be warned - this is not necessarily an easy book to read. It is dense, profound stuff, and there are many places that will stop you in your tracks as you read paragraphs over and over, trying to tease out and understand all the multilayered detail. But once it's accomplished, the lights go on, and you have a new understanding that a more &quot;readable&quot; treatment would never have afforded. The illustrations are marvelous, whether it's the crisp, highly detailed line drawings of rig details or the wonderful rare old photographs of the glory days of this marvelous rig. Truly a must read. And it isn't just a tribute to the racing yachts - this is a book of working sail, where men's lives and livelihoods depended on their watercraft.Also highly recommended is &quot;Hand Reef and Steer&quot;, by Tom Cunliffe, which is a much more readable and user friendly text for the gaff rig owner/sailor"},{"Title":"The Gaff Rig Handbook: History, Design, Techniques, Developments","review":"Like Tom Cunliffe's \\"Hand Reef and Steer,\\" John Leather's \\"Gaff Rig Handbook\\" is an excellent resource for someone building, restoring or merely interested in gaff rigs.

Each of these groups has its own culture and he stays a while at each, doing whatever he needs (e.g., going nude, praying, chanting \\"Hare Krishna\\") to fit in while he's there. This works well for him -- he stays fed and sheltered and moves on when he's ready for a change of scenery.But when he comes across a walled-in settlement in the middle of Native American land, he finds that he can never fit in because the group who lives there are the adult descendents of women who contracted rubella while pregnant. All of these adults are both deaf and blind, though their children are not. At first the drifter is fascinated by the ways they've developed to get around their \\"handicap,\\" but soon he learns that, in their community, he's the one with the disability because he will never be able to understand their language -- a language that is a lot deeper than mere spoken words could ever be.As someone who spends a lot of time thinking about perception, I was fascinated by a culture that can't see or hear, and I enjoyed the parts of the story that dealt with how the group overcame their obstacles. Also, the idea that communication without the masks of fake facial expressions and deceptive body language could be more informative than the \\"normal\\" methods is appealing. We get a lot of information about someone's internal state through visual and auditory cues and it's hard to imagine that tactile methods could compensate for missing this input, but John Varley is suggesting that people who are born blind and deaf might develop these sorts of paranormal abilities when normal sensory input is lacking. It is true that some people who are blind or deaf have sensory abilities that seeing and hearing people don't have, or at least never realized they have (e.g., blindsight, echolocation). Perhaps Varley's idea isn't so far-fetched.The Persistence of Vision, which won both the Hugo and Nebula awards, will make you think. It will make you consider what kinds of wonderful abilities might be unmasked if you lost some of your \\"normal\\" abilities. Would it be worth the price?I listened to Peter Ganim narrate the audio version produced by Audible Frontiers. It was a great production and I'm pleased to see so many Hugo- and Nebula-awarded stories in their catalog."},{"Title":"Movie Sets 101: The Definitive Survivor's Guide","review":"Movie Sets 101: The Definitive Survivor's Guide by professional special effects and makeup filmmaker Paul J.

A must have!"},{"Title":"Movie Sets 101: The Definitive Survivor's Guide","review":"This is a great book. Even if you already work in film and tv there's something unexpected to be read. It gives you a really good heads up about on-the-set mayhem you could never really anticipate and wouldn't expect until it happens. Invaluable stuff."},{"Title":"Movie Sets 101: The Definitive Survivor's Guide","review":"I really enjoyed the insightful and often very humorous commentary given in this book. It is below my level as I'm a film industry professional, but I wanted to check it out because I'm directing my first feature and thought it would be interesting and probably entertaining. I mainly was hoping for funny stories, which is what I got! My problem with the book is there quite literally at least 200 errors in this book, if not 300 to 400. I am not exaggerating. One page alone has THREE misuses of \\"then\\" instead of \\"than\\" and there are constant typos as well. There was clearly no editor whatsoever, which is astonishing for a book with a real publisher. It's totally inexcusable. As a two-time author myself who did all of his own editing for grammar or spelling errors, I proof read my books until I found 0 mistakes. It's the author's job not just to write the book but to make sure of its quality, and that was not done here."},{"Title":"Considerthe Lilies","review":"Since I am a dog show person, and an animal lover I found the stories to be humorous, I've been there trying to get that perfect picture. Watching the silly things are furry friends do endear them to us. And of course, Sterling Silver, she was a wonderful dog and the best thing is that I still see her in all her grand children and great grand children...etc. and the Parade always brings back the past and you remember when these dogs were in their prime and how many wonderful memories come flooding back into your heart.It was lighthearted and touching and brought tears to my eyes. Thank you for preserving these memories."},{"Title":"Kabuki: Metamorphosis","review":"Frankly, a piece of comicdom art-- a real groundbreaker. This graphic novel, and the whole Kabuki series, moves comics into areas that the genre should have been going for years-- namely, using the art form for one of the things it can do best-- telling a story visually. Mack's ability to bring together both the story itself, and _how_ that story is told into one, completely interdependent form is amazing. The full color paintings and ink drawings that Mack does are beautiful and visually compelling, and his use of the whole page (versus simple panel by panel exposition) is refreshing and well worth the time one can spend poring over a page looking for all his details. The story itself, a dark one of beautiful assassin \\"secret agents\\", is nether here nor there. However, what he does with that vehicle is mezmerizing. The depth of Kabuki's character is real, what she experiences internally is real, and the growth she moves through is real. Get it just to see what a graphic novel really can be-- an art form entirely its own, a merging of visual and literary mediums. Read it over and over to be awash in an obvious labor of love. Psychologically engaging, visually stunning. It's unlike any other comic I've seen yet-- transcends the comic genre, even as it moves the genre into a new level."},{"Title":"Kabuki: Metamorphosis","review":"The Kabuki series creates and sustains a visual intensity that has to be seen to be believed. If nothing else, the range of media is incredible - one image might contain watercolor, collage, lettering, and computer processing. The next might be three or four other media.This is not a book to read once and put down. It deserves more than one reading, maybe many readings, to capture everything in this story. The plot itself is well done but ordinary. It's the imagery that can't be absorbed at one sitting, including lettering and private notes. These additional texts don't drive the story along the plot line. They do, however, sustain the mood and express the characters' inner experience of their situation. There is no clear dividing line between text and artwork, though.Other artists may use experimental media and non-linear text as a substitute for technical skill. Mack uses the media to express his skill - his drawing is outstanding, and he clearly has a passion for figure.I have many favorites among comics, each for different reasons. Mack's Kabuki is a favorite among my favorites."},{"Title":"Kabuki: Metamorphosis","review":"This is possibly the best Western graphic novel that I have ever read. The artwork is phenomenal-- David Mack is an amazing artist-- and the layout/storyline is incredibly designed. There are so many levels to this book, and it is very involving. It can be appreciated for its genius, its art, its characters, its symbolism, and its depth. It tells the story of Kabuki, an inspiring woman, from a very personal and unique point of view. The way it is written is so incredibly real that you can't help but get involved. You will fall in love with the artwork and the people and every time you read it you will get more out of it."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},E={class:"card-container"},W=["disabled"],C={key:0},H={key:1};function R(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=y("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",E,[(t(!0),a(g,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),p(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",H,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",C,"See more"))],8,W)):b("",!0)])}const j=u(x,[["render",R],["__scopeId","data-v-aafaef38"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/59.md","filePath":"people/59.md"}'),q={name:"people/59.md"},N=Object.assign(q,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(j)]))}});export{L as __pageData,N as default};
