The plot is thus: After Christina's parents died, she was sent to live with a rather cold, unmaternal aunt. She attempted suicide and was then placed in a group home while they tried to figure out what to do with her. Her guardian ad litem, Mr. Keller, took a liking to her and became her foster parent, and Christina's life improved a great deal, but then Mr. Keller died suddenly and her future was up in the air after that. Although Mrs. Keller invites her to stay on, it's clear that she never liked Christina as much as Mr. Keller did, and Christina feels unwelcome.Well, at the end of the story, a lot of issues are still unresolved. You never figure out what's going on with Mrs. Keller, whether she actually cares about Christina or not, whether she will keep her or not. There's this kind of weird subplot with Christina's cousin that I can't figure out either. Christina herself has practically no personality.Give this one a miss. Even making allowances for its being dated (over forty years old now), the story was sorely lacking."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Mathematical Cosmology","review":"This book presents a review the basics of mathematical cosmology. For example a review of basic general relativity (a co-ordinate approach) is presented early on (Chapter 2). There are no exercises or problems. You could not learn general relativity from this.The discussion of the geometric and kinematic properties of the RW metric were good. Sufficient material is presented for reviews of standard cosmological models in chapters 3 and 5 although the material concerning the relativistic Friedmann models is covered much more clearly in Foster and Nightingale with the same end results and nice do-able exercises.. Chapter five presents a review of models with a cosmological constant.Some exact solutions (original work by the author) are presented. Rather frustratingly, solutions of some equations are presented with no hints at all as to how they are arrived at. Some approximate relationships are stated without suggesting how they are taken.This makes independent study of the book frustrating at times.There are two chapters later on that present the material from the mathematical supplement to Weinberg's 'three minutes' book in more detail. These are quite fun and could be dipped into independently. I bought this book 'hardback at paperback price - 14.95' which was fair. I would not pay the full price for this book - save up and get Weinberg's Gravitation and Cosmology or get it from the library. It is not really suitable for independent study."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Mathematical Cosmology","review":"Some books on cosmology specialize in stating the concepts while keeping the mathematics to a minimum. Others state everything in more mathematical terms. Yet others are textbooks which get one to practice the mathematics. This book takes a different approach from any of these.To understand cosmology, one needs to know some mathematics. And that would be true even if we knew all the answers to our questions. Given that there are actually multiple models of the universe that are being used and debated, it is even more important to see the mathematics that gets used to characterize them.Still, this is not a textbook with problem sets. It is more of a review text in some areas (particularly general relativity), and a supplementary book in others. It addresses several important topics in cosmology in useful detail.The book begins with an overview of cosmology and a review of general relativity. Then Islam spends a significant amount of time on the Robertson-Walker metric, with two different derivations of it. Next, we look at Friedman models of the universe. And then, we look at observational cosmology, with estimates and ranges for the Hubble constant and the resulting age of the universe (which hopefully comes out larger than the ages of the stars and galaxies).After that, Islam discusses models with a cosmological constant. That's a good idea given that in the last few years, we have obtained more and more evidence for the existence of this (or of a dark energy term). He then includes an interesting chapter on singularities.After this, there are chapters on the early universe. That means the temperature of the early universe and big bang nucleosynthesis. And we find out about the amounts of primordial helium and deuterium (I think these are still very intriguing issues). The author also shows us a variety of inflationary models (I had fun comparing this chapter with what Roger Penrose said about inflation in \\"The Road to Reality\\"). Islam then gives a brief account of quantum cosmology, including a mention of the Hartle-Hawking proposal for the wave function of the \\"ground state\\" of the universe.The book concludes with a chapter about the distant future of the universe, including black hole evaporation and proton decay. While such a section may seem speculative and unsophisticated, I think such topics are a genuine part of cosmology.This is a useful book, and I recommend it as a supplement to almost any cosmology text."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Mathematical Cosmology","review":"I picked this book up in the science library.

It is also a masterful study of the competing Catholic and Protestant views and teachings with regards to the mores and cultural attributes of that time period. This was a time when Europe was exploding in Reformation and Counter-Reformation and hysteria over witchcraft was at its highest. Roper's most controversial assertion is that our modern, Freudian understanding and construct of the Oedipus Complex has no bearing or relationship to that of other time periods and cultures. This would seem to complicate contemporary attempts by such philosophers as Jurgen Habermas to reconstruct historical materialism by examining the family and the dynamics of their relationships, psycho-sexual or otherwise.

Reading the play silently is nice, but at the meeting we read the second act as a play (with a little bit of gender bending required to fulfill a few of the female roles - but it worked amazingly well. Really!). Most of us weren't wild about the play, but we liked it. Reading the play out loud gave us a much better idea of how the play works: its surrealism, its naturalism, its non-sequiturs (that really aren't non-sequiturs after all), its motivation and motion. Also, it's a very complex play, with a play within the play, and commentary on the play within the play.Generally we agreed that this is a period piece, best understood as a response to World War II and a belief that we'll be better after it's over, just as we've been better after after each previous war or catastrophe. It was nice to talk about the characters, how they changed, yet how they remained the same, and why the play isn't revived very often."},{"Title":"Three plays: Our town, The skin of our teeth, The matchmaker","review":"Our Town is interesting 1939 play stage-managing the life of rural families in NH at turn of the century, focussing on a love affair, rueing that each one of us should spend more time appreciating the fullness and preciousness of the day-to-day world in which we live.

Plays aren't everyone's idea of pleasure reading, but this collection of Wilder's best-known three are among the best-known one-act plays in the American collection. Drawing at will upon the comic and the tragic -- often in the same breath -- Wilder's plays might have prompted the slogan of the recent (and acclaimed) &quot;American Beauty&quot;, which implored viewers to &quot;look closer.&quot; These three plays are good discussion pieces, palatable introductions to American theater, and insightful explorations into the potential of the theatrical medium.A little more info on two of the three:OUR TOWN happens to have been one of the first plays I ever actually studied in a drama class, and I have particularly fond memories of blustering through the part of Mr. Webb in our dramatic reading. The play, which focuses on the lives of the simple townsfolk in Grovers' Corner, New Hampshire, a dry New England town, begins with an observation of the daily lives of the townsfolk. In the second act, it goes on to portray the romance which develops between George Gibbs and Emily Webb, the young lovers who consummate their feelings in marriage at the end of the act. And in the third act, after Emily dies, she finds herself among the mourners at her own wake. Taken as a whole, Our Town shows the reactions of the austere New Englanders to all possible situations -- they are brought to life, portrayed in times of happiness, grief, and peaceful quiet. In addition, Wilder uses the play to make a statement about the futility of living in the past, and forcing the audience to deal with the concept that just like a show, life must go on. In the end, he says, truth can only be found in the future, which it is still in our power to influence and change. Our lives are our own to live, and we must learn to set our own course while we still can. (Of particular interest in this script is the role of the &quot;Stage Manager&quot;, who both interacts with the characters and serves as a quasi-omniscient narrator. I think the idea of having a character exist on multiple planes might have been a Thornton first, at least in some regards.)THE SKIN OF OUR TEETH is a little bit stranger and more avant garde. In a script unlike anything else that Wilder has ever written (to the best of my knowledge), the audience is presented with a detached look at man's natural reaction to crisis and stress. The play focuses around the Antrobus family, simple representatives of the every family, but with a few significant quirks -- the characters seem to be updated (or perhaps reincarnated) versions of the first family -- Adam, Eve, Cain, and Abel -- and refuse to establish a consistent setting. Simultaneously set in the prehistoric Ice Age and on the boardwalks of Atlantic City (and by simultaneously I mean that there is no differentiation between the two), and paying no particular attention to the linear laws of time or space, the play draws upon so many stage and literary devices that it eventually makes the head spin. In a particularly powerful conclusion, the play comes entirely round circle, ending with the same lines on which it began, and implying that the entire cycle is about to repeat itself. And that is exactly the point Wilder was getting at in this bizarre and avant garde production -- no matter how much we change, as we evolve from cave-dwellers to farmers to civilized ladies and gentlemen, the more we stay the same. Our features change, but our natures do not. Both a confusing and intensely powerful piece of dramatic scripting, this play is worth reading at least twice. (To the credit of this script, I remember getting chills just reading it to myself for the first time, during certain climactic scenes.)As for THE MATCHMAKER... I'm not as familiar with it, but I know it's a popular comic script for amateur theater troupes, and served as the basis for the musical comedy &quot;Hello Dolly&quot;, in which a widowed matchmaker decides to take a second husband, and tricks him into proposing to her by making a show out of setting him up with another woman. Clever, but not as experimental as the other two...All in all, this is a collection of plays that should be read at least once, if only so that you can say you didn't care for them. There's a lot here, and Wilder was a master of the short script, and a pioneer in American theater. Give it a shot -- check it out from your library if you're dubious about purchasing scripts you haven't read -- and see what you think,"},{"Title":"Three plays: Our town, The skin of our teeth, The matchmaker","review":"Skin of Our Teeth and Our Town both were prize-winning plays. The Matchmaker became one of the most popular musicals of all time - Hello Dolly. Thornton Wilder's plays are in production at countless high schools across the country, and that's a pity - few students have the maturity or insight to bring these words strongly to life.Skin of Our Teeth, the story of the Antrobus family in stone age Atlantic City, NJ, deals with indomitable humanity, and how we can prevail against all odds, but especially against our own impulses. It also brings up the consolations of literature and of past times.Our Town is a simple little play about love and death, and how life is composed as a series of moments. It is so important to live in every, every, moment.The Matchmaker is about living life to the fullest, even in the midst of grief and aging.This makes these plays sound dreadfully simplistic, and full of high-school style morality. Thornton Wilder's writing is full of irony, wit, grace, kind humor, and style. His writing has a deceptive simplicity and rhythm. Read these plays to bring some beauty into your life."},{"Title":"Three plays: Our town, The skin of our teeth, The matchmaker","review":"When I received this collection of plays by Thornton Wilder, I compared some of the text to an original acting script, and found that several changes had been made, apparently to make it more socially \\"correct\\". For example, in the introductory monolog to Our Town, the playwright's reference to the people living in Polish Town as \\"foreigners who come to work in the mill\\" had been completely deleted. I consider this an example of Bowdlerizing, and a big enough change in the text that it may be illegal. I was very disappointed."},{"Title":"Three plays: Our town, The skin of our teeth, The matchmaker","review":"I just saw the revival of &quot;The Skin of Our Teeth&quot; for free as part of the New York Shakespeare Festival in Central Park, and I can't begin to tell you how extraordinary it was! I immediately ran out and bought the play, in this edition of &quot;3 Plays,&quot; and hearing it again in my head, I'm convinced that this is one of the best American plays I've ever come across. It is crazy and funny and complex; it reaches the heart and asks profound questions, from the meaning of life to the boundaries of theatre. Depicting the resilience and perseverance of the Antrobus family, who, along with their maid Sabina (a great, great part), represent all of humanity, &quot;The Skin of Our Teeth&quot; reminds us that, in spite of war and flood and all misery, &quot;we have to go on for ages and ages yet.&quot; An awesome play."},{"Title":"Three plays: Our town, The skin of our teeth, The matchmaker","review":"With the centenary of Wilder's birth in 1997, the Yale Repertory Theatre mounted a production of &quot;The Skin of Our Teeth,&quot; probably the first professional one it had seen (in this country, anyway) in twenty years. Encountering the play for the first time since reading it in high school, I was struck by its notorious alleged similarities to FINNEGANS WAKE, which got Wilder in trouble when Joseph Campbell and Henry Morton Robinson pointed them out upon the play's first production. Although Wilder scholars have always been heatedly hostile towards Campbell and Robinson, there is no doubt that the two men were right: &quot;The Skin of Our Teeth&quot; is obviously inspired by and much indebted to FW (it is probably going too far to call the play an adaptation of Joyce's novel), and anyone doing what Wilder did today would be accused of plagiarism and be sued (and lose).That said, the play can still hold the stage, although it is not as good a play as &quot;Our Town,&quot; which uses the same modernist, fantastical conventions to much stronger effect. Does anyone actually read &quot;The Skin of Our Teeth&quot; these days, or do they buy the three-play book just for &quot;Our Town&quot;?"},{"Title":"Three plays: Our town, The skin of our teeth, The matchmaker","review":"Thorton Wilder is one of the best playrights of his generation. This book brings together three of his best plays. &quot;Our Town&quot; which is a play centered around one town, and the way life can change within it. &quot;the Skin of Our Teeth&quot;, which centers around one family that is going through all the changes that have ever happened in the world, including the ice age, world war 2, the depression, and so on. And finally &quot;the Matchmaker&quot; which is not the best play, but is still worth reading. Thorton Wilder does an amazing job with character developments and sub-plots, and these three plays really show his genius."},{"Title":"Three plays: Our town, The skin of our teeth, The matchmaker","review":"Thornton Wilder's reputation as a playwright rests upon three works: the 1938 drama OUR TOWN; the 1943 comedy THE SKIN OF OUR TEETH; and the 1955 THE MATCHMAKER, a farce re-written from a previously failed play titled THE MERCHANT OF YONKERS. The first two of these titles won Pulitzer Prizes; the final title would go on to become the basis for the musical comedy HELLO, DOLLY!, one of the most popular Broadway shows of the 20th Century.Although its \\"out of town\\" opening was nothing short of a debacle, OUR TOWN first charmed and then stunned audiences and critics alike when it reached New York--partly through Wilder's staging concepts (the play is performed on a bare stage and without scenery or hand props) but most particularly through Wilder's delicate story of an ordinary New Hampshire town in the earliest part of the 20th Century. In the first act we become acquainted with the Gibbs and Webb families; in the second act we learn how George Gibbs and Emily Webb come to fall in love and marry. It is charming, guiless stuff--until the third act brings us the town cemetery, where the dead contemplate the nature of life, death, and eternity.Written in the darkest days of World War II, THE SKIN OF OUR TEETH is a proto-absurdist comedy about an \\"everyman\\" family: Mr. and Mrs. Antrobus, their son Henry, their daughter Gladys, and their sultry housemaid Sabina, who live in middleclass comfort in New Jersey. But it is also, most curiously, the middle of the ice age! As the play progresses, Wilder drags the Antrobus family from Noah's flood to the aftermath of an apocalyptic, global war--even as the actors break ranks, dispute the merits of the play, refuse to play scenes, and are sent rushing to the hospital with food poisoning. Can they finish the show? More to the point, can the human race survive?THE MATCHMAKER is, of course, the famous story of Dolly Gallegher Levi--a busybody who is determined to marry the wealthy Horace Vandergelder. But Horace is stuffy; who wants a husband like that? By putting her hand in here and there, Dolly contrives to unstuff the stuffy, bring the unhappy lovers together, create two new romances, and do well by herself and all those around her.Wilder was not fond of realistic theatre and all three plays are similar in that they are styled in a very theatrical manner. As noted, OUR TOWN is done without scenery; in a classic production you can see the back wall of the stage itself. THE SKIN OF OUR TEETH is also highly stylized, with bits of the stage flying away and then reappearing, and in all three titles characters suddenly turn to speak to the audience directly--and now and then even emerge from the audience itself.All of this was very cutting edge for its time, but what really sets Wilder apart is his talent for mixing a slight story with a depth of poetry and theme that rarely occurs on the stage. His plays bring forth great, fundamental questions. What is eternity? What is the future of mankind? What is the nature of happiness? What is life worth--and can it be lived to any point or purpose? His responses are eloquent and more often light than dark.Samuel French Inc., which holds the amateur performance rights to all these titles, notes that OUR TOWN is performed at least once a day in some part of the world. It is generally regarded as the single best known play of American theatre. Although seldom performed in America today, THE SKIN OF OUR TEETH remains a landmark drama--and is very popular indeed in Europe and most particularly in Germany. And THE MATCHMAKER, although often outshined by its cousin HELLO, DOLLY! remains a favorite as well.These three plays are presented with a preface by John Guare. Frankly, they would be better left to speak for themselves. Guare seems a great deal less interested in Wilder than in his friends, and most particularly so in Gertrude Stein. The result is a bite of over-written and over-heated academia at its least impressive. Considerably better are the end notes by Tappan Wilder, which describe the original productions and the wider impact of each. But with or without foreword and end notes, these are three masterpieces by a master artist working at the height of his powers. American classics, all three.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Three plays: Our town, The skin of our teeth, The matchmaker","review":"Wonderful book with wonderful plays in it, a truly American Classic.

Wilder wrote \\"Our Tow\\"n because he grew tired of playwrights and replying more on staging and effects than on the imagination of both the actors and the audience -- words that could be applied to Broadway today.

A great read."},{"Title":"The Bible in Spain (Everyman's library)","review":"This is a rambling but amusing autobiographical tale of George Borrow, as he meanders through Portugal, Spain, Gibralter, and the Barbary Coast. Although his ostensible mission is to distribute New Testaments (not full Bibles), it is clear he is also going out of his way to amuse himself. Borrow speaks virtually every language, and, as such, manages to travel through a country torn by civil war and rampant banditry without ever getting in serious trouble (his impisonment for distributing testaments not withstanding).Unfortunately, this volume printed by IndyPublish.com is clearly a download from Project Guternberg or another website. It has CAPITALS where it should have italics, the formatting is poor for a reading book (gaps between the paragraphs rather than indents), and, most offensive, instead of a few passages in Greek, it has the words [Greek text which cannot be reproduced.] There are a dozen typographic errors. The margins are poorly laid out (the bottom margin should be larger than the top, not the other way around). Frankly, it looks almost as if the publisher didn't even proof the copy before sending it to press.This volume is NOT worth the cover price. If you can find it published by any other source, the book is worth reading. If not, download it and read it that way -- at least you won't have the affront of having paid good money for a lazily produced volume."},{"Title":"The Bible in Spain (Everyman's library)","review":"I read the Bible in Spain immediately after reading Lavengro and Romany Rye. While I find that particular characters and anecdotes were actually more powerful than those in Lavengro etc, the book on the whole was rather poor and worthy of neither the author, nor the tales he recounts. There were extremely boring rants against &quot;papists&quot; at every opportunity, for one thing. But, if I remember correctly, Borrow even said he was aware of these faults in the introduction; it was one of his earlier works, and he said he wrote it in seclusion based on the many letters he had sent to the Bible Society (for whom he was working at the time); I think he had either lost steam by the time he wrote the book, or else he was unsure how to procede and leant too heavily on the letters. In any case, the book certainly reads like a report, besides the odd sketch--that is otherworldly and unforgettable, but suddenly ends, and doesn't really relate to the narrative, which jumps abo! ut without reason.In short, if you read Lavengro and Romany Rye and couldn't get enough of them, then this book is worth it; I have read none of his others, (besides dipping into Wild Wales, which I also found dull) so I don't know if another would be better. Also, if you're really obsessed with Catholicism in the Mediteranean or Spain during that civil war, then you'll enjoy this book. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend it."},{"Title":"The Bible in Spain (Everyman's library)","review":"Borrow travels all over Spain in the early 19th century with the aim of selling and setting up the printing of bibles to give the Spanish the holy word without any Catholic inter mediation.

The only quibble I have is with a statement on 'The witches sabbats' (as the chapter is called) where Baker states that Yule is one of the greater sabbats and Samhain one of the lesser, when it is in fact the other way around. Other than that, the info was practical and mostly accurate.Blessings."},{"Title":"Spells for Teenage Witches","review":"This book is a waste of time for ANYONE thinking of reading it, and somewhat dangerous as well. \\"Get your way with magical power?\\" Sorry, but Sabrina the Teenage Witch is a TV show and should stay that way. The spells are COMPLETELY impractical - where is your average teenager working a minimum wage job, if at all, going to find all of these oils, specially colored candles, and other items, not to mention be able to afford them? And nail clippings/bits of hair? Come on, there might as well be eye of newt and toe of frog in there too, if we're supposed to be THAT cliche.Not only that, but the book is just an index of spells. There is absolutely NOTHING in the book regarding safety, and barely lip service paid to a true introduction to witchcraft and paganism. The only partially useful thing in the book is the color correspondence chart, which should still be taken with a grain of salt, as it's not entirely accurate. This is a dabbler's book, and as such, should not be a book at all."},{"Title":"Love for Sale: The Words and Pictures of Barbara Kruger","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Love for Sale: the Words and Pictures of Barbara Kruger. It was very interesting to see the wide variety of topics that she covers in her art. Some of the statements she makes can sometimes be difficult to admit or to bring up, but she boldly states the truth of the matter. I highly reccommend this book to art students, as I am, because I think it teaches us a lesson on being brave in stating our message and opinions. Barbara Kruger is my hero, and after looking at this book, she'll be yours, too."},{"Title":"Love for Sale: The Words and Pictures of Barbara Kruger","review":"If you're not afraid to explore the darker areas of self (especially if you're a male) Kruger's work probes deep into the psyche of late 20th century patriarchal consumerism and the values of the dominant culture.Whether you love photography or love critical theory, Kruger will delight you and disturb your idea of self as you are dazzled by starkly arranged works that appear to read you instead of you reading them."},{"Title":"Love for Sale: The Words and Pictures of Barbara Kruger","review":"Barbara Kruger's art, often pairing appropriated black &amp; white photos with blocks of bold-faced type, has appeared on billboards, bus placards, posters, t-shirts and even shopping bags. She's big on circulating her stuff outside of conventional venues such as galleries and exhibits. This book showcases her brilliant work with plenty of full-page plates as well as photos of her installations and projects. There's a brief introduction covering her early design work for &quot;Mademoiselle&quot; magazine in the '60s and for various book covers in the '70s, up through her progression into the art world by the '80s. The pages of text are accompanied by assorted quotes from a variety of individuals (Edgar Allen Poe, Mae West, Sandra Bernhard). The influence of Kruger's stuff continues to turn up. Her work has been lifted for music videos (Motley Crue, Rage Against The Machine) and album covers (Snog, Consolidated), and her style is commonly imitated by lazy advertisers. This collection is an impressive and inspiring look at her career and her contribution to the world of art and design."},{"Title":"Love for Sale: The Words and Pictures of Barbara Kruger","review":"&quot;LOVE FOR SALE&quot; THE WORDS AND PICTURES OF BARBARA KRUGER, is a ~must~ for anyone concerned with modern art, these days!

Bockris is obviously a huge fan of the Velvet Underground and much of Reed's solo work, and his book covers seemingly every aspect of Reed's life. A couple dozen people, not including Reed but including many people who knew him well, were interviewed for this book. Every album and every available detail, lurid or otherwise, about Reed's personal life gets written up. The Lou Reed that emerges is not a pleasant person, but a fascinating and brilliant one nevertheless. With all that said, the book's flaws are many. Bockris, like Reed, seems to be an extremely perverse individual, which perhaps explains his fascination with Reed. His misstatements of fact are frequent (he says Brian Jones was murdered, and that Peter Laughner was the lead singer of Pere Ubu), leading one to suspect that many of the details he provides about Reed are not quite true either. At occasional junctures he says things that he seems not to really mean -- for example, that John Cale's solo albums are a better body of work than Reed's, or that Albert Goldman was the leading American rock critic of the 1970s -- probably just for the sake of being perverse. Still, for longtime followers of Reed's career, the book is riveting; and as a full-length biography of Reed, it has no substitute."},{"Title":"Transformer: The Lou Reed Story","review":"This book is far superior to Doggett's \\"Growing up in Public\\". I recently read them both. Just wanted to help out if anyone was deciding between the two."},{"Title":"Transformer: The Lou Reed Story","review":"Lou Reed has used his songwriting and sociopathic P.R. persona to tell the world more than anyone could have wanted to know about a middle-class Jewish kid from Long Island who just happened to revolutionize rock'n'roll. So why does the world need another soon-to-be remaindered rock-bio?Two reasons. One: Reed changed his personalities more often than his underwear, contradicting himself and opening as many mysteries as he solved. Two: Victor Bockris has done a damn fine job of playing Boswell to Reed's drugged-out bisexual Dr. Johnson. Collating endless reviews, interviews, and other views of Reed's life and work, Bockris has used his considerable literary skill to form a coherent, insightful narrative from Reed's often incoherent chaos of a life.Bockris has an authorial voice that's lively yet restrained; his writing takes a back seat to the biography, but his brisk style and intelligence are worthy of Reed, America's most literary rock star. Rock journalism needs a Victor Bockris almost as much as rock music needs a Lou Reed."},{"Title":"Transformer: The Lou Reed Story","review":"It's unfortunate that a really good biography of Lou Reed hasn't been written, since that means fans are left with meanspirited revenge peaces like this one. Not that it doesn't have a lot of good information, but it's interwoven with the author's unmasked hatred, repeatedly calling his subject names (\\"lizard-like\\" stands out). I mean, is it really so difficult to understand why even as an adult somebody still might be a bit upset with his parents about subjecting him to intensive and damaging electroshock treatments to \\"cure\\" antisocial and homosexual tendencies, no matter how \\"well-intentioned\\" they were? I mean, considering that Bockris has written his own \\"Mommy Dearest,\\" apparently because a rock star was somewhat dismissive of him in an interview (dutifully excerpted in the book, as if in explanation of all that preceded it), I don't know how he can possible fault anyone else's resentment.And, apparently, he's written a similar hatchet job on Patti Smith (though his biography of Keith Richards was, I must admit, pretty good. Perhaps Keef shared his drugs with poor Victor?)"},{"Title":"Transformer: The Lou Reed Story","review":"This remains the best bio of Reed. Don't be discouraged by the three-star average rating, which is simply the result of fans' resentment at a critical examination of their hero.This book view of Lou Reed is not pretty, but is unsurprising to anyone familiar with his history and his own account of himself in interviews, where he regularly appeared as self-aggrandising and insecure (although without seeming to realise it ...)Anyway, his character deficiencies needn't undermine your appreciation of his music.The book has some marvellous anecdotes and insights, for example, relating to the woman who inspired several classic VU songs and an amusing attempted interview by Lou Reed of Vaclav Havel. (Clue: the rock star thought himself more important than a mere head of government. Havel terminated the interview as Lou was clearly too incompetent to perform it.)"},{"Title":"Transformer: The Lou Reed Story","review":"A good biography provides insight into its subject and how that person became who he or she is or was. A good biography gives the reader a sense of the time and place in which its subject lived and worked, and how those things influenced the individual and his or her work. Bockris' book accomplishes very little of this, and is primarily a compendium of select gossip arranged in chronological order: no research is evident beyond endnote references to (not citations of) previously published articles and interviews, various unnamed sources, and quotations that may or may not have come from discussions the author had with the speakers; the lack of annotations further diminishes Bockris' credibility. This doesn't make it a \\"bad\\" book, but anyone about to invest the time to trot through the book's 400+ pages deserves to know what they're in for. Which is......an account of Lou Reed that deliberately and cloyingly focuses on and emphasizes the most lurid details of the man's existence: dope, a nasty personality, a wildly inconsistent career, and his sexuality. To be fair to Bockris, he does seem truly to admire Lou Reed and his music, but apparently realized he needed to have some angle for his book to help it sell--too bad he took the easy way out. To be fair to the reader, Bockris' writing is often tedious and repetitive, and rife with plain, old-fashioned factual errors.My two primary frustrations with the book are these: Reed is presented as a one-dimensional nasty, immature, and selfish character--so what? Most rock stars are probably the same; most ordinary folk too. There simply has to be a lot more to Lou Reed than this, and I wish I knew what. Secondly, Bockris presents Reed as a dope fueled, speed freak from the mid-60s through the 1970s. The problem with this assessment--however accurate it may be--is that the Velvet Underground produced at least two of the 60s' most important records, and Reed as a solo musician created AT LEAST three or four of the most important rock albums of the 70s. Quantitatively, that puts Reed up there, arguably, with only the Beatles, Led Zeppelin, and the Stones--not bad company! (A qualitative assessment of 60s and 70s bands would be much more inclusive, but that's not the issue at hand). Additionally, Reed toured every year from '72-'78. Again, there's got to be a whole lot more to the man than personlity crises, speed-injected veins, and a wavering sexual orientation.Ultimately, reading the biography was like reading a cheap celebrity magazine (or a \\"dirty French novel\\"!): our desire for dirty details is gratified tremendously, but any hope to understand the person is sorely disappointed."},{"Title":"Transformer: The Lou Reed Story","review":"great inside in who is lou reed, the hard copy is a great product and not very expensive, is a really joy to read the book , it starts from lou child hood to almos 2005 i think"},{"Title":"Transformer: The Lou Reed Story","review":"Seriously.

It gives insight into his approach to music and relationships with his band members and life style.Reed is revealed as a rather dark character, with a real romantic soul."},{"Title":"Transformer: The Lou Reed Story","review":"Victor Bockris' exhaustive (and exhausting) bookon Lou Reed takes 400+ pages to paint a portraitof someone who seems basically unknowable. Likemost of rock's private geniuses, Lou has a flairfor lying, and a knack for being all things to allpeople at all times. The overlying theme seems tobe that Reed is an insecure jerk who chews uppeople and spits them out.THe fact of the matter is.... So What. Bockrisdidn't do much interviewing of Lou to inform hisbook. (Not that the cryptic, game playing Louwould ever give you a straight interview) Forthose of us who love his music the book is a shallowreference point. We hear about a jerk, but aregiven no insight as to how his life and lifestylesreflected in the work he produced. Bockris isnot a rock critic, and seems not to base his opinionsof the music on what other have said.What we are left with is 400 pages describing theunsavory people Lou hung out with and how hetreated them. The booklets that came with Lou'sboxed set and the VU boxed sets were moreenlightening. Save your money and buy thoseinstead."},{"Title":"Transformer: The Lou Reed Story","review":"Heed this, lest ye venture any further in vain. Lou Reed did not participate in this \\"biography\\" whatsoever. After reading it, I can't ever imagine why. Oh, I'm sure Louie boy is every bit the egomaniacal jerk Bockris portrays him as. Sharing many similarities in background with Messier Reed, it's often difficult not to be, what with the mass of morons that pollute our common air, coming and going and breeding as they please. Bockris lays on the trashy gossip thick, particularly where it concerns Lou's relationship with transvestite Rachel, and the methamphetamine circle that mocked him as he lapped up the abuse for a hit. There are moments of Lou-ney humor here and there, mostly extracted from interviews dating back to the \\"Transformer/Berlin\\" days. Lou envisions Sinatra singing \\"Heroin\\" at the Sands, and spins tales of a groupie who complained about Mick Jagger's lack of sexual prowess in the middle of getting it on with him. If that sort of thing amuses you, as it does me, then sure, grab a copy. If you really want to peek into Lou's skull, and few would sanely dare, just listen to his albums. The Rock 'N Roll Animal's music is where his soul is at."},{"Title":"Transformer: The Lou Reed Story","review":"Don't buy this book. It is a complete waste of money and an even bigger waste of time. It made me wonder why Bockris wasted his time writing a 400+ page book about someone he obviously doesn't like. The only thing this book does is make Lou look like a jerk, and the only subjects it touches on is how he was taking drugs, and how he hated his parents, and how bad he was treating his first wife Betty, and then Sylvia. His music is never even mentioned. I wonder how much of this book was really true, because Bockris never interviewed Lou, Mrs. Reed, or anybody else for the book. In fact, if I remember correctly, my Velvet Underground Companion book had an article from back when Bockris was writing this book, Lou was against it, but Bockris said he was going to write this with or without Lou's cooperation. The only reason Lou cooperated, was because Sterling Morrison convinced him to go along with it. This makes me wonder if that had anything to do about the way Lou is portrayed in this book. Bottom line: don't waste your money, because all this book is is a bunch of gossip, and it doesn't do his music justice."},{"Title":"Transformer: The Lou Reed Story","review":"When I finished &quot;Transformer&quot;, it leaves me a bad taste that Bockris was kinda foe of Reed, that he really hates him. The book tries to glance Reed from the outside, not getting very involved in nothing, but describing coldly all the bad things that Reed has done. If you dont know anything about Reed music, this book is very boring. If you have enjoyed his work, this books dissapoint you, gives you the impression that Lou is just an asshole with nothing to do but drink or snort drugs. Bockris avoid every sensibility that Lou may put in every one of his albums, just making poor critics of the technical aspects or what the press said. Unfortunately, this is maybe the only biography of Reed, or at least the most complet. So if want to know more about this great poet and composer, you must read this, although it has a great lack of passion and compassion for Lou."},{"Title":"Should You Read Shakespeare?

Despite the name changes and detail alterations that completely hide all but the most obvious characters, were there any revelations so damning that only anonymity could protect the storyteller? This leaves the reader wondering if the story had any truth at all or was merely a anti-clinton text designed partly for smudging the legacy of the Presdient.As for the quality fo the tale, it has little to show for the sake of integrity. There are episodes of the West Wing that are more realisitic than the scenes in Primary Colors. The theme itself falls into the trap of suggesting that no politician can move onto the national stage without having some dark secret that opens the doors. Anyone who knows the secret and can expose it is thus subject to being a target for the incoming administration. Hence follows a series of ridiculous conspiracies.All in all Primary Colors was a more entertaining movie than a book. It is targeted at a less studious electorate but holds forth just enough truthiness to affect public opinion."},{"Title":"Primary Colors","review":"This novel was based on a presidential primary campaign from the 1990's. It follows the campaign of a southern governor who is smart, inspirational, and surrounded by personal scandal. What is does well: it creates a realistic view of the excitement, frenzy, idealism, and cynicism of a presidential campaign. What it fails to do: it does not create characters of depth, ones that come alive on the page. The story is good, and the general atmosphere of campaign headquarters is very real and both funny and sad. If you like politics with all its dirt, or just want to know more about what campaigns are like, I recommend this novel."},{"Title":"Primary Colors","review":"Was more fun when no one knew who wrote it. Would encourage reading it before seeing the movie so you can picture the protagonist as Clinton rather than Travolta!"},{"Title":"Primary Colors","review":"Although this is hardly a brilliant novel, it makes a fine reading for us fans of politics; it was a nice light Holidays reading for me.I liked it more than the film although it shares one good feature with the film: together with the hero/young black aid, the reader/viewer is sucked into the magnetic power of politics, ideology and personal charms...This book is not an attack on the Clintons (although the characters are obviously based on them and their circle) because the very same political rules obviously apply in the era when educated \\"half-black\\" hero Henry Burton became president and the Clintons are forced into supporting roles.One of the fun trivia bits - Joe Klein (a.k.a. anonymous) wrote one of the characters for Kathy Bates to portray it in the eventual film version (which she did)."},{"Title":"Primary Colors","review":"Henry Burton--a Democrat too young for Kennedy, unfamiliar with magic--is our entree into the psychodrama-filled world of the Clintonian Jack and Susan Stanton. Libby Holden a \\"gay lesbian woman\\" (in her own words) hilariously and then tragically embodies the wildest swings of our adoration and disappointment with the Baby Boomer power couple.Klein in parts of Primary Colors demonstrates a better feel for character (\\"Her strength in the face of this embarrassment was strange. She was drawing attention to her perfection, which only served to remind people of her husband's imperfection--it was, I realized, a vengeful act\\"), dialogue, meaningful plot development, a good turn of phrase (\\"It felt like the quiet scene just before the monster comes\\"), and literary imagery (\\"the roadsides were the color of a squeezed fingertip\\") than many full-time novelists.However, what makes the underrated Nichols/May film adaptation even better than its source material is that it is an undiluted love story between a nation and the Clintons. Nichols doesn't bore us with a single relationship conversation or scene between Henry and ad guru Daisy--hilariously we just see them in bed together when Henry gets a campaign crisis call. It's a great visual joke--this is just a campaign romance, not to supersede the one between candidate and country.Reading this novel makes one appreciate their restraint even further as Klein's obsession with the exceptionally stupid love story between Daisy and Henry knocks him two stars. About 40% of the way through the book the Stantons disappear, with Jack, our once \\"larger than life\\" politician reemerging every so often as an angry, uncharismatic boss who spouts the profanity-laden obvious.Instead, we get lots of this: \\"...we don't have to talk about it anymore, Henry. Or say any of the words. We can wait till this is over and we can think clearly, but I'm really feeling kind of quivery and gelatinous over you.\\"There is very little great in Primary Colors the movie that was not lifted directly from Klein's book. You've got to be truly brilliant to have Nichols and May steal from you verbatim. But how could he not see that the real love story was between Henry/America and the Stantons/Clintons?"},{"Title":"Primary Colors","review":"This was a good read and is interesting to read at this time when we have news of candidates inundating the airwaves and newspapers, not to mention the bloggers busily adding their two cents worth."},{"Title":"Primary Colors","review":"I don't follow politics too much. (I haven't voted in about twenty years.) Yet, I still cannot believe that someone running for President of the U.S., and his wife, could act the way Jack and Susan Stanton do in this novel.They are just too human. Jack swears a lot and is profligate. Susan has sex with the narrator, Henry Burton, and uses \\"dirty\\" politics to make sure her husband wins.Henry Burton is the child of a white mother and a black father, who abandons him and her and becomes an ex-patriot, more or less, in Africa, Egypt, somewhere? This man, Henry's father, is the son of a grand old man in the Civil Rights movement, someone like MLK.Being of mixed racial heritage, Henry is neither here nor there, and seems to waft around the Democratic primary as a deputy to Governor Jack Stanton, almost like an unseen spirit. Well, that's what a good novel narrator should do: waft around unseen, being everywhere the action is and nowhere in his own mind.Henry does have an inner life, maybe too much of one for this type of a political novel. In the end, he falls in love (with Daisy, another Stanton helper) and listens to Jack plead with him to stay in the campaign. Most of the primaries are over by this time, but Jack is not yet sure he'll be able to run on the Democratic ticket.I found the first two-thirds of this book interesting. I learned about how a political campaign might have been run in 1992, when William J. Clinton was running. I know this novel is said to be a rom&aacute;n a clef, where the characters are based on actual people. This did tend to make it more interesting.I know John Travolta played Stanton in the subsequent movie, which I didn't see.And, I can tell that the author, Joe Klein, Anonymous, infused what he thought was a climax in the last third of the book, filled with emotion, a suicide, a moral test for the Stantons and for Henry, and a reconciliation between Henry and his loved one. To me, these add-ons, though good certainly for the cinema plot, reeked of fakery, in the book version.I can't believe Libby Holden would commit suicide because she lost faith in the Stantons. Libby is the \\"dust buster,\\" played by Kathy Bates in the movie, a perfect role fit, it would seem.For a biracial kid whose father left him when he was ten years old, Henry seems very well adjusted, better than most of the other characters in this book.That seems somewhat unrealistic, too, that Henry, a young man at that, could be more mature, more thoughtful, and more humane, than the presidential candidate, the candidate's wife, the other politicos here and there on all sides, and so forth.Anyway, what's reality? Bill Clinton has come and gone, but this novel lives on, at least for a few years more. After that, who knows? It had its 15 minutes of fame, just as he did. What more can we ask of them?Diximus."},{"Title":"Primary Colors","review":"Reading Primary Colors, a &#34;novel&#34; about a cerain Southern state governor who is handsome and charismatic with a wandering eye for the ladies, and running for the presidency, is almost like an alternative universe version of re-living Bill Clinton's successful run in 1991. It's almost Clinton, but not quite, just enough different to perhaps avoid any possible legal entanglements. But the aw-shucks, grinning, candidate who has such a powerful and personal contact with people, his brainy and steel-willed wife (Hilary's clone?) are penatrating portraits of fictional people who bare a startling resemblence to Bill and Hilary. Did our governor have an affair with this woman, and get this black girl pregnant? You'll have to read this witty and literate version of what may or may not have transpired during the governor's run for the presidency. It's a fun, light-hearted read that still conveys a lot about the govrenor's ethics, morals and vision for America. Very recommended for people who enjoy reading about politicans and the often nasty and always intriguing business of politics."},{"Title":"Primary Colors","review":"I read Primary Colors a few years ago and enjoyed it tremendously.Sharp, keenly observed political games and recognisable characters if you want to transpose them for their real-life alternatives.I loved it."},{"Title":"Primary Colors","review":"First read the book when it came out and loved it. I love the movie and the more I watched it the more I wanted to re-read the book. Excellent read."},{"Title":"Primary Colors","review":"My relationship with this book is a mixture of happenstance and serendipity.I heard of Primary Colors when it came out in 1996. I didn't get round to buying it then. Shortly thereafter - in 1998 - a film starring John Travolta and Emma Thompson was made of the book. Shortly thereafter, I was taking a trans-Atlantic flight and the film was shown. It was amusing enough to keep me awake but not amusing enough to make me want to buy the book. So I didn't buy the book. (Moral: always read the book before watching the film).This year, my wife and I found ourselves in Washington State. On a pleasant little side-trip along Highway 101, we were in need of a good breakfast. We stopped off at 'The Tides Family Restaurant,' near Hoodsport, a small community in Mason County. We had a very good breakfast, lasting a couple of hours and consisting of good food and fine company. We were sated. We then noticed a small book case with second-hand books for sale and marked at a dollar each. In amongst the books on show was a very good hardback edition of Primary Colors. We got it. So, if my wife and I had not been loitering on a July Saturday morning in Washington State, if we had not been hungry, if we had not happened upon 'The Tides Family Restaurant' and if we had not had a dollar to spare, we would not have bought Primary Colors nor would I have enjoyed a book that is so, so much better than the film, nor would I be reviewing it for Amazon from back home in England after having read it into the wee small hours with amusement, fascination and admiration for the author's (the one-time 'Anonymous' but now known to be Joe Klein, a controversial but respected political author and blogger) skill in concocting a plot that bears sufficient kinship to real life and the real politics of the early 1990s and that is utterly riveting. As the author says, in a preface note, 'None of these events ever happened.' And, of course, Governor Jack Stanton and his wife, Susan, didn't exist either. Nor did Governor Stanton win the Democratic nomination for the presidency in 1992. Or did he?Perhaps I should warn readers of a sensitive disposition that the story-line is racy and that the dialogue is often crude. Despite the foregoing, I loved the book and recommend it to all who appreciate a steamy political tale told with the skill of a literary genius.And, if you, dear reader, are ever in need of a good meal whilst travelling on Highway 101 in Washington State, stop by 'The Tides Family Restaurant' for first-class food and for another good book.

A great strength of the book is its organization which digs deeply first into strengthening our inner practice through a daily spiritual discipline and dissolving our fears. The second half of the book speaks to how we can then take this inner strength and use it to deepen personal relationships with spouses, significant others, children, and friends. What also makes this book so powerful are the &quot;practice&quot; sections at the end of each chapter which give the reader a practical way of incorporating spiritual disciplines and ideas into your life. The author also has an uncanny way of dissecting and blowing apart all of the excuses we make to avoid spiritual practices. The author does all of this however, while still being quite modest and sharing the various struggles that he and his family has had. The motivational clarification that the book contains on page 31 alone is worth the cost of the whole book."},{"Title":"It's a Meaningful Life: It Just Takes Practice","review":"Bo's latest is even clearer and more poignant than his earlier books. In this latest spiritual guide Bo provides insight and valuable complementary exercises to make the reading all that more powerful and effective.What truly amazes me is how Bo can keep writing with such relevance and power and yet never repeat his earlier books (which I also felt excelled in relevance and power...).Rather than read as a novel, I've treated this as a workbook, savoring each point and companion exercise and then moving to the next one."},{"Title":"It's a Meaningful Life: It Just Takes Practice","review":"This is a rare, exceptional book that combines thoughtful, evenhanded scholarship with practical applications. The book does a superb job of highlighting some of the common denominators present in various world religions and translating these beliefs and tenets into sound guidance for people of all faiths.

For years he has lived the way for prisoners and now he brings a broader path into the view of those of us who are doing our time on the outside.

Bo has created an amazingly accessible, insightful, and practical spiritual handbook as a commentary on modern society and the human condition. In a world of increasingly negative values, Bo writes simply and elegantly of what it takes to live a 'meaningful life'. Originally, a collection of his compiled essays, the 'chapters' are fairly short and direct. I enjoy reading them to my young children aloud, and try to discuss the chapters afterward, as a way to impart practical thoughtful spirituality in my children against the backdrop they live in societally of the secular modern decline in family and spiritual values. These are timeless truths for us all, and hope Bo's inspiring words will spread widely, and as he says, help us thru his wisdom to 'ennoble the human race rather than to diminish it' ... and I recommend this book unconditionally!"},{"Title":"It's a Meaningful Life: It Just Takes Practice","review":"For me this book was inspirational and a book to keep on my bookshelf. The author writes about everyday struggles in human life. From our spiritual side to our community service side, which is just as important. Spirituality is not an option for us and if we desire to live a more peaceful life, community service is a must. Bo puts into perspective things we've heard before \\"It's not the top, It's the climb\\" and daily prayer and meditation are good for the soul. Taking time every day for silence connects us with our creator. I like the marriage stories about Bo and his wife Sita. Letting go of the trivial and seeing the human side of our partner and working together towards community service is Bo's message. Bo writes about awareness in all things from our material goods to our spiritual well-being. He mixes daily life with our higher purpose. In each chapter Bo gives spiritual and practical exercises we can do each day to be aware of our human side and how we can peacefully interact with each other. A down to earth book which is easy to read and comprehend and apply to our daily life. Reading this book gave me insights to daily living, the busyness we tend to, and the interacting with others through community service, friendship, and family relations."},{"Title":"The Dreadful Future of Blossom Culp","review":"BOOK BLURB: 14-year old psychic Blossom Culp isn't looking forward to life in high school. Thanks to stuck-up Letty Shambaugh, Blossom's not included in the class Halloween project, so she can't help transform Old Man Leverette's place into a haunted house. What's worse is, Letty has her sights set on handsome Alexander Armsworth. Wanting to get back at Letty, Blossom secretly explores the eerie house with Alexander.Suddenly everything goes berserk, and Blossom's hurled from 1914 into a time warp. Through her psychic powers Blossom's found a new way into the future, where she's surrounded by Valley Girls and computers. But will those powers work in reverse?"},{"Title":"The Dreadful Future of Blossom Culp","review":"I've read all four books in this series, and this is the one I like least.I can see why Peck chose to follow up on \\"Ghosts I Have Been\\" (the best, in my and probably most others' opinion). Readers and his publishers were probably hounding him for a sequel...and that's the most likely explanation for why this is so poor! It must have been written under duress, is all I can figure.The tone of the other three installments is lost here, crushed under the weight of slapstick and gratuitous .... (Blossom ogling Alexander at the swimming hole? P-lease!) The 1984 sequence doesn't stand out as an anomaly, the way it should: everything leading up to it has been a painfully obvious parallel. And Peck also cheaps out, in my opinion, by only showing the extremes of the '80s lifestyle.When I first read this, it had just been released, and I was 14. As such, I could totally feel Blossom's pain when Alexander starts courting Letty. But now, at 33, I have to wonder if he's worth losing a minute's sleep over. In GIHB, he and Blossom were a year or so too young for any serious romantic leanings (although there was a bit of foreshadowing when a character points out that if Alexander gets caught in Blossom's room, he'll have some 'splainin' to do), but they were definitely friends. Now, I can understand that a year later, when he starts to Notice Girls, that he might be swayed by Letty, who is more conventional, but that doesn't excuse his extreme rudeness towards Blossom.And not just rudeness. In one case, he's either a cold-hearted SOB or the most base coward ever. Throughout the 1984 sequence, I assumed that it would be one of those deals where Blossom would return to 1914 just a few seconds past the time she left. But the same amount of time elapsed in both eras: she was gone for a night and a day. Meanwhile, Alexander just took off as soon as she disappeared, which is bad enough, but when they meet up again, he never shows one iota of concern for what happened to her! No \\"Glad you're okay\\", not even \\"So what happened?\\" For all he knew, she might have never have come back at all. What a jerk.I'd say skip this one, as it adds nothing to the series. The next one is okay, but only if you accept that Peck hit the reset button."},{"Title":"The Dreadful Future of Blossom Culp","review":"Blossom writes a wonderful story, much better than when Peck was writing as the \\"boy next door\\".

I know there is a controversy over teaching literature in ENG 101 and this is not a literary collection. Indeed, the selections are well rounded.I approach teaching this class with several concerns foremost in my mind:The poor vocabularies of today's young people.The inadequate knowledge of science among the same group.The manner in which discussions of history are conducted in this country.The fact that so little literature is read by far too many of today's students.The death of the sophomore literature survey course (Romantic Poets, Elizabethan Drama, Contemporary Drama, 19th C. American Literature, etc.)I selected this book because it has selections on science, history and politics as well as memoirs and classics (Jonathan Swift's A Modest Proposal).101 is the introduction to college writing and the course that teaches students how to research. I offer the students 8 choices of what I call projects, books which should serve as the basis for their research paper as well as for a compare and contrast paper (one of three essays). This semester, I offered them Shakespeare's 12th Night; The Short Stories of Eudora Welty; The Narrative of Frederick Douglass; Brave New World; Nineteen Eighty-Four; Poems of Love; the Ramona Quimby novels of Beverly Cleary, and Ever Since Darwin by Stephen Jay Gould. The idea is to offer substance and choice; stimulate thought and dialog; familiarize them with history and science; look ahead to potential teaching careers and more.I do not teach a political point of view. No responsible teacher should. That Buscemi and Smith included opposing views on global warming and social responsibility is wonderful. But, I do have problems with two of the essays, both in the cause and effect section. One is by Shelby Steele and the other by Barbara Dafoe Whitehead. As both authors represent a conservative point of view, I would love to have the students read these essays. Steele's old essay, written in 1990, displays his anger and his conservative politics. Are these teenaged students sophisticated enough to tease out that his stance stems from both? Whitehead's piece earned from me the same criticism that others have leveled at the organization she co-directs, the National Marriage Project: that some of her (its) claims are not substantiated. Recognizing her tendency toward strawman arguments, I can choose to ignore her work, and, I probably will. However, I could pair it the Jonathan Kozal essay offered in the argument section of the book (and with a couple of selected installments of Mad Men, if I had the time), but. . . is there a value in offering an example of bad writing? That is the crux of the matter, isn't it?So, why did Buscemi and Smith offer a flawed, incendiary piece (Steele's) and a sloppily written piece in an otherwise excellent anthology?"},{"Title":"75 Readings: An Anthology","review":"This collections of essays pack loads of different styles and ideas.

In order to clear her grandfather and herself from these accusations Keira is now forced to travel to Puerto Azul to locate a very special statue which is said to have great power when both pieces are fitted together. Even worse she's forced to work with Zane. Zane had desired Keira from the moment he first saw her but he doesn't trust easily and the fact that Keira is suspected of illegal dealings makes it doubly hard for him.

My course came with the web based course also. I went over the web based course and used this book. The book did have quite a few misprints, but overall it was fine. It went throgh all of the major objectives of the test. The best use of my money was to also get the practice exam from sun. Alot of the questions were very similar to the actual test. These three methods enabled me to pass with an 89%. I wish there was an equivalent book for the System Administration 2 test."},{"Title":"Sun Certified System Administrator for Solaris 8 Study Guide","review":"I got this book expecting that it would cover the specifics of Sun-centric applications and tools that are on exam 1 and 2 (esspecially 2), like Sun Disk Suite, Enterprise Management and Sun Cluster related stuff. What I got instead is an overview of the basic Unix topics covered on test 1. If I needed a refresher on the \`ls\` command, I don't need to pay (money) when I can use \`man\` for that.If you are like me, a senior-ish SA who doesn't get that much exposure to the Sun Apps and OS based security tools, then this book will be a waste of your money. Don't buy it. There are a proliferation of websites out there that cover this info in as much or greater depth, so look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Sun Certified System Administrator for Solaris 8 Study Guide","review":"This book is a frustrating one to review, partly because the author did a credible job with 98% of the effort needed to write a good study guide, but failed with the final 2%. I might also note I just passed the first exam for the SCSA, and this book was helpful to that end. But I would feel sorry for anyone who relied on it to learn the Solaris operating system: the proof-reading and editing of this book were just not up to par. The author is a respected member of the Unix community and certainly knows his material. But, because of sloppy editing and inattention to detail, the reader will come across truly amazing facts. Just one example occurs in the section pertaining to cpio. There the reader will learn that,&quot;cpio performs three functions; they are:1. Copy in. cpio creates an archive. ...2. Copy out. cpio reads from an archive. ...&quot;As anyone familiar with this venerable Unix command knows, the copy out mode creates a cpio archive: the author has the meanings of copy in and copy out reversed. Later in the discussion he corrects his error, but the net effect is one of confusion to the reader. A second example is one could charitably be ascribed to a typo, except that it is repeated numerous times throughout the discussion: the book notes the role played by the vi configuration command &quot;set showmodes&quot;. vi has no such command- the correct option is &quot;showmode&quot;. A minor point perhaps, but indicative of the manner in which this book has been proofread and edited.The discussion of shells is quite cursory- probably acceptable given the book's purpose as a study guide, given that Sun, in its infinite wisdom, considers the vi command to be much more important than an understanding of shells when bestowing the SCSA certification. But author discusses only three shells: the Bourne, Korn, and C-Shell. Solaris 8 also comes with the tcsh and zsh shells, which the book fails to mention. In the book's defense, it may be that these shells are not addressed in the certification objectives.The author spends a considerable amount of ink- and risks drawing undue reader attention to- information lifted from man pages, particularly the more obscure options used on various commands. Now as one who prefers reading from a book than from a screen, I find it useful to have some of these options documented in printed text. But the author makes unsufficient effort to distinguish important options and those rarely used. Despite what one might hear to the contrary, my certification test, at least, did not cover the rarely used options. Much of this is material that a reader whose goal is to pass the certification test could dispense with, even though it could be useful a reference material.A final gripe- one that could easily have been corrected- appeared repeatedly thoughout this book. The organization follows a well-trod path of describing a command, then giving examples of the command in action, followed by a discussion of the examples. The examples were generally well-chosen, while the discussion frequently follows the format: &quot;the first example illustrates ... the seconds shows ... the third ...&quot;. Except by the times you have several examples, the reader may scratch his head wondering which examples pertains to the part of the discussion he is currently reading, particularly if he is reviewing the material. I suppose it would have been extra work to have made it easy for the reader to readily identify which example corresponded to a particular portion of the discussion.This reviewer also used the Syngress/Osborne book in his test preparation. It had far fewer of the irritating flaws, with less filler than this book. Moveover, the Syngress book has much more in the way of visual aids that make reading a book easier on the eye, and does a better job of pointing out things that are likely to trip up someone taking the cert test. The Syngress book also covers both SCSA exams, making it a better value in this reviewer's opinion. That said, this book does cover the material needed to pass the first of the Sun SCSA certification tests. If you read and absorb what is in this book, you should have no difficulty passing the exam. But the Syngress book is a better choice."},{"Title":"Sun Certified System Administrator for Solaris 8 Study Guide","review":"While the book did cover the necessary objectives as published by Sun Microsystems at time of printing for Solaris 8 (SunOS5.8), the title is misleading. Upon reading the title, the audience is led to think that the text reviews material covered by both Parts I and II of the Sun Certified System Administrator (SCSA) exam, and that is simply not so. The publication covers only Part I.In addition, it does so with some notable errors, misprints, and typographical errors. The review and editing of the text before publication must have been done with very cursory effort.In summary, money on a study guide for studying up on the material for the SunOS5.8 exams would be better spent on another publication. I have the greatest respect for Mr. Peter H. Gregory, but this book simply does not live up to his reputation nor Sun's endorsement of this volume as the official study guide.(By the way, the latest objectives for the exam, Parts I and II, are always available for review at:suned.sun.com/US/certification/solaris/solaris_exam_objectives.html.)"},{"Title":"Sun Certified System Administrator for Solaris 8 Study Guide","review":"Easy to read; well-organized and illustrated. Not just pictures of man pages; a definite asset for study for the first SCSA test. It covers the Sun objectives for the first test only - it tells you that on the back (not front) cover of the book.

It does not, however, address part 2, so I had to find a second resource, Ambro's &quot;Solaris 8 System Administrator Exam Cram&quot;, to study for the second part. I found Ambro's book also served as a very good study guide, and given that it addresses both parts 1 and 2, I would have to recommend it first if you only have the time or money for one reference."},{"Title":"Sun Certified System Administrator for Solaris 8 Study Guide","review":"As noted by a previous reviewer, the back cover notes for this book state that this is a study guide for part I only. Given that, this is quite a decent study guide for part I. In fact, I noted that two of the questions on the version of the exam I took were in this book, either verbatim, or so nearly so that it made no difference.There are a number of errors in this book, but given its length and that it's a first printing, I did not consider the number of errors to be excessive. I did note that there were two questions (out of a total of 57 on my exam) that involved a subject not directly covered by this book. (It's something any competent *nix admin should know, so don't worry.)I would further note that, as the author states in the book, it is intended to be a study guide for people who are already Solaris sysadmins; don't count on being able to take the exam after going through this book if you aren't.That said, part I of the exam should be relatively simple for anyone who has been a Solaris sysadmin for a while and claims to know it well. One only has to get 66% of the 57 questions correct on the Solaris 8 part I exam to pass, after all. As a point of reference, I've been a Solaris sysadmin for about 5 years, but in a professional sense for only less than 2 of those years. Solaris is one of the three flavors of *nix that I currently support. I believe (I hope this doesn't sound too big-headed) that I could've passed without using this study guide, but would not have scored nearly as well (missed 3 questions - scored 94% and finished the exam in 30 minutes out of the allowed 90 minutes)."},{"Title":"Sun Certified System Administrator for Solaris 8 Study Guide","review":"Everyone in the IT industry knows there is a huge difference between getting the certification and doing the job.

This book was very well thought out and extremely well written. It is safe to say that this is the only study guide I would buy. (...)"},{"Title":"Sun Certified System Administrator for Solaris 8 Study Guide","review":"One would think that a book titled \\"Sun Certified System Administrator Solaris 8 Study Guide\\" and backed with the offical Sun logo would satisfy a few basic criteria. First and foremost, it would be a Study Guide. It doesn't come close. Or that it would be a complete guide for both parts of the test. No, it only partially covers Part I.One would expect that as an offical Sun Press book, it would cover topics on the test. It doesn't. This book is nearly worthless to anyone that does not already have extensive knowledge of the subject matter. So, what is the point of purchasing a Study Guide if it does nothing towards study of the topic given?The testing certification subjects are pretty much covered in order when you take the actual test. They are not presented in order in the book. In fact, this book barely even discusses the topics for the test itself. It simply presents various commands and options a basic sysadmin might encounter. But, as far as the actual Solaris test is concerned, after page one, you might not even recognize the book is supposed to be a study guide for the test. It doesn't mention the test hardly at all.One review above mentioned that there were two whole questions that were sort of like what was on the test. I repect his opinion but geez... two WHOLE questions. Sort of. On a test that has 57 questions. You get two? Actually, there are a few... but nothing like what you would expect and should get in any decent true Study guide.All in all, save your money and buy ExamCram or something else. Heck, just buy the big honking Solaris 9 Complete Reference. This book would be excellent as a quick reference guide for a sysadmin that needs to know (quickly) the option used on a particular command.

It looks and feel good but the content is a little too brief. It is a bit expensive. Doesn't cover Part II. I notice there a lot of print error. Reader need to be careful when reading the book. The way it is structure is quite confusing, it try to reduce the pages so it combine those options together.

With his first book, Charles Chicarelli introduces the life story and teachings of Sakyamuni Buddha as depicted in paintings, sculptures and other works of art found in a dozen Asian countries. Lavishly illustrated with more than 175 exquisite color photographs from temples, museums, historical sites and private collections, this invaluable book ranks first in terms of illustrated guides to Buddhist Art. Extensively researched over more than thirty years while the author resided in Asia, it is well suited everyone: college students, armchair travelers backpackers and academics.

However this book is a very personal and insightful series of vignettes from her childhood to her years as a Boston debutante in the twenties.Hale's stories describe a world of posh dinner parties, childhood outings, deb parties but all with keen insight into the fleeting nature and underlying poignancy of life. A elaborate dessert is crumbled as guests chatter, a child's fair is turned to the purposes of an adult social climber, a precious ring is lost.This is a wonderful memoir of the life of an affluent but aware young lady and subtly witty and ironic. Aside from that her stories of chilhood and early womenhood are wonderful to read as she attends school, dancing lessons, her first parties in a era that has passed. For a young women or adults a wonderful book."},{"Title":"A New England Girlhood : An Affectionate Re-creation of Things Past","review":"I've loved this book since I was a teenager, because it transported me to another place and era, much like _A Tree Grows in Brooklyn_, which is another wonderful book for a teenager to read with pleasure, and then read again as an adult with different kinds of delight. Hale has a marvelous ability to capture the way the world feels to a child -- the nausea created by school bullies, the amazement of a New England beach to a kid equipped with a brand new bucket and shovel. And, even though as a teen I was dancing to the Rolling Stones at school dances, rather than attending subdeb parties with ushers and stag lines, I found so many of my teen anxieties captured in this book. Hale finds all the magic in even those little crevices of ordinary living that most of us have forgotten about and with her delicate humor she just pulls out a tiny irony, drops it on the page and moves on. For those who wonder what it was like to live near Boston before WW1 and who enjoy books that really capture the detail and fragrance of earlier days, this will be a real treat!"},{"Title":"The barbarian west, 400-1000","review":"This book covers one of the most confused periods in western history, and I must say it left me more confused than enlightened.The novice may gain superficial knowledge about the Lombards, Visigoths, Franks, and Ostrogoths, from Hadrill's compact book, but not much else. (I challenge any beginner who trodded through this to say anything illuminating about Visigothic Spain!)Too many times the author frolics about interpreting documents and developments without giving any background information. If I did not know any better, I would think he was having a debate in his own mind. Hadrill certainly lacks expositional skills, nor is his ability to write clear english any better.I would not recommend this to a novice (layperson or student). It is one of those books you read, set down, reflect upon, and realize you do not remember anything it said.For an advanced student who has the requisite background knowledge, it might serve as a contentious (brilliant? tendentious?) interpretive history, but for the beginner it is gibberish.History professors should stop using this text in introductory courses. Why not pick a text by an author who actually cares about EXPLAINING the Barbarian West to students so that they will UNDERSTAND the time period. Methinks Hadrill wishes to impress with his erudition too much."},{"Title":"The barbarian west, 400-1000","review":"This is a short little book that is tackling a very large subject.

Every sentence in this 170-or-so page book is laden with information, many times based on facts which the author already assumes the reader knows or which he had briefly discussed thirty pages prior in one line. Many times the new facts seem unrelated to each other, connected only by flimsy transitions written in the airy manner. The book is also far too dense to serve as any useful introduction to the relevant time period. The abscence of maps and family trees, two things which would greatly ease the burden of the reader from the rapid-fire assault of new facts, further decrease the legibility of this book.Walle-Hadrill attempts to introduce and discuss the histories of all major Germanic tribes that existed during a 600-year time period in less than 170 pages. It really doesn't work and is too challenging for someone in need of a good introduction. Also, and this may come as a surprise to some, much new research has been done over the last five decades in the matter of medieval history and thus this book may be missing some fundamental facts that have only recently been discovered. For those in need of a good introduction to the time period, I would recommend a relatively new book that is either less ambitious in its goals or substantially longer and inclusive of maps, trees, and other useful presentation devices."},{"Title":"The barbarian west, 400-1000","review":"This is neither a good introduction nor a valuable contribution to scholarship about the period. I believe its best use is as a critical thinking test for beginning scholars showing how easily the reader can slide unquestioningly over banal and ridiculous statements which have no basis in historical evidence. If you deconstruct this book, you find it has very little substance. In addition to plain poor writing, the author uses vague or confusing terms which I'm sure he thought \\"flowed poetically,\\" when specific ones might have actually benefited the reader. Furthermore, many sentences just don't belong in a professionally-written work. For example, he writes of the Goths that they were \\"barbarians but not savages,\\" and then moves right along. Does he mean more primitive culturally but not vicious? [I don't think so.] Or is he using the Greek origin, barbaros, ie. not Greek or, by extension, not Roman? In any case, why even include such a statement? Pointless. Every page is rife with these meaningless, sophomoric self-indulgences. And despite being a historian, he treats the Incarnation and Resurrection as \\"historically significant\\" FACTS -- not simply as facts to many of the Christians in the fifth century, but facts, period. Now, the author can believe whatever he wants to about these privately -- I would not be surprised to read this in a nineteenth-century work; but such presumption does not belong in a scholarly work written in the second half of the twentieth century. I am truly amazed that this was ever published, let alone multiple times."},{"Title":"The barbarian west, 400-1000","review":"J.M. Wallace-Hadrill (hereafter JMWH)wrote a small book about a very complex historical era from the demise of the Roman Empire until the end of the Carolingian reign. One might need a \\"score card\\" to follow the events and \\"players\\" during this very complex history. Yet, the book gave readers a detailed account in spite of its brevity.While many Romans bemoaned the declinning fortunes of the empire, some of the Romans were aware that ALL empires collapse. For example, St. Augustine (354-430 AD)wrote that all temporal power is subject to collapse and change whereas his THE CITY OF GOD argued that men should pursue God who is eternal while The City of Man is temporary. JMWH clarified some of the political and religious conflicts in the West. The Arians gained support among many of the barbarians who had bitter disputes with the Catholics. While the Gothic and Germanic tribes had serious conflicts, these were dwarfed by the threat of Attila(c.400-453) the Hun whose threat was blunted by Aetius' (396-453) forces at the Batlle of Chalon in 451. As an aside, the Roman Emperor Valentinian III (419-455)assassinated Aetius due to political jealously. Later Aetius' wife vindicated him when she in turn assassinated Valentian III.The events of the the Huns, The Scourge of God, enhanced the Catholic authorities. Many of the Catholic bishops were the sole defenders and administrators of cites and dioceses. As JMWH commented, the Popes in Rome also enhanced their influence especially Pope St. Leo I (440-461)who convinced Attila to defray his planned invasion of Rome. In the midst of these terrible problems, JMWH reminded readers of the economic problems when some of the barbarians got control over sections of North Africa and blockaded food trade with Europe.Historians would err badly if they thought that Justian's (527-565)Gothic Wars relieved Western Europe of the serious problems that haunted Western Europe and especially Italy. His Gothic wars lasted about twenty years and lasted too long. Justinian's troops caused continued death and destruction simply because Justinian did not realize what his troops faced. The Lombards also posed serious threats to Italy and Rome, but Pope Gregory (590-604)was able to offer charity and help. The Benedictines establsihed monastaries where learned monks and nuns helped barbarians administer their lands. By 653, the Lombards converted to Catholicism. Also Pope Gregory was partially successful in substituting blood money for vendettas. JMWH had an interesting comment re the fact that the Lombards were more influenced by Greek language and culture. Between c. 600-750,13 Popes were Greek which helped the Lombards become more sympathetic to Catholicism vs. Arianism and the Greek Orthodox Church.JMWH next sections focused on the Merovingians beginning with Clovis (467-511)who married a Catholic and made what is basically France mostly Catholic and not Arian. JMWH made a note that the Merovingians got their name from a word meaning Sea Fighers. With the problems that faced Western Europeans, Danes added another threat. While the Danish threat was blunted at first, they returned later only to be absorbed by Catholic Europe. After 391, no Merovingian was able to control all of France until the reigns of Pepin (741-768)and Charlemagne. What the Merovingians did not understand due to their laziness,is that the Carolinginas, who were called The Mayors of the Palace, got most of the power, and later prestiege, to eventually oust the Mervingians. Charles Martel (714-741)commanded the Frankish forces who stop the Moslems at the Battle of Tours in 733. Pepin (741768)pulled a coup d'etat and took control of the Frankish realm in 754 which was sanctioned by Pope Stephen II (752-757). As JMWH noticed, the Franks protected the Papal States from the Lombards which obviously influenced Pope Stephen II's approval of Pepin's coup.After Pepin abdicated power to join a monastery,Charlemagne (768-814)became the Frankish ruler and, after several conquests, the Franks controlled large sections of Western Europe. One of Charlemagne's goals was to improve learning. He \\"imported\\" monks from Ireland and subsized Benedictine monastaries. He created palace and cathederal schools, Alcuin (735-804)and his scholars \\"streamlined\\" written expression and helped to standarized the Vulgate Bible. These men copied Latin AND Greek texts and preseved the precious learning from Antiquity.While Charlemagnue establish learning and \\"law and order,\\" the empire fell into disarray after his death due to the nobility establishing their own turf. Charlemagne's successor, Louis the Pious (814-840)inherited an empty treasury and faced famine and local wars. JMWH clarified the problems and divisions in Western Europe until 987 when the last Carolingian died. The next ruling family in France were the Capetians (987-1328). Thereafter the center of Europan power shifted to Germany and the Ottonians whose forces destroyed an Avar invasion in 955.By the year 1000, the Europeans were divided by language and political conflicts. Yet,the only unifying factor was Catholism and the influence of Catholic religious and Popes. While many Europeans thought \\"the end of time\\" would occur in 1000, there were dynamics that would create new trade, scholarship, and renewal.While JMWH's book dealt with complex problems, a good index and bibliography can help readers get focus and clarification. JMWH dealt with a complex history, and he wrote a good account. Readers should have pen and notebook to carefully comprehend this book.James E. EgolfSeptember 1, 2012"},{"Title":"The barbarian west, 400-1000","review":"In J.M. Wallace-Hadrill's \`The Barbarian West' the author attempts to discuss the major histories of all major Germanic tribes during a 600 year period in 163 pages, not including the 12 page bibliography & 8 page index. Because of this every sentence is heavily laden with information, much of which the author already assumes the reader knows or which he had very briefly mentioned in a prior page. The book is far too dense to serve as an introduction to the period, as the author notes in his preface. \\"The reader who requires a balanced introduction to the early Middle Ages will do best to turn without delay to the general books cited at the end of this volume, which, so far from seeking in any particular to replace, I gratefully build upon.\\" (Preface) As a novice to this time period, I found the book a little challenging and it took some effort to read. The Book became to me, simply, a list of information put into paragraph form that the author divided into seven chapters. Chapter One: Introduction-In the year 376 A.D. northern tribes from beyond the Danube were in motion. This wasn't the first time so the Roman Empire was slow to react to the reports, but they were anything but normal, \\"The Huns, the most terrible of the barbarian peoples, had been stirred to life and were sweeping south towards the Imperial frontiers, refugees streaming before them.\\" (p.9) The Imperial frontiers had long been stretched to a point where defense against threats was a burden big enough to cause economic & social problem. Problems such as labor and spending modified the structure of the Empire. 1st labor; Defense of an immense frontier combined with the need to exploit food producing land & to make every able-bodied man the object of state supervision proved to be a self-destructive process. An age long reliance on slave labor wasn't conducive to inventiveness or labor saving methods, the slave population would bear no more work than it could avoid. 2nd Spending; No Emperor would have considered fiscal discipline for a minute because lavish households and grand towns were the Roman way of life. Emperors continued to live beyond their means because to do otherwise was not to live at all. A lack of adaptiveness showed in Roman social activity. Take the increased demand on the soil & decreased productivity and add to it endemic plague & war casualties, and the Empire saw no alternative to settling the land and army with barbarian refugees. Chapter Two: Mare Nostrum- During the 3rd century in south-eastern Europe there formed two barbarian confederations. To the east were the Ostrogoths and to the west the Visigoths. The Ostrogoths were comprised of the East Germans: Goths, Vandals, Burgundians, Gepids, Lombards and they controlled the Steppe-lands between Crimea and the Don & Dniester rivers. The Visigoths were comprised of the West Germans: the Franks, Alamans, Saxons, Frisians, Thuringians and they controlled the lands between the Danube and Dnieber rivers. Both Groups were hard living pastoral peoples and likely would have died if they didn't trade with the Empire. It was the unexpected arousal of the non-Germanic Huns that broke up the confederation & created a mass exodus to the eastern empire, which was unable to stop them or provide for them. This led to armed conflict and in August 378 A.D. near Adrianople, the Imperial forces were defeated and the Emperor Killed. The eastern provinces were open to raids, and both the Huns & the Goths took advantage. The western empire knowing it was in danger took what means it could to save itself by surrendering power of the Emperors to the barbarian chieftains and by the complete barbarization of the army. The Goths learned their Christianity from bishop ulfilas. He preached among them 341-348 & translated the scriptures into their language. Ulfilas was an Arian who believed in the divinity of God but not Jesus, so it follows that the Goths share this belief. Western Catholics did not like this. In 410 A.D. Alaric, chieftain of an Arian people finally took Rome. He didn't have much interest in it afterwards because he needed food more than plunder, and there was little or none in Rome. Rome was supplied with corn & oil from Africa. The Visigoths tried to reach Africa, always the barbarian goal, but failed and retreated along the Mediterranean coast. Tribes searching for food move fast and in a generation or two settled among the Romans on the western lands that were to become, in general, their permanent homes. Chapter Three: Italy and the Lombards- In the 6th century the Emperor Justinian undertook the re-conquest of Italy after a successful campaign against the Vandals in Africa. The war took 20 years & in the process Italy was ravaged from end to end, part of this was due to famine & plague. Had the re-conquest gone as well as the one in Africa & had the barbarian rule in Italy been harsher, Justinian would have been welcomed as a liberator. His renewed rule over Italy was soon tested as the Lombards invaded and settled. The north Italian plains on which the Lombards descended in 568 A.D. were not at all prosperous. The Lombards were distrustful of the Romans & went out of their way to avoid them when possible. They were able to keep their culture and language longer than most groups by bringing with them their wives and children. They were constantly ready for war, raiding neighboring territories for goods. \\"They were the wicked people, the people a man could not trust to keep an agreement, the destroyers of churches and monasteries.\\" (p.52) Chapters Four & Five: The Franks- Tournai was taken by the Franks in 446 A.D. and is where they established themselves. In 482 A.D. Clovis succeeded his father childerick as leader of the Merovingian house of Franks in Gaul. About 503A.D..8 years before his death, he converted to Catholicism. In 639 A.D. the last great Merovingian king, Dagobert, died. He had been a Frankish hero who united Franks & Germans against the Avars, a nomadic group of warriors related to the Huns. His descendants were aristocrats not warriors. The Arnulfings who later become the Carolingians eventually take advantage of this. In 751 A.D. with support of the church Pepin, a Carolingian and father to Charlemagne, seizes the throne and remains king until his death in 768 A.D. From 779 A.D.-791A.D. of Charlemagne's rule is referred to as the great central period. It was a time of military conquest and the rapid development of his Christian mission. 792 A.D. & 793 A.D. were bad years because of bad harvests, famine, trouble in Saxony, Italy, Spain, as well as a plot against him by his bastard son Pepin \`the hunchback'. The Eight years between 793 A.D. and his Imperial coronation, he painfully re-imposed his authority over Saxony, Spain, & the middle Danube lands of the Avar. By the Imperial coronation of Christmas day 800 A.D. he had extended his power of the Franks beyond anything his ancestors had achieved. Chapter Six: Spain and the Visigoths- The Sueves who settled in the north west of Spain were the 1st barbarian kingdom in western Europe. This was enough to cause the Empire to invite the Visigoths intervention, by the 6th century they had control over central & southern Spain. At war with themselves, a group led by Athanagild called upon Imperial help from Africa. The Empire began a military occupation of south and south-eastern Spain that would last from 554 A.D. to 629 A.D.. The Arab invasion of Spain was a repetition of the past, but instead of turning to Imperial forces, the dispossed family of Witiza looked to the Arabs for help against Roderick. After preliminary raid Tarik, the Arab governor of Tangier, crossed into Spain in 711 A.D. with a force of 700, most of which were Berbers, to a world in decay. Since the departure of the Empire and the Devastated Visigoth armies were made worse by plague & locust swarms the Arabs easily conquered and ruled from 711 A.D. to 850 A.D.. Chapter Seven: Imperium Christianum- Louis \`the Pious' received from his father an empty treasury, rebellious followers, & a plague and famine stricken countryside. His friends were fierce reformers who believed Charlemagne did little to help them. His idea of a Christian Empire is best expressed through his plan for the future. In 817 A.D. he conceived the Ordinatio Iperii, He did not plan to leave equal shares to his three sons and nephew. Lothaire the eldest was to get the biggest share and the Imperial title, though he did not wait to claim it & took a co-Emperor title. The next oldest Pepin would receive the kingdom of Aquitaine, Toulouse, & parts of Burgundy. Louis \`the German' his third son would receive Bavaria & the Eastern Marches. Bernard, his nephew would continue to rule Italy. All three were to acknowledge Lothaire as their leader and pay him annual tribute & make no wars he would disapprove of. In the event one of them died without an heir the Kingdom would revert to Lothaire. However none of this came to fruition because 1) Bernard rebelled and lost his eyes & kingdom, and his family was exiled to France & 2) the Empress died and Louis remarried and produced another heir Charles \`the Bald'. The new Empress tried to secure a good inheritance and his step-brothers tried to prevent one, resulting in strife and once again the west was at war with itself. In his last years, and during the reign of his sons the Empire, subjected to many divisions, showed that linguistic differences became more clearly marked. The Language of East & West Franks had developed towards modern German & French. As early as 843 A.D. the Imperium Christianum no longer existed and the Franks would never know peace again.In conclusion though the author provides excruciating amounts of detail on these groups mentioned, his focus is almost solely on the Empire and the Roman Church. Instead of an in depth look at these cultures, he wants the reader to see only their ties to Rome. \\"Hence, as at the beginning so at the end, the vivid contrast stands; early Medieval men could live like barbarians; but they could think that they were Romans.\\" (P.163)"},{"Title":"The Rise of Rome: Books One to Five (Oxford World's Classics) (Bks. 1-5)","review":"Professor Luce has done an admirable service to students of ancient history with his new translation of Livy.

Overall I'd recomend this book to someone looking for a good, fast moving, light read."},{"Title":"The Khufra Run","review":"Another of Jack Higgins boys own adventures, set in the 70's with good old fashioned seat of your pants adventure and intregue.The good guys win again."},{"Title":"The Khufra Run","review":"I'm a great fan of Jack Higgins especially his Sean Dillon series.

The storyis very similiar to his book \\"The Keys Of Hell\\". However, the story is good and fast paced.Of course parts of the story are a bit hard to believe - especially some of the escape sequences.But Higgins does a good job weaving the various story elements together - making for anenjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Khufra Run","review":"As with most of Jack Higgins' works, we really enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"The Khufra Run","review":"Shipment was timely.

Rivonia was a suburb of Johannesburg where the ten defendants secretly met and hid on a farm. Ethnically they were 3 Jews, 2 Indians and the rest black. Nelson Mandela had masqueraded as a cook and gardener.The trial began in December 1963 and the verdicts were rendered in July 1964. The trial outlines the conspiracy to violently overthrow the South African government.It proves how the revolutionaries planned and implemented campaigns of sabotage, intimidation, torture, guerrilla warfare, violence, disruption of transportation and communications, insurrection and revolution against the government with the assistance of the Communists and other radicals. They planned to manufacture or purchase explosives such as 48,000 land mines each containing 5 pounds of dynamite, 210,000 hand grenades each containing 1/4 pd of dynamite as well as petrol bombs,syringe bombs, thermite bombs, 1,500 timing devices for bombs, as well as molotov cocktails. Their requirements included 144 tons of ammonium nitrate,21.6 tons of aluminum powder and 15 tons of black powder. They prepared for a nucleus army of 7,000 soldiers. Many to be trained abroad in Communist countries. The campaign was based on the model of successes previously achieved in Algeria and Cuba. More than ten documents written in Nelson Mandella's handwriting were submitted as evidence. They contained notes on basic and advanced military training and warfare as well as Communist doctrine. Although Mandella denied being a Communist he admitted that the aims and objectives of the ANC and Communist Party were identical. He even spoke of retaliation against non supportive blacks such as murder and cutting off their noses. The planners were convicted and sentenced to life in prison. The lesson that may be learned from this is that governments when threatened such as in this case must move harshly. Had these terrorists been convicted of treason and executed things might have turned out differently."},{"Title":"Rivonia unmasked!","review":"This book is full of information presented in a pro-apartheid government view. Look elsewhere for legitimate sources of information about the Rivonia trial..."},{"Title":"Mile High","review":"Richard Condon's \\"Mile High\\" is one of the smartest, most exciting thrillers in the entire canon of American popular fiction. It was published the same year as Mario Puzo's \\"The Godfather.\\" Both books feature a mafia leader known as Don Vito (interestingly, each book also has a minor character named Coppolla). There are numerous similarities between Puzo's book and Condon's, but Condon's is definitely the more intelligent and ambitious of the two. The story hits upon many of the highlights (or, perhaps, lowlights) of American history: slavery, Prohibition, the Great Depression, McCarthyism, etc. The book starts out like a runaway train, and concludes with one of the most gripping showdowns in print. There is about a 100-page stretch early in the book where Condon slows his plot down with excessive detail about the family business that is at the core of this superthriller. But from about page 200 onward, the novel is as inescapable as car careening through the loops and lifts of really devious roller-coaster."},{"Title":"Mile High","review":"I defy eny reader of this book to conclude that it is a novel or a non-fiction work.It is absolutely breath taking - I couldn't put it down. A terrific read. I found it in a library in Palm Springs.

I passed the Godfather one along at that time. It got all the press. Yet many, many years later this is the one that sticks to my gut. It hits hard at the truth -in fiction form. Because, quite frankly, thats the only way it could be told. Nothing has changed. A Must Read."},{"Title":"Mile High","review":"This is an imagined history of the hidden forces that shaped the American 20th century. Written with splenetic good humor, it postulates the Prohibition movement as the creation of one greedy New York Irish-Sicilian banker who turns his inherited knowledge of the synergy between New York ward politics, big business and organized crime into the blueprint for a tyakeover of the soul of the nation. It draws from Asbury's The Gangs of New York and also serves as a thematic \\"pre-quel\\" to Condon's other, more well-known masterpieces, The Manchurian Candidate and the multi-book Prizzi's Honor series. What a wonderful movie for the mind's eye."},{"Title":"Mile High","review":"I am re-reading Richard Condon's books and they are just as great the second time around as they were thirty years ago.

The takeaway is you are one of the puppets. This amazing book provides the \\"how\\" it could be done. The reader will have to decide if it could really happen this way. In the early 1960's I worked with a Chilean man who was a former seaman, then in his 60's. He claimed he worked on the Kennedy yacht during Prohibition. The boat was stripped of its interior and was filled with the finest wines and liquors from France. Back and forth, back and forth for years. He claimed the Boston police escorted the boat to the dock and guarded the unloading process.

The most valuable points concern the limited time for practice and what to focus on. There are many interesting concepts in the book that are full explained.However, the book was tarnished on several accounts. It was filled with details of Mr Reed's dubious adult baseball career that I really didn't need. His constant negativity and bitterness towards the players, fellow coaches, league administration, volunteer umpires,etc.... got to be too much by the end. All of this complaining done while reminding the reader it is for the kids. I ended up questioning why Mr. Reed spent so much of his time doing something that caused him so much unhappiness.Read this book it is worth it. But, be very careful of adopting the attitudes and feelings conveyed in it."},{"Title":"John T. Reed's Youth Baseball Coaching","review":"Book lays out very complete and thorough plan to put a successful baseball team together. With &quot;Time&quot; always against the coach, Mr. Reed shows how to use practice time to teach what you need to know for game situations. Lot's of good little tricks also included for plays against the opponent. I recommend this book highly as a coach in the Minor League level myself."},{"Title":"John T. Reed's Youth Baseball Coaching","review":"Page for page this is by far the best baseball coaching book I have ever read. Having just completed coaching 7-8 year olds and coaching them in an incompetent way, I can't wait until next season to implement the &quot;Youth Baseball Coaching&quot; system in practices and games. Every youth baseball coach and parent should read this book."},{"Title":"John T. Reed's Youth Baseball Coaching","review":"After coaching youth baseball for sixteen years, after reading numerous books on the subject, I can now say that it's refreshing to read a book that tells it like it is! Mr. Reed identifies the coaching incompetence in us all and tells us how to correct it. I personally can accept this, many other youth coaches may not. If you are a youth coach and have a high opinion of your coaching talent, I do not recommend this book. However, if you are opened minded and seek to greatly improve not only your coaching abilities but also overall enjoyment of the game, I strongly suggest this literature."},{"Title":"John T. Reed's Youth Baseball Coaching","review":"Most books on youth baseball that I read before this did not properly prepare me for the challenges I would face in coaching my team. This book is packed with details on every aspect of the youth game. The sections I found helpful include: how coaches cheat the draft; how to properly equip your kids for safety (including where to get proper equipment); what to teach your kids that will actually make your team better; and what not to waste time on. Some of the notions in this book were so radical to me that I was fascinated and unable to stop reading. While I do not agree with him on everything, I see exactly where he is coming from. The chapters on each youth position are packed with detail, hints, and drills. He spends over 20 pages (full size pages with small print) on the right field position! I now agree with his statement that 98% of youth coaches are incompetent. If you are serious about coaching a team, or even just working with your son or daughter, this book is a must!"},{"Title":"John T. Reed's Youth Baseball Coaching","review":"I knew that this was going to be a good one as soon as I saw the authors' name on the cover (check out John T. Reed's *football* coaching books, excellent!). Based on my personal journey of 10 years coaching youth baseball, and associated 100+ books read &amp; scores of clinics attended over that time - *this* is the best take on what constitutes effective 12 &amp; under baseball coaching that I have seen to-date. Finally, a reasoned and thoughtful delineation of the differences between &quot;real&quot; baseball and &quot;youth&quot; baseball - and how to effectively coach to those differences. John T. Reed does it again!My plug for the best companion coaching book out there - Positive Coaching, by John Thompson (a fuller exploration of the emotional side of effective youth coaching, IMHO). Utilizing these 2 books, you have all of the tools that you need to be an effective youth coach. Go get 'em!"},{"Title":"John T. Reed's Youth Baseball Coaching","review":"I found this book recommended in the Amazon review of ANOTHER BOOK! I'm so glad I did. I've had kids in youth baseball for 6 years, and have had my various complaints regarding coaching and league rules. Everything Reed writes is extremely logical, reasonable, and practical. All well-organized, well-written, and with just the right amount of wry humor. He suggests ways to bring out the best in players. He outlines exactly how to prepare players for each position. He explains why it doesn't make sense to spend a great deal of time practicing things you aren't likely to improve (like batting) but to spend a lot of time working with players on things they can improve, such as intelligent baserunning and correct understanding of rules. His emphasis on safety is terrific. I bought this book for my husband, but I read it cover-to-cover myself. It makes me want to coach a team next spring. But even if you weren't interested in coaching, the information in this book could help you be a better &quot;baseball parent,&quot; too."},{"Title":"John T. Reed's Youth Baseball Coaching","review":"John T. Reed is not afraid to speak his mind and through his outspokeness, real life experience and detailed analysis of stats provides some of the most informative, useful and novel approaches to coaching youth baseball. I have read alot of books on coaching youth and this one is a must for any coaches library because it is not just the same old, same old. You won't agree with everything he suggests, you don't have too. But you will find a large number of nuggets that will make your team practice and your team better ball players. I only have th first edition (which I guess this one is) but there is a 2nd edition out that I may have to take a look at."},{"Title":"John T. Reed's Youth Baseball Coaching","review":"I just wanted to let readers know that there are several other books and resources out there with much better content and organization for less moneyHaving been involved with my own kids in different facets of kids baseball I am always on the lookout for new or original material. Unfortunately this very pricey book does not fill the bill."},{"Title":"Real Estate Investing From a To Z","review":"The problem with a comprehensive \\"A to Z\\" book like this one is that it likely contains more information than the reader really needs. If you are interested in all aspects of real estate investing - commercial, residential and land - having to sort through the material for just one of these won't be an issue for you. But my interest is in single-family residential houses for investing and rental. The book is not organized so that I could read appropriate chapters to get the information I wanted. These three subjects are interspersed, often under the same section heading. Admittedly, there are many commonalities between the three types, but often it was difficult to discern which type was being written about or if it applied to all three. If you're mainly interested in residential real estate, check the reviews for \\"Rental Houses for the Successful Small Investor\\" by Suzanne P. Thomas. Also, just as I was beginning to get annoyed at the number of success stories about clever tactics for making \\"a killing\\" in real estate, Pivar finally wrote about a few failures - with post-mortem analysis - which helped to point out the risks in this type of investing. Perhaps because the book is about four years old now, it doesn't talk about on-line searches and some of the tax information may be not be accurate now."},{"Title":"Real Estate Investing From a To Z","review":"This is a great book if you want to get excited about real estate investments. The first chapters give one the impression that there is minimal risk in real estate compared to a vast upside potential.The rest of the book surveys all the various kinds of real estate investments but does not cover them in depth. If you are looking for a book to help you evaluate a real estate transaction from a numbers standpoint, this book is not for you. I would turn to &quot;The Real Estate Game&quot; by Poorvu as a beginner's guide for evaluating real estate transactions."},{"Title":"Real Estate Investing From a To Z","review":"THIS WAS AN EASY TO READ, VERY INFORMATIVE BOOK ABOUT THE BUSINESS OF REAL ESTATE INVESTING...JUST LIKE IT SAYS...FROM A TO Z.

I WOULD BUY IT AGAIN."},{"Title":"Real Estate Investing From a To Z","review":"I found this to be a real meat-and-potatoes book. Crammed with lots of information, you should learn something from Pivar regardless of your experience level. Great addition to the library.He focuses on generating wealth through land ownership, commercial properties, single family homes, and property conversions. He also covers how using options and long-term appreciation can sweeten your deals."},{"Title":"Real Estate Investing From a To Z","review":"I was searching for a good book that would give me the basics on real estate investment and came across this one at a bookstore. Judging from the title, I thought this HAS to have the most definitive information that I'm looking for in order to get started as an investor. What I found was this book made my head spin. Don't get me wrong, it has a wealth of information and I'll probably refer back to it as the need arises. I guess I was looking for more of a step by step guide or something with a more orderly approach. This is more like a dictionary - so, you'd better know exactly what you're looking for before you open it. I bought this several months ago and still haven't finished reading it. In my opinion, it's not the type of book that you would (or could for that matter) sit down and read from cover to cover, but it does have some useful info nonetheless."},{"Title":"Real Estate Investing From a To Z","review":"Wonderful book for the beginner. While more motivational and thought provoking than purely step-by-step instructional it certainly de-mystifies the process and provides the average reader with enough real life examples that at least one (or more) should appeal to you. I would say this book emboldened me to get out and do something in real estate investing."},{"Title":"Real Estate Investing From a To Z","review":"The best book that I have read to date. Now that me and my husband are successful real estate investors, all of our friends want in on the actions. We recommend that they read this book first. In fact, before, we will answer too many of their questions. This book covers it all and is very up to date."},{"Title":"Building Construction Inspection: A Guide for Architects","review":"I bought that book hoping to find some thing related to construction inspection. The book takes you thru a quick trip of the ideas of inspecting items.I recommended this book to my mother in law to have a general knowledge of construction, however she has nothing to do with construction.Too expensive, and in my opinion does not worth that money."},{"Title":"Quantitative Zoology","review":"For biologists and paleontologists, this book is a must-have. It uses examples that relate to our research needs and presents them in clear comprehensible terms. For those who want to USE statistics in those & similar fields, this book is far and away the best ever."},{"Title":"Beautiful Outboards","review":"After reading this book I can say I share an eye with the author for beautiful outboards. Contained in this tribute to not only kickers of distinction is interesting historical information as well as discussion of restoration in general. Peter Hunn has a great love of outboards of bygone days, as is his many loyal readers and fellow enthusiasts. If you want to relive a piece of the past with a picture and accompany text, this was written for you."},{"Title":"Beautiful Outboards","review":"The book was made for the admirers of antique outboards, but the value would have been better if the book was made in a larger \\"coffee table\\" style format. Nice pics, one to two page descriptive follow-ups, mostly in chronological order.The sections that I found \\"odd\\" were the solid gold plated over-pretentious restorations. What the heck were the owners thinking? This was a bizarre augmentation of old outboards that made me want to laugh at the glitzy extravagance. It's like some gold toothed rap star wanted a photo spread to show how much money he could pour into a motor. Trashy glitz.Using the same background/backdrop for most of the photo-shoots soon gets cheap & boring, a little creativity would have gone a long way. A bit more detailed pictures would also have helped this book to be a better value. A few more motors would have justified the cost.The redeeming feature was the general cross section of motors. Hope Hunn's next attempt is bigger in scope, and less over-done in over-restored gold plate."},{"Title":"Beautiful Outboards","review":"The pictures are very nice, the book is well-constructed, and there certainly are many beautiful outboards included. Beauty is subjective, however, and I would have deleted several (the Mercury Mark 6, e.g., I was a Mercury mechanic at age 14 when that motor came out) and definitely would have included others. Glaringly absent are the 1975 Evinrude 75 Hustler (the short shaft EP/SE racing model) and it's hotter twin the Mod 50 CC. The former was the most beautiful outboard ever produced. Also missing is the 1958-60 Scott/McCulloch 60 or 75. Those motors were way ahead in styling, and are still very beautiful. The Scott 40 was no dog to look at either. I would not have included any pre-1930 outboards."},{"Title":"Beautiful Outboards","review":"Nice book but with some errors and many ommissions.The Red Johnson Javelin is not the same year under the hood (Probably a 1957 35 hp., as evidenced by the electrical plug on the port side and the carb adjustment plate.)Better examples do exist as well.More OMC models would have been nice. He missed so many. A 1957 Johnson Golden Javelin, Evinrude Larks of the same year as well as many of the lesser hp motors from that era. There are many 1958-1960 models that are just stunning too. I am an OMC man and Hunn seemes to be a Merc guy but he missed a lot of really beautiful Mercs too (1958 Mark 58A?). Most from when Karl K. was the owner.I still love the book and have all his others except one and will most likely purchase anything he publishes!Thanks Peter!"},{"Title":"Beautiful Outboards","review":"My father liked the book as he's into old outboards.

I couldn't disagree more with a previous reviewer's insinuation that this book is depicting a hidden sexual message simply because the two snowmen are male at the end. Last time I checked two men (\\"snow\\" or of any other type) can be friends without it meaning anything else. Ridiculous. Like I said, a great inexpensive read - words flow beautifully and the pictures are sweet and great for kids."},{"Title":"All You Need for a Snowman","review":"PreS-K. \\"One small snowflake fluttering down- that's all you need for a snowman.

The watercolor paintings help tell the story of neighborhood children working together to build a larger than life snowman. The children, dressed in colorful clothing \\"pat them and pack them and roll them around,\\" and then, that \\"one big ball,\\" seems to be larger than a house. The finished snowman is so large the book needs to be turned sideways to see it. These beautiful paintings along with the fun text keep the energy alive in this book.

The illustrations are clear and colorful and there is a nice rhythm and rhyme to the text. As the snowman is being built, and his accoutrements added, there is a teasing \\"except\\" or \\"but\\" before you turn the page, inviting participation and anticipation from the audience. I was surprised and delighted that when a new snowfall invited the construction of a second snowman it turned out to be, not a pet or a snow-wife, but another snowman. Since this is a clear departure from traditional snow-being groups I suspect the author is making a point, but a point so subtle that is only going to be noticeable if someone chooses it to be. If there is an objection to the implied message, there is no problem interpreting the story as a snowman having a snowguy buddy. The book is well worth reading regardless of how you interpret it."},{"Title":"April Evil","review":"This early paperback original by John D. MacDonald is a gem of a novel. All the action takes place in a thinly disguised Sarasota, Florida.April Evil is the story of a sinister home invasion. The third person narration brilliantly builds to a climax as the points of view of the multiple characters are explored. MacDonald tells this interesting tale with remarkable attention to realism. The characters are undeniably human in their thoughts and quite believable in their actions.One unusual aspect of April Evil is that the protagonist Ben Piersall, a lawyer and family man, plays a surprisingly low key, limited, almost passive role in the proceedings. That particular touch makes the book all the more believable.Those lucky Gold Medal readers of long ago who paid 75 cents for this outstanding paperback really got their money's worth. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Women and War","review":"This is an absolutely stunning collection of photographs that explore the effects of war upon the women of the world.

There's something uncannily sensual about the image--graceful, seductive--that speaks, perhaps, to our fascination in the West with violence and sex. But open the book to the first full page photograph inside the covers, and Matthew quickly disabuses one of any urge to romanticize of sensualize war. The photo is an in-your-face portrait of Phuong, an eight-year-old Vietnamese girl who was born without eyes because her mother was poisoned by Agent Orange years earlier.The rest of the photos follow this initial template of starkly contrasts between beauty and horror. One of the most memorable contrasts is midway through the book. One page shows stacks and stacks of weapons.

Although he is not the only explorer to go through tribal initiation rituals, the ritual of scarfication he submitted to seems quite extreme for even the best of them! Returning to England with a raised pattern on his skin resembling that of a crocodile must have shocked more than a few people!Having read several of his books, I admire his approach to adventure, relying on his ability to enlist the aid of people he meets along the way. His comfort zone is very large, and his openness no doubt appeals to the indigenous populations. He does not present himself as a larger-than-life character, nor does he adopt a macho facade. He is a human among other humans, which is precisely why I enjoy traveling with him."},{"Title":"Critical White Studies","review":"An excellent collection of essays and law review articles that explore the concept of &quot;whiteness&quot; and what it means in American Law.

The checklists and critical questions that are provided in this text are well worth the cover price, in and of themselves. I believe that this book is an excellent companion to Joseph Krallinger's text, &quot;Mergers &amp; Acquisition: Managing The Transaction.&quot; The authors' hands-on business experience, as well as their academic abilities are clearly in evidence in their work. The chapters related to the valuation of the various forms of assets and liabilites (including the potential legal consequences) are especially valuable to the reader. As a leadership coach to CEO Entrepreneurs and as an academcian who teaches courses in entrepreneurial leadership and decision making, I find this book to be a valuable resource. All in all I'd strongly recommend this book to any entrepreneur or would be entrepreneur who is considering the acquisition of an existing business."},{"Title":"Rare Views","review":"The book itself is beautiful and sexy, the photography just right.

I was expecting a lot less and was gladly suprised at the depth put into this game system.Even if you are not a gamer, and just a Tolken fan you will enjoy reading the book."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game Core Book","review":"In 2003, The Lord of the Rings Role-playing Game won the Origins Award for Best Roleplaying Game of 2002, and it's easy to see why. This game system is very well thought out, and makes for some fun role-playing. The system is pretty versatile, and has a good selection of character classes and abilities.My one and only complaint is that makers of LOTR RPG have not produced anything new for it since 2006, and likely won't every produce any more. However, in spite of that, the system is so good that you will want to write your own adventures or adapt adventures from other systems."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game Core Book","review":"This is a fabulous book. It is beautifuly laid out, the pages decored with wonderful photos from the movies. The rules are surprisingly easy to understand, largely due to their flexibility (e.g. you do not need to look up every modifier and TN [target number], you can just use the tables as sort of guidelines and trust your own judgement). I especially like the 'qualities of heroes' pages, and though it is quite difficult to get across all of these attributes they do add to the 'Tolkienesque' flavour of the game.When I first read the Coda rules I thought that the combat would be quite tedious and dull before you memorised the rules, yet no, it flows quickly and furiously, leaving your heart pounding as if it were real! Yes, sometimes you have to look up rules, but it isn't a huge encumbrance to your enjoyment of the game.However, the most importent attribute to the game's level of fun is the pacing. My group made the mistake of letting our charcters converse and discuss every little thing, and though this was fine at first it soon became quite dull. You've got to find a balence between dialogue and and combat/tests, and once you do the game is amazing. We played for four solid hours and it merely felt like 1 1/2 - 2 hours at the most. I have read the book six times, and this is a must-buy for any Tolkien or game fan.[Oh, and by the way, my titles in Quenya (High Elven).

So dont exagerate pick up your copy today!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game Core Book","review":"The design of roleplaying games has improved drastically over the last twenty years, and \\"The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game\\" is a good example of this shift in trends. While the early roleplaying systems were not much more than wargames with a few modifications for character development, current systems are being designed with greater care and interest in the storytelling element of the game.Even if you're not interested in roleplaying games, you might still find this book interesting if you enjoy Tolkein. In fact, with stills from the film(s), Decipher's book would make an excellent coffee table book. Glossy pages with full color photographs adorn nearly every page, and the binding on this book is one of the best I've seen in the last ten years (this [book]will stand up to use).Decipher's CODA rule system is simple, flexible, and easy-to-use. It relies on a skill based system where each skill modifies a roll designed to test a PCs success accomplishing a particular task. While there's nothing revolutionary about the CODA system, it does provide a simple method for resolving tasks without slowing down the game with a ton of \\"chart digging.\\" This was a wise choice on Decipher's part. It keeps the mechanics simple enough to allow for the storytelling atmosphere that's needed for a game in Middle Earth.That being said, one has to wonder exactly what GMs (Narrators) will do with this sleek looking book. Even though Decipher does an excellent job of presenting the \\"world\\" of Middle Earth, as well as, meshing their CODA rules to provide a simple, structured backbone for the game's mechanics, there's almost nothing in the way of aid for narrating a new chronicle. The list of monsters/evil humanoids is barely a dozen pages at best, with few opponents suitable for newly created characters and some notable exclusions (goblin and dragon being the two biggest). Granted, there's always the orc but -- show of hands for anyone interested in fighting another orc in a fantasy RPG?Even if you're like my group and prefer a storytelling (plot driven) adventure over a combat oriented adventure, one has to wonder exactly what kind of adventures fit well in a Middle Earth game. Unfortunately, unlike most RPGs, Decipher doesn't offer an example adventure either. Aside from a chapter on creating Middle Earth style chronicles, there's little in the way of primary source material geared for aiding a new LOTR Narrator. This, and Decipher's extremely slow (often late) production schedule, seem to be the two biggest sources of contention on their official message board.The only other problem with this product is the same that plagues all publishing these days - inconsistent editing. The number of errors isn't overwhelming but there is an errata sheet as long as your leg for the first printing. This will no doubt be cleared up for future printings, but as I mentioned in the previous paragraph, they're not moving at a dangerous pace with releases.Having said all that, I've given this book a \\"four star\\" rating. The source material, history, layout, design, mechanics, binding, and character system are all top notch (five star). Unfortunately, material for the Narrator (particularly the first time Narrators out there) is rather sparse, which to me brings the rating down, warranting only three stars."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game Core Book","review":"I preordered this book after having anticipated it greatly for the preceeding months. I was not let down. When I opened the cover and was confronted with the antique looking map of Middle-Earth I was instantly taken with the &quot;Tolkien&quot; feel, something well maintained throughout.This game is for you if you are tired of constant &quot;roll-playing&quot; and are looking the original &quot;role-playing&quot;. Properly, this book is primarily about role playing. Often in D&amp;D, a character is reduced to a pile of numbers on a sheet of paper with a name scratched in the top such as &quot;Joe the Thrasher&quot; simply because of all the combat/spell option which power playing characters break down to mathematical equations. Not in this book. Playing a heroic character in Tolkien style is this focas.Elves are portayed in good Tolkien fashion. The reaction of one of my friends was the elves should be banned from being PCs, as elves in Tolkien's world have many special abilities but nothing could be farther from the truth. Did Legolas unfairly unbalance the Fellowship? No way, and neither would an elven PC or two unbalance a game. Again, the emphasis on this game is role-playing. Role playing proper Tolkien elves is alluring, but is not a Rider of Rohan galloping across grassy plains, or a Tower guard standing firm on stone walls as a crisp wind blows, or a much fabled Ranger of the North wandering the wilds equally as alluring?The book is fantastically illustrated with photos from the movie and quotes form the books help players wee how nearly every rule and heading is carefully integrated into the world of Middle-Earth.I was concerned on about the was the magic and magic users would be handled by the rules, but have no fear, magic stays very true to limited direct uses of magic, while not stepping on the feet of characters who would like to play a more magically attuned character. Carefull attention is paid to the magic of the worls itself, prophesy, curses, oaths, foreknowledge, and the magic of &quot;the way things are supposed to be&quot; as it plays in to the story of the Lord of the Rings. Much is made about things happening when &quot;dramatically appropriete&quot;, and in some cases limiting effects of curses or the results of a broken oath until the game master agrees it fits properly in the flow of the story.The Hobbit is not forgotten. Quotes and references form it shaped the game as well.In short this game is about the epic fantasy adventures of true heroes in the greatest fantasy setting there has ever been, or will be, and not about adventuring &quot;heroes&quot; robbing graves and hacking apart every NPC in their path. Tolkien fans and role playing fans, do not hesitate to purchase."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game Core Book","review":"When I opened this book and began to read the pages, I realized that I had found the most realistic yet simplist RPG system that has ever been made. The battle scenes flow like no other and the easy to read tables make it a simple system to create exciting adventures with characters that are limitless in scope. Your character can be anything from a mighty warrior, to a powerful wizard, a crafty rogue to a humble inn keeper, a daring sailor to a wealthy noble. And the best thing I have found is that the rules are so open, that the game focuses more on roleplaying characters than any other I have seen.The system has the good points of others while throwing out the bad ones. Your characters primary attributes and skills are simple to test using a similar system to that of the d20 system. However, using weapons are now skills like they should be instead of some sort of a feat or special ability determined by your class. A player has many options in combat while still keeping it simple, which lead to battles flowing very smoothly. The game also uses a unique advancement system which level up your characters quickly and steadily. This makes it so that the players enjoy the fun of leveling up with out drawing attention from the Roleplaying part of the game.The Orders, or classes, have a lot of depth, making it sort of hard to figure out with only one read, but by reading it a second time I was able to not only figure out how to use them, but how much flavor they add to the roleplaying aspect of the game. Also, the races that a player can choose are very realistic. Some may seem more powerful than others, but I have found this does not effect player's choices when choosing a race. In fact, I have found more diversity among PCs because each race is so unique.Because this is the first printing, it is not totally perfect, but it comes close. I found a contradiction in the money system over the ratio from Silver pices to Gold Pennies, but the Game Master can easily fix this problem with choosing one of the two ratios mentioned. Also I wish that they had put a larger choice of weapons and monsters in the book for players to use. For example, there are only three types of blades to choose from: longsword, scimitar, and shortsword. For monsters, they don't have some of my favorites that I like to use such as a Dragon; now that I was shocked about. Hopefully, future realeses will remeady this. I am looking forward to a Weapons &amp; Equipment Handbook along with some sort of a Monster's Manual.All in all, this book is a giant step in the development of RPGs. A true epic of a book!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game Core Book","review":"I would never say any one system is the best, bu this is definitely ONE of the best. It takes elements from many different games, like D&amp;D, Feng Shui, and BESM, and adds its own flavour to them. The class-type character system is more flexible and natural than that of D20, and the way the rules work, making your characters quite tough to start off, and downplaying the role of magic and magical items, encourage a more character-based game that doesn't rely on hunting XP points and magic weapons. The battle rules likewise focus on drama and the PCs, and the combat rules strongly lean towards epic confrontations.The layout is very nice, with plenty of pictures from the movie trilogy, although the book is primarily based on the novel. There is, however a fair amount of errata to be downloaded from the company site, but mostly it's small things, the only really major change is the damage ratings for weapons.My only real gripe with the book is that, as I read further, I noticed a certain amount of &quot;sucking up&quot; to the Tolkien name. Every writer deserves due credit, but when you start being told that Tolkien's style doesn't move too fast or too SLOW, you really start to wonder.However, all that aside, it is a great book, brimming with campaign ideas and even advice on how to work your game within the established plot, or change it completely."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game Core Book","review":"Ok, let make this simple: this book is amazing!!. I was very concerned at first with the system: it use only d6 dices?, how the elves will be managed? and the magic?. All these questions worried me, but let me tell you: the system is great, flexible (like or more the d20 system) and simple. The races and character classes (order) are very well made and presented. Of course, the elves are superior, but thats does not mean that the other characters will not be relevant. The ROLE playing is what is relevant. And this book present wonderful opportunities for make many good roleplaying sesions.The magic system (another big issue) is great also: is not to powerful, but powerful enough. It let you combine your magic, you do not need to &quot;memorize&quot; the spells, etc. But one thing is important to remember: forget about big balls of fire or dozens of magic rays creating havoc between your enemies... Think more of how Gandalf use the magic and you will have a more precise idea of how the system works... And you want to be a member of the Wizard Order? This book tell you how to achieve this.One last word: the biggest challenge will be for the Narrator (or storyteller, DM, or whatever you call it). To create a wonderful story in the Middle Earth that capture the Tolkien mood without copy the books will not be easy, but this book help you a lot in the process... The rest is for your imagination."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game Core Book","review":"The Core Rules of the Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game is an OK try at turning a series of fantasy books into a game. It has the basics down - character creation, a simple system of rules, a magic system and rules of combat.But the background information is too simplistic. There is no way, if you wanted to make a whole story, that you could get enough details from the book. If you planned to make your own epic story you would need to use Tolkien's books for finding the ideas and giving you the knowledge to fill them out.Also, I think the rules about mass combat, in dealing with the major battles of Middle-Earth, also seem too simplistic. This book is great in the hands of a person who already knows how to design and run a game. But a person new to roleplaying will need more help than found in this book."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game Core Book","review":"I wanted to love this book. Unfortunately, while beautiful and alluring, it does not stand up to extended scrutiny. Certainly, it seems to play better than it reads. However, I simply cannot get beyond rushed playtesting problems (the Warwise edge is insanely good, Loremasters are like magicians only lame, etc), copious errata (affecting nearly aspect of character creation and most weapons), and an overly strict license that prevents it from expounding on Middle-Earth in depth. It might be inspirational, but as reference, it is hamstrung, and as a game design, it is strictly second rate. A lot of love and intelligence went into this product which unfortunately did not get developed to its potential.The book's strongest points are its description of epic fantasy, Tolkien-style, and the flexibility of the character creation system. I think you could mine a good campaign out of this book, but I have a hard time really investing in a game that is basically broken, when better games and better ME references are out there."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game Core Book","review":"At first I was really excited about this book. For one thing, the art and production values are excellent, even if they lean too heavily on snapshots from the movie. Also, compared to ICE's Middle-earth Roleplaying, these rules capture some of the flavor of gaming in Tolkien's world. Wizards do not blast away with fireballs, and characters are supposed to be heroic and aligned against the powers of the shadow. These are the strengths of the game.The weaknesses, which appear to reflect poor game balance and insufficient playtesting, became obvious after a couple of gaming sessions. For one thing, beginning characters are way too powerful. A party of hobbits was able to chase down and destroy a hill troll on their first night out of the Shire! Another problem was that many of the combat manoeuvers are underpowered and not worth expending actions on. Why give up a parry and very likely receive say 2d6+5 in order to perform a \\"power attack\\" and gain a pawltry +3 damage modifier?As I developed my chronicle, I found that it was somewhat difficult to creatively roleplay in Tolkien's world. I believe that this is because the plot of the books is relatively structured and oriented toward a single supreme goal. Obviously, this is not a fault of the game, but simply an observation or opinion of my own.It is probably possible to make these rules work, if you really want to try gaming in this setting. There are also a variety of alternative and optional rules online to compensate for the problems I mentioned earlier. Personally, I would recommend waiting for the second edition, or simply sticking with d20."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game Core Book","review":"While the rulebook is very nicely presented, the game they are presenting lacks a great deal of substance. They have pledged to use only information available from the books and/or the movies in fleshing out their system, and this is where the true weakness of the system lies. This means that no material will ever cover any location not visited in the books or movie. No inns beyond the Prancing Pony or Green Dragon will be described, which means that it is entirely up to the gamemaster to invent things that happen beyond the path that the Fellowship themselves traveled. The book provides no real help in developing your own campaign settings and adventures. It is also assumed that the only magical spells available are ones actually used in the books, which is an unfortunate assumption that Gandalf never had anything else in his repertiore. While I assume the limitations on the game are the result of licensing restrictions, it causes the world to completely lack depth or any sense of wonder; everyone who read the books or saw the movie know what everyone else is capable of. My advice is to use the rule setting you prefer, find some old ICE/MERP campaign materials, and run your own Middle-Earth campaign. This book may have some value as an occasional inspiration or sourcebook, but I wouldn't count on it being very much."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game Core Book","review":"Let me get all the negative bits out of the way first, because I own this book and I really do feel that my money was well-spent. The system itself is my biggest problem with LOTR RPG. The reason why is simply that, as a gaming veteran, I quickly recognized the \\"Coda System\\" as Dungeons & Dragons with a different hat. Two six-sided dice are used instead of a single twenty-sided die, but otherwise, the mechanics are very similar. Task resolution, the way attributes and skills are handled, even the timing of combat rounds are almost carbon-copies of D&D.; The classes (called \\"orders\\") are a strange mix. Some seem better suited to a roleplaying heavy game (as one truly inspired by Tolkien's original tale would likely be) like the Craftsman, Loremaster, and Minstrel. Others seem inspired by D&D;, like the Barbarian, Rogue, and Warrior. I'll be honest: I have never liked classes or levels (in fact, I actively DISlike them). Nearly any gaming system imposes certain arbitrary restrictions or rules as a matter of course, but classes and levels feel artificial to me and seriously hamper my enjoyment of a game. Unfortunately, LOTR RPG has both, though it calls them different things. Even D&D;'s Armor Class mechanic, my disdain for which knows few bounds, found its way in. My personal tastes aside, the question then becomes \\"is that the best way to simulate a story that 'feels' like Lord of the Rings\\"? Overall, I don't think so. While there are some things that I like a great deal (like Courage points, or the Corruption mechanic), my conviction is that Tolkien's Middle Earth would have been better brought to life through a different system of mechanics. The chapter titles also deserve a brief mention: while titles like \\"Ringing Anvils and Rhymes of Lore\\" or \\"Stern Men and Resolute\\" preserve a \\"Tolkienesque\\" feel, they can make it difficult to find the particular chapter you were looking for (happily, the subtitle of the chapter in question--\\"Skills\\" and \\"Traits\\", respectively for the two examples--is listed on the opposite page from the main title during the body of the chapter).Now, all that said, LOTR RPG does treat Tolkien's work with reverence and affection, and is a fantastic reference on the history and geography of the late Third and early Fourth ages of Middle Earth. Since it was released around the time Fellowship of the Ring was playing in theaters, LOTR RPG is obviously a bit of marketing (now, I have no problem with this as long as it's done well, which I think this is). Fans of Tolkien's work have noted differences between the story as told in the films, and Tolkien's original tale. (Admittedly, they are often subtle differences to an outsider, but they ARE important ones: Boromir's motivation for visiting Rivendell is a prime example.) LOTR RPG avoids the problem that the second and third films had yet to be released by taking the obvious shortcut and making the original books its source material. However, the book is FILLED with imagery from the first film, and it is extraordinarily well-done. The book is positively gorgeous.Now, I paid full retail price for this book when it was first released, and as I said, I feel my money was well-spent. However, I would have been much happier if the system hadn't been such a blatant copy of Dungeons & Dragons. If I were to want to run a game in Middle Earth, I would use LOTR RPG as a reference, but I would almost certainly use a totally different system for the actual game. Your mileage may vary, of course. While the rule system is questionable, the book is undoubtedly a fine reference, and beautifully put-together. If those things make it worth your money, I don't think you'll be disappointed."},{"Title":"Basic Criminal Procedure (Black Letter Series)","review":"This book is an exceptional outline of the law concerning the 4th, 5th and 6th amendments.

The opening plot is ridiculous and not even remotely believable. I don't know if there was any editing done for this book because there are numerous spelling and grammatical errors. *NOTE TO AUTHOR* Readers get extremely frustrated if they have to continuously overlook spelling and grammatical errors. It's also frustrating when you're always having to figure out which character is speaking. I haven't read a book this bad in a long time. My suggestion to the author is to go back to the drawing board and learn something about character development. Have a few people read your work before you publish it and get their honest opinion.

James puts Harry in his place by informing him that Portsmouth is hardly the center of things and heads for London. I always found James a distraction, and probably enjoyed his time in London even more than he did.Unlike some of the other books in this series, this one's less of a mystery and more of a spy novel. It further develops the impetuous and manipulative character of Harry Ludlow, and sees him negotiating with everyone: local smugglers, able seaman, through half the admiralty and even William Pitt himself. This installment also has more action, including a combined land/sea battle in a river with galleys and ships.Like most of the other sea heroes (Alan Lewrie, Horatio Hornblower and Jack Aubrey, in particular), Harry's luck on land is not what it is at sea. Although in this book, it could be argued Harry makes his own \\"luck\\" at sea and on land.Read the first five of these books first. They tell one long story in episodes, much like other nautical fiction series. After Aubrey, Kydd and Hornblower, Harry Ludlow's my favorite sea officer. The novels move along with crisp dialogue and excellent nautical action. The fourth Thomas Paine Kydd book, \\"Mutiny\\", by Julian Stockwin, covers the same events from a rather different perspective, and I think gives a better perspective on the mutiny itself."},{"Title":"A Game of Bones (The Privateersman Mysteries)","review":"Set in the Age of Fighting Sail, right at the close of the 18th century, A Game of Bones is a seagoing adventure novel with seasonings of whodunit. Part of author and sea lover David Donachie's \\"Privateersman Mysteries\\" series, A Game of Bones follows seaman Harry Ludlow and his exhausted crew as their search for an easy prize lands them amid a desperate fight for survival. His Majesty's Navy has erupted in mutiny; sea froth with be mixed with blood before all is said and done, in this salty historical adventure."},{"Title":"A Game of Bones (The Privateersman Mysteries)","review":"This is novel No. 6 in a series about Privateersman Harry Ludlow. The author assumes you have read previous books in the series, as references are made to previous events without clearly explaining them. Most of the action takes place on land or aboard moored ships.Much of the plot material has been used before. Patrick Obrien's novel &quot;Post Captain&quot; found Captain Aubrey in debt after his bank failed, and sent him on a quest for prize money to satisfy his debts. Various novels have included fictional accounts of the mutinies at Spithead and the Nore (See C. Northcote Parkinson's &quot;The Fireship,&quot; Richard Woodman's &quot;A King's Cutter,&quot; etc.), although this novel puts a different spin on the story.This is a readable novel, although the hero comes across as a somewhat boneheaded fumbler at times, who gets his men killed to satisfy his quest for gold. It seems to alter history in some areas, e.g., I recall that a significant number of mutineers were hanged after the Nore Mutiny."},{"Title":"Naked by the Window: The Fatal Marriage of Carl Andre and Ana Mendieta","review":"Ana Mendieta was a Cuban-born girl who moved to Iowa in the early 1960's as part of \\"Operation Peter Pan\\", a relocation program for Cuban children. First she was placed with her sister in an orphanage in Dubuque, before finally reuniting with her family in Cedar Rapids.The Cuban girl Mendieta grew into a beautiful woman who began expressing herself in performance art and sculpture with themes relating to the practice of Santeria, blood, earth, birth and death within the contexts of primitive Hispanic symbolism. In short, she was brilliant. However, she had a predisposition to form relationships with her artistic mentors. One of these was Carl Andre, an established minimalist sculptor that Mendieta married, using him as a bridge to join the New York art establishment. Mendieta eventually became disenchanted with the bearded Andre, a rather odd and stilted personality, perpetually clad in Grant Wood-style overalls. She made plans for a divorce, but tragically died in a fall from the thirty-fourth floor New York apartment of Andre.A trial ensued, in which most of the New York art establishment remained in solidarity with Andre, even though the alibi that he offered--that Mendieta committed suicide in a fit of jealousy--lacked plausibility. There simply was not enough evidence for the judge (Andre opted to forego a jury trial) to convict, and so justice was denied for yet another woman who lacked the power given her male counterpart.This is a fascinating story that could have been told in a better form--this book has a fractured format which hacks up Mendieta's life and death instead of presenting it logically. But, as the best book available on the subject, it deserves your attention."},{"Title":"Naked by the Window: The Fatal Marriage of Carl Andre and Ana Mendieta","review":"This is a fascinating account of the life, and untimely death, of the gifted Cuban artist Ana Mendieta. The writer, Robert Katz says, I have \\"sought to narrate these events as they were revealed to me, certainly not chronologically or in any other 'logical' way.\\" In spite of the odd sequence in the recounting of events it is a riveting read. Ana Mendieta was lovely, free-spirited, magnetic, and a rising star in the art world. Her tragic fall from a NYC highrise is a great, and enduring loss to the world. Carl Andre is depicted as a complicated, proud, eccentric individual. He had fatal flaws in his character, and at the time of Ana's death his star was descending. Nevertheless, he was an iconic figure who was defended, and protected, by his powerful and wealthy friends in the art world. A burning question remains, did Andre get away with murder?"},{"Title":"Naked by the Window: The Fatal Marriage of Carl Andre and Ana Mendieta","review":"The OJ Simpson of the 1970s art world.

Each offers authoritative answers to the most important questions concerning its specific subject. The material in this book is drawn from a variety of sources which include William J. Bruns, Michael J. Roberts, and Robert S. Kaplan as well as Harvard Business School Publishing and Harvard ManageMentor, an online service. Each volume is indeed \\"a highly practical resource for readers with all levels of experience\\" but I think those who have only recently embarked on a business career will derive the greatest benefit.This volume explains the basic concepts of finance to managers who are not financial managers. As Richard Luecke notes in the Introduction, \\"Knowing how to finance assets, forecast future cash flows, maintain a budget, determine which operations are profit generators and which are not, and judge the real economic merits of different investment opportunities will help you stay in business and turn a profit.\\" Samuel L. Hayes served as subject advisor to Luecke, writer of this and other books in the Harvard Business School Essentials Series and author or developer of more than 30 other books as well as several dozen articles.There are ten chapters followed by an Appendix: Activity-Based Budgeting. (More about that material in a moment.) Each chapter is introduced by a list of \\"Key Topics\\" to be covered in it. For example, in Chapter 5, the focus is on start-up financing, financing current operations, financing growth, establish a proper match of assets with financing, and typical financing arrangements. Obviously, all of this material may seem basic (if not self-evident) to the experienced financial manager but keep in mind that the material was carefully selected for managers who are not financial managers.One of the most informative discussions is provided in the Appendix when brief but sufficient attention is given to \\"Developing Cost Drivers\\" and more specifically to activity-based budgeting (ABB) and how it differs from activity-based costing (ABC). Less experienced non-financial managers are frequently asked to prepare a report which, more often than not, involves a budget or at least a cost analysis. A basic understanding of ABB and ABC will guide and assist the completion of that task. Whereas ABC starts with the cost of resources, allocates these costs to activities, and then allocates these costs to products and/of services, ABB starts with the planned product or service, estimated sales volume, and mix and comes up with the requisite activities to produce the mix and volume.Financial managers as well as non-financial managers who supervise other non-financial managers should seriously consider providing copies of this book to those who currently do not understand \\"how to finance assets, forecast future cash flows, maintain a budget, determine which operations are profit generators and which are not, and judge the real economic merits of different investment opportunities\\" which will help [their organization] stay in business and turn a profit.\\" Of course, younger executives need not wait for such provision. Published as a paperbound volume and priced attractively, Finance for Managers would be a modest investment for them to make in their own careers."},{"Title":"Finance for Managers (Harvard Business Essentials)","review":"I bought this book to rehash some of the necessary and critical financial concepts learnt in school. Objective was to a. Make informed decision with knowledge of some finance terms (like top-line growth) B. Make more familiarity with the standard yet not so frequently used financial tools (like cash flow statement).The book does reasonably well to fulfill these criterion with and optimal degree of satisfaction. Nice organization, one chapter flows onto next one and examples related to one business entity (fictitious yet realistic) run through. Numerical examples explaining the basic as well as relatively difficult financial concepts are easy to understand and make a good reading.This trend continues pretty much throughout the book except in few chapters. I would actually point out two chapters where details and flow are not as lucid. The chapters explaining Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and Net Present Value (NPV) (Chapter 9: Time value of Money) and Budgeting process (Chapter 7: Budgeting) lacks the depth even at a conceptual level and does not help the reader to form a clear impression of the topics. I would say it in some cases it presents too less a detail (ex. definition and explanation of IRR) and it some cases it tries to present too much (Budgeting process/type and factors consideration)Overall a good buy and definitely nice value for money!"},{"Title":"Finance for Managers (Harvard Business Essentials)","review":"Explains the basics, not so detailed that a novice can't follow it. If you're already a finance manager (as opposed to a manger without a finance background), I suggest something a little more advanced."},{"Title":"Finance for Managers (Harvard Business Essentials)","review":"\\"Finance for Managers\\" is short and clearly-written. It's a good book for non-business people (like me) who want to be smarter readers of business and economic news. However, it strikes me as too elementary to be of value to real non-financial managers (the supposed audience), who studied business at college and already know the basics of discounted present value, ratio analysis, the risks and rewards of leverage, and so forth. The good thing about \\"Finance for Managers\\" is that it NEVER goes beyond the bare basics. But that's also the bad thing."},{"Title":"Finance for Managers (Harvard Business Essentials)","review":"For those who have never studied finance but need to understand the basics, this is by far the best book available: intelligent, concise, and easy to understand. I recommend it to my consulting clients (entrepreneurs and small-business owners in creative industries), and use it as a framework and primary resource in an undergraduate course in finance for designers. Students often prefer this to a conventional textbook, as it highlights the most important aspects of financial understanding and management, presents the material in a very accessible style with concrete examples, and de-emphasizes mathematical aspects.I hope Harvard will update this book with a new edition, as their more-recent \\"Understanding Finance\\" provides insufficient depth."},{"Title":"Finance for Managers (Harvard Business Essentials)","review":"This book is an excellent primer or refresher course on the basics of finance and accounting in business. This book is clearly not aimed at finance or accounting folks working in business today as the presented material is far too high level and basic. However, if it has been some years since you have dealt with this material in school, if you have always been on the periphery of this material at work, or if you have never encountered these subjects, then this is a great book to get you going.The very thought of the subject matter might make some sleepy, but credit to the authors for covering this subject in a short, concise, and relevant way. To the extent that a book of this type could be considered a \\"page turner\\" I think this book is it. The subjects are covered using every day language in an efficient and quick moving manner. You never get bogged down in any one subject or esoteric detail and there is nothing academic about the writing style.On the back cover of the book it is mentioned that the Harvard Business Essentials is designed to provide \\"comprehensive advice\\"... While this is clearly marketing speak, it is still quite untrue. There is nothing comprehensive about this book so folks should be careful about taking the Harvard name and the notion of \\"comprehensive advice\\" as if this is some sort of definitive text on the subject of finance in business. The material is at the level of the most basic introductory course and if you go in understanding this and desire something to either get you going on the subject or refresh your memory from long ago study, I think this book will fit the bill nicely."},{"Title":"Finance for Managers (Harvard Business Essentials)","review":"The book contains a number of good articles, introducing some important, basic accounting and finance concepts for non-financial managers. The chapters on Financing Operations and Growth, Budgeting, Practical Tools for Management Decisions and Valuation Concepts were the most informative and relevant. Others, like Taxation and The Time Value of MOney were too simplistic.

The bulk of the book is contained in the chapter on parts, in which every part of the rifle is described in great detail for every model of Swedish Mauser. If you have a Swedish Mauser, these descriptions are very useful.The other chapters are less substantial, providing an overview of the whole range of Swedish Mauser models, the life history of that rifle in the Swedish military and its final disposition out of that military, the marking system used on that rifle (serial numbers, status disk, inspections, etc.), a short excursion into sniper rifle models, some accessories available for the Swedish Mauser, and various (too short) appendixes on Swedish military history, Mauser production records, steels used, ammunition used, and so on.If you own (as I do) or are thinking of purchasing a Swedish Mauser, this book is very useful and informative. If you don't own one of these rifles, the book won't be as useful although it will help you round out your knowledge of historical weapons.If you don't own any guns and aren't interested in them, you'll probably wonder why anyone in their right mind would write a book like this."},{"Title":"The Swedish Mauser Rifles (For Collectors Only)","review":"I purchased a pair of Swedish Mausers (thanks to Boston T.

I like pithy little books--some photos, accurate line drawings, descriptive text, tables. My only disappointment was the lack of loading information--bullets, primers, powders which I might use to duplicate the military loadings. I would buy other volumes in this series."},{"Title":"The Swedish Mauser Rifles (For Collectors Only)","review":"This book (and the others in the series) does a great job of providing a lot of specific information related to the Swedish Mauser rifles. There's a ton of info and illustrations detailing the different stocks, hand guards, front/rear sights, barrels, sling swivels, barrel bands, triggers, bolts, etc. The book also sheds some light on the different types of ammunition, accesories (bayonets, slings, etc.), and production methods used to craft these fine rifles.There's not a lot of history explained, but the book does include lots of production figures and explanations/illustrations for many of the stock cartouches and receiver/barrel markings you're likely to encounter while hunting for Swedes at the local gunshow.The book is also written with a certain degree of redundancy -- the author may, for example, mention why a particular sight was used on a particular rifle in more than one spot so that the reader doesn't need to thumb through the book trying to remember where he/she first saw that information. That's definitely helpful since it lessens the need to read the book cover to cover on the first pass.All in all this is a great book and truly deserves to be in every Swede collector's library."},{"Title":"The Swedish Mauser Rifles (For Collectors Only)","review":"If you are really interested in the Swedish Mausers, then this is the book for you.

The book gives the reader a trip through time back to the mid 1800's when rifles were going through a time of \\"design revolution\\". Perhaps the arguable victor of that revolution was the design, acceptance and then manufacture of the Swedish Mauser in 1896. The book documents variations in the Swedish Mauser and gives the years which these changes took place such as the shortened barrel length from 29.1 inches to 24.5 inches in 1938 producing the M96/38 model rifle. The book describes the wood used to make the stocks for each year was manufactured: walnut during the early years, then oak, ash, elm or beech for the later years.

It is all very well to talk about 'whole board' play, but it takes considerable experience to lift one's eyes above the dust of battle long enough to see that there is action all over the board and that everything is related. It only slowly dawns on the player that more points may be made by playing elsewhere than can be gained by flogging a local group to death.Even after one knows that this is true, even after one has studied some basic opening strategies, it is often difficult to for a player to understand how he or she can arrive at the middle game already badly behind. The 'Power Builder' series is intended to remedy this situation by studying overall opening strategy and then following through to other aspects of the complex game of Go. In each case, Wang Runan goes that little bit deeper that is intended to drive a player past the intermediate skill level.This is the first volume released of three volumes, a translation of the first 13 lessons of a set of 34. I find it remarkable that they were originally based on a Chinese television program presented by Wang RuNan. It says something for the overall popularity of Go in the Orient that a course as advanced as this would appear as popular media. Here in the U.S. it would be hard to find a program on Chess, let alone a less popular game like Go.James Dee has done an excellent job of translating the classroom style of the program into a text with a similar feel. I find the discussion exceptionally clear, even though the subject matter is not always straightforward. It is enjoyable, enlightening reading that, applied carefully, will work positive changes in your playing style. This is a book I expect to read many times, and I hope that the following volumes appear in short order."},{"Title":"Wake The Dead","review":"While Niles has done much credible work in the past, it's a sign of the dearth of fresh ideas in Hollywood that this flimsy adaptation has (evidently) been optioned for a movie.

[...]"},{"Title":"Creating Miracles: A Practical Guide to Divine Intervention","review":"Carolyn Godschild Miller is a clinical psychologist; in Creating Miracles she gathers together a number of real-life situations related by the individuals involved as appearing to be miracles. Dr. Miller explains that about 70% of the people who had shared their stories with her were psychotherapists. She also noted that most were \\"spiritually oriented individuals\\" though generally not conventionally religious. From this she concludes that \\"centering the mind in peace appears to be essential for obtaining a miracle.\\" Most of the cases recounted by Dr. Miller in the book involved life and death situations, where the victim, rather than being beset with fear, found an altered consciousness state: an inner peace that seemed essential to achieving a favorable outcome.One category of miracles that Dr. Miller describes is spontaneous remission from disease. She notes that: \\"Patients with terminal diagnoses sometimes set out to heal themselves by altering the beliefs and attitudes that produce negative emotions, such as fear, anger, depression, and guilt. There are even physicians who make the restoration of inner peace an integral part of their treatment ... self-healers seem to give themselves permission to finally do what they want rather than what they are \\"supposed\\" to do ... they take a renewed interest in life and begin to feel they have something to live for ... They seem to place their main emphasis upon living in a way that is congruent with their inner values for as long as they have left.\\"I found myself reflecting on how similar the changes in consciousness reported to Dr. Miller were to accounts of near-death experiences (NDE) such as are discussed by authors such as Drs. Kenneth Ring and Raymond Moody MD. While I found myself ambivalent about the meaning of the claimed miracles, the credentials of all of these authors are good reason for reading with an open mind. What they show is that at least some of what are typically grouped together as paranormal phenomena seem to be more than illusions or dreams and that whatever their cause, they can bring about real change in those who experience them. Very absorbing."},{"Title":"Creating Miracles: A Practical Guide to Divine Intervention","review":"Great book. Has helped me a lot.

It truly makes miracles seem within the realm of the possible."},{"Title":"Creating Miracles: A Practical Guide to Divine Intervention","review":"I happened to be in a local Chapters bookstore one day and stumbled across this book, \\"Creating Miracles - A Practical Guide to Divine Intervention\\" by Carolyn Miller. When I first noticed it I thought that it would be simply another run-of-the-mill book filled with 'new-age' fodder and fluff. However, after leafing through the pages for a couple of moments, I became intrigued and purchased it.What I found did not disappoint me. The author tackles the subject of miracles - what they are, how they are created, and why some never seem to have them happen - with the objectivity of both a psychologist and believer of 'faith' combined. She manages to analyze and explain just how the inner workings of miracles come about, how to recognize them, and how to work upon bringing more miracles into one's own life. Filled with anecdotes and documented cases, along with a great sense of humor and humility, \\"Creating Miracles\\" is a book I would highly recommend. Interestingly, after reading one chapter that addressed a commonality among those who have experienced miracles in their lives, Miller noted that one thing all cases she related in her book had one thing in common...they all came to a point of surrender just before the miracle happened. She noted that a sense of peace came over each individual, despite the sometimes horrific events that were taking place at that moment. And as I read this I was taken back to a day in 1979 when, a week before my wedding, I almost drowned. I had been in a boat with my fiance and a friend at dusk, on a deserted lake. No lifejackets, not another soul around for miles, and our boat began to take on water at a steady rate. I couldn't swim a stroke, and at first panic set in as the two men tried to keep the boat from going under. The water was flooding in much too fast however, and within moments it had gone under. And I recall that at the moment the water had reached my chin, a sense of inner peace enveloped me. I didn't struggle, didn't panic...didn't even attempt to save myself...I just 'let go' and waited, almost as though I was an observer watching the event unfold. As soon as this sense of inner peace took over, something miraculous happened. Despite there being no visibility (as the sun had gone down), one of the men suddenly grabbed me and threw me into a dinghy that we had been towing. It seemed so effortless, and so 'right', yet the odds of him finding me as I sunk below the surface, the water pitch black and not able to see within a foot around us, would have been incredibly low. I hadn't called out, hadn't made a sound in the water...yet he was guided to me and he managed to save me nevertheless. I believe this is exactly what Carolyn Miller talks about in her book; this is how so many have experienced miracles in their lives...unexpected, sometimes life-threatening events that suddenly grasp us and in those few moments, we have the free will to decide (either consciously or subconsciously) how to act.I highly recommend this book, as it may open your eyes to ways in which to invite miracles into your own lives, or even to recognize when miracles have indeed, taken place."},{"Title":"Creating Miracles: A Practical Guide to Divine Intervention","review":"Quick - what's the first thing that comes to mind when you find yourself in a bind? The frantic search for someone to blame? The feeling of victimhood? The lengths to which we are willing to stretch reason in order to find someone else responsible for our woes is nearly comical.This book is as close as you can get to a &quot;how-to&quot; book for miracles. The exalted &quot;A Course In Miracles&quot; is quoted freely in this work, establishing its secure underpinnings in the metaphysics of higher realities (a.k.a. miracles). The key: miracles are a CHOICE.If life is a series of lessons, choosing the &quot;path less taken&quot; often means a conscious decision to see a situation in a completely different light. This might entail compassion for the oppressor, awareness of the &quot;big picture&quot; and the wellbeing of all concerned, or simply a complete surrender to a loving Higher Power. (Interestingly, completely &quot;losing it&quot; later on seems to be OK). When this loving attitude is chosen as the response to a crisis, the lesson may be &quot;called off&quot; as it were. You got it. You passed the test. No need to go further.This is a wonderful book - one that should be read by everybody as an antidote for the &quot;eye for an eye&quot; mentality of the world-mind."},{"Title":"Creating Miracles: A Practical Guide to Divine Intervention","review":"DO YOU KNOW HOW TO CREATE MIRACLES?Armed with a Ph.D. in experimental psychology, Carolyn Godschild Miller tackles some tricky issues in her fine book Creating Miracles: A Practical Guide to Divine Intervention.The book delivers a heaping plateful of inspiring and astounding true tales - deliverance from deadly dangers and personal attacks; synchronicities; healing by prayer, visualization and distant intention - the stories alone are worth the price of admission. Even if you don't believe in miracles as such, but prefer to view the \\"miraculous\\" as an unexplained facet of the natural world (as I do), you will find much in Dr. Miller's book to appreciate, enjoy, and use. An eye-opener as well as a heart-opener, this book shows that amazingly good outcomes are possible in even the most hopeless-looking situations.Defining a miracle as \\"an instance in which a supernatural power interferes in the natural world,\\" Miller says, \\"the actual miracle is not the healed body or the peaceful outcome to a dangerous situation. It is the unconditionally loving state of mind that allows such things to happen.\\" The peaceful, loving, assured state of mind associated with meditation is felt to be the catalyst for miracles. In this, the author follows the spiritual curriculum of A Course in Miracles.Dr. Miller is an astute writer, fluid and user-friendly, with an intriguing sense of humor. Her engaging accounts of purportedly miraculous events provide a punch that deflates defenses and opens the imagination - wide. Stories and chapters in Creating Miracles brought joyful tears to my eyes, a warm expansion to my heart, and a sense of empowerment and determination to my intellect.In her review of the scientific literature, Miller tackles chance, coincidence, skepticism, and the 95% confidence level with wit and an insider's knowledge of the vagaries of the experimental method. Her final chapters challenge the reader to fashion personal experiments conjuring up (or meeting) divine guides and test-driving miracle-mindedness.Credulity is, of course, an issue. Dr. Miller apparently believes that specific \\"miraculous\\" things are possible, such as the sudden, perfectly-timed appearance of a life-saving beaver pond where none had ever been seen before. I don't. But if you get too uptight about being credulous, you may miss the plum in the midst of the pie. I'll bet you'll appreciate the body of what Miller has to say and how she says it. I'll bet you're going to want to read every page of this book and share it with friends.Creating Miracles is sagely organized. Stories in the beginning tantalize the ego; admonitions at the end are soaked with spirit. The book takes you on a delightful journey and by the time you're finished you're not quite the same person who started. Miller's book is gently persuasive. It animated me.263 pages of mega-brilliance can't be boiled down to a brief review, and a summary can't do justice to the high quality of thought and intention in this book. To get the gift, you'll have to read it yourself. As the subtitle promises, it's practical - it teaches you how to begin to do these marvelous miracles (or facilitate these beneficent mysteries). And it's a fine read.Carolyn Godschild Miller, Ph.D., Creating Miracles: A Practical Guide to Divine Intervention. An HJ Kramer book, New World Library, Novato, CA. $14.95.

Packed with well-told tales with surprising turns and endings that really hold you glued. Unusual, unexpected and dramatic events in the lives of many ordinary people in extraordinary situations. Under circumstances that seem to guarantee loss and tragedy, the miracles in this book are an unforseen turn of events that transforms the individual's threatened reality into one of love and tranquility, leaving everyone changed for the good. These miracles are created when one shifts their consciousness into a state of uncalled for unconditional love. The dangers averted include life-threatening accidents, illnesses, attacks by rapists, terrorists, serial killers, etc.This is a book of hope for everyone, that requires no belief in the supernatural or the miracles of myths. It teaches a technique for creating miracles in your own life that simply relies upon everyone's natural ability to respond with love. Dr. Miller's research shows that this method has been used throughout the ages by the wise and successful.I would have been satisfied reading this book for the many inspiring stories alone. These, in themselves, could constitute a separate heart-warming book about the transcendence of love and good, over all that darkens our world. However, the real surprise is that Dr. Miller is both an experimental and a clinical psychologist, who uses her research skills to critically examine alleged miracles. She is not just a teller of tales, a collector of pearls of inspiration, but a serious scientific investigator who wants to know the truth.Miller challenges and digs deep: Are these happenings coincidence? Mental aberrations? Psychotic or neurotic phenomena, self-hypnosis? Misinterpretation? Can anyone work miracles or do you have to be someone special? Do you need to believe in a religion or God? Are there supernatural forces at work? This exploration delves into traditional healing, cross-cultural miracle phenomena including those at Lourdes, historical and religious traditions around the world, and current scientific evidence for miracles including United States government sponsored research on prayer. Dr. Miller's analysis is astute and dispassionately scientific and she supports her surprising conclusions with reputable evidence in an easy, readable style.You can tell that I was quite taken with this remarkable book. I even bought copies and gave them to my friends who are ill, troubled, struggling with critical issues in their lives, or who just want to know! The feedback has been one of gratitude and even awe. I highly recommend this book of hope and love for everyone!"},{"Title":"Creating Miracles: A Practical Guide to Divine Intervention","review":"Facing a eye disease with no known cure and progressive degeneration I found myself looking at books with titles like this one. Aftear all, since medicine has no answer, I'll have to find the solution in some other way. I'm not really very religious, and am actually a bit ashamed to show books like these to my friends (as a engineering student and computer geek this is not really the stuff I used to read). Still, I liked Carolyn's way of writing without being based in a specific religion.It's hard to know what's true and what's not, what comes from God and from men. The Bible isn't for me, at least, not everything. The concept of Carolyn's God is indeed a lot more pleasant. Is it that way? Who knows.In any case, the book won't make it worse, it can only make you a bit better person (and more optimist) or you'll just throw it away disgusted.I liked it, the first pages were somewhat boring and the cases shown were not impressive at all. But the second half was delicious and left me thinking about it.Read it, I definitely didn't regret spending my money on it, even if some parts sounded like some books on mind control (Ex: Silva's Mind control method).Overall, it was good book and I'll read it again soon. If you think there must be someone or something out there worrying about us but have no clear idea about it, give it a try."},{"Title":"Creating Miracles: A Practical Guide to Divine Intervention","review":"Wouldn't it be great if each of us could remake our lives miraculously? Wouldn't it be great if we got more great ideas, had more fortunate coincidences, understood more quickly the positive and constructive meaning of the difficulties we encounter? Wouldn't it be great if we had more reason to value love, joy and peace of mind so that we would be more intent on incorporating these states more fully into our lives? Creating Miracles goes a long way towards inspiring me towards these ends. It is written very intelligently and it's filled with wonderful, inspiring, fascinating, thought provoking stories. I often recall a passage or story from this book when I am encountering difficulty in my circumstances or in my emotional experience, and very often it helps me to return to where I am enjoying my life again. In other words, this book helps keep me alive.I remember a couple of statements. Albert Einstein's &quot;God does not play dice,&quot; and Barbara De Angelis' saying in her book Real Moments, &quot;Throughout my lifetime, I'd learned over and over again that there are no accidents in the Universe,...&quot; (p. 79). I especially liked Carolyn Miller's book because it helped demystify the idea of miracles. It seems it is very likely that so-called miracles are not in any way random events, and they are within reach of everyone. I cannot prove it, but it seems to me that miracles--maybe not on the scale as many in the book--are a normal part of my life now. I credit Creating Miracles with helping me create my life more fulfillingly and meaningfully."},{"Title":"Creating Miracles: A Practical Guide to Divine Intervention","review":"This book has something for everyone. Even if you don't buy into the new age stuff, the anecdotes alone are worth it. To say the very least, it left me thinking, and answered in a very unique and straightforward manner those eternal questions like \\"why do good people suffer?\\" \\"Is God cruel?\\"...Dr. Miller walks the line between clinical talk and everyday language very well, unlike many other clinical psychologists. She presents her arguments in a very readable and rational manner.All in all, a very readable book, and if you're into this sort of thing like I am, then it's a MUST HAVE! :-)UPDATE:It's been at least 2 years since I've written the review, and I haven't touched another self help book since. Everything I said above still applies, though I'm a little less psyched about the miracle stuff.Shortly after reading this book I came up on a medical emergency; I certainly wasn't looking to try the stuff on such a scale yet; instead try something small like maybe focusing on finding a $10 bill on the sidewalk :-)Anyway, I followed the examples in the book, focusing on my desired outcome. No go. At the end, I had to have surgery. I even contacted some of the \\"miracle workers\\" in the book, even the author, who I'd emailed when I first got the book, congratulating her.Not much. Can't blame them I suppose, a total stranger contacts you out of the blue, what do you expect.Needless to say, the entire experience left me jaded and feeling a bit foolish for spending time on alternate healing.That's the problem with these self help books, they make it sound sooo easy, but.... People who are cited in these books, I've come to believe are the exceptions than the rule. Heck, if such principles as focusing on the desired outcome were so easy, then we'd have a LOT of successes. Look at the millions who've read Norman Vincent Peale, Wayne Dyer, but still...all you have to do is look around.At the risk of sounding bitter, maybe I am, if 99.9999999% of the world has difficulty practicing the positivity message, then the message itself is deceiving, because in the end the person is left questioning his/her faith/efficacy, which is even worse, and only adds to the problem.I'm not saying it can't be done, but for my life, I've found everything topsy turvy. Sometimes, when I'm expecting the \\"worst\\", voila, things miraculously turn out better than I expected. However, when I expect the \\"best\\", like in my medical condition above, I get the worst...so, I'm at a loss as to cause/effect as far as attitude is concerned.I'm sure I'll pick up another self help book sometime in the future.I remember 11 years ago I first read Wayne Dyer's books, and also read Tony Robbins, Napoleon Hill. I tried in earnest to practice the principles, but as the weeks wore into months, and the months to years, nothing.I eventually became very bitter, felt I was mislead into believing there was a better way when there wasn't, and in the process started to think there was something wrong with me.I didn't touch another self help book for a few years, and then started back up again.All this has nothing to do with the book in question, but then again, it has everything to do with it, because in reading this stuff you get the feeling that what you're reading about may, just MAY be possible for you too(that elusive thing called hope).But hope unfulfilled, or worse, dashed, is worse than not having that seed planted in your head, because then you have a long way to go down when it fails to materialize.Oh well, Dr. Miller's book is an entertaining read nevertheless.The principles espoused in these kinds of books aren't the easiest things to put into practice. Ah well, but at least the authors make a nice living at it.Oddly enough, I still think the principles ARE workable, but for those of us (actually a GREAT MANY of us) who can't make them work properly, there may be a case where we may be sabotaging ourselves subconsciously.But after the years of negativity our subconscious is fed from early childhood (again, for a lot of us), it's a bit like trying to untangle wet noodles. The psyche is a very complex thing to deal with. Look at the millions spending years in therapy in one form or another (be it clinical or religious).I know a little something of that, having spent time as a volunteer counselor back in college, \\"trying\\" to help people with serious problems.For those who can get instantaneous results, I envy them, because they have a clear channel, at least where their particular objective is concerned, but for people like me, the waters I guess are a bit more muddy.I've been trying to clear my subconscious, but I sadly just haven't made any discernible progress in all these years. I feel like I've been running on a treadmill.Anyway, sorry for the long discourse, but I'd been mulling writing something like this about books like Carolyn Miller's.You read a lot of reviews from professional reviewers about how \\"great\\" these books are, but you don't read much from people who've actually tried to put into practice the principles.Like Wayne Dyer in the PBS specials lecturing the audience. I always thought he should include a Q&A.; Actually, I like Wayne Dyer, he's one of those \\"gurus\\" who tries to expand the concept of \\"self help\\" to outside himself by making his books reasonably priced."},{"Title":"Creating Miracles: A Practical Guide to Divine Intervention","review":"Creating Miracles excited me to the core of my being. I have seen and felt its principles operating in my life and have learned that we all have the power to access a spiritual and mental state that allows us to surrender to God/Spirit and find the path to living a passionate, purpose-filled, and yes, miracle-filled life.In Creating Miracles, Carolyn Miller provides the keys to help us see, understand and find our way through the maze that is life and to take an active role in consciously creating our own miracles. It is one of the most valuable books I have read because it fills my world with the grace and freedom that comes from learning how to live with peace and serenity, trusting that all is as it should be in this moment, and knowing how to create a more desirable future.I have recommended Creating Miracles to many many friends and given it as gifts.

Miller captures the emotional spark and personality of those involved, and gives us a front-row seat as miracles unfold. Many of these stories describe people who survived accidents and escaped assaults in situations where they easily might have died or been seriously injured instead. Miller explains how changes in people's thinking leads to changes in the circumstances in their lives, even when the situation appears to be hopeless.

George K. Bradley tells the tail of Samuel Insull's effort to consolidate several Indiana interurbans into one large mass transit system. The pictures and their captions alone tell a very effective story, along with the map on page 4.Unfortunately for Samuel Insull, the Great Depression, and the development of improved highways, condemned the Indiana Railroad and Insull's utility empire to a tragic end. Little by little rideship fell off. The Morgan banks called several of Insull's loans in 1932, and refused to grant any extensions. A tragic 1936 accident and an ill-timed 1937 strike helped seal the fate of the Indiana Railroad. Throughout the 1930s interurban lines were abandoned, and eventually the Fort Wayne, Muncie, Anderson, and Indianapolis line; the Indianapolis to Louisville, Kentucky line; and the Indianapolis to Terra Haute line fell by 1940 or 1941; ushering an end to high speed electric mass transit in Indiana.This is a cautionary tail of emerging technologies, high expectations, and financial risk.

Julian creates a lead character who is supposed to be strong and independent, yet is prone to run screaming hysterically about, making paranoid accusations and bursting into tears -- but moments later she is fine. No explanation given. She has the poor leading male character twisting about so often he comes off sounding like a weak, mean spirited brute -- not the tormented soul she likely was hoping to create. But one thing that did make this book interesting was that from the very beginning you get a feeling that things are not what they seem. The author drops subtle hints of things to come and the suspense does indeed build. Initially it was fun trying to figure out how it would all end. I read Julian's &quot;Bad Moon Rising&quot; and loved it. I was hoping for the same suspense here. But soon it became apparent the author just started writing with no clear plan of where she was going. Suddenly she realized she had to wrap things up and she did a poor job of it. Nearly everyone turned out to be evil, characters were thrown in in an effort to tie up loose ends, and the chemistry between players just fizzled. It was a disappointing end to a well-worn but somewhat promising story."},{"Title":"Mirror, Mirror","review":"This was my first Donna Julian novel and I enjoyed it very much, after reading the other reviews on the page I felt that they were a bit harsh.

Though he was very alpha, I liked the hero. He and the heroine made a great couple, even if he thought he hated her for most of the novel. Even if their first love scene was a bit... rough. Also, though the amnesia plot has been done before, this book made it fresh and interesting.But as I read on, I kept shaking my head at plot holes, subplots that went nowhere, and secondary characters that were wasted. (Sometimes literally!)On top of all that, the Big Surprise is too incredible to believe. It hinged on too many HUGE coincidences."},{"Title":"The Story of Papiamentu: A Study in Slavery and Language","review":"Anyone studying the Papiamentu language should read this book. Fouse, the author, gives a history of the language, presenting linguistic and historical evidence that it was originally based on Portuguese and has ties to Cape Verdean Creole (Kriolu).In part one, Fouse explains pidgins and creoles and then introduces the basics of the language, giving the etymologies of some words including djarason (Wednesday) as \\"day of [weekly] rations\\" (here I have used the Bonairean spelling). Part two traces the history of slavery in Portuguese West Africa, the Spanish destruction of the native Caiquetios on Aruba, Curaao, and Bonaire, and the Dutch rule of the ABC islands since the struggles of 1634 through 1636. Part three presents the many influences on the development of Papiamentu, including Portuguese slavers, African languages, Sephardic merchants, Spanish Catholic church workers, Dutch landowners and administrative personnel, oral versus written transmission, and the issue of standardization. In part four, Fouse describes the present situation of Papiamentu, including the diaspora of Papiamentu speakers and the future prospects for the language.As the book went to press, it was not well proofread. However, the many problems with punctuation and the occasional problems with spelling originate with the editors of the University Press of America and not with the author. At places, the book seems to have been written to meet a deadline. Indications of this rush to completion include unexpected and unilluminating repetitions of information. Fortunately, these problems present a minor irritant and do not negate this book as a source of information.This book fills what would otherwise remain a void for the prospective student of the Papiamentu language. It should be considered as required reading both for the classroom student and for the independent learner."},{"Title":"The Story of Papiamentu: A Study in Slavery and Language","review":"When I bought this book on Amazon, it cost me 25 cents. That is about what it is worth. It is a shame that such an interesting topic as Papiamentu should be given such a slapdash treatment. A reviewer below seems to blame the editors, but the editors didn't write the thing, they just didn't fix it. I managed to finish the book despite the horrible writing, which goes beyond punctuation mistakes and repeated information. It is full of non-sequiturs, parenthetical notes (that do repeat the same information they are describing), subordinate clauses that do not refer back to anything, and a terrible overuse of the \\"etc.\\". This all makes for a very confusing read. Fouse is not a writer or scholar - he is a former customs and DEA agent turned ESL teacher (check out his blog \\"fousesquawk\\") and is now a dilettante who chose a very interesting topic and bogged it down in such poor writing as to make excruciating. I give him credit for trying, though, and for his love of the language."},{"Title":"The Story of Papiamentu: A Study in Slavery and Language","review":"I found The Story of Papiamentu an interesting and refreshing study of Papiamentu en read it with pleasure."},{"Title":"Ronald Reagan: The Great Communicator","review":"This book is one of those I refer to as a bathroom book.

She loves to read all books, but when I brought this one home to my 16 month old, she went crazy over it. With the dog finger puppet as the charm of this book, it makes the book actually come ALIVE and interact with her. I truly believe this is a book she will always remember from her childhood. It's very different than any other book I have seen. The puppy is very cute in the story. He plays with all the different farm animals. The story reads where you make the sounds each animal makes, so its fun to let the puppy act this out. My daughter loves it because she can touch and feel it as she hears the story being read to her AND she sees the puppy moving at the same time. I love it so much, I am buying 3 more as gifts for friends children. By the way, my 5 year old was entertained by it too. Excellent choice for an unforgettable childrens book."},{"Title":"Yankee Dutchman: The Life of Franz Sigel","review":"German-Americans, during the Civil War, were proud of saying \\"I fights mit Sigel.\\" Franz Sigel was a German officer, who fled to the United States after an unsuccessful insurrection, in which he played a role as an officer of a revolutionary force (in 1848). The purpose of the book is straightforward. In the author's words (page xix): \\"The purpose in this study is to understand Franz Sigel's life, to venture some explanations, and to provide a framework that would make sense to the reviewer.The first chapter focuses on Sigel's background, from his birth in Baden to his retreat after the unsuccessful military venture into Switzerland. The crushing of the republican forces was an event that colored Sigel's later life. He was a \\"champion of idealism, liberalism, and democracy\\" (page 25), but failed to achieve those goals in Germany. These factors are part of the context for his declaring for the Union at the outset of the Civil War, after he arrived in the United States in 1852.It is his performance in the Civil War that is central to people's views of Sigel. In early small-scale conflicts, he had some success in Missouri. Part of his importance was generating many German recruits flocking to the Union forces. His popularity among Germans and his ability to inspire new recruits into the Union Army helped him last as long as he did as a field commander. In his first major battles, Wilson's Creek, he convince the commanding general to try a Robert E. Lee-like division of forces to strike the larger Confederate Army from front and flank. At this stage of the war, this was essentially not very practical. The end result? A Union defeat and the death of General Nathaniel Lyon.I won't be tedious, going over battle after battles in which Sigel fought. Two illustrate: At Pea Ridge (Or Elkhorn Tavern), he began slowly, but actually had one of his few really good days of the war on the second and final day of the battle. It may be that the commanding general, Samuel Curtis, was the kind of take-charge commander he needed to work under (he was never very good in independent command, as later events would show). At Second Manassas, his generalship (he served as a corps commander) was uninspired, as was normal. He was finally shelved.However, historically, he was an interesting figure in that, despite his flaws as a commander, he did elevate \\"the status of Germans in an American society and by raising the national consciousness of Americans\\" (page 233). Overall, the book is pretty well written, although sometimes matters might be more clearly explicated. Nonetheless, to get a better understanding of an important Union general, this is a good volume."},{"Title":"Yankee Dutchman: The Life of Franz Sigel","review":"A very enjoyable look at one of the greatest German Americans involved with the Civil War. Tracks his early days to his time as a commander in the Union Army. Engle provides the reader with a new insight into Sigel's life, with a fresh style that never disappoints. A book that is long over due and finally pays tribute to a forgotten figure of the Civil War. A great addition to a Civil War collection, especially if you are interested in Civil War biographies."},{"Title":"Yankee Dutchman: The Life of Franz Sigel","review":"Engle's description of Sigel's controversial Civil War career is sketchy, lacking in detail. We don't learn, for instance, why the German-born general was transferred East in 1862 (Sigel, among other things, felt slighted by General S. R. Curtis's official report on the battle of Pea Ridge); there's virtually nothing on his threatened resignation in the autumn of the same year, or the infighting among the ethnic generals (Schurz, Stahel, v. Steinwehr) in Sigel's Reserve Grand Division regarding the latter's succession as head of the 11th Corps.On 15 February 1863, Sigel wrote to his wife: \\"It is certainly very hard to have to bear neglect, but when this war is over, people will ask very little whether this or that West Pointer played me tricks, but they will ask what I have accomplished. The obstacles that stood in my way, and against which I have had to fight at all times, and which I have often overcome, will only make it easier the better to assess what I have achieved.\\"If you are looking for such quotations, you are looking in vain.

It's done in a way that allows for self-study, which is how I used it. One thing I liked about it is that it doesn't try to be cute and amusing like many language textbooks do in order to keep your attention, while often forgetting to include good information. Instead, Ollivier gets right down to the question at hand which is studying grammar and vocab, and the fact that she does it in a thorough and organized way is what kept me involved. She also does it almost entirely in French. The only reason why I might have taken off a star is that I would have liked to have more exercises with corrections, but I believe that most of the exercises are intended as homework assignments for class, and I made do.

Except for the magnificent photographs and illustrations, the average reader will likely find much of the material presented somewhat tedious and at times rather boring.The book is written very much in line with the modern approach to history in that information is not presented in chronological order, and the exploits of those leaders who made the history happen are minimized or all but left out of the story. On the contrary, most of the book's chapters deal with subjects that would only be of interest to true scholars of the ancient world (e.g. the environment; the rich and poor; the average women, children, and men; etc.). Each chapter is written by a different expert in his or her particular field, and each one is essentially a stand-alone entity. All of the authors are obviously erudite, but just as clearly some are better writers than others. This constant shifting of gears and styles eliminates any possible thread of historical continuity.So, unless you are a true scholar concerned with all things about ancient Greece or are studying ancient Greece, you would be well advised to first concentrate on reviewing the photographs and reading their captions. Then pick and chose those chapters which are in your realm of interest and skip the rest. In all probability, no one will ever ask you what the average man, woman, or child ate for dinner in ancient Greece and, even if they did you probably wouldn't remember anyway."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Illustrated History of Ancient Greece (Cambridge Illustrated Histories)","review":"The Cambridge Illustrated History of Ancient Greece is dedicated to giving an objective perspective of ancient Greek civilization, and culture. Filled with photos of beautiful Greek pottery, this book is a treasure in both the pictures of pottery that it contains, and the well written descriptions it gives of this glorious culture. Although classified as a reference in most local libraries, The Cambridge Illustrated History of Ancient Greece can be read like any other chapter book with a historical perspective. Unlike other works on ancient Greece, this book is dedicated to giving an unbiased, factual record of Greek civilization, while devoting as much attention to ancient wars, as to social structure. It will not lead you to one particular conclusion about Greek civilization, as other books do, but will introduce you to the latest theories, and perspectives of ancient Greek lifestyle, and belief systems. This book covers every aspect of Greek civilization, from Socrates to Plato, to Aristophanes, as well as Greek art, religion, myths, wars, etc., devoting a chapter to each main idea. It is a well written, high quality book, which can be read by beginners, and people who are well versed in Greek history alike, and I would recommend The Cambridge Illustrated History of Ancient Greece to anyone who loves this glorious culture as much as I do."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Illustrated History of Ancient Greece (Cambridge Illustrated Histories)","review":"I really like this book. The writing is very informative, but I also appreciated the illustrations. There are lots of them, and they are fully explained.

Sometimes the pictures don't exactly match the accompanying text, and this breaks your train of reading, but that's a minor flaw. This book is good for both beginners and Greek history buffs alike. If you are interested in classical Greek history, read this book."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Illustrated History of Ancient Greece (Cambridge Illustrated Histories)","review":"I feel the book is really a 3.5-star as Cambridge's Illustrated Series 'Ancient Greece' is a very good introductory text that is not a doctoral socio-political analysis or an advanced level chronological review of Greece's evolution from polis to Hellenism such as the massive Cambridge 'Ancient History' editions. It therefore makes it an ideal text for general readers and beginning students despite having some deficiencies that can be easily supplemented by another publisher's as a companion text.The book is suited for readers ages 12 and up and treats the subject more as a primarily anthropological and interdisciplinary approach to the subject covering things such art, political intitutions, urban life, and how their legacy remains with us today. A collaboration of various respected scholars with different specialties provides readers with a multi-faceted view of Greek civilization without bogging them down with a tedious chronological approach focusing primarily on a geopolitical evolution of its social and military institutions along with its principal agents. Its subjects are illustrated by a good amount of color photographs, drawings, and diagrams, giving the reader a useful visual aid for an enhanced perspective of the subject.Although it has great qualities, I find it insufficient for general education college classes as its subjects are too limited and without enough detail as to social and political topics in particular. Leslie and Roy Adkins' 'A Handbook to Life In Ancient Greece' is more thoroughly edited and organized than this text despite their having black and white illustrations as opposed to color. The Adkins text is also categorically organized as well, but its approach is more sociopolitical and encyclopedic, giving much more detailed information on a much broader subject range: especially military, economic, and political topics. Its detailed illustrations, maps, and thorough categorical summaries give the reader a better idea how major Greece's impact was on the modern world in its ideas of the city-state, art, philosopy, and cutlure. At the very least, both texts should be bought together as complements for the general reader to really have a complete overview of the progression and impact of Roman history: none are very expensive at $20-$40 each.Cambridge Illustrated History 'Ancient Greece' is a good introductory text that would appeal to a wide general audience ages 12 and up and that would make a fine high school or general education-level college class as a main text. Covering a broad category of topics from various disciplines, the reader will be informed of Greek civilization's evolution and continuing legacy in the modern world. Its drawback is it may be too general as to some subjects which would be complemented with Leslie and Roy Adkins' equally affordable and outstanding summary text 'A Handbook to Life In Ancient Greece.' Both texts allow the reader appreciate how the small Greeks polis and the culture that created it paved the way for our modern political institutions and secular states that prize democracy, science, and rationalism above anything else. I strongly recommend getting both to anyone who wants a broad yet comprehensive overview of Greek civilization."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Illustrated History of Ancient Greece (Cambridge Illustrated Histories)","review":"Better than expected.

I thought the plot trivial, the heroine insipid and overall wondered if the author, always one of my favorites,was losing her magical touch that had inspired me for over 20 years. Now, upon listening to the audio book version read by the talented Jane Asher, I believe my first impressions was wrong.Granted Geillis Ramsey is not Mary Stewart's typical heroine: the career girl on vacation or on the new job who through a set of odd happenstances literally must fend for her life. Geillis is reflective. While Ms Stewart's other heroines, report and record the vivid locales through the sense-provoking medium of the author's glorious prose, Geillis Ramsey revels in it. She is an older contemplative Ms Stewart telling of her love of home, relating small yet monumentally beautiful occurrences of her own life, set in the green splendour of the UK. At the same time, she weaves these &quot;little things&quot; into a feasible fictional story of a lonely girl who with the help of an older unorthodox cousin finds her special niche in terms of self, community and finally love. The elan of witchcraft interjects a minor touch of the old Stewart suspense, but, on the whole, I believe this is Ms Stewart's tribute to life, love, and nature.Lyrically beautiful and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Thornyhold","review":"I've been reading Mary Stewart since high school, which was a long time ago.

But they were not necessarily simpler or less complicated times...Thornyhold is less well known than Steward's tour-de-force Merlin/Arthurian novels, but still one of my favorites. Where many of her novels have modern (for the time) heroines, fighting villains in the form of thieves, murderers, selfish relatives, whatever, Gillie has less obvious battles to fight. Set in post-World War II England, where rationing still held sway and everyone knew their neighbors, Thornyhold is much like it's heroine: deep, introspective, self-depreciating, and ultimately, quietly triumphant -- much like their author.If you are looking for excitement, battles, gunfights, and torrid love affairs, it isn't for you. But if you are looking for a truly brilliant example of character development, where gaining self knowledge is important...look into this gem."},{"Title":"Thornyhold","review":"Mary Stewart's rhythm lulls me.

Gothic Romance is one of my favorite generas and this book fits the description. This was also my first book by Mary Stewart. I had read other reviews about her books before and I have always wanted to read her. She sort of reminds me of Barbara Michaels. I started out really enjoying this book. Our heroine is Gilly and she has had a rough childhood filled for the most part without love. Her only good childhood memories involve her spinster cousin who is also her godmother, and most likely a witch. So when she inherits her godmother's home, Thornyhold she also inherits all the creepy problems that come with it and it might be more than she baragined for. The only reason why I didn't like this book more was because I found the romance to be a bit cheesy but I know what can you expect from a gothic romance novel. For the most part the novel flowed really well and I enjoyed all of the descriptions of English countrysides and the way this author walked along the thin line of reality."},{"Title":"Thornyhold","review":"Those readers who love the vivid, lyrical prose of Stewart's novels shouldn't be disappointed in this offering, although be warned, it DOES differ from her earlier works.Thornyhold a more subtle and contemplative story then you might be used to when it comes to reading Stewart. After all, she was in her 70's when she wrote this, and I imagine she was harkening back to her youth while penning \\"Thornyhold\\". Generally absent is the suspense and romance so magically woven throughout in \\"The Moonspinners\\", \\"Madam, Will You Talk\\" or \\"This Rough Magic\\". Instead, there is a magic of another kind here: a gentle, hearth-and-home-loving tale of a home well loved and much desired, and an ode to the beauty of a time and place now gone but fondly remembered by the author.I can't really put into words how much this story affected me. It was as if Stewart had looked into my heart much like cousin Geillis looked into Gilly's heart and provided the nourishment for her soul that she craved....and Stewart did the same for me with \\"Thornyhold\\"."},{"Title":"Thornyhold","review":"After you're read this book. I read it when it first came out, and have loved it since, and periodically reread it. It is a romance, of sorts, and a gothic, of sorts, but I'm not one for gothics or romances, so that isn't really the attraction. When I read it, I empathized with the main character, who as a child wished for nothing more than a country life with animals and is left a mysterious legacy to fulfill that very wish. The romance, when it comes, is welcome, but she was doing very well just on her own. If you would love to tend a garden and a cottage, in a largely deserted wood (with a market town a few miles bike ride away), then this is the book for you. The author dwells lovingly on the simple sweets of putting the long neglected house to rights, marketing for her rationed goods on her bike, making bramble jelly, nursing back to health an abused recue dog. It sounds like an idyllic life. If you long for something less frantic and busy than the modern world and a modern job, you may wish for something like Miss Ramsey, who was given as a legacy a cottage, a garden complete with herb beds,surrounded by a woods and a river, with plenty of room for animals and a bit to live on so she doesn't have to go out to work. That's the real magic of this story. The romance is nice, but not the real attraction of the book for me.

You can feel the warmth of a summer day, smell an early morning or a rainfall, see the reflection of the moon on a starlit bay. What's more, you are transported into the life of the narrator: Your stomach tightens as Charity Selbourne flees her pursuer in \\"Madame, Will You Talk,\\" or Linda Martin and her charge, Philippe, flee their imagined enemy in \\"Nine Coaches Waiting.\\" Such is the case with \\"Thornyhold.\\"This is a book you can escape into, as it takes place a few years after World War II, when the world was on the precipice of a time of unbridled optimism and boundless change. But rural England was much the same as it had been 20 years before.And that's the charm here: This is a story you get lost in, if only for a brief time. It is not as complex and layered as some of Stewart's books, but it is charming in a gentle way. As usual, Stewart's characters are deftly created.The books gets off to a slow start, but it picks up once Gilly moves into her cousin's cottage.

She makes certain that young Jilly is provided for when her parents leave her alone in the world as a young woman with no real prospects. She gives her Thornyhold, a beautiful old Georgian House that once belonged to a witch named Goody Gostelow, which becomes a refuge for the poor young Geillis.But how truly safe is she at her new shelter? A disturbing dream, messages from the great beyond, and neighbors who send out mixed signals as to whether or not they want her there leave Geillis wondering about the sanctity of her new home and the sanity of her mind.What worked for me:For the most part this is a very gentle pastoral story filled with lovely descriptions of a time gone by in the countryside of England 50+ years ago when not all houses had phones, neighbors dropped in to clean your house with you, and herbal remedies were more trusted than doctor's prescriptions. But the first few chapters about Geillis as a child, which were necessary to show why she is the way she is and add depth to the story, were decidedly sad in several places.Size-wise Geillis wasn't really described, but her neighbor was a fairly large woman.What didn't work for me:Because of its idyllic pace it didn't have me on the edge of my seat the way I expect a gothic romance should. In fact the romance and even the suspense in \\"Thornyhold\\" were very mild, almost secondary even, so that I think the book seems more like a light paranormal fiction than a gothic.Overall:A very sweet story worth indulging in, especially if you are a fan of witches and/or gardening.Warning: There are a few references to the occult in this novel.If you liked \\"Thornyhold\\" you might also enjoy \\"The Dancing Floor\\"."},{"Title":"Thornyhold","review":"Mary Stewart wrote many exciting novels, but \\"Thornyhold\\" is my favorite.

Thornyhold was a dower house inhabited by the upright wife of a wicked rake of the Victorian era. Sybil was succeeded by our heroine's mother's cousin, Geillis, and, in turn, by our heroine, another Geillis. The three &quot;witches&quot; are not quite the same, but share a taste for healing, and a love of animals. As our Geillis' talent is nurtured in the house in the woods, she finds herself in need of more than herbal wards to protect herself from the unwanted attentions of another woman in the area who considers herself something of a witch -- and not precisely a white one at that.Stewart does a nice job of preserving ambiguity, allowing dual explanations for nearly every event in the book, without it becoming mechanical or some sort of apology.

I enjoyed the description of the house and the countryside more than the story line, but I wish the Author would have developed the character of the Aunt a bit more - I felt it could be much more descriptive. I'm not sure if the Author ever wrote a prequel but I feel like one would be mildly entertaining. The ending was happily ever after but too predictable for my liking. This is meant to be a simple read - Also might be good for a preteen."},{"Title":"Thornyhold","review":"This book was an enjoyable read, however I found the storyline to be lacking a bit and highly predictable. It was still a good read and I would recommend it, however, if you're expecting something thrilling and romantic this book is not for you. It's entertaining at most, but the ending was rushed, like the author had only ten minutes to pop out an ending. If she had taken her time to write a hearty ending, I would have given this book five stars."},{"Title":"Thornyhold","review":"Thornyhold is the third novel of Mary Stewart's that I've read; although I generally enjoy Stewart's novels, I'd definitely say this wasn't as good asNine Coaches WaitingorThe Ivy Tree.Geillis has just inherited Thornyhold, an 18th century house that had once apparently belonged to a Victorian-era witch, from her cousin, also named Geillis. Upon moving to the house, Geillis becomes caught up in its atmosphere, even taking on her cousin's reputation as a witch.Stewart definitely has a flair for the dramatic, and for infusing her stories and settings with magic. There's a sort of dreamlike quality about Thornyhold. But here, I felt that something was missing--the novel (really a novella) was too short for character development, too short for the development of the romance. Stewart's other novels had villains that were creepy; the \\"villain\\" in this novel is sort of caricaturish. In addition, the novel is quite sad in some places as Geillis describes to the reader what her childhood was like. I'm still a fan of Mary Stewart's, though. She really knows how to craft a novel that's got atmosphere."},{"Title":"Thornyhold","review":"Gilly Ramsey is at a crossroad. Her parents, a clergyman and his bored wife, die (though not at the same time), and now her home has to be sold to another member of the clergy. She has nobody. She'd once wanted to become a teacher, had in fact gone to a boarding school where she was constantly bullied by the senior students, but that won't be possible. She remembers a cousin of hers (not her aunt, like the Amazon review says) -- a fascinating woman who seems to have magic powers -- but she hasn't seen her in years. But then something happens. Just when Gilly is at a loss of what to do, her cousin comes to the rescue. She passed away recently and left Gilly her home in the country. Thrilled, Gilly sets out to the Thornyhold estate, where she meets various interesting characters (including a maid that seems at first like a more benign version of Mrs. Danvers), and where she discovers that everyone there is under the impression that Cousin Geillis had been a witch. And if the previous owner was a witch, then she must be one too, right?Mary Stewart drew me in with Nine Coaches Waiting and The Ivy Tree. Thornyhold, on the other hand, never quite managed to interest me. Perhaps it was because the book is too short (only a little over 200 pages), or perhaps it was because the story and characters seem sketchy throughout the book. Only Cousin Geillis manages to be interesting, but she is scarcely in the book. But the real reason I couldn't get into this book is because, to be frank, it's boring. At least it is to me. I read it during the train ride to and from work yesterday, and while it was a quick two sitting read, I had to literally force myself to finish it. So, my opinion is different from the majority of reviewers here, who seem to have loved the book. I still have faith in Stewart though. I have Madam, Will You Talk? and Airs Above the Ground on my TBR pile and I hope that those books are more like the previous two. But if you're in the bargain for a quick read, and you like Stewart, then I won't discourage you from getting it. After all, based on the glowing reviews here, your opinion might differ from mine."},{"Title":"Leaving","review":"\\"Leaving\\" depicts a family through the memories of a narrator whose history is infused with stories from Poland, Argentina, and the United States. The narrator seeks to find a home, seeks peace through the telling of (the translating of) his family story to his American interlocutor. The narrator struggles to find identity among the ghosts, to find place amid the comfort of a love affair.Waisman's deft use of language (\\"The nation is a linguistic concept, a magnet of memories...\\") and keen ability to evoke a variety of locales and time periods with concise and vivid scenes infuses the book with a timeless quality. Each piece, each fragment in \\"Leaving\\" builds on the last to inform and evoke a sense of longing, a struggle to define oneself through nation or family or home.Waisman experiments with language as his narrator seeks to translate and define his surroundings--be it San Francisco or Buenos Aires--exploring how language is shaped by environment, how place dictates identity.The narrator tells the stories of others but he also begins to weave his own story of migration, adding to the stories of his family: listening to the whir of a sewing machine, the ticking timepieces in a grandfather's repair shop, the sound of music echoing across time and place.\\"Leaving\\" is a unique and evocative telling of a universal tale in which the stories that populate families both inform our own and compel us to create our own history."},{"Title":"Leaving","review":"LEAVING was an absolute pleasure to read.Waisman's prose is lyrical and thought-provoking, the kind of writing that has you savoring sentences, underlining, dog-earing pages to be able to return and re-read the most well-turned of his phrases. I found myself reluctant to leave each one of the narrator's locales, only to appreciate the next, with its attendant cast of characters, more and more fully.The experimental aspects of the novel--the middle section in Spanish, the scientific subtexts, the temporal shifts--all are so effective in underscoring the narrator's quest.And yet what stood out most poignantly, and what continues to intrigue me, is Waisman's deft treatment of issues of how language and interpersonal connection shape our experience. Few books can take up such heady material and render it so beautifully vivid.Waisman has done a great job--I eagerly await more of his work!"},{"Title":"Leaving","review":"Leaving is a literary novel that traces the story of three migrations: a Jewish family's move from Poland to Argentina (between the two World Wars); part of that family's exit from Argentina to the United States (during the political upheavals of the 1970s); and the contemporary travels of the protagonist (the inheritor of all previous migrations) and his American girlfriend (and later fianc e) in the United States.

The family memories take the reader to Buenos Aires, to the voyage from Poland to the Americas, to New York, Paris, Champaign/Urbana, Providence, Boulder, San Diego and San Francisco, among other places. In the process, Leaving explores what it means to be Jewish Latin American (Argentine, in this case), as well as what happened to that mixed heritage once it is exiled from South America in the U.S. The novel is written primarily in English, with some Spanish idioms scattered throughout; there is also one brief section (5 pages) that is entirely in Spanish, and purposefully left untranslated. Leaving is a unique novel, as it tells the stories of the family at its center, while exploring broader themes of memory, language and translation in issues of identity and cross-cultural communication. Latin American identity takes on specific aspects in this novel. With respect not only to Argentine culture, but also to the manifestations and memories of that Jewish Argentine culture once the main character in the novel have to leave Argentina and move to the United States after the military coup of 1976. In addition, the novel's very style and structure (an experimental, fragmented collection of interconnected narratives) seeks to mirror the difficulty in recounting and understanding past events, especially as they are distorted by conflicting versions of history and the uncertainty of memory itself, as well as by the changes in languages associated with each migration, with each \\"leaving.\\"- - - - - - - -\\"Excellent first novel.

The title became for me a visual pun, since I always carry a book wherever I go, and as I stuffed this one into my backpack, I'd smile as I watched the word \\"Leaving\\" disappear. The sections featuring the main character's parents and grandparents are memorable, as are those about his childhood in Beunos Aires. So much about the family and its integration within a larger Argentine community is revealed in the scene where the small boy is seated on his father's shoulders at a Peron rally. Another moment that powerfully affected me occurred during the novel's short (a few pages) Spanish-language section. The statement/accusation/reminder \\"but you guys left\\" is rendered in Spanish, even though the speaker (the main character's California-born girlfriend) is presumably using English at the time. \\"Ustedes se fueron, no te olvides.\\" This single, unobtrusive sentence reveals the survival guilt that underlies the narrator's melancholy. His sadness, pervasive in the novel though never plainly stated, is devoid of false sentiment and reductive theories. Finally, I appreciated the maturity of the main character, especially in his accounts of his love life. His search for a better translation of his own identity as a Jewish Argentine ex-patriot is joined to an almost phlegmatic stability unusual in a quester. Memory is key to his investigations, and the author makes very effective use of repetition of significant recollected images: eucalyptus; the rubber tree; coffee and mate drinking around a kitchen table. If our human mind tends to jump with pathological quickness past moments of departure in order to focus on new beginnings, this novel provides a tonic, causing us to pause and appreciate all that endings may contain."},{"Title":"Fifteen years in hell: An autobiography","review":"This is a autobiography about the author's recovery from alcohol.

Her book is griping. You cannot stop reading even as you are horrified and pained by what she has to tell you. And what she has to tell is very much about how loss, painful loss crosses generations. This is a book very much about grief across generations in a single American family. Maggie does not prettify the range of emotions that come with tragic loss. She is not afraid to show the rage as well as the sorrow and how these emotions are mixed and intermingled."},{"Title":"Jane: A Murder (Soft Skull ShortLit)","review":"Jane's diaries are extraordinary; oh, maybe they're not but Maggie Nelson frames them in an extraordinarily telling manner, abstracting their most beautiful or witty parts so that often she comes across as a teenage Marquise du Deffand. Considering that Nelson had only two journals to work with, written many years apart, she mines them wonderfully, and part of the heartbreak is realizing how much Jane has grown in the gap of missing years between 1960 and 1966. Sometimes the older Jane strikes a note of spiritual exhaustion, like Francoise Sagan last year at Marienbad: \\"Cigarettes--one after the other; why?\\" And the 1966 Jane sometimes seems a little bit like the questioning heroine of the \\"Go Ask Alice\\" diaries, a far cry from her innocent days of youth, in which it was bliss to be alive.And yet what Nelson does with this material is in the end a fit memorial for a woman we feel we might almost know, except an evil spirit came down on Michigan and began stamping out its most beautiful citizens. Nelson has attained a niche in both true crime and poetry; has any other writer really been in this crazy space before? The life that she had, born in the wake of this terrible murder, has been a haunted one; for better or for worse poetry got a hold of her. JANE A MURDER is nearly a novel, for it has a strong subplot that culminates in the early death, revealed in \\"The Burn,\\" of her father, described almost as an apple, strawberry, or rose. \\"I remember thinking he looked really, really red,\\" a classmate tells Maggie. \\"Like he was about to burst.\\"The trope of bursting is everywhere in these plain and wonderfully turned poems. Ripeness is all, a surreal ripeness like the bright beating bead at the end of the thermometer. A friend recommended this book for its therapeutic value, as though Nelson had healed herself, or her family, through writing it all out, but I don't think that it's about rescue per se, it's more about noticing how vivid it all is, life, death, going away, coming back, the pulsating world."},{"Title":"Jane: A Murder (Soft Skull ShortLit)","review":"When a person is murdered, that single fact frequently overshadows the person they were or could have become. In Jane:A Murder, Maggie Nelson gives us a glimpse into her Aunt Jane's life via her Jane's diary entries, stories told by family and friends, and through Maggie Nelson's own poetry. What comes through is a life cut tragically short. Jane had a depth and clarity of thought as a teenager that I am still yet to achieve in my 30's. She was a social activist, a brilliant writer, and so much more than a headline.I literally cried in certain places and devoured the book in less than 24 hours. I was unable to walk away from Jane.

Among the particulars that reading Cranford the book put my mind at ease about are why Miss Mattie's brother Peter never wrote or returned home and how Martha and her beau end up married and living with Miss Mattie. Also, after watching the TV series it was a treat to have a little more time to spend with the wonderful women of Cranford in their book forms."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"As with all of the other Gaskell books I've read, this was extremely well-written and a pleasure to get lost in the time and place. It did not truly grab my interest on an emotional level until the end because the story itself was not that strong, but how interesting could it be when it revolved around the lives of a bunch of spinsters? I did enjoy reading about the mindset of that group of women and as I had known already, their focus on the trivial. But wouldn't life be great if that was all that one had to worry about. And that's the feeling I had about Cranford itself.There was a good amount of humour and some human interest lessons that proved valuable and thought provoking. The spinster character type is often portrayed in a minor or negative way and it was nice to see them in a harmless, charming light."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"Cranford is one of the better-known novels of the 19th century English writer Elizabeth Gaskell. It was first published in 1851 as a serial in the magazine Household Words, which was edited by Charles Dickens. The fictional town of Cranford is closely modelled on Knutsford in Cheshire, which Mrs. Gaskell knew well. The book has little in the way of plot and is more a series of episodes in the lives of Mary Smith and her friends, Miss Matty and Miss Deborah, two spinster sisters.But what is it about Cranford and its deceptively simple tales of country life that makes the work so appealing? It has been aptly described as \`a piece of exquisite social painting' ... \`tender' and \`delicate.' Narrated by Mary Smith, a friend of Miss Matty and frequent visitor to Cranford, the lives, loves, tragedies, and triumphs of the inhabitants of Cranford are woven together seamlessly to create a tapestry portraying timeless emotions and choices.The petty social bickering, cold shouldering and jockeying for importance in the village's pecking order are outlined in a humorous yet pointed way--the author loves her characters, with all their faults, and is tolerant of their foibles while holding them up to gentle ridicule. In every community there is an arbiter of good taste, a setter of trends, a leader of public opinion, and all the other social whimsies that make up this colourful collection of characters. It is not easy to keep secrets in this closed environment, and as Mary Smith remarks, \\"It was impossible to live a month at Cranford, and not know the daily habits of each resident ....\\" Despite the squabbles and occasional \`no speaks,' the ladies of Cranford would rather die than see one of their own fall by the wayside. It is the community spirit that inspires Miss Matty's friends to decide to donate a portion of their annual income to sustain their beloved friend when an investment goes sour.As a different kind of history book and one that very possibly the author did not set out to write as such, Cranford is actually an analysis of an early Victorian country town. The inhabitants are shaken and disturbed by inevitable changes such as industrialization, the advent of the railway and other events that force an inescapable transition into an increasingly modern world.The appeal of Cranford cannot be better described than in the popularity of the BBC drama series. The teleplay by Heidi Thomas was adapted from three novellas by Elizabeth Gaskell published between 1849 and 1858: Cranford, My Lady Ludlow, and Mr. Harrison's Confessions. (The Last Generation in England was also used as a source.)A gentle, charming read, Cranford has much more to offer the discerning reader than a unassuming look at country life."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"This was a birthday gift for my younger granddaughter.

They have small private incomes (Matty has 127 pounds a year and a pound contained a third of an ounce of gold - a new silk dress costs five pounds) and observe lives constrained by etiquette and class distinction. It has been praised for its &quot;gentle&quot; humor (although I was chilled by the &quot;Irish beggarwoman&quot; saying her children were starving who gets the door shut in her face). I think you have to have a certain interest in how life was lived in 1850 to read it through. In this edition, with the explanatory note it is mine of information on domestic arrangements. The narrator often points out how old-fashioned these ladies are and what fasions are new and draws comparisons going back over fifty years. This adds an extra dimension. The train has arrived but sedan chairs are still used. Some of the explanatory notes are written in British English that needs more explanation to Americans. The introduction by Charlotte Mitchell says a lot more about the place of this book in feminist history. Basically it is something you'd read for historical interest rather than immediate entertainment.

I wish Penguin would release more books in such high quality editions.I'd never read any of Gaskell's work before, so Cranford was a pleasant surprise. It's a lively and warm-hearted novel which will appeal to fans of Garrison Keillor and Alexander McCall Smith.Another reviewer described Cranford as \\"not a novel at all, but rather a series of nostalgic sketches.\\" Certainly Cranford is nostalgic, perhaps even sentimental, but it's more than a series of sketches. I would go so far as to say that Cranford demonstrates a remarkable tightness of plot and character development, though Gaskell works with such a light touch (and elliptical style) that I can see how it would be easy to overlook the unity of the whole novel. If you read Cranford as a collection of anecdotes, I encourage you to ask yourself which parts could be removed without undermining the book."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"In the last few years or so, I've been noting a resurgence of a writer who was very popular in nineteenth century England. Not quite as famous as Charles Dickens or Anthony Trollope, Elizabeth Gaskell did find a niche writing about everyday people in the small towns and villages that dotted England's landscape.Cranford is a slim collection of vignettes. Each little story explores a person, a gathering, or an incident in the past or present. Some are humourous, others are very poignant, and some just look at the life and manners of the time. In specific, to one particular group in the village.For Cranford, as we are told in the opening sentence, is a place that is governed by Amazons. The Amazons are a group of elderly spinsters or widows who have fallen into genteel poverty, supported by meager savings left from legacies and inheritances. As a group, they inhabit nearly all of the homes of Cranford, deciding on questions of taste and morality, the correct behavior of servants, managing gardens, discretion in clothing and so forth. And where are the men, you might ask? Nearly all of them have fled, it seems -- to the military, to the navy, to the nearby city of Dumble (a stand-in for Manchester), frightened off, no doubt, by the formidable array of feminity before them.As the 'leaders,' there are the two daughters of the former vicar of the town. Miss Jenkyns and her younger sister Miss Matty, have risen to a level of respectability in the community, leading their little bevy of companion in acts of charity, mourning, welcoming (and shunning) strangers, and even to such details as what is to be considered suitable literature. When we first meet them, the town has been sent into turmoil by the arrival of a retired military man with two daughters -- and he has the temerity to actually suggest books to Miss Jenkyns. Horrors!But there is more to the story, and as the nameless narrator leads us through the various members of the village, there are stories that are humourous, such as when a string of burglaries occurs, or when a traveling magician arrives. Other stories are very poignant, such as Miss Matty and a collection of old letters, or when a bank in Dumble defaults and one person's savings are wiped out.What makes this collection stand out is the level of compassion between the various women as their little world is shaken up by the encroaching Industrial Age, and their somewhat stubborn intent on keeping their village just the way it is. And underneath some of the bristly exteriors, there are acts of selflessness and care that they extend to each other. This and the humour that the author brought to each story, was what made the book for me.I really don't want to reveal much more of the book as not to spoil it for anyone. The collection itself is rather slim, just sixteen stories of about twenty pages long. Along with the stories, there are extensive notes that have been added by Patricia Ingham, which really do help to understand the terms and usage of the language, and help to clear up some very unfamiliar terms.All in all, a very enjoyable read that is much lighter in tone than most Victorian fiction. Great fun to read, and to sigh over as well.Four stars. Recommended."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"This is a really good edition of the book. If you by classic literature you know that some editions are better than others, this is a very good version of the The Cranford Chronicles.

The story of the town of Cranford and it's inhabitants, the comings and goings, the slow and steady development of the women of Cranford and their coming together."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"Not a novel, not an anthology of short stories, Cranford is perhaps best described as a cohesive series of vignettes. Recounted by a young woman of about 30 from the city of Drumble [Manchester], these stories depict family, friendship, and love lost and found in a village dominated by poor but genteel spinsters and widows. \\". . . all the holders of houses, above a certain rent, are women.\\" Small, rural, and elitist in its way, Cranford is a place out of time, where faded fashions and proprieties still matter.Gaskell begins Cranford with a series of descriptive statements. Some are accurate, while others prove to be ironic. For example, \\"Although the ladies of Cranford know all each other's proceedings, they are exceedingly indifferent to each other's opinions.\\" While discovering Cranford and the Amazons who possess it, we also learn the dry perspective and voice of the narrator, who clearly loves the village while gently highlighting the foibles of its female inhabitants. \\"But I will answer for it, the last gigot, the last tight and scanty petticoat in wear in England, was seen in Cranford--and seen without a smile.\\"Like Gaskell's Wives and Daughters, Cranford is focused on gender roles and the different lives of women and men. The sexes share many characteristics; Captain Brown and Peter Jenkyns display the thoughtful, neighborly solicitude associated with women (with Peter going so far as to don a woman's dress), while Miss Jenkyns (the woman Peter impersonates) exhibits a manly will and resolution. It is the opportunities they have and the way in which they live that separates the sexes. Captain Brown, Peter, and Signor Brunoni have traveled and seen some of the world, and have even influenced it, while Miss Jenkyns, Miss Matty, Miss Price, the narrator, and their friends are constrained by their gender, gentility, and social code to hearth and home. Here, they perform their small household tasks, including ensuring that their maidservants are not disturbed or distracted by \\"followers,\\" or interested young men. The social code that prevents any of them from working in \\"trade\\" also determines the hours that can be spent outside the home. \\"Then there were rules and regulations for visiting and calls . . . 'from twelve to three are our calling-hours.'\\"In such a small, interconnected village, everything that happens is noteworthy, and every decision is important if the occasionally cruel social order is to be maintained. \\"The whole town knew and kindly regarded Miss Betty Barker's Alderney,\\" whose fall into a lime-pit warrants Captain Brown's advice, \\"Get her a flannel waistcoat and flannel drawers . . .,\\" so the narrator can ask the reader incredulously, \\"Do you ever seen cows dressed in grey flannel in London?\\" Miss Matty's decision not to marry against her family's wishes keeps the peace at great personal cost, and her wistful decision to allow Martha to have a follower recompenses her later when the outside world intrudes into her realm with its ugly realities--one of the many signs that Cranford must and will change. When Lady Glenmire renounces her title and takes the name of Mrs. Hoggins upon her remarriage, Cranford reels with shock and dismay, and it takes Peter Jenkyns, and his broader perspective from India, to reconcile the village and its de facto leader, Mrs. Jamieson, with the new ways.The narrator, who divides her time between her father in the progressive world of Drumble and the slowly and reluctantly changing Cranford, finds herself under the village's influence. As an observer, she describes the complex set of rules that governs Cranford society and the social slights they necessitate, not without a sense of regret. She is aware of the absurdity of Cranford society's beliefs and behavior combined with expediency, such as the occasion of Miss Betty Barker's party for the Cranford elite. \\"'Oh, gentility!' thought I, 'can you endure this last shock?'\\" when \\"all sorts of good things for supper\\" appear. \\". . . we thought it better to submit graciously, even at the cost of our gentility--which never ate suppers in general--but which, like most non-supper-eaters, was particularly hungry on all special occasions.\\" More seriously, she pities Miss Matty and her lost love and life, and like her other well-meaning friends determines that she shall be happy.With the arrival of Signor Brunoni and the ensuing panic over the perceived crime wave that seems to hit Cranford, the narrator loses some of her wryness and seems to become nearly as frightened by the rumors of strangers and robberies as her elderly friends. It is the new outsider, Lady Glenmire, who \\"never had heard of any actual robberies; except that two little boys had stolen some apples from Farmer Benson's orchard and that some eggs had been missed on a market-day off Widow Hayward's stall.\\" Even while caught up in the panic, however, \\"I could not help being amused at Jenny's position . . ..\\" When she speaks of Jenny's ghost, the narrator says, \\". . . for there was no knowing how near the ghostly head and ears might be . . ..\\"Through the narrator, who seems to represent Gaskell's own perspective, Cranford pokes gentle fun at a time and place that had already become a fairy tale-like setting, where goodness outdoes pettiness, justice prevails over setbacks and hardships, and even the prodigal son (or prince) can return to set things right. In Cranford, Gaskell reminds the reader of a recent past that is both amusing and moving, a time to look upon fondly but without regret for the changes that Peter and the marriage of Lady Glenmire/Mrs. Hoggins bring about. The one constant in life is change, and in Cranford change is at least as much for the better as for the worse."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"Elizabeth Gaskell's Wives & Daughters and North & South have recently become two of my favorite books, so it stood to reason that I should check out her other novels. When I read Cranford I already knew that it wouldn't have a coherent plot, so I wasn't disappointed about that. What I found was a short but slow read made charming because of Gaskell's humor and elegant style of writing.Plotwise, it reminded me of L.M. Montgomery's stories, because Montgomery usually features young girls being brought up by dominant spinsters in small towns. Cranford doesn't include children of any variety, but similar quirks of aging ladies and domestic life are depicted. Of course, Gaskell's writing is not quite as saccharine as Montgomery's.Men are so rare in this novel that they are great curiosities, to the main characters and to the reader. My only complaint is that the narrator (I think her name was Mary Smith) did not talk more about herself. Was she destined to grow old without love just like her friend Miss Mattie?This isn't a book I would read more than once or twice. I can't imagine that I would have enjoyed as much if I hadn't already been obsessed with the author."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"Not really a novel, but more of a series of stories of the narrators recalling of her time spent in the fictional Cranford. Quite funny in parts (\\"When it was ended, she turned to me, and said with mild dignity, 'Fetch me \\"Rasselas,\\" my dear , out of the book-room.\\" You know things are going to heat up when someone is going to go and get the Dr.). Once upon a time writers used to have love for their characters they created, which I believe is why so little of fiction from the last 50-100 years or more appeals to me.Unfortunately, the Introduction is a horror of modern criticism bugaboo gone wild. I'm remined of Kerouac's saying \\"I have the critics explaing me to me.\\" This is the sort of intro that trots out the writers (and what about the practise of putting the editor, the person who does the introduction, and the likes, NAME on the cover, inside and everywhere else, as large as the Authors? Its quite funny to look up a writer on Amazon and see someone elses name tagged along, as if Dante and Homer and the rest had a helper writer we didn't know about!) pet peeves and overly biased views: \\"In his healthy appetite for food ('the peas were going wholesale into his capacious mouth,' p. 33) we see an image of sexual appetite, unhampered by social shibboleths.\\" We do? Maybe you do, but I don't. It's amazing how many writers attribute their loony views to poor writers who, in all probability, meant no such thing (Freud, Fraud, Freud...). And they can't refute such nonsense and drivel, most being dead (and being dead being beyond refutation)."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"These little stories are about life and love in the mid-nineteenth century. This book was first printed as serials as so many books were at that time. By the time Mrs. Gaskell wrote Cranford, she was extremely popular with the English people. This book is essentially a comedy of manners. The people in Cranford live genteelly and they are very proud of that fact even if they don't have much money. The book is about four old ladies and the life they lead. Mrs. Gaskell's characterizations are wonderful. Their lives consist of tea, cards and gossip. This is a book about ladies. There are very few men in it, but we certainly get a good description of the male species from the ladies' observations. It's a wonderful world that Mrs. Gaskell has created for us. Come and meet the wonderful ladies of Cranford."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"This book wraps you 'round and carries you into into the humble, hilarious and understated society of the women who inhabit the small town of Cranford; it is a treasure that you will want to read again and again."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"Beautiful book. I love the fabric cover. There is also a ribbon book marker in each of these books in a coordinating color!"},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"Elizabeth Gaskell's 1853 novel \\"Cranford\\" is a subtle and often sly portrait of life in a fictional mid-19th century rural English village. At the center of the novel is a circle of spinster and widowed females who wrestle mightily with the challenges of lives of genteel poverty. On its surface, \\"Cranford\\" is a comedy of manners, but its episodes have surprising and often moving depth.\\"Cranford\\" was originally published as a series of short stories, all narrated by Miss Mary Smith, a frequent visitor to the village and the young friend of its leading spinster ladies Miss Deborah and Miss Matty Jenkyns. The chapters are therefore not quite chronological in the telling; characters overlap but plot lines appear, disappear, and sometimes reappear.The narrative works through the relationships of the circle of women, as they deal with births and deaths, marriages, questions of fashion and manners, and such mundane events as a traveling magic show and a bank failure. Men are suffered to live in Cranford, but it seems that it is the women who actually arrange everything important in the village. The reader cannot help but be drawn into their lives through Gaskell's authentic dialogue and superb sense of place.\\"Cranford\\" was the basis for a Masterpiece Theater mini-series in the Spring of 2008, and is well worth reading on its own for its sympathetic portrait of a lifestyle now a distant memory. This Penguin addition includes an informative introduction by Patricia Ingram, extensive notes on 19th century customs, and a final chapter on Cranford written by Gaskell years after the original series."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"Ever get invited to spend a long, long weekend with an unmarried great-aunt and her closest unmarried friends, when what you really wanted to do was hang out with gals your own age? Well, that's exactly what a reader experiences on picking up CRANFORD, when she's come to it after delighted hours spent with WIVES AND DAUGHTERS and NORTH AND SOUTH. Take one of those wonderful, wonderful novels, delete all the men, all the romance, and all the passionate class critique, and that leaves CRANFORD.All I can say is, this novel is like Barbara Pym's QUARTET IN AUTUMN or her EXCELLENT WOMEN, only more so. More old ladies, more \\"spasms and flutterings\\" of old ladies (to borrow from Andrew Davies' P&P; screenplay), more petty snobberies and antimacassars.A plot of some sort does rear its head at about 75%, but don't look for one before then. I'd say I enjoyed the last 25% the most--found it comparatively un-put-down-able!--but only because I'd abandoned all hope by then.My book club was going to read this one, but I frantically steered them away when I was 60% in.

Here is an idea for Dover Press: Rename the line Dover Classics, Dover Thrift makes it sound like a book you buy at a Goodwill for a quarter- have some class, some pride- after all you are publishing classics.Gaskell was a well known literary figure in her day- she wrote non-fiction as well as fiction, including a biography of her homie Charlotte Bronte. Even though this is a book putatively about small town genteel widows and matrons, the timely references to characters being enthralled by Dickens Pickwick Papers (one of the few men in the novel is hit by a train because he is standing on the platform, so enthralled by the latest installment of Pickwick that he is slow too alert a child stuck on the tracks.)Elizabeth Gaskell in fact chose to be known as \\"Mrs. Gaskell\\" to the point that contemporary editions of Cranford read \\"by Mrs. Gaskell.\\" Although Cranford is not exactly what you call \\"action intense,\\" it is well observed, and at 130 pages you can read through it in a couple hours. Gaskell's country matrons don't sparkle with the life of those of Stendahl's the Red and the Black, but she does an equal job of portraying a specific time and place (the 1830s) from a vantage point twenty years in the the future (published 1852.)In the end Gaskell's genteel spinsters come together to save the day in the manner of a book like \\"the Little Women,\\" it's a bit TOO pat of an ending but hey it's just a minor classic, nowhatimean?"},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"A lovely book about a lovely village of lovely people. The inspiration for BBC/Masterpiece Classic's Cranford and Return to Cranford. I read this book in only a few nights and enjoyed it thoroughly. The glossary/notes regarding material culture (clothing, terminology, expressions) are not always correct (based on my own research and experience as an historic interpreter), but most of the information was new to me and referred to books and events of which I was unaware. I'm glad I watched the tv series first, including \\"The Making of Cranford,\\" before reading the book; it made clear how and why the series was created as it was. That being said, the book is charming and should be read by all high school students, especially female students, to understand that they are not so very different after all."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"For those expecting the book and PBS Mini-series of the same name to mirror each other, your expectations will probably fall short. Although the book is very well written, it is definitely not light reading, and requires a great degree of concentration to understand the ins and outs of the plot - the characters are intertwined, but it is sometimes hard to remember how they relate to one another.Overall, this book is a good, classical tale, but not recommended for bedtime reading! Strong coffee and concentration is needed!"},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"i chose this book because i liked it on tv and wondered what the 'raw material' was like.

I had expected a regular-size paperback (I failed to notice the dimensions when I ordered) and find this size unwieldy and floppy.

I have not finished reading the book because of this and would not order this particular item again."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"Let me just say that I don't remember which cover is on my Cranford book so I don't know that this is the correct issue.

I felt this had a little of everything. I'd suggest a read if you want to be ready for watching any TV adaptation."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"Having recently read both Gaskell's _Mary Barton_ and _Cranford_, I was pleasantly surpised by how humorous and pleasant I found the latter to be; gladly, _Cranford_ proves that not all Victorian fiction is populated with the unfeeling wealthy and the starving poor. A charming tale of leisurely--but never idle--life in the era, the author's cunning wit and ladylike charm adorn every page. In the oddly Amazonian town of Cranford, all the men have gone off to seek their fortunes in nearby indutry or simply never were born; the ladies of Cranford, then, occupy their time with ever-modest hostessing, challenging games of Preference, and demure speculation on the comings and goings of the penny-ante gentry that breeze through their midst. The copy I read offered a quote from Mrs. Gaskell, saying that she herself often read _Cranford_ when feeling ill or sad, as it was good for cheering her flagging spirits. Any modern reader would, no doubt, reap the same mirthful benefits."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"Orginally published in Charles Dickens' magazine Household Words, _Cranford_is in fact a collection of stories about the people (mostly women)'s lives in a city called Cranford in the 19th century. It is said to be Mrs. Gaskell's most popular book, and the only book that Mrs. Gaskell herself would want to re-read again. This book is indeed full of funny, ridiculous and heartwarming stories about some old-fashioned but really friendly and kind-hearted women (mostly old maids or widows) living in this little town called Cranford. I think Mrs. Gaskell did a good job in bring up themes like the confrontation of the old and new world, the comparsion between the life in an industrial city like Drumble (believed to be based on Manchester) and the little tranquil town Cranford. If you are interested in Victorian Literature, this is one of the few relaxing novels belonging to that period that is definitely worth a reading!"},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"Gaskills character sketches are delightful to read. Her descriptions of village life are spot on. I have lived in a small village all my life, and with the exceptions of technologies and British class systems, this is how a small town still operates. Loved reading it and followed with the other novels based in Cranford ASAP."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"I bought this for my wife - but, after we both greatly enjoyed the BBC miniseries, I ended up reading it myself as well. Compared to the miniseries, as expected, the book expands into more details and can be savored in many more levels.Sometimes escapism may require an action page-turner. Other times the same effect can be achieved by a slow novel about middle-aged women and their daily troubles.Pettiness and kindness, age and genders, nobles and lowborn, progress and tradition, all come together and weave the tapestry of rural middle England of the 1840's.RECOMMENDED!"},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"I would like to begin by saying that this book is very little like the PBS production that is being aired on TV right now. There are many characters that make their way into the miniseries, but many that the producers seem to have borrowed from other Gaskell novels. However, though the producers do not stick to the plot of the book, I feel they have captured the spirit of Cranford.If anyone were to ask me what this book is about, I am not quite sure what to tell them. In essence, it is a book about nothing in particular and everything meaningful in general. The key characters are elderly ladies who, like prim Amazons in middle-aged caps, look after each other and those around them. The adventures in this story are so mild, yet taken so seriously by the characters, that I was myself as excited as they were to learn that a magician had come to Cranford, or that the new fashions had arrived, or that a Lady was to marry someone quite beneath her. The most moving part of the whole story is Miss Matti's past love, a love that she sacrificed for the sake of her family. Her stories brought many tears to my eyes.Overall, I am so impressed with how such a simple story could be so altogether moving, and, quite unexpectedly, very fast paced. I read it very quickly yet I feel as if the tale will live with me forever."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"It's true that the novel \\"Cranford\\" doesn't mirror the recent Masterpiece dramatization, however this is because the adaptation was based on a series of Mrs. Gaskell's works, of which \\"Cranford\\" is only one. The others are \\"Mr. Harrison's Confessions\\", \\"My Lady Ludlow\\" and \\"The Last Generation in England\\". Taken together, all four give a complete -and more familiar- portrait of the delightful village we saw televised. I recommend each of them highly."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"Cranford by Elizabeth Gaskell, follows the lives of a group of women living in a small English town.I enjoyed this book very much. More of a collection of stories than a novel, it reminded me of The Pickwick Papers by Charles Dickens, to whom Mrs. Gaskell pays particular homage in more than one place in the book.Like most Victorian novels, the humor is droll and significant attention is played to social class. But it is also a quick, somewhat easy read, adjectives that don't usually come to mind when describing works of this era.This is a book about women, a point that Gaskell makes clear in the first line:\\"In the first place, Cranford is in possession of the Amazons; all the holders of houses above a certain rent are women.\\"And while the middle-aged spinsters of Cranford are a far cry from the women warriors who came to the assistance of the Greeks at Troy, the stereotypical rich, handsome man who comes to marry the woman in distress and therefore saves the day is absent from this story.Told through the eyes of Mary Smith, the two main characters of the novel, Miss Deborah Jenkyns and her sister Matty, put me very much in the mind of the Miss Brownings in Gaskell's final novel, Wives and Daughters. The foibles and misadventures of these two sisters and their circle of friends often had me laughing out loud.This is a delightful book. Written at a time when a woman's worth was often tied to how well she married, the gently humorous but dignified way in which Gaskell treats her characters in this novel is lovely."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"A delightful portrait of a somnolent English village in mid-nineteenth century Midlands, striving to shut out the noisy industrializing forces changing the world as they knew it. Vivid portraits of the largely single women--spinsters or widows--who dominate the social life of the town and their struggles to control who gets invited to tea parties etc and who doesn't, their criticisms of who doesn't observe the proprieties, and their underlying good-heartedness. In other words, Gaskell observes the manners and the people of this world with great insight and wit, not just looking at struggles to define etiquette but also at the last vestiges of a peaceful rural place and the changes being thrust upon its classes--working, middle, and nobility."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"A very quick review. A beautifully written book filled with the feminine niceties and social customs of provincial early 19th Century life. A very interesting read to myself as I was born at Cranford Lodge, Knutsford, the true market town in the north of England that Gaskell based her novel on. A visit to Knutsford itself brings out the flavour of the writing and tours of \\"Cranford\\" including Miss Matty's house and the Assembly Rooms at the George can be arranged through the Gaskell Society!"},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"A sweet, gentle story of a small English town not unlike Jan Karon's Mitford, only 150 years ago.

Don't miss this little jewel."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"...do try the book. I had to read this at school at 14 (so often enough to put anyone off anything) but it has remained an absolute favourite which hardly anyone else seemed to have read until recently.

You will know what I mean - but you'll need something to wipe away a tear!"},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"It is fun to read the book from which the TV miniseries was taken. Seeing the people in print gives more to their on screen characterizations. I think that it is good to have both and to explore more of Gaskell's creations."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"Cranford is a delight and an idyll of calm in our clamorous twenty-first century world of clutter and clatter! The short novel was first serialized in Charles Dicken's edited periodical \\"Household Words\\" during 1853. Its author was Elizabeth Gaskell (1810-1865) of Manchester who was the wife of the Unitarian pastor William Gaskell. Despite a busy life of charity work, raising several children and a wide correspondence she managed to develop into a fine novelist. Gaskell was friendly with Florence Nightingale and became the biographer of her good friend Charlotte Bronte. This novel has become a popular miniseries on BBC TV and is being broadcast in the United States on the Masterpiece program on PBS.Cranford tells the story of Miss Debroah and Miss Matty Jenkyns late middle aged daughters of a Church of England clergyman. We visit their quiet world of sewing, morning visits to friends, afternoon teas and trips to church events. We learn that they are old fashioned disdaining the coming of the railroad. Miss Deborah engages in a very humorous argument with Captain Brown (significantly this character is killed by a train) over whether Dr. Samuel Johnson or Charles Dickens is the best writer. We learn that Miss Matty had been courted by the eccentric farmer Mr. Holbrook. We learn he has 26 cows or one for each letter of the alphabet. Holbrook dies as an old man after fulfilling his dream of visiting Paris. We discover the story of the siblings wandering brother Peter who leaves home after a quarrel with their stern father. Peter becomes a sailor. Several years later he returns from India to be reacquainted with his surviving sister Matty and his friends in Cranford.We meet such eccentric old maids as Miss Pole and learn of other residents of the tiny village. Cranford is based on Knustsford the village in which Mrs. Gaskell grew to womanhood. Knustford is located close to Manchester in the industrial north of Great Britain.One of the most heartwarming tales of Cranford is to see how the friends of Miss Matty rally around and support her when she loses all of her money in a bank which failed.Cranford is a gentle glance into a rural England which only exists on the printed page. It is a loving little story of ordinary men and women bound together by blood, love and common interests. Excellent!"},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"This book has been called Gaskell's greatest, something I just cannot agree with. ok, so it provides an sharp insight into the small town life of the time.

The story itself is not what the book is focused on but instead it's about this group of women in a small English town and their view of life and the odd inner workings of their minds. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I believe there is also a movie made but it might be hard to track down.

Reads very much like a newsy letter from an old aunt whose daily life sees great drama in little things. I laughed out loud more than once- as the writing is both sincere and gently parodying itself at the same time. I finished the book with a smile and a few times was quite touched by the goings on in Cranford.

The much that we get in this book includes a compassionate study of life in a small English town in the early 1800s before Victoria, using as Austin does, the stratum of families (mostly single and widowed women) who saw themselves as genteel though needing to practice elegant economy as the viewpoint. We get writing where each word is exquisitely chosen yet unpretentious; we get a quiet but clear sense of the social stratification where servants were kindly treated but unpaid including the little workhouse maiden whose arms were too small to carry a tea-tray. We get laughter as in the story of Miss Betsy Barker's cow going to pasture in grey flannel after she lost her hair when she fell into the lime-pit.Most of all, we get love: the love between sisters, brothers, fathers and mothers; the love between men and women;lovingkindness to strangers; and the love between the lifelong friends who are the women of Cranford.My copy is over 100 years old, illustrated in pen and ink drawings that are as witty and compassionate as Mrs Gaskell's writing.

There is a general absence of men in Cranford, but not of the kind of young men suitable for dating the servants. The central postion in the story is occupied by Mathilda Jenkyns, daughter of a clergyman, an unmarried woman.The author has amusing ways of describing the people in the village, their quirks, their eccentricities, their habits. One character prefers Mr. Boz, (Dickens), to Dr. Johnson. Miss Mathilda Jenkyns is persuaded by her friends to visit Mr. Holbrook, a former beau who was considered by a member of her family to be unsuitable. The guests wonder whether it is possible to eat peas with the utensils provided. Shortly after the visit Mr. Holbrook dies to the secret consternation of Miss Matty Jenkyns.From letters it is learned that her mother expected Matty Jenkyns to grow up to become a great beauty. Her brother Peter, after mischief-making and being whipped by her father, disappears. He is sighted in Liverpool and it is understood his employment takes him to India. He sends his mother a shawl and then the family ceases to hear anything about him.Mrs. Gaskell describes a milliners shop in Cranford and another establishment selling general goods. Expenditure of dress in Cranford is mainly a case of new caps. A hostess gives her dog cream with his tea and her guests, milk. In misfortune, a bank failure, kindness and love are bestowed by friends and associates for the victim's support and betterment.

I ordered the Penguin Classics edition, which was described as having 304 pages and included the two novellas besides the excellent \\"Cranford.\\" The picture on the book that came is the same as the one pictured on the website, but the book I received only has 257 pages and doesn't have the two novellas, which is why I wished to have this edition.Now I notice that the great reviews of this book are from some other edition -- strange and misleading. How can be sure to get the right one?"},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"I hate to be a naysayer, but I truly do not understand the appeal of this book. Old maids sit about pinching pennies (or farthings) poke their heads outdoors to frown on their neighbors and head back inside to grouse. A reader of this review commented that some of the details (I considered them banalities) do indeed constitute spoilers and therefore I have deleted them from this edited version (12/5/11).That same reader was kind enough to point out the history of the novel which explains its disjointed narrative and lack of cohesion. Whille I understand better why it is such a tedious stinker, I am no more inclined to improve my opinion. The book is nothing more than a multitude of the mundane strung together as plot. Our narrator pops in and out of town on visits recording these banalities to what end? A few instances made me smile, a skirmish between fans of Dr. Johnson and Dickens had some charm but for the most part the characters and their lives left me bored. Some of the reviewers here have compared Gaskell to Austen. Sorry but not even close.I can't imagine this being a Masterpiece Theater selection. Did they film Judi Dench taking an hour long nap?"},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"\\"Quaint\\" is the first word that comes to mind. I would almost describe it as one of Eliot's idyllic novels, if it had been written by Dickens. I would say that, if it weren't a disservice to all the authors involved. Jane Austen would be a more apt comparison, if Austen's works were more episodic. Mrs. Gaskell has a sweetness and a wit throughout the novel, with a tongue-in-cheek attitude towards the inhabitants of Cranford, that brings to mind both the works of Dickens and Austen--especially the characterizations, which are quite good. This is important, as with only a thin veil of a plot to tie to chapters together, the responsibility of drawing the reader in falls solely on the shoulders of her characters. Moving from incident to incident, as was not uncommon in Victorian novels, the novel begs us to pay attention simply because the characters are worth giving our attention. Obviously, a weak novel is one wants to study plot, but one could certainly choose a worth book to pick up to study the art of comedic characterization. With less on it's mind than some of Gaskell's other works--from what I've read--Cranford is an easy, enjoyable read, but far from life changing. It is simply a well-written, enjoyable read, and there's nothing wrong with that. Something to enjoy over afternoon tea."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"Last winter, I rented Cranford, the BBC miniseries (starring Judi Dench), from Netflix--and that got me interested in the book on which that's based. The book is a series of vignettes about the ladies of the town of Cranford, many of whom are elderly spinsters like Miss Matty Jenkyns and her sister Deborah, or Miss Pole (much as I tried not to, I kept seeing Judi Dench and Imelda Staunton in the roles of Miss Matty and Miss Pole).This short story differs significantly from the miniseries; the miniseries focuses a lot on the encroachment of the railways on the town of Cranford, and there's a romantic subplot going on there. The book is much more centered on the middle-aged and elderly ladies of the town, as seen through a semi-outsider, Miss Mary Smith, the daughter of a family friend of the Jenkynses.As another reviewer said on Librarything, reading about the ladies of Cranford is a lot like reading about the Golden Girls. This is a very lighthearted, funny book in many places, but still very touching. The ladies are very provincial, focused on the mundane details of their lives--but very loyal to one another, as seen when Matty looses her money and her friends conspire to help her out. It took a few pages for me to get into the story, but once I did, I was fully engaged in the lives of the characters in this book."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"I have always been a fan of 19th century novels and many of my favorite authors come from this time period. I have never read anything by Gaskill, and finally grabbed this book after seeing the BBC miniseries of the same name.It was a sentimental look at several spinsters in the town of Cranford, all of which are likable and good people. The overall tone of the book was very positive, with one of the main lessons showing that people love to help genuinely good people. It is a nice contrast to many novels that show the worst in people.Note that this does not match the BBC series in all aspects since the BBC series took all 3 Cranford books and condensed them into a miniseries, but many of the episodes from the book are included with modifications. I enjoyed the book and the TV show, even though they did not match exactly.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in this type of literature and who wants a refreshing glance as a time that was."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"...I came to the conclusion that this printing of Cranford has the CUTEST cover (i.e. a pretty teacup and a great font), therefore I bought it.My wife agreed.Mission accomplished hubbie. Mission accomplished.But seriously, if you or your wife are into Jane Austen(ish) stuff like my wife, Cranford is a MUST have. And of all the printed versions, this one is by far the cutest looking, which apparently is somewhat important to wives who like Jane Austen and her crowd of Victorian/Regency era authors. If you're a husband looking for a gift for your wife, this is a great one.And definitely buy her the DVD bundle of Cranfod and return to Cranford.And definitely buy her the DVD first few seasons of \\"Lark Rise to Candleford\\".Believe me...it's worth the money.She'll feel like you understand her a little bit...and she'll have some of her friends over for a \\"girl night\\" where they watch their DVDs and drink tea and dream about living in mid nineteenth century Britain, and you'll be able to work on the car/the yard/whatever without feeling like you're neglecting your wife because she'll be having way more fun than you.That's worth any price."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"Explore the 3 life perspectives of the folks in Cranford and surrounds and you'll settle in for a cup of tea at Miss Matty's in no time. These are the 3 character-filled and -driven collections that the PBS Cranford series and Return to Cranford series were adapted from, so I recommend Gaskell's set here for any and all who've enjoyed the film versions.And this particular offering from Amazon is priced so frugally even Cranford's own Miss Deborah would approve. So, settle into Cranford for the summertime and enjoy the rhythm of their lives."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"Inspired to grab a copy of the book after seeing the PBS series, I am very pleased with this version of Cranford by Elizabeth Gaskell. With several options to choose from, I am very happy with the aesthetics of this book. In particular I truly enjoy the \\"tea cup\\" cover and the simplistic and easy to read layout of the interior. And it's always good to have a nice book to look at on the shelf when you're done with reading it.After being impressed with this book I also checked out the other books tagged with cricket house and their other offerings are as equally impressive.This version of Cranford is definitely worth it's price."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"I was inspired to read Cranford by Elizabeth Gaskell after watching the PBS/BBC miniseries last year. The town of Cranford is dominated by women. There are relatively few men, at least in the social circle of the characters in this book. The main characters are all single, either spinsters or widows, and they fiercely guard their way of life.The book, originally published serially in 1853 in Charles Dickens' magazine Household Words, is a series of vignettes of the daily life of Miss Mathilda Jenkyns. This book is definitely character driven and starts off slow. Nothing truly exciting ever happens in Cranford and you have to get to know the characters before you understand how small disruptions can make huge waves in their lives. Gaskell manages to convey how important small events are to these characters. You get the sense that if anything big ever happened they'd die from the shock. The narrator, Mary Smith, a frequent (and slightly more worldly) visitor to the town tries to keep molehills from turning into mountains and for the most part is successful. But, sometimes even she gets sucked into the daily drama.Fans of the miniseries might be disappointed with the book. Many of the funniest storylines from the series are added. But, the loyalty and friendship the characters display towards each other should endear this book to all but the most jaded reader."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"When I finished the last sentence of Cranford, I was so sad. I was so sorry that it was over, that I would not be sharing more time with these wonderful people, especially the dear and familiar Miss Matty. I was moved to laugh and cry over the events of this book, and I will not forget the parts that touched me most. I found the most real and lovely part of the book was when the friends came together when Miss Matty needed them most, and they did this just as real friends do, without mentioning it. I have purchased the mini-series and look forward to watching that, but nothing compares to the days and nights I spent \\"walking\\" the streets of Cranford and sharing an inside knowledge of all that was going on."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"This novella has a good deal of charm and real feeling--I don't think you'll soon forget Miss Matty, who is the center of these little stories, even if her older sister was much more forceful in character. The efforts of the ladies of the village--and it is pretty much ladies--to cope with limited incomes, burglars, death, love, tea, cows, servants, and addressing the nobility are both funny and poignant. However much they bicker and contend with each other, when the chips are down, you'll find them (or their handmaidens) at the door with the 19th century equivalent of a casserole. (For one born in New England, these ladies are very reminiscent of much older relatives.)Heartily recommended."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"Cranford (Penguin Classics)I bought this book after having seen the Masterpiece production of it. The book is unique in that it is a novel set in the mid 1800s and comes complete with appendices explaining the words and references to people and events used throughout the book. It was very historically educational in addition to being a very interesting and well written novel. I very much recommend the book and I will be reading more by Patricia Gaskell"},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"This paperback version is the one that the recent tv series fan will want, because unlike some of the other paperback versions, it includes the three Gaskell novellas that were the basis for the Judi Dench-Eileen Atkins miniseries. The three books were\\"Cranford\\", \\"My Lady Ludlow\\" and \\"Mr Harrison's Confessions.\\"Mrs Gaskell stories are considered comedies, and this comes clear in the original texts. Some sadness of course in events, but mostly there is a clear comic, even sardonic voice in which we can fall in love with the characters and still laugh at their foibles, fashions, and foolishness which seem still so apropos today.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"Let me begin this review by saying that if you are thinking about reading this book only because of the BBC series, you will find it very disappointing. The makers of that series used the authors name, the title of the book and some of the characters but the remainder of their production is pure invention. I am enjoying watching the BBC program, but it is not this book.Ms Charlotte Mitchell provides an Introduction and Notes for this book. It is my belief that it is essesntial to read the Introduction in order to fully understand Cranford. Elizabeth Gaskell had written a series of stories which appeared at irregular intervals in a magazine edited by Charles Dickens titled Household Words. The stories first appeared together as a novel in 1853. Ms Mitchell uses the Introduction to explain the chronology for the publishing of this and other novels by Elizabeth Gaskell. She also takes this opportunity to explore the question of whether or not Cranford was ever meant to be taken seriously by readers of Ms Gaskell since her other novels are so very different in tone from this one.One of the things I really appreciate which Ms Mitchell did was to include the Notes section to explain words and phrases which appear in the book which were very well understood in the 1800's but which may be unfamiliar to readers today. I read a lot of historical romantic fiction and these Notes gave me concrete explanations for words and phrases I have been too lazy to research for myself. I thought I knew what they meant before, now I know for sure. Items such as:1. gigot - a sleeve style described as leg-of-mutton2. baby-house - a dolls house3. sarsenet - a soft thin silk material4. blind man's holiday - a proverbial term for night or twilightMs Mitchell states in the Introduction that Gaskell later came to regret the fact that she had caused Colonel Brown to be killed in the first story. If he had remained a character longer in the series, I think that Cranford might have gone in a very different direction. As it is, Cranford is the story of a certain class of women, either unmarried or widowed, who live in a small English villiage. The main character is Miss Matty Jenkyns who only comes into prominence after the death of her older sister, Miss Deborah. The women relish their lack of male inhabitants and see themselves as lucky in not having to deal with the ways of men, which they see as uncouth and almost barbaric (they will speak too loud!). There is a very strict social structure among these women, even as to what time of day they can visit each other and what kind of clothes they should be wearing when the visits take place. These rules are in place to keep everyone on an even keel, so that everyone understands the rules, and no one may change the rules without the approval of the most prestigious ranking member of their set.Cranford is a study in contrasts. The differences in the male approach to the world, with their freedoms, and the female approach to the world, with all the restrictions placed upon them. I can honestly say that I had fun reading this book. I grinned, smiled, chuckled and even laughed out loud. No episode was too tiny to cause a complete, unrealistic upheaval among the ladies of Cranford. One of my favorite parts of the story concerns how they all react when rumor and half-truths have them convinced that a gang of thieves and burglars are roaming the countryside. It is funny and heartwarming but also sad to see the lengths they go to in order to protect themselves and their households from these thieves who are, in reality, simply the result of gossip and overactive imaginations. Another part I am particularly fond of is when the main characters allow themselves to unbend to the extent of divulging to their friends what their worst fear is. Miss Matty revealed that she was afraid each night that a man was hiding under her bed. Her method of reassuring herself that no person was there was actually quite astute and surprising for this woman's character. But Cranford is not all warm feelings and quaint happenings. There are real tragedies which effect these women and move their lives into totally different directions.This book is told in the narrative style, something which I usually do not like. There is very little dialogue. The name of the narrator is not even mentioned until page 137. I had read the persons name in the Introduction but I was very surprised to see that this type of presentation did not detract from my enjoyment of the book at all. It is not the most exciting book I have ever read, it is not a very long book, and it does not require much stretching of the readers intellect but I enjoyed all of the time I spent reading it and will certainly read it over and over.Very highly recommended for any reader who enjoys historical fiction. It is not a romance, more a journal of the everyday lives of women who depend on themselves and their friends for comfort and companionship."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"This Viking edition includes \\"Mr. Harrison's Confession,\\" \\"Cranford,\\" and \\"My Lady Ludlow,\\" the three novellascombined to produce the Cranford BBC series. The works are quite different from each other, \\"My Lady Ludlow\\" differing the most in tone and style.\\"Mr. Harrison's Confession\\" is the droll account of a young doctor who comes to Dunscombe (a Cranford stand-in) to practice with the much older Mr. Morgan, an old friend of his father's. As young Harrison makes the transition from the lively streets of London to the quaint lanes of the little town to which he has moved, he is involved in many humorous misunderstandings--and especially troublesome are those caused by a prankster friend of his! There are poignant moments too, as Mr. Harrison and the townspeople learn to know each other, and the young doctor finds love.\\"Cranford\\" is the most fully fleshed out of the three novellas, and easily the most readily absorbed by the modern reader. To one who grew up in New England of swamp Yankee parentage, the mindset of the Cranford ladies is completely familiar. Why care about dress when everyone in your town knows what clothes you own, and why care when you are away where no one knows you at all? The various subplots of the story are very reminiscent Sarah Orne Jewett, who wrote a few decades later in the US--\\"The Country of the Pointed Firs,\\" for example. The novel comprises several interlocking stories centering on Miss Matilda Jenkyns, her family and her friends who inhabit the little town of Cransford--a town of Amazons. Very few men live in the village. Though many of the stories are humorous, there are those that touch the heart.\\"My Lady Ludlow\\" is the most old-fashioned of the three novellas--set decades before the others at the beginning of the nineteenth century, and full of sentiment. Lady Ludlow, herself in old age, must learn to change as the world around her does. The story, narrated by a young woman in frail health, from the vantage point of later years, contains a lengthy and melodramatic subplot reminiscent of \\"A Tale of Two Cities.\\"\\"Cranford\\" is a wonderful piece of work, and the other two novellas are very enjoyable. Especially if you liked the BBC series, you'll enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"\\"Cranford\\" is likely the best known novel of Victorian author Elizabeth Gaskell. The novel follows the day-to-day social lives of a group of upper-middle-class women in the small, fictional town of Cranford, England. Rather than having a strong narrative, the novel delivers a tableau of social goings on that illuminate the characters and their lives. These stories are told largely through the eyes of a younger lady (Miss Mary Smith) who often visits from a nearby town. The ladies of Cranford are not rich, but wealthy enough to belong to a certain social strata, and much of the comedy derives from their careful considerations of who to include and exclude at various social gatherings. Miss Matty is essentially the main protagonist, and she is a basically kind woman if a bit miserly, especially when it comes to candles. She and her friends typically look to the most prominent member of Cranford female society, Miss Jamieson, and then assiduously follow her lead. Unfortunately, Miss Jamieson is sometimes rather narrow-minded, unlike the other ladies, which creates certain socially awkward situations.This enjoyable novel may seem a bit meandering to some readers, given that there is not a main narrative thread. The novel was originally published in serialized form in \\"Household Words\\" (edited by Charles Dickens), which may partially help explain its lack of a strong plot. Indeed, the 2007 BBC mini-series versions of \\"Cranford\\" included stories from several of Gaskell's other novels. However, the stories here all add up to a devastatingly accurate picture of small town life and the sometimes vicious yet amusing ways in which people in them behave. Gaskell clearly understood human nature, and readers are likely to recognize many truths about human foibles in her stories. I found myself laughing and touched often.Note: This review is for the Kindle version. The text is well-arranged and does not contain any noticeable errors, although there are lots of spaces in between section and subsections (which actually makes reading easier). This version has no extras, such as a biography of Gaskell or an introduction to the text; however, such materials are so easily available on the internet now that this exclusion is not a major debit."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"To you scoffers who find this novel uneventful - I say read it again toward the close of your life. The stories of these genteel ladies with their 40 year old lost loves and their strong familial relationships are very moving. I also like the way the book is contructed in a series of vignettes. But most of all I am enchanted with the \\"feel\\" of the portrait of village life in the middle of the 19th century - such a contrast with the mores of today it's hard to believe we are the same species! If you like Mrs. Gaskell, be sure to read Barbara Pym for the 20th century version."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"I have just discovered this wonderful author after watching \\"Cranford\\" on Masterpiece Theatre. I ordered several of her titles and I am hooked. I will read everything she has written. As someone who always wished that Jane Austen had written just one more book (or two or five or forty!!!), Elizabeth Gaskell is a real find. Her works are more \\"worldly\\" than the mild Miss Austen, but her characters are just as compelling and I love her."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"I read this series of village sketches as an independent study and found that it is most commonly referred to as &quot;charming.&quot; This so called charm is achieved through the humourous realism with which Gaskell depicts the citizens of the small, rural town of Cranford. The women presented are 'old maids' and though genteel, their economic status is far from certain. Perhaps the tender concern Gaskell shows for their welfare, and the friendship demonstrated for a friend in need is most pivotal in creating the charm of the novel. This book has the feel of a 'chick flick': no grand action necessarily, but little episodes of social excitement followed by periods of daily activity. The book provides both comic scenes and tear-jerkers and the method of storytelling could be likened to that of movies such as &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot; or &quot;Fried Green Tomatoes&quot;."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"Delightful, surely one of the most charming novels ever written. Using the lightest of touches, Mrs. Gaskell pokes fun at the simple people who inhabit the provincial community of Cranford in rural England in the 1840s, a village we are told at the beginning that is curiously \\"in possession of the Amazons\\": its male inhabitants nowhere to be found. Told in the form of reports by a frequent visitor to the village (Mary Smith) from a more cosmopolitan place, we are made privy to the disappointments, hopes, fears, and affronts of a number of the female residents, particularly Miss Matty Jenkyns and Mrs. Jamieson. All are related humorously, some wildly so. My favorite scenes include Mrs. Jamieson's defense of Samuel Johnson over Captain Brown's preference for Dickens's Boz and the sad story of Peter Jenkyns who is insulted by his father and runs away to join the navy. But every chapter offers its delights, and it's easy to see, as Frank Swinnerton mentions in the introduction, how many people at one time knew the book by heart. Long a best seller in the Everyman's Library, it's sad to see the book not included in the recent reissue of 100 of that library's most popular books, a gross oversight for sure."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"Sherwood Anderson once described life as a \\"history of moments\\". Miss Gaskell has created in Cranford a glimpse into a dying culture of the more egalitiarian rural Bitish Yoemanry of the 18th century collapsing under the urbanization of the society and with a more repressive capitalism to claim the lives and souls of the youth leaving the village for better lives. Goldsmith's the \\"Deserted Village\\" comes to mind.The story is told from the lives of elderly mostly female, spinster as well as widowed community of genteel rural poverty- self imposed and otherwise. Quaint yet, but with vinegary pithiness of death, stoicism and social veneer, in other words real life. This is civilized 19th century social writing at its best, like a journalistic Austen. The narrator is a wise insightful character commenting on the eccentric and slightly mad village women who make up this world. The rivalry between Captain Brown and Miss Jenkyns based upon their literary preference of Dr. Johnson vs Charles Dickens is especially amusing considering that Cranford first appeared in Dicken's magazine, \\"Household Words\\". Endearing and haunting- much more than its surface appearance."},{"Title":"Cranford,","review":"Reading \\"Cranford\\" is a lot like spending an afternoon in the doily museum of a provincial city; you can't help but admire the skill of the embroidery but you have to wonder at your own sanity for being there. I stuffed the book in my carry-on, as a relief from the 20th C anguish in the novels I'd been reading recently, and found myself waiting out a snow delay with nothing to read but this staid portrayal of a circle of spinsters nourished chiefly by their own proprieties. Cranford is not a novel at all, but rather a series of nostalgic sketches of the old-fashioned manners and quaint habits of genteel but impoverished provincial ladies, gently satirical, a porcelain cup counterpart to Charles Dickens's \\"Pickwick Papers\\". Dickens is explicitly mentioned in several chapters of Cranford; Miss Dorothy Jenkyns, the most literary of the Cranford ladies, finds him vulgar and less eloquent in every way than Dr. Johnson.Elizabeth Gaskell and Charles Dickens were quite well acquainted with each other's work; in fact \\"Cranford\\" was first published in serial form in one of Dickens's magazines. There are many parallels, particularly between Dickens's \\"Hard Times\\" and Gaskell's \\"North and South\\". Both books focus on the dire conditions of labor in 19th C England; both can be considered liberal protest novels. I suppose Gaskell is never as knee-slapping funny as Dickens can be, but she has other virtues, closer to Trollope, in terms of cogent story-telling and sympathetic insight into characters of all classes and both genders.Gaskell was totally 'out of fashion' when I went to college. The luminaries of Victorian literature, as taught at Harvard in the 1960s, were Eliot, Austen, and the Brontes, with Dickens and Thackeray cast as their knaves and Trollope as their butler. But Gaskell has made a comeback. Aside from \\"North and South\\", her novels \\"Ruth\\", \\"Sylvia's Lovers\\", \\"Wives and Daughters,\\" and others are in print and well worth reading. As her titles suggest, her feminism was more overt than that of her peers, and her sympathies were clearly 'liberal' in the current American political sense. Above all, she could tell a good story.Cranford was immensely popular in its time, when perhaps most readers had their own maiden aunts to caricature. It's quite well done in its way, but if you've never read Gaskell before, I wouldn't suggest starting with it. You might find it challenging to sit quietly with the ladies as they crochet and dither over their bonnets."},{"Title":"A room of one's own","review":"This is the first of three books of Jill's that I read recently. Since I was planning to hand her A.S. Byatt's Possession (my pick for the best book that I read in 1993), she felt that it would take three books to make an equivalent trade, and I agreed to the terms.I had seen part of a dramatization of this essay once, and had heard many references to this work, so it was about time that I read it for myself (one of these days I'll pick up Heart of Darkness in the same vein). I'm happy to have done so, for now I understand where Shakespeare's sister and Chloe likes Olivia falls into the scheme of the argument. It's nice to note that the state of women's writing has improved tremendously since this was originally presented. As a man, I like to see this same argument now as genderless--that is, the room and the money that one needs to support oneself is necessary to any writer, no matter what gender."},{"Title":"A room of one's own","review":"after i ordered this book, the distributors let me know instantly that they no longer had the book on shelf, and instantly refunded my account. speedy service is one thing, but keeping the customer informed is another...thanks"},{"Title":"A room of one's own","review":"...that women should have financial security; a readable classic that makes its point well."},{"Title":"A room of one's own","review":"The product is fine, but the sipping was a little slow.

I do not like A Room of Ones Own. I understand the concept of stylized writing, but the content of the book does nothing to draw in the reader. Certainly, Woolf's mastery in writing should be applauded on its merit; however, I am not progressed far enough in my education to fully appreciate Woolf's subtleties. There is nothing in A Room of One's Own that remains once the book is closed, although the pages are full of wonderful ideas. The presentation of these ideas; however, are uninteresting and handled in a very preachy manner. It is my opinion that such revolutionary ideas should have been shot forth from a canon rather than whispered in a library"},{"Title":"A room of one's own","review":"This essay, which was originally a speech and was somewhat elongated, speaks about feminist issues of the time in a rather circuitous manner. She spends chapters discussing topics that could be addressed in a matter of sentences. As Woolf acknowledges in the beginning of her essay, she does not always tell the truth, and sometimes contradicts herself (not to mention the insults she throws at the male sex). In support of this novel, it was revolutionary for the time and offers some interesting anecdotes of her time. However, the stream of consciousness style she employs clouds and confuses her theses. It is also interesting to note that she summarizes most of her speech in the last 5 pages."},{"Title":"A room of one's own","review":"Virginia Woolf is in no way an encouragement to young women writers. This book is a downer, filled with many inaccurate conclusions and information, including many twisted facts concerning Charlotte Bronte and views."},{"Title":"A room of one's own","review":"After being forced to read this book for English class, I feel it my obligation to let people know just how bad it is. Woolf is an ardent feminist, and will go to whateer length necessary to tell her audience of the supposed atrocities committed upon society by men. According to her, men are pigs who simply suppress women to elevate themselves. Her constant self-contradiction (is she not doing here the same thing that she accuses men of?) makes her thesis difficult to believe. Her unusual style, using dashes instead of proper names, only distracts the reader. All in all, I do not recommend this book to anyone who is capable of conscious thought."},{"Title":"A room of one's own","review":"A Room of One&iexcl;s Own is an essay, which is &iexcl;based upon two papers read to the Arts Society at Newnham and the Odtaa at Girton&iexcl; in 1928.Virginia Woolf, an advocate and speaker for women, gives a really good and important lesson to females. She challenges the norm and tradition of the patriarchal society. By questioning the phenomenon of the society, Woolf clearly points out the insufficient opportunities for women and the deprivation of talented women in different ways, especially in education and work. For the essay, Woolf invents Shakespeare&iexcl;s sister, Judith, and tells us the life of Judith. She shows us that society overlooks the talent of women; thus, a lot of intelligent women are not recognized in the world. She urge people to open their eyes, take a serious look at women and praise them for their talents.The other important message that Woolf brings to women is about freedom and the ways to strive for it. Adequate income and a room of one&iexcl;s own are the two essential factors for a woman to earn freedom. These basics can free women from getting nothing but children. Women can have more choices besides staying at home and doing housework; life will be different if one has her own space. I think Woolf&iexcl;s Essay is indeed a timeless lecture for every woman. As a woman, I think we should use our knowledge to strike for freedom and opportunities for ourselves and our next generations, just like Virginia Woolf challenges the norm and system of the society."},{"Title":"A room of one's own","review":"When I read this book the first time I was enthralled. We really take for granted the position our mothers and grandmothers worked so hard to ensure for us. I forget how close in time we are to when women couldn't vote or attend male universities.Virginia Woolf was provided a room of her own to be able to create the work that has become so influential in twentieth century writing. In an ideal world everyone would be allowed to artistically express themselves without having to be in the &quot;real world.&quot; I know that since I graduated from college and have been working 40-50 hour work weeks, I am less inclined to read or write. I don't feel like I can let that be my excuse, though, just because it would be easier to write if I could spend all my time doing it. The request that women have money and a room seems very upper-middle-class and out of touch with the way life was even in Woolf's time.In spite of those criticisms, I am so glad I read this book. It made me feel empowered as a woman and a writer. This is a must read for anyone trying to understand the history of feminism."},{"Title":"A room of one's own","review":"Virginia Woolf was asked to give a talk about Women and Fiction in 1928. The talk eventually became this book. Woolf shows very convincingly how women have found it difficult to be taken seriously in the world of literature. Her famous suggestion that women can only play a full part in writing if they have an income of five hundred year and a room of their own - with a lock on the door still holds good today though the amount of money needed would be larger. She provides some examples of how women's talents were just not taken seriously and they were regarded as totally inferior to even the most mediocre man.I found it interesting that she thought the best writing is androgynous and could have been written by either men or women. She accepts that women may write differently from men because they are aware of different aspects of life because of the way society is organised. Jane Austen wrote about what she knew as did George Eliot. They are disparaged because they deal with everyday life whereas men write about the outside world because that is what they know. Could Tolstoy have written \`War and Peace' if he had been female? Woolf thinks not.Woolf's overall thesis is that the world of literature needs both masculine qualities and feminine qualities. She does not want to downgrade the achievements of men because she believes the world needs both. The example of Shakespeare's sister is a telling one even though Shakespeare's writing is androgynous. Writers need to use both sides of their brains and personalities which echoes Jung's ideas that men have a feminine side just as women have a masculine side - wholeness comes from using both sides.This book is well worth reading for its writing style alone and for its humour. This is not a feminist tract by any means but it does make some very valid points about how women were still treated in the nineteen twenties even though they had the right to vote."},{"Title":"A room of one's own","review":"Woolf, in her poetically rambling way, manages to navigate through numerous subjects, including but not limited to: a history of women writing fiction, their male counterparts, the literary merits of both sexes, the dual-sexed nature of the brain, the limits placed upon women in society and to hold property, thwarts the critiques of men who dismiss the contributions and characters of women, and mediates over walks, meals and cigarettes. While she takes an indirect course, a characteristic of her fiction, she hits upon her thesis throughout: to be an artist of any merit a person needs a room to write in and a source of income; without both the artist is hard-pressed to have the time and energy in which to create. She notes that this holds true for men as well, holding up a number of authors we have long canonized who were not only from wealthy families, but highly educated; things denied women throughout most of history. What is most enjoyable is her dry humor that peppers the text, and I wish her fiction contained more of it. I would recommend reading Orlando in conjunction with this; not only does it explore the same themes of art, sex, gender and the evolution of women, but it does so with the same level of humor. It is also her most accessible work and the \\"love letter\\" to her lover, Vita Sackville-West, is a warm and sensual novel."},{"Title":"A room of one's own","review":"Virginia Woolf always blows my mind with her ability to marry illustrative, vivid paintings and academic writing. I often find that she makes a clear conclusion that I have previously arrived at independently, but could have never materialized or verbalized successfully. I will always have a room of my own!"},{"Title":"A room of one's own","review":"There it was, sitting high on my daughter's bookshelf, still, as I see it, while she is half a world away. What many consider to be the modern primogenitor of feminist literature, written long before Betty Friedan'sThe Feminine Mystiqueand even before Simone de Beauvoir'sThe Second Sex (Vintage). Virginia Woolf, in the 1920's, was nailing the central problem: to produce (and we're not talking more kids, Wolfe was talking literature) women needed a bit of space, as is implied by the title, and the all-important separate income (500 quid, on an annual basis, at a time before the ravages of inflation would make that figure insufficient even for a month.) I have read the other two books, polemics if you will, so why not start at the beginning, finally, when I am, well, a few years beyond the high school period when my daughter read it? She has managed to also \\"take the path less traveled,\\" and so there is that additional fillip: perhaps a voyeuristic one. What part did the many passages she underlined play in that decision when reaching the fork: Oh, the less traveled one looks more suitable?Virginia Woolf was a founding member of the Bloomsbury Group, a literary association that was prominent in what we now call the inter-war period. She did have periods of mental instability, which culminated in the taking of her life, by drowning, as the Second World War was in its early phases. Parts of that instability may be reflected in the somewhat erratic nature of these essays; but rest assured, when she is \\"on,\\" she is really \\"on.\\"Woolf packs a lot into not much more than 100 pages. She starts at Oxbridge, and the serene peace of the quadrangles of these two universities in the ultimate month: October. How were they built? First, it was the age of faith, and the kings and lords poured money in, to erect an edifice to defend their position in the social hierarchy. Then it was the age of reason, the old order undermined by its own wealth. Yet that era had a passage also, as Wolfe says: \\"When the guns fired in August, 1914, did the faces of men and women show so plain in each other's eyes that romance was killed? Certainly it was a shock (to women in particular with their illusions about education, and so on) to see the faces of our rulers in the light of shell-fire. So ugly they looked- German, English, French- so stupid.\\" She notes that it was only 48 years before that wives could possess money in their own name. In the next chapter she is off to the British museum, to read about women, in books that men have written, dyspeptic men, who, Wolfe speculates: :\\"Had he been laughed at, to adopt the Freudian theory, in his cradle by a pretty girl?\\" Further, she notes the sad human tendency of seeking reassurance of one's worth by knocking the value of others. As the author says: And how can we generate this imponderable quality which is yet so invaluable, most quickly? By thinking that other people are inferior to oneself. By feeling that one has some innate superiority- it may be wealth, or rank, a straight nose, or the portrait of a grandfather by Romney- for there is no end to the pathetic devices of the human imagination - over other people.\\" As for women in this game: \\"Women have served all these centuries as looking-glasses possessing the magic and delicious power of reflecting the figure of man at twice its natural size.\\" Acerbic, yes.No question too that Woolf is erudite. A take-away for me is that I should read the essays of Charles Lamb. In the third chapter she posits the literary fate of Shakespeare's \\"sister.\\" Why did both George Eliot and George Sand adopt male pseudonyms? She addresses that also, along with the works of Jane Austen and the Brontes. Mary Carmichael, to whom Woolf also devotes much ink has, alas, slipped into obscurity.Wolfe can be repetitive, and clearly the following insult at Oxbridge rankled, since it is expressed throughout: \\"Fellows and scholars only allowed on the grass! Ladies not admitted without a letter of introduction!\\" The solution also surfaced a few times: \\"...that it is necessary to have five hundred a year and a room with a lock on the door if you are to write fiction or poetry.\\"And my daughter? Still seeking the \\"essential oil of truth,\\" which was not merely underlined, but placed in a box, and in the process acquiring the two essential ingredients along the path less traveled: the room and the funds to sustain independent thought. And I, well, should have read this book much earlier in life, so only the old saw about better late is now available. 5-stars."},{"Title":"A room of one's own","review":"Keeping in mind the date these lectures were delivered, her biographical details, etc. this is now a totally enjoyable piece. It is wonderful seeing a writer put into practice what she suggests regarding good writing while she does it. It is also easier to see the hilarity of the event. Some of the lines must have been absolutely hysterical for the audience! Critiques written by her contemporaries, both pro and con, also seem interesting. I must confess the author I thought of right away was JKR writing her Harry Potter books - famously with sleeping child in tow at a coffee shop. No room of her own or 500 pounds either! (At least to start.)But what's in a room? I interpret this as a metaphor. There is more going on here than meets the eye. 500 pounds must have been sufficient money to live in comfort - that is, no worries. So one can concentrate. One has time to read and think. That is the point of that. Perhaps also the security of knowing what one chooses to say is not liable to cause a break in one's future security. Perhaps that is one point she makes regarding Jane Austen. So the central issue here is still very much a serious matter - and certainly not just for women. I take it to mean that one must be capable of such reflection as well as have the means to reflect. Of a more contemporary note is the issue of how many books we ought to have. Perhaps VW saw no potential for there being too many. Today with self- publishing via social media there comes a point when figuring out priorities is absolutely necessary. For example, how many people are going to read this? These essentially become my notes so I can easily access my basic thoughts having read the book regardless of where I am. But what value might these have for someone else? We cannot read everything. Much of what is written today might be self-reflection on the part of someone just starting out on life's journey. Unless you are a teacher or otherwise have an interest in that young person, reading their work could even be painful as well as a waste of time. So an education of some sort becomes a requirement. Where would we be without the guidance we received so that we had hints regarding the comparative worth of literary works? Harold Bloom anyone? But this book is also a pleasure to read. Perhaps we can spend some time reading just to enjoy ourselves."},{"Title":"A room of one's own","review":"She rambled around a bit but made some very important points about women, and writing inside the traditional male-driven hegemony. While I thought it could have been better written without such a stream of consciousness that she throws upon us, she makes some very important points. Near the end of her essay are a few sentences that I think synthesize nicely much of the syllogism she conveyed:\\"Intellectual freedom depends upon material things. Poetry depends upon intellectual freedom. And women have always been poor, not for two hundred years merely, but from the beginning of time. Women have had less intellectual freedom than the sons of Athenian slaves. Women, then, have not had a dog's chance of writing poetry. That is why I have laid so much stress on money and a room of one's own.\\""},{"Title":"A room of one's own","review":"This was an incredible work, mindblowing and provocative, putting intense subject matter and scope into a very short little account. Of the work I've read so far in 2010, it does the most with the least space, giving a fundamental feminist branching point for reflections on literature, politics, war, culture, family, psychology, the academy and identity. This final element is particularly effective, providing a rich understanding of how conditions of patriarchy determine not just power, not just social roles, but the very self. Starkly, this account delves into the scope of such politics, in framing how self-regard and the regard of others. Woolf perceives and expresses very clearly that men and women both have twisted psyches from the power disequilibrium, and some of her most resonant passages are the musings on why exactly the entrenched male intellectual elite show so much passion in denying female publications. Across the work there are areas where Woolf is no longer as applicable, where she reflects on conditions in our day that are substantively changed for the better. But this is far from total, and a lot of this writing still rings very true. That's not exactly a positive reflection on the state of our world ninety years later, but it makes this piece still a vital piece of thought for policy brokers and regular citizen here and now.Perhaps the area Woolf most impressed me was her thorough understanding of how systemic realities and power structures work. Long before historians had really started taking cultural history seriously or understanding the role of discourses in positioning individuals, Woolf paints a clear understanding in the feminist context. Specifically, her question of what would happen to a woman of literary genius in a society where she cannot express herself poses some stark look at structures, while her answer (probably go insane) reveals again how fundamental this type of control is, how non-negotiable basic equality should be to avoid this kind of intergenerational anguish.In addition to Woolf's effectiveness in analysis of many given topics, there's also a great energy and value to the way she moves from one angle of focus to another. There's apower fluidity in here that reflects both the power of her thought and the inherent interconnectivity of the issues she faces, women's place in literature leads smoothly into the cultural changes of Britain since the war, which leads to reflections on basic power distribution and the scope of nature. What the question ultimately returns to, and what Woolf powerfully voices, is how widespread the power gap is between men and women, how much the later have been abused, coerced and silenced, and how intolerable this situation is. Woolf's writing is self-consciously a record of main themes of that oppression and a challenge against it.In a more minor note, it's a bit surprising to encounter repeated references to Mussolini as the archetypal figure of masculinized, militaristic fascism. Pre '33 that makes sense, and works as a reminder on how rapidly political symbols of evil and violence can shift in global vocabulary.Similar to and better than: Woolf's Three GuineasSimilar to and worse than: Butler's Gender Trouble"},{"Title":"A room of one's own","review":"Virginia Woolf in her best form - personal but not self-centred, concentrated and ready to fight for what she believes is right.

But A Room of One's Own, a very long essay about feminism, independence, writing, and becoming one's own person, is actually quite readable, quite educational, and quite wonderful. The reader, at least this one, feels she's in the presence of a great mind at work as it ruminates on and on about these topics in a somewhat rambling but engaging personal reflection.

Indeed, she speaks eloquently against just that danger throughout &quot;A Room of One's Own,&quot; which is partly what allows it to stand not only as a feminist classic, but also as a classic piece of both literature and literary criticism. It is not often that an essay reaches creative heights great enough to establish itself equally as a work of art and an intellectual effort, but Woolf has done it here.

A Room of One's Own is a skinny little treasure of a book with words and wisdom that will stay with the reader long after it is read. The essay contained in the book is the result of two papers that Ms. Woolf read to the Arts Society at newnham and Odtaa at Girton (England) in October of 1928. She was asked to speak about the topic of \\"Women and Fiction\\", and after doing so, she expanded her papers and later published them as this book.Woolf begins the essay by writing, \\"I soon saw that [the subject of women and fiction] had one fatal drawback. I should never be able to come to a conclusion. I should never be able to fulfil what is, I understand, the first duty of a lecturer- to hand you after an hour's discourse a nugget of pure truth to wrap up between the pages of your notebooks and keep on the mantelpiece for ever. All I could do was to offer you an opinion upon one minor point- a woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction... At any rate, when a subject is highly controversial- and any question about sex is that- one cannot hope to tell the truth. One can only show how one came to hold whatever opionion one does hold. One can only give one's audience the chance of drawing their own conslusions as they observe the limitations, the prejudices, the idiosyncrasies of the speaker.\\"It is in this straightforward and honest manner that Woolf writes about women and fiction. Although the speech was given and the book was published in 1929, all of its points are still important for women- and especially women writers and artists- today. In A Room of One's Own Woolf examines classic literary works of the past and wonders why most, until the 19th Century, were written by men, and why most of the works published by women in the 19th Century were fiction. She comes to the logical conclusion that women in the past had little to no time to write because of their childbearing and raising responsibilities. There is also the fact that they were not educated and were forbidden or discouraged from writing. When they did begin to write, they only had the common sitting rooms of Elizabethan homes to do so in, which did not provide much solitude or peace of mind, as it was open to any interruption and distraction that came along.Woolf argues passionately that true independence comes with economic well-being. This is true for countries, governments, individuals, and writers, especially female writers. Without financial security it is impossible for any writer to have the luxury of writing for writing's sake. It is also a very inspiring book for any aspiring write to read. I end this review with Virginia Woolf's own hopes for women in the future:\\"... I would ask you to write all kinds of books, hesitating at no subject however trivial or however vast. By hook or by crook, I hope that you will possess yourselves of money enough to travel and to idle, to contemplate the future or the past of the world, to dream over books and loiter at street corners and let the line of thought dip deep into the stream.\\"(If you liked this review, please read my other book reviews under my Amazon profile...)"},{"Title":"A room of one's own","review":"I was terrified when I found out that I had to read this book for my women's studies class because my mom told me that Virginia Woolf was like James Joyce stylistically. When I actually started reading A Room of Ones Own, I was pleasantly surprised by the intimacy and smoothness of Woolf's writing, and her clear logic compared with the rigidity of &quot;the old boy's club.&quot; She offers a simple, well thought-out argument for why a woman needs financial independence and a room of her own in order to achieve what men can achieve artistically and academically. The depressing part about A Room of Ones Own is a lot of what she writes about the status of women today compared to that of men is still true."},{"Title":"A room of one's own","review":"70 years have passed since the first publication of &quot;A Room of One's Own,&quot; and yet we have not seen as many dramatic changes, let alone improvements, in social mentality as early feminist thinkers like Virginia Woolf wished to provoke to establish women's new role as equal to men's. She argued that the reason why there was no female Shakespeare is not that women are biologically inferior to men but that there was simply no &quot;room&quot; for women to develop themselves, both metaphorically and realistically speaking. Therefore, in this book she encourages women to have a room of their own and a stable income to ensure a career. However, women, in the past as well as the present, have long been &quot;grounded&quot; by men. For a woman to have a room of her own and a stable income means that the woman is invading (from male chauvinistic viewpoint) men's territory, and this kind of behavior (and thoughts) is not to be allowed in male-dominated societies.Early feminist thinkers like Virginia Woolf provided later generations with iron-cast proof (as far as I'm concerned) that women are no &quot;second sex&quot; by pointing out the false discriminations men put against women for men's own convenience. (Ironically, I see men suffer as well from doing so.) Thinkers like Virginia Woolf provided &quot;rooms&quot; to develop feminist thoughts, and these rooms also provoke controversies and debates because feminist way of thinking is revolutionary. At any rate, there would be no improvements of women's role in society if there were no Virginia Woolf and other first-wave feminist thinkers.At the end of the twentieth century, in spite of the burgeoning &quot;industry&quot; of feminism, the real condition of women appears to be quite depressing. The real condition of women goes like this: &quot;During the last decades women's representation in education has grown enormously but so has our [their] participation in low paid and part-time work. So that, for example, the percentage of women in German higher education has doubled yet the degree of confidence German women express for women in non-traditional jobs is one of the lowest in Europe...,&quot; and &quot;similarly feminist literary criticism has created a lively and substantial body of work in the last decades but continues to exist in a hostile and often marginal academic place.&quot; (&quot;A Reader's Guide to Contemporary Feminist Literary Criticism&quot;, 1994: 290) One cannot fail to see (if one is willing to open his or her eyes) that we have made just a tiny bit of progress since the first-wave feminism. There is room for improvement, indeed, but people's ignorance of women's real position in society, women's subordinate educational, economical, and political conditions, and the overall social status of women being secondary, must first be recognized. In this sense, Virginia Woolf's &quot;A Room of One's Own&quot; appears to be especially inspiring.In my opinion, feminism is not only for or about women, it is also for and about men, because the world is composed of both sexes, and men suffer (without understanding, because of stupidity) from the traditional, male chauvinistic attitude as well. What is important is that feminist way of thinking is a breakthrough, revolutionary philosophy that challenges the way we perceive the world for centuries. &quot;A Room of One's Own&quot; opens my mind's eye; it is, no doubt, a classic that must be read."},{"Title":"A room of one's own","review":"I had no idea who this woman was, other than a generic realization that she was a writer of the early 1900s.

Let's not get into that argument! But anyway, A Room of One's Own, is cool because it makes you feel good about being a woman, and it highlights so gently and kindly and humorously the biases that may exist in your own mind and in society around you about what women can and can't and should do. I read somewhere that VW was motivated to cheer up young women who seemed so depressed. It works! I don't know what other people think: is there irony in the way she talks about how women must flatter and please and be charming to get their way; and then she herself is so flattering and charming in this book? I don't know. I learnt a lesson, though, about how to argue. I wish VW were alive. I've wanted for years now to contact her and say thankyou, and then to tell her how things are going these days."},{"Title":"A room of one's own","review":"In this book, Virginia Woolf explores the following thesis: \\"Intellectual freedom depends upon material things. Poetry depends upon intellectual freedom.\\" Writing at a time when, as she herself stated in her diary, writing was not a respectable occupation for women, Woolf showed great courage in propounding this profoundly simple, pithy book.The book began as a lecture which she prepared for a girl's school. Asked to lecture on the subject of women and fiction, she determined to propound her theory that financial independence was necessary for the creation of genius. In her way of thinking, women throughout history may have had genius, but were never given the opportunity to develop it, being always dependant upon men for their social and financial standing. She urged women to earn their own living through writing; to break free of these social and financial constraints. However, in speaking out against the male-dominated intellectual scene, she did so without anger, without acrimony. Her usual good humor and simplicity, found so clearly in her diary and letters, shine throughout the book, making it invaluable not only as a social statement, but also as a precious insight into her personality. She is in turn serious, playful, mocking, and tender.A Room of One's Own is not so applicable today as it was seventy-five years ago, but it is still valuable as an historical document; as a moral boost for aspiring young women writers; and as a further insight into the character of Virginia Woolf."},{"Title":"A room of one's own","review":"A timeless essay not only for women. Good hard binding that will keep. It's a must have if you like English literature."},{"Title":"A room of one's own","review":"This is a beautifully written and highly enjoyable exploration of the history of women in writing. It is also a plea for the liberation of women, and their full entrance into the world of Literature. Woolf argues that a woman needs financial independence, a room , that is a space of her own, if she is to be able to truly create. She also needs the kind of access to everyday life that women confined to hearth and home were as she sees it, traditionally denied.She urges that Woman enter into all fields of writing, and develop in directions they had no opportunity to develop in before.She also perhaps reflecting on her own experience and nature argues for the androgynous nature of the creator, seeing in Shakespeare, Keats and certainly Proust a strong feminine element.Woolf anticipates and perhaps in some sense helps creates the vast flourishing of Literature written by women which will come in the decades after her."},{"Title":"A room of one's own","review":"Woolf's book is a treatise in examining what is holding women back from writing their best fiction. She tells of the hindrances of women's fiction writing throughout history, and also tells of the well-known parable of Shakespeare's sister. Painful at times, but telling the truth without falter, Woolf's book should be read by all fiction writers, feminists, and anyone who has suffered oppression."},{"Title":"A room of one's own","review":"I have read much of what Virginia Woolf wrote, and this has to be my favorite.

V. Woolf is an outstanding writer and I just coud not put this book down. I agree with her approach to feminism. What she wants is to be a women, one that is free to do, say, write, etc. AS A WOMEN. She does not subscribe to the present day feminism; that is to say now many feminists want to anull men and make them feel useless. No and no, Virginia only wants to be free to be a women with the same rights as men. I totally agree with her. Men and Women are different and that's just fine with me.

I had a Doctorate of Business, as well as an AA, BBA, MBA, and was working on my Juris Doctorate in International Law. \\"I\\"! was able to 'step on the little patch of grass' outside of some hall, which was ONLY available for \\"FELLOWS\\". \\"I\\"! was a FELLOW! and could NOW 'step on that little piece of grass'.

A Room of One's Own is not only valuable for female writers, but for all women trying to fulfill their dreams.

The early 20th century essay is still widely relevant, and not just in developing countries.On the reading style, this essay is much more accessible, compared to say \`Mrs. Dalloway' and \`To the Lighthouse'. Reading it felt like having a conversation with someone who was not just erudite, but also reflected some of my own thoughts and beliefs. Especially as I believe that economic independence and resource availability could be key to overturning the notions of sexual inequality.Many thanks to Woolf for airing these thoughts and inspiring the rest of us."},{"Title":"A room of one's own","review":"One cannot think well, love well, sleep well, if one has not dined well.~Virginia Woolf, A Room of One's OwnVirginia Woolf's very intense A Room Of One's Own, is actually a long essay she wrote \\"with ardour and conviction\\" on the the topic of women and fiction, that she prepared when asked to speak about this subject at women's colleges. A Room of One's Own was published in 1929, when young women were still discouraged from attending college (due to genuine fear that a good education would make women unfit for marriage and motherhood), and although it's not angry in tone the essay reflects a society in which severe limitations were put on women and their achievements. Virginia Woolf speaks about the creative process that lead to her talks, of her notebook in which she recorded a multitude of ideas, thoughts, and mental meanderings, and writes about the train of thought that led to her conclusion, that \\"a woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction\\". In A Room of One's Own Virginia Woolf grapples with what is exactly meant by women and fiction (not a simple matter), and demonstrates and expresses the complexity of her thought in her trademark stream-of-consciousness writing. Defying conventions of the time, she talks about the actual food served at the luncheon party, of the soles and partridges and potatoes, and of the importance of food to the artist in a more general sense. She discusses numerous things in this full, layered essay of her thoughts, among them a sense of loss due to the war which began in August of 1914, that changed the underlying current of life--previously filled with music and poetry, with romance--and of the special difficulties women artists face (still relevant today!). Her message is simple (though the means is not), that women must have money (a fixed income) and a room of their own (privacy) in order to have the freedom to create, luxuries that men may take for granted. She imagines Shakespeare's \\"sister\\", equal in talent and genius, but because of her sex, never writes a word, never expresses her genius, never lives to old age because she takes her own life in quiet desperation. Her essay is meant to encourage young women, to inspire them to create, as she's sympathetic to their plight. In A Room of One's Own,Virginia Woolf wants the limitations removed, and for women to have the same intellectual freedom that men have had for centuries, so that they, too, may express their genius.(This is a passage slightly modified from my blog about books, Suko's Notebook, suko95.blogspot.com, which I invite you to visit.)"},{"Title":"A room of one's own","review":"This book is very short and it expresses brilliant logic that I have not seen for a while. Virginia Wolf writes her case about women and writing. What it takes to be a woman artist and remain one. She argues very carefully, that woman artist needs means (read: money) and a room of her own where she can express herself without any interruptions from the outside world. While many male counterparts of her times argue that women have no character and are inferior to men, Virginia asks question on how come that almost two tousand years ago, Greeks were writing literary work that described women like: Cleopatra, Medea, Clytemnestra and Electra? These powerful female images have no characted and power? Anyone who read classics knows it is far from that. Virgina also argues from the works of early British female writers such as: Lady Winchilsea, Margaret Newcastle and Aphra Behn, that finest poetry was created by a women of noble birth married into a noble families. These women were educated, cultured, most had no children and had very understanding and supportive husbands or were single. They were lonely creatures who produced valuable work. Women of lower birth and less education, such as Jane Austen and Bronte sisters, were talented, but they wrote about the world they new about: middle class that was all around them. They were social observers who wrote in the crowded living rooms about people that were part of their own world. In addition, they did not produce poems, they produced novels primarily. Virginia argues that only the most perceptive of women are capable of producing remarkable poetry. She also draws similarity that it was male writers from the upper classes that created masterpieces. The exception was Keats, who was poor but who also dies young - since writing is exhausting both physically and emotionally. But she also argues that the finest of male voices who dedicated their lives to writing has sort of sensitivity that is unique to women. So the true writer is never he or she, it is a mix of both sexes. This is one of the most powerful feminist books I have ever read and I admire Virginia Woolf for having a courage to create it and share it with the public."},{"Title":"A room of one's own","review":"The inoffensive feminist tone of this text should not confine it's readership to the predominantly female.

After all, it's Virginia Woolf and only really smart people can read Woolf's writings. But I decided to read what I could and glaze over the rest. I ended up tucking myself into bed with this book every night and reading it again and again and again.Yes, Woolf was a Victorian-era writer and the prose is thick and heavy-laden with Victorian verbosity, but her powerful writing style shines through the complicated sentences and nuanced lexicon.My very favorite part in this essay, originally delivered to college students, was where she wrote,\\"...moreover, it is all very well for you, who have got yourselves to college and enjoy sitting rooms of your own to say that genius should disregard such opinions; that genius should be above caring what is said of it. Unfortunately, it is precisely the men and women of genius who mind most what is said of them.\\"After reading that, I felt that Ms. Woolf had reached through the decades and touched my very soul.

Her criticism is sharp and poignant but without bitterness, self-pity, or arrogance, so inviting into her intimate thoughts. She has a great ability to use hypothetical character, such as Judith, Shakespeare's sister, and to use examples--Jane Austen, Coleridge-- so creatively without causing any distraction.

Despite what other reviewers may say, it is as relevant today as it was when written."},{"Title":"A room of one's own","review":"\\"A Room of One's Own,\\" published in 1929, is an expanded essay combining two papers which author Virginia Woolf presented in 1928 at Newnham and Girton Colleges, the only women's colleges at Cambridge at that time. In this dissertation on women and literature, she discusses the various obstacles facing women involved in the creative process, and stresses the importance of financial and social independence for females. I think this is probably my favorite essay by the author, and one of her finest, most accessible pieces of writing. It is important to note that her interests did not lie particularly in the areas of politics and feminism, but solely on art itself and the freedom to create it.Ms. Woolf argues that the reason there were so few prominent, highly respected women authors before the twentieth century is because most women had not led lives conducive to creating great art or literature. She posits that there was no actual body of notable women's literature because, in the past, women did not have the education, the income, the privacy, the experiences of travel to broaden their world, or the time to write. Dominated by men throughout history, females have been denied access to education, independent travel, and to publication. Without an independent income, women are totally dependent upon men.Women are responsible for bearing children, and in almost all cases have the primary responsibility for bringing them up. Few have the luxury of hired help. Although rewarding in many way, child rearing allows for little privacy, independence and solitude, prerequisite conditions for writing, painting or composing. If privacy is non-existent, interruptions block creativity. Ms. Woolf clearly states that what a woman needs is a room of her own and a guaranteed fixed income in order to write noteworthy fiction. Here she challenges women to become economically self-sufficient in order to acquire the necessary intellectual freedom to create outstanding literature. Virginia Woolf believed that the remarkable, the momentous, could be found amongst the mundane details and occurrences of everyday life. She encourages women to write about all of the \\"minutely obscure lives\\" which men have ignored, and about themselves, their feelings and their reactions to the world around them. I believe the author's great novel, \\"Mrs Dalloway\\" reflects this mindset.Aphra Behn, (1640 - 1689), was the first female writer to earn her own income from writing. After John Dryden, she was the most prolific dramatist of the Restoration. However, she achieved her place in literary history for her pioneering work in prose narrative. Ms. Behn paved the way for 19th century novelists like Jane Austen, George Eliot and the Bronte sisters, who were able to write in their family sitting-rooms or libraries, despite their lack of independence and privacy. Woolf wrote/spoke: \\"All women together ought to let flowers fall upon the tomb of Aphra Behn, which is, most scandalously but rather appropriately, in Westminster Abbey, for it was she who earned them the right to speak their minds. It is she - shady and amorous as she was - who makes it not quite fantastic for me to say to you tonight: Earn five hundred a year by your wits.\\"Ms. Woolf quotes Sir Arthur Quiller-Coach, a Professor of Literature who wrote: \\"The poor poet has not in these days, nor has had for two hundred years, a dog's chance...a poor child in England has little more hope than had the son of an Athenian slave to be emancipated into that intellectual freedom of which great writings are born.\\" Ms Woolf goes on to state that obviously this noted professor believes that intellectual freedom depends upon material things. \\"Poetry depends upon intellectual freedom. And women have always been poor, not for two hundred years merely, but from the beginning of time. Women have had less intellectual freedom than the sons of Athenian slaves. Women, then, have not had a dog's chance of writing poetry. That is why I have laid so much stress on money and a room of one's own.\\"A good part of \\"A Room of One's Own\\" analyzes the patriarchal British society that so limited a woman's opportunities. Woolf theorized that while male authors write about women and allow their heroines to \\"shine like beacons\\" in fiction, in reality women were often treated like slaves, not free to choose their own mates, and frequently beaten by their husbands and fathers. She goes on to say that men historically belittle women as a means of asserting their own superiority. She uses the metaphor of a looking-glass relationship, men, threatened by the thought of losing their power, need to reduce women to enlarge themselves.The androgynous ideal, the writer with an androgynous mind, where a writer uses both parts of the brain equally, is also championed here. \\"The androgynous mind is resonant and porous; it transmits emotion without impediment; it is naturally creative, incandescent and undivided.\\" This is a fascinating proposition which Woolf explored more fully in her 1928 novel \\"Orlando,\\" a fantasy set in the Elizabethan court, tracing the career of the androgynous protagonist from a masculine identity to a feminine identity.Woolf constructed this essay as a partly-fictionalized narrative to make her points vividly. She invents an imaginary female narrator, a talented contemporary novelist of some potential. Unfortunately, because she lacks models and a tradition to draw on, our narrator is a hundred years away from being able to develop her gifts fully, to \\"be a poet.\\" A fictional historic character is introduced, Miss Judith Shakespeare, the very gifted sibling of Will, in order to illustrate the sorry fate of highly intelligent, creative women in the past. This device is extremely effective in bringing home the difficulties of talented women living in the traditional world.I highly recommend this extraordinary long essay to both men and women - to everyone interested in the creative process. It is a brilliantly written, perceptive thesis.JANA"},{"Title":"A room of one's own","review":"This essay taken from a lecture that Virginia Woolf gave to students in England during 1928 is an essential reading for writers and feminists alike.During the 1920's women writing literature were still struggling for a voice without prejudice. Virginia Woolf emerged as one of the first feminist voices ready to speak out against the silenced history of women writers and historians. In this book she argues that any woman serious about writing must have 500 pounds per year and a room of her own in which to capture a few moments of silence and restore her voice back to power without the pull of all her \\"womanly\\" responsibilities. Woolf seems to believe that one of the only true literary voices, one that wrote without anger, fear, or prejudice was Shakespeare and that his works have lasted because of the extension of this idea. Woolf discusses Br&ouml;nte and leans towards a woman writing with anger the seeps forth in her words and of Austen she expresses appreciation for what she must have endured in order to publish her works in a male dominated industry. Woolf clearly criticizes writer's that allow their gripes to appear in their works rather than their true talents. She appears hopeful that the future holds another Shakespeare and that inevitably it will be a woman who writes so extraordinarily this time around.Woolf shows herself to be one of the first true feminists our society had during her lifetime. She unabashedly criticizes a society dominated and silenced by men who felt it their duty to protect women from their own fear. Her critique of professors who openly claim women to be inferior is turned towards them as men concerned instead with being superior. She insists that the enlargement of men like Napoleon and Mussolini as well as the many wars society has experienced is purely because the light that is contained within women has been allowed to be dimmed by male domination. Woolf is saddened and disgusted by the fact that history and literature represented women so poorly in the past refusing to offer a woman as being anything more than a lover to a greater man. She also indicates that the suffrage movement probably contributed towards males feeling challenged by something far inferior to their inflated superiority. Her words are quite strong for a woman of her era but also fairly futuristic in thought.Woolf writes of many intelligent guidelines for any writer in this book. She offers a suggestion that one should write with an androgynous mind allowing both the softness of the feminine and the power of the masculine to come forth in words. A writer must not fear another's opinion but instead believe so forcefully in one's words that criticism cannot cause dishonesty of talent. And of course she is resolute in the fact that a writer needs a room of one's own to come to his or her center and in order to bring forth greatness without prejudice."},{"Title":"A room of one's own","review":"Oh, this was VERY good. And totally still applies today, sometimes shockingly so. A few times this felt dated, but mostly it was a very sharp, entertaining, poignant, and important essay. I enjoyed the format of both lectures quite a lot. The first was brilliant, following the day of one woman thinking about the issues of women and literature, and seeing that woman encounter all types of barriers in her everyday living. The second provided more of the \\"meat and potatoes\\" (the heart and facts) of the problems faced by women who wish to participate in literature. The fictionalized story of Shakespeare's sister was very powerful.I'll definitely be thinking about this for awhile."},{"Title":"A room of one's own","review":"There is no mistaking Woolf's writing style: intricate, introspective, convoluted and then again portraying ideas and situations with brilliant clarity and insight. She ponders the plight of women during her time and through history. Her main question asks why women, despite even those with exceptional talents of intelligence and character, have been abused and dominated by men and relegated to roles as mothers and servants to the men around them. Why are there not great female financiers, writers, academics, etc.? Or why are there too few of them? She searches in many corners such as history books and makes deplorable discoveries: early teen marriages, beatings, restrictions of all sorts, and despicable opinions of women in general by academics and men in other stations. In one instance she compares the plight of Shakespeare and his sister, both equally talented, and you can imagine the results. Her musings are gripping and interesting and at the same time she paints the quality of her physical surroundings quite vividly. This is a favorite book."},{"Title":"A room of one's own","review":"Woolf's &quot;A Room of One's Own&quot;, a collection of papers Woolf delivered for the literary societies of Girton and Newnham in 1928, stands as an all-time classic of the feminist movement.The thesis of the essays consists of the simple statement that womens' literature would be on par with that of men, if women had had the same levels of income, privacy, and experience as their counterparts. Woolf's main illustration of this principle was a hypothetical sister to Shakespeare, who, even with the same talents as her brother, would have never had the chances to display her talents to the world.This book is actually rather apolitical, dealing directly with the arts. It is very positive, and is not accusitory towards men. It is straightforward and brief, and brings its point across quickly. For its time, it was an excellent and radical short work, but over the last 70 years it has lost some of its relevance to the modern reader, as its thesis has gradually been proven true."},{"Title":"A room of one's own","review":"Susan Gubar writes the excellent introduction to this lovely annotated version of Woolf's A Room of One's Own. Even those who have read this book before will enjoy reading a scholarly annotated edition--the notes and introduction provide valuable insight into Woolf's life and times, and the specific conditions against which she rebelled."},{"Title":"A room of one's own","review":"Her argument goes: \\"Intellectual freedom depends upon material things.\\" The intellectual freedom of writing books, good books, depends on a person's ability to acquire income and to have their own space, undisturbed and unashamed. Virginia Woolf suggests that she is an amateur in this matter, and, due to her lack of formal education, finds it difficult to properly research the topic. However, she proves herself competent in making a coherent argument that is convincing, though her conclusions are no longer very surprising. It is difficult to argue against her, to say that women, who have had substantially lower incomes than men and have faced many stigmas and prejudices are not disadvantaged in producing works of literature or art or in making intellectual contributions.As I said, her argument is no longer new. Most people probably do not have to read this book in order to agree with her main thesis. But she does make a few interesting points about the role of women in literature and what the effects of increased freedom for women might be. For the method of the argument alone this book has value: \\"...one cannot hope to tell the truth. One can only show how one came to hold whatever opinion one does hold.\\" She does not ask you to agree, but only to understand why she thinks what she does."},{"Title":"A room of one's own","review":"Critics might agree or disagree with Virginia Woolf, based on the degree to which they perceive her as threatening or unstable.Whether Woolf is portraying a feminist view or not in her \\"A Room of One's Own\\"; she is outstandingly candid and honest about the way she's perceiving life.I agree with a few great points that Woolf raised for example:1. As Woolf puts it in her own words: \\"intellectual freedom depends upon material things\\". No one who's financially dependent can have the freedom to explore any intellectual versions.2-One of most Woolf's fascinating opinions is her view of the subjective nature of truth. When a subject is highly controversial, no one can actually tell the truth, but simply defend her or his opinion and how they arrived at their opinion. Each person's reality simply depends on the circumstances and experiences they encountered, therefore, no reality is absolutely objective.In that way, Woolf insinuates that all the truth she presented in her book is questionable, just a very interesting way of dealing with any controversial matter.I strongly disagree that these points or ideas apply only to females. I think, they apply to every human being, but because of Woolf's own experience as a female, I believe she had to apply them to only females."},{"Title":"A room of one's own","review":"This may be a longer essay than many may be used to reading, but it is worth reading!

The cause of feminist equality has improved somewhat in the intervening years but is still falls shamefully short of full emancipation.As Woolf so eloquently puts it, a woman needs money and a room of one's own. And it is still a rare woman who has both. Her use of the imaginary tale of Shakespeare's sister and her \\"feminine\\" fate still has weight and packs a significant punch of truth.The other significant factor that Woolf does not touch on in this essay is time. The weight of child rearing, housework and domesticity still falls heavily on women. There has been some movement with men being involved in that area but the movement is very, very slow. Added to that, it is a rare woman who does not have to work and bring income into the household.Woolf continues to speak with honesty to the issues of feminism and women over the intervening bridge of years.

At first I fell in love with it, it's all of that which contemporary writer's such as Iris Johansen or James Patterson will NOT give you perhaps not even in of their writings, although to be honest although I do happen to love this book very, very much for the essence of it it does grow a bit lukewarm for my palate. It's probably the manner in which her vocabulary is so extended it forces me to look up words very often or how I am so unaccustomed to her, she gives you things to read which very few writer's offer and the manner in which she speaks it is so profound, nonetheless I've only read it through once and Im absolutely positive I'd love to read it again getting the hang of it a bit more. Just as someone said in some other review of a Virginia Woolf novel: she isn't to be read in 10 minute intervals, give her your time entirely and then you'll see how rewarding it is. Perhaps that's why people don't write like her anymore: Our society doesn't make the time for reading such works of art, all they have time for is bubble-gum-like James Patterson type fiction (and I probably should've made more time to enjoy it more thoroughly, too). It's truthfully great and I honestly love it but not everyone will be ready for it -nor for it's voice or meaning."},{"Title":"A room of one's own","review":"I had to read this book for my Women in Literature and Visual Arts class, as it focused on female authors in the past, and why they had little representation in history. The overall thesis of the book is that women need a room of their own in order to finds a place in history. It served as the foundation of our class. This book is certainly not for everyone, but it was an interesting perspective and certainly worth reading."},{"Title":"A room of one's own","review":"This book is an ideal gift for any young person, but particularly for girls entering puberty. It is a guide to gaining and keeping control of one's goals and self-respect. The topics covered include a right to privacy, a good education and a modest income sufficient to allow for independence and nurture creativity. The author's voice is that of a friend or mentor, never heavy-handed or pompous, but wise and straightforward. Woolf never talks down to you, the reader; her writing is elegant and she assumes you care to be a woman of substance, not a drone."},{"Title":"A room of one's own","review":"Whenever I read this I think, \\"I've got a room and some money -- so maybe deciding to write for a living wasn't such a bad idea after all.\\""},{"Title":"A room of one's own","review":"Familiar with Virginia Woolf only from reputation, I picked up a copy of this book at an antique store. It sat on my nightstand for over a year before I opened the very short essay. Written almost 100 years ago, I related so well to her words, it's one of the few books I know I'll read again, and again. I've actually underlined sections - something I never do! Great for female writers and those who love them."},{"Title":"A room of one's own","review":"This is not just an essay on feminism, this is a window to Virginia Woolf's thought pattern and logic. A Room of One's Own is beautifully written, it almost reads like a novel yet is packed with insightful thoughts on the idea of being an independent woman. The roles of women have changed since Virginia wrote this book but that in no way renders this book obsolete, for there are many struggles yet to be overcome and Virginia foresaw that in this book.Her hopes and dreams for women are beautifully expressed and heartwarming. This book is like a gem, the more you look at it the brighter it shines. I have reread A Room of One's Own many times and gotten so much from it. Its a book you will not regret owning. Simply inspiring."},{"Title":"A room of one's own","review":"I really didn't know much about Virginia Woolf until 2005, when I ended up living with a dear friend who taught at a local college. Like most folks, I knew Woolf was a writer of the early 1900s and I'd seen the movie \\"The Hours\\" and that was the sum total of my knowledge.One day, my dear friend handed me this book and said, \\"You'll like this.\\"I was intimidated. After all, it's Virginia Woolf and only really smart people can read Woolf's writings. But I decided to read what I could and glaze over the rest. I ended up tucking myself into bed with this book every night and reading it again and again and again.Yes, Woolf was a Victorian-era writer and the prose is thick and heavy-laden with Victorian verbosity, but her powerful writing style shines through the complicated sentences and nuanced lexicon.My very favorite part in this essay, originally delivered to college students, was where she wrote,\\"...moreover, it is all very well for you, who have got yourselves to college and enjoy sitting rooms of your own to say that genius should disregard such opinions; that genius should be above caring what is said of it. Unfortunately, it is precisely the men and women of genius who mind most what is said of them.\\"After reading that, I felt that Ms. Woolf had reached through the decades and touched my very soul. For so many years, I struggled and struggled and struggled to stop caring what people thought or said about me and that single statement uttered and recorded by this amazing woman changed my life forever."},{"Title":"A room of one's own","review":"This is a testament to writers everywhere. Write, write, and write is what you must do to become published, but you must have your own space to do so. Virginia Woolf's testament to that resounds just by the fact that her writing has survived various generations to still be read today."},{"Title":"The Greek Concept Of Nature (Suny Series in Ancient Greek Philosophy)","review":"Because it is considered the foundations for most of our current culture and philosophy, we have been studying Greek philosophy for literally centuries. It is therefore to see this book come out with a somewhat different view of what the earlier Greek philosophers meant by the word phusis means.Usually translated as nature, the author has come to the concusiion that the ancient philosophes used the word to mean 'origin, process and result.'The author is clearly an expert on the ancient or classical Greek language, including some very obscure details of the grammer. He has used these to make his own translations of some of the earliest philosophical works. The differences in his translations are subtle, but they impact the meanings some of the earliest philosphers : Anazimander, Zenophanes, Pythagoras, Heraclitus, Parmenides, Empedocies, Anaxagoras, Leucippus and Democritus when they were using the word. The meaning of the word, obviously, can change the meaning of the entire work.This is not an introductory text on Greek philosophical, but provides an interesting insight into some of these points."},{"Title":"Schaum's Outline Theories of Advanced Mathematics for ...

Mostly a good book."},{"Title":"George Whitefield: Wayfaring witness","review":"George Whitefield is primarily of interest to us today for his remarkable ability to relate his Salvation experience to large numbers of people in unceasing ways. Clearly, the Holy Spirit was working overtime through Whitefield to bring out the Good News about gaining Salvation.This book's weakness is primarily in placing too little emphasis and explanation on that part of Whitefield's life. If you want to understand Whitefield, the evangelist, a much better book is George Whitefield: The Life and Times of the Great Evangelist of the Eighteenth-Century Revival (Volume 1) by Pastor Arnold A. Dallimore.I must credit Professor Henry for encapsulating a lot of information very briefly. I was particularly interested in reading what he had to say about the reactions to Whitefield.May another great revival be just ahead of us!"},{"Title":"Goodnight, My Angel","review":"I enjoyed Goodnight My Angel very much and recommend it to anyone who is looking for a fast but meaningful read.

This books focuses on physical and technical understanding required for designing an aircraft with a little bit of historical background. This book also includes some color photos and graphs, I would recommend buying this book."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of aircraft design","review":"Having worked in preliminary design of modern commercial airliners for several years I must say, this is the book which best summarizes the current industry practices. Maths are down to the relevant amount, reflecting the real ways of working, which makes it a readable book at the same time. The large aircraft/engine/aero database in the appendix adds a lot of value, as reference data is the most important thing in preliminary design.Highly recommended to students in aircraft design and also to engineers who are looking for an answer on why aircraft look the way they do.AIRSHIP ENTHUSIASTS BEWARE: This book does not cover airship design at all."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of aircraft design","review":"This is an updated edition of Nicolai's 1975 publication.

I am planning on adopting this book for our senior aircraft design course."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of aircraft design","review":"This book comes in two volumes. The book you see is Volume 1 which is devoted to Aircraft Design only. Airship Design is supposedly covered in Volume 2 which I have been unable to locate. The AIAA says it is unavailable. Does that mean it hasn't been published yet or just that they didn't have one to send me? If any of you find out, please let me know. Volume 1 is an excellent 900-page book with about 200 pages of appendices. Volume 2 promises several Case Studies which I am most interested in."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of aircraft design","review":"Though surpassed by newer texts on the subject (such as Raymer's, which seems to summarize a lot of older references), Nicolai's book gives some background theory in aircraft design in a very readable format. Not recomended for the mathematically challenged and lacks a good index but is a good read nonetheless."},{"Title":"Making Books That Fly, Fold, Wrap, Hide, Pop Up, Twist, And Turn: Books for Kids to Make","review":"As stated in the title, this is a book for kids but has some pretty neat ideas. The book begins with an introduction touching on the question &quot;what is a book?&quot; with lots to think about. Such as pg 6 - &quot;Can you call it a book if it's big enough to walk through? How about a book that is small enough to be carried in a little pouch that hangs from your belt? Have you ever seen a book made up of five kites, each with part of a poem written on it? Or a book that looks like a window shade, with each page working like one of the slats?...&quot;Then there are sections on How to Use this Book, Tools and Materials, Setting Up a Book Center, Writing Your Message, and Illustrating. The book project sections are: * Books that Carry Messages across Space and Time (accordian fold with pockets, stabbounds, coptic binding and foldouts, origami, and others). * Books that Celebrate and Mark Things (Japanese ledger binding, scroll books, &quot;pamphlet-bound notebook in a polaire&quot;, &quot;pop-ups in a glue book&quot;). * Books that Save Words, Ideas and Pictures (&quot;accordian-folded, with small pamphlet-bound inserts&quot;, &quot;Tetratetraflexagon journal that unfolds in two mysterious ways&quot;, ring binding, secret compartments and others). * Books that Help Us Think and Make Sense of Experiences (Dos a Dos books, accordians cut into three sections, hardcover/three signature book, stab binding with split pages, lotus book).Interspersed throughout are water color pics of neat old books and various book history bits. Super reading.Though written for kids, the book doesn't talk down to readers but rather encourages them to go ahead and try making a book. I'm really looking forward to putting together some of the projects, which are not in the least juvenile.Oh, did I mention the book is hardcover with a vinyl spine so you can see through it to the mull and stitching? Neato!"},{"Title":"Making Books That Fly, Fold, Wrap, Hide, Pop Up, Twist, And Turn: Books for Kids to Make","review":"I used several ideas in this book to teach an afterschool bookmaking class for K-3rd graders. The books are eye-catching and pretty simple to make, although I did a bit of prep work for the kids.It was really wonderful to see how much the children loved their projects. They were extremely creative and innovative too, every child made the book their own by doing something interesting or different with the materials provided. This is in stark contrast to several adult bookmaking classes I've taken, where the adult students want to recreate the teacher's book EXACTLY.Anyway, I highly recommend this book to anyone is willing to spend some time making books with kids. Children older than 4th grade MIGHT be able to use this book independently, depending on their experience and motivation.Regardless, I think this book is wonderful for showing kids just how fascinating and rewarding it can be to make their very own books."},{"Title":"Making Books That Fly, Fold, Wrap, Hide, Pop Up, Twist, And Turn: Books for Kids to Make","review":"While this book is written for young people, these projects can easily translate into adult projects. The book includes some fundamental book making but also takes you, step-by-step, to more complex design, stitchery and concepts as you go from chapter to chapter. The coptic stitch is woven into pages 28-30 so subtly that you may not immediately realize its intricacy. What is fascinating about Books that Fly is its imagination and introduction to the wonder of books. It takes the reader on a magic tour of books."},{"Title":"Making Books That Fly, Fold, Wrap, Hide, Pop Up, Twist, And Turn: Books for Kids to Make","review":"I recently purchased this book and have found it to be a terrific resource for teaching children how to make beautiful books.The instructions and diagrams are easy to follow and very clear.

My mother was a working artist with an MA in studio arts and art education, and she had a genius for running a three ring circus in her own art classes. At any one time she could have up to two or three projects going for anything from K-12, college classes, private lessons, and special ed groups. Although she didn't actually teach me \\"art\\" her example, and encouragement, and the availability of almost every conceivable art material at home gave me an opportunity to try almost every medium. Ms Diehn is probably one of the few authors on arts and crafts that even remotely compares with my mother's influence.Making Books that Fly, Fold, Wrap, Hide, Pop Up, & Turn is a marvelous example of a how-to book that not only gives one ideas but encourages one to come up with them on ones own as well. It's exuberance also encourages the learner to \\"go ahead and try it!\\" It combines information on how to do it, with history on the evolution of books and book art. The author gives simple instructions that any person who can read can understand and illustrations that are understandable enough that the pre-literate individual may put the instructions to work with only a little help.More than anything the author has instilled a sense that art is a process, a fun process; it is what artists do. Like most processes, art is also something one experiences; it's a feeling. Like my mother, she shows that there are no real \\"rules\\" about what makes something a work of art; when one gets right down to it, art is just as the old hackneyed phrase has it, &quot;just what you like.&quot; There is probably nothing worse than an art teacher who disparages the creativity of the students in her charge. I have friends who refuse to do anything remotely artistic because they had an art teacher that \\"thought anything less than Rembrandt was a waste of time!\\" as one of my former roommates said. How sad. In Ms. Diehn I find an artist like my mother, who had a lovely collection of student art, someone who loves the process and is able to convey her passion to the reader.I hope to make several of the ingenious little books Ms Diehn illustrates for Christmas gifts for my friends. We've all got pretty much all we want by way of material goods-and anything they might like and don't have I probably couldn't afford anyway!-so these charming books will permit me to give them something of sentimental value. We've shared a lot of years together and what better way to preserve the memories!An impressive little art book."},{"Title":"Making Books That Fly, Fold, Wrap, Hide, Pop Up, Twist, And Turn: Books for Kids to Make","review":"This is a lot of fun for kids or adults. The instructions are step by step and are clearly written. They're also augmented by line drawing of how to do the folds and where to cut. Pictures of finished books are also shown so you can see how it should turn out. There are pictures of kids making these crafts throughout the book which makes it kid friendly. There are also ideas on themes for the books so it's a little more than just about the mechanics of folding but also ideas on content. The gypsy wagon for example has little cards that you put into each of the folds so she has you write a story in the cards first - by the end you have a really cool folding book that is interactive and tells a story. As I mentioned, this is great for kids of all ages (like me at 36 years young).

It's way too complicated for a young child - despite photos of kids in the 8 - 10 year old range, I'd be leery of trying this, even with a lot of adult supervision. Unless the child has exceptional small motor skills, I think the adult would end up having to do most of it, and it could be frustrating for the child. I own a number of bookmaking books for adults, and instructions for sewn bindings are extremely difficult to convey in those books - few do it successfully. In an attempt (I'm guessing) to keep this &#34;simple&#34; the instructions are kept short, and for some reason the visual instructions are either missing, or not specific enough. I have some other books by Gwen Diehn, and they are wonderful, so I bought this sight unseen, hoping that she would have laid it out well enough for an adult to follow - I could, but it would take more time and effort than I am willing to expend.

Rather it is arranged categorically according to ideas, with the intention of aiding in literary composition, as the title page states.This is apparently the first American Edition of Roget's Thesaurus, first printed in 1933. I came across it when my mom brought it home from a book sale. I didn't think much of it until I realized the organization was competely different than what we are now used to. At first it seemed like a royal hassle. However, now that I've spent some time with it over the years, I would not go back to the alphabetical set-up. In fact, almost any time I write creatively, I have this book by my side.There are six basic classifications outlined in the contents.I. Abstract RelationsII. SpaceIII. MatterIV. IntellectV. VolitionVI. AffectionsIn turn, these each have various divisions and subdivisions. At first it is a dizzying, yet dazzling, organization, making it seem impossible to find anything. However, there is a fairly extensive index at the back; if you're looking for synonyms of a specific word, you can start there. The benefit of the set-up is that it affords almost endless cross-referencing. It's impossible not to find a plethora of related words. Additionally, since it is a fairly old edition, there is an extravagant supply of words that are essentially out of use. Each individual word entry has its synonyms listed according to parts of speech: Noun, Verb, Adjective, Adverb, and also Phrases, which can be anything from literary references to foreign phrases to colloquialisms and slang sayings. For the avid word-lover, this volume is an absolutely inexhaustible treasury.

It is very well-illustrated, including many color photos. With an initial pressing of 5,000,000 copies, it was intended for wide distribution. It is still (as of 2011) distributed by the Watchtower Society.Here are some quotations from the book, that often illustrate distinctive doctrines of the WBTS:\\"Daniel reports that when Babylon was overthrown, a king named 'Darius the Mede' began to rule. (Daniel 5:31) Darius the Mede has not yet been found by name in secular or archaeological sources.\\" (Pg. 17)\\"Evidently, Nebuchadnezzar's 'seven times' involved seven years... so the king's 'seven times,' or seven years, were ... 2,520 days... That 'trampling' began in 607 B.C.E when Jerusalem was destroyed and the typical kingdom of God ceased to function in Judah... If we were to count 2,520 literal days from Jerusalem's destruction in 607 B.C.E., that would bring us only to 600 B.C.E., a year having no Scriptural significance... Since the 'seven times' are prophetic, we must apply to the 2,520 days the Scriptural rule, 'A day for a year'... The 'seven times' of earth's domination by Gentile powers without interference by God's Kingdom therefore spanned 2,520 years... Thus, the 'seven times,' or 2,520 years, ended by Tishri 15, or October 4/5, 1914 C.E.\\" (Pg. 95-97)\\"The 'holy ones' persecuted by the 'small horn'--the Anglo-American world power--are Jesus' spirit-anointed followers on earth.\\" (Pg. 141)\\"Today, the remaining ones of the 144,000 are earthly representatives of the 'heavenly Jerusalem'--the citylike Kingdom of God--and its temple arrangement... In this sense they occupy a 'holy place' that the seventh world power tries to trample on and make desolate.\\" (Pg. 175)\\"What was the experience of Jehovah's Witnesses during World War II? They suffered intense persecution!... When these nations conscripted their manpower, they refused to grant ministerial exemption to Jehovah's Witnesses, showing no respect for their theocratic appointment as ministers of God. Mob violence and various indignities were experienced by Jehovah's faithful servants in the United States... By persecuting 'the holy ones' during World War II, the small horn put on great airs 'all the way to the Prince of the army.'\\" (Pg. 176)\\"The 2,300 days constitute a prophetic period... When was this period? Well, in the 1930s, God's people began to experience increasing persecution in various countries... Therefore, the 2,300 days must be associated with that war... While the 2,300 days ran their course during World War II ... The Watchtower of October 15, 1944, contained an article... (that) indicated that the 2,300 days had ended and that 'the holy place' was again in its 'right condition.'\\" (Pg. 177-179)\\"Nehemiah's arrival in Jerusalem occurred near the end of Artaxerxes' 20th year, or in 455 B.C.E. It is then that the foretold 'seventy weeks,' or 490 years, began. They would end in the latter part of 36 C.E.... As prophesied, early in 33 C.E., Christ was 'cut off' when he died on a torture stake... So it was that Jehovah removed the law covenant by means of Christ's death in 33 C.E. ... at the end of the 'seventy weeks' of years, in 36 C.E., the apostle Peter preached to the devout Italian man Cornelius, his household, and other Gentiles.\\" (Pg. 190-194)\\"But what about Jehovah's people? As far back as March 1880, the Watch Tower magazine linked the rule of God's Kingdom with the ending of 'the appointed times of the nations,' or 'the times of the gentiles.'\\" (Pg. 261)\\"Who will be this king when Daniel 11:44, 45 is fulfilled? Will he be identified with one of the countries that were part of the former Soviet Union? Or will he change identity completely, as he has done a number of times before?... Only time will provide answers to these questions. We are wise not to speculate.\\" (Pg. 281)\\"Recall that Michael is a name given to Jesus in his role as a heavenly Ruler. The reference to his 'standing'... refers to the action of a king, such as his taking up royal power... When, though, does Michael 'stand up'? When he rises up to take special action. This, Jesus will do in the future.\\" (Pg. 289)\\"But this promise in the book of Daniel (12:2) refers primarily to another kind of resurrection--one that has already occurred. How could that be?... In the Bible, resurrection sometimes has a spiritual significance... Has there been such a spiritual revival of God's anointed servants in the time of the end? Yes! It is a historical reality that in 1918 a small remnant of faithful Christians were subjected to an extraordinary attack that disrupted their organized public ministry. Then, against all likelihood, in 1919 they returned to life in a spiritual sense. These facts fit the description of the resurrection foretold at Daniel 12:2.\\" (Pg. 290-291)\\"Daniel 12:3 even tells us what work would occupy these anointed Christians in the time of the end... The anointed remnant set about gathering the remaining number of the 144,000 joint heirs of Christ... When that work was completed--evidently by the mid-1930s--they began gathering the 'great crowd' of 'other sheep.'\\" (Pg. 292)\\"The prophecy is quite explicit as to when the 1,260 days would END--when there is a 'finishing of the dashing of the power of the holy people to pieces.' In the middle of 1918, leading members of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society... were convicted on false charges... and imprisoned... Counting back three and a half years from mid-1918 brings us to the end of 1914. At that time the little band of anointed ones were bracing themselves for the onslaught of persecution... The parallel prophecy found in Revelation 11:3, 9, 11 shows that after the 'two witnesses' are killed, they lie dead for only a short period of time--three and a half days---until they are revived. Similarly, the prophecy in Daniel chapter 12 shows that the holy ones would not remain silent but had more work ahead of them.\\" (Pg. 296-297)\\"During that time, did the holy ones make progress toward becoming whitened and cleansed in God's eyes? They certainly did! In March 1919 the president of the Watch Tower Society and his close associates were released from prison. They were later exonerated of the false charges against them... By the end of the foretold 1,290 days, the holy ones were well on the way to a cleansed and restored standing.\\" (Pg. 300)"},{"Title":"Pay Attention to Daniel's Prophecy!","review":"I have found that this book on the discussion of the Bible book of Daniel to be impecable in referencing blow by blow scriptures in the Book of Daniel.

Near the end of her trek she sees her husband for the first when she watches him shoot fleeing outlaws with buckshot. Uncomfortable with violence and hearing about Russ' reputation from a traveling companion that he killed someone ten years ago, Tanzy decides to delay the nuptials insisting to Russ they need to know one another better; Russ reluctantly agrees.Russ is attracted to the sassy Tanzy and begins courting his fianc&eacute;e. She soon sees a different picture of the person so many fear; instead he is kind and caring. As they fall in love, his past surfaces when an enemy snatches his Tanzy to get at Russ.Leigh Greenwood always provides one of the year's best western romances, but his latest tale may be the best in an illustrious career. The lead couple is a likable pairing that readers hope come together as their interplay is terrific fun to follow. However, what makes the tale is the realistic support cast as the audience gets a different taste on relationships that would send someone less courageous than Tanzy is back to St. Louis.

The material is carefully organized within ten sections which range from \\"The Real World: When Theory Meets Practice\\" to \\"Visiting Olympus: The Corporate Legends.\\" In the Foreword, Harold J. Leavitt suggests that there are at least three reasons why this volume can be helpful: \\"These verbal snapshots, taken together, provide a panoramic view of the actual organizational world circa 2000\\"; \\"In this era of volatility and impermanence, of mergers and takeovers and of wild markets, these readings remind us of a reality too easily forgotten: that much of organizational management has not changed\\"; and finally, the various essays \\"spotlight something far more than this year's managerial beats and beauties, and more than the unchanging, deep heart-beats of organizations. They catch the new, new thing: the speed, turbulence and instability that have sharply and permanently differentiated the new organizational surround from all its predecessors.\\" In effect, what we have here is a \\"yearbook\\" which correlates the past with the present while suggesting what an uncertain future could prove to be.It remains for each reader to determine which of the sections and which of the individual essays (to which David Leonhardt has written crisp and insightful introductions) are of greatest interest and value. I hasten to add that, as a reader's needs and interests change, there will be what Adrian Slywotsky calls a \\"value migration.\\" Hence the importance of determining which essays are grouped within each section. (I wish the editors had listed them in the \\"Contents\\" section.) At the moment, the sections which interest me most are \\"Moving with the Times: Old Economy Meets New\\" (#3), \\"The Talent Squeeze: Recruiting and Retaining Employees\\" (#6), and \\"9-1-1: When Things Go Wrong\\" (#9). I also enjoyed \\"Visiting Olympus\\" (#10) which features brief but rigorous discussions of \\"corporate legends\\" such as Warren E. Buffett, David Merrick, Tom Landry, Bill Gates, and Peter F. Drucker, followed by a lengthier discussion of Sanford I. Weil. Julie Flaherty provides an appropriate Afterword in which she briefly compares and contrasts certain business principles (and cultural values) in the 19th and 20th centuries. Great stuff.In the Foreword, Leavitt says this about the material in this volume: \\"No ribbons and bows here, no airbrushed warts and scars, just sharp, clear pictures of the new whirling managerial world, a world that will surely be whirling even faster by the time new M.B.A.s are ready to jump aboard a year or two from now.\\" As we proceed into a new century, change may well be the only constant and yet....and yet, as various authors represented in this volume suggest, certain \\"hot ideas and best practices\\" have been essential to commerce throughout human history. Plus a change....Of all the business books I have read within the past year, this is one of the very few which is as entertaining as it is informative.

Most can be identified without magnification. Plants are identified using dichotomous keys.I also use The Jepson Manual, Higher Plants of California and the old Munz's. But both are heavy and difficult to use in the field for many of the genera though I did use them when I got home to check my identifications. The second great feature of this book is that the plants are specific to the area that I was traveling through. I didn't have to separate out plants that only live in the desert or at the coast. Eliminating that many choices made the effort much easier.I recommend the book heartily, understanding the plants and animals around us greatly enhances the experience of enjoying nature.Many of the plants that I found can be seen at californiagardens.com"},{"Title":"A Sierra Nevada Flora","review":"This book is valuable because it's complete and compact enough to carry in a backpack. Unfortunately, it has enough drawbacks that I wish someone else would write a better book to compete with it.One example of its problems is when I tried to use it to identify a daisy. The index showed no listing for daisy, so I looked through the Aster family section the hard way, and eventually found the genus Erigeron (which turned out to be indexed under \\"wild daisy\\"). Unlike most genera, the book only provides a key for this genus, and omits the usual species description that includes things like plant height that I rely on to confirm the guesses that I make from the key.I've found an unusually large number of anomalies where I suspect the book is simply wrong. For instance, it says Lupinus adsurgens leaflets are 2-5 mm long, whereas Jepsen says they're 20-50 mm long (I suspect Jepsen is right).Experienced botanists will find this book to be a worthwhile supplement to Jepsen. Amateurs should look elsewhere, and probably settle for something that only tries to cover the most interesting flowers."},{"Title":"A Sierra Nevada Flora","review":"This book is great.

The flora seems very complete for any plant you find over 4,000 foot elevation--it won't help as much if you're in the foothills.

It is, however, reasonably complete, and compact enough to be portable. It contains a great deal of useful information, such as species lists, some basic ecology of the sierras, and as I said, the species descriptions.

Like the ant book this book deals on how humans and bees have interacted, from when humans first hunted down bees to steal their honey to when we made horror movies about them. Facts, fiction, legends and history, this book touches on everything and anything that has to do with bees in our culture, books, movies and ideals."},{"Title":"Bee","review":"\\"Bee\\" isn't really a book about the biology of bees or history of beekeeping, although a few chapters on this have been included. Rather, it's a book about the bee as a cultural or political symbol. The author is a lecturer in English literature. Indeed, the biology sections of the book contain sloppy mistakes. For instance, Preston doesn't understand the exact taxonomical relationship between ants, wasps and bees. She also constantly refers to the Western honeybee as the only honey-making bee, yet mentions other honey-making bees as well, sometimes on the same page!But then, the book is really about humans...Preston points out that the honeybee has traditionally been a positive symbol in Western culture. The bee was considered chaste, virginal, hard-working and co-operative. Christians connected it to the virgin birth of Christ or the perpetual virginity of Mary (for a long time, people had no idea how bees reproduce). The bee supposedly left the Garden of Eden already before the fall of man, and was therefore a perfect divine creation. During the 16th and 17th centuries, many royalists claimed that the hive was controlled by a king bee. Supporters of a constitutional monarchy claimed that the worker-bees could overthrow a bad king bee. And a admirer of Elizabeth I pointed out (correctly) that the \\"king\\" bee was really a queen bee! Still others saw the beehive as a republic.Preston has detected a change of attitude towards the honeybee as a cultural symbol during the French revolution. Both the revolutionaries and Napoleon used the bee or the beehive as emblems. Because of this, the bee got a negative reputation in Britain. Suddenly, bees were seen less as the epitome of order and more as a dangerous swarm bent on destruction. The hostility to the bee was continued by the Romantics, who saw it as a metaphor for depersonalized industrial society. Likewise with Fritz Lang, whose famous movie \\"Metropolis\\" depicts enslaved workers as being similar to bees.But the worst bee-scare came in the United States after World War II, perhaps due to the anti-Communist hysteria of the Cold War. The collectivism of the hive resembled that of Communism. Preston also mentions a few horror movies where the evil takes the form of women who turn out to be \\"queen bees\\". Strangely, Preston never reflects on whether these films could be anti-feminist. Of course, when the Africanized killer bee \\"invaded\\" the United States from Mexico, the movie industry had a field day. Many horror movies about killer bees use these insects as an obviously racist metaphor for Blacks, Mexicans or aliens in general. One particularly bad movie depicts the killer bees as eco-terrorists, and this even before eco-terrorism became an issue!However, Preston also points out that the European honeybee was still seen as a positive cultural symbol in many contexts. In the United States, bees are still used as role models for children: \\"Be a Do-Bee, Don't Be a Don't-Bee\\". Indeed, it's difficult to believe that the negative attitude towards the European honeybee was ever the dominant trend. It's hardly a co-incidence that the negative views of the Cold War era were later projected onto the more aggressive and invasive killer bees!Some new development not mentioned by the author are the varroa mite and CCD. My guess is that bees will eventually become symbols of human civilization itself. The next horror movie will feature gigantic mites...or terrorists inducing mass starvation through CCD. The honeybees (and ecologists) will be the good guys. Boring, right?As already pointed out, \\"Bee\\" isn't really about bees. It's a book about the human hive. It's not a scholarly study, but rather a compilation of facts about bees as metaphor. Some chapters could need better editing. Frankly, you probably should approach this book with a grain of salt. I mean, a book that mentions both Virgil, Edmund Burke and \\"Candyman\\"? Still, if you have a beekeeper or Do-Bee in the family, it could perhaps work as a lighter birthday gift.Three stars."},{"Title":"The pacha of many tales","review":"The Pacha of the Many Tales is Marryat's contribution to the Arabian Nights' tradition. The Pacha of the title decides to imitate that great work by collecting tales, each of which is thoroughly inventive and preposterous, but highly entertaining. The Pacha's taste is definitely in favor of the fabulous and against romance (but there's plenty of romance in the tales, as beautiful women need rescuing from a variety of misfortunes), and each tale is quite amusing. They're told by a series of miscreants, rogues, liars, impostors, and rascals, and if you think Pirates of the Caribbean was getting hackneyed and worn out, you'll be delighted by the flights of imagination in this book. Anyone of the tales could provide an entire movie in its own right, whether it be the adventures of a sailor who allegedly swam to Africa from Australia, the strangers who live on a floating island and raise whales, or the many cases of true love and romance involving the rescuing of damsels from highway men, monks masquerading as cavaliers, and the occasional beheading.The framing device of the Pacha and his Vizier interviewing potential storytellers is amusing in its own right and allows Marryat to parody readers and authors. For example, the man addicted to saying 'You know' so aggravates the Pacha that he lops the man's head off, by which point we are cheering for him. 'Valleyspeak' may not be noble, but its apparently ancient. The Pacha himself tends to fall asleep during more edifying passages, prompting the Vizier to advise the storyteller to skip over all that. (Come on, admit it, you've done the same. Did you actually read the chapters on cetology in Moby-Dick? No you didn't.)Marryat was writing during the first half of the 19th century, so some of his characters embody outdated stereotypes, but at the same time, he is never mean. His characters, regardless of complexion, have their foibles treated with a good humored even-handedness. Sitting down with a novel by Marryat is always like being treated to a series of tales by a slightly inebriated storyteller, tales so engrossing you keep buying the man drinks.M. Kei, author ofThe Sallee Rovers (Pirates of the Narrow Seas)"},{"Title":"The pacha of many tales","review":"Marryat was a born story teller but he was too much a pupil of Voltaire. Mind you he would have hated to hear that accusation and yes I am quite certain that he never read a line of Voltaire. Do I sound confused? Well, read the book.To write an Arabian Nights tale that IS an Arabian Nights tale you need a certain amount of navite. Marryat does not have it.There are a few - mostly female - American fantasy writers who on a good day can deliver the goods."},{"Title":"The Umbral Calculus (Pure and Applied Mathematics, Vol. 111)","review":"I'd give this about four-and-a-half stars, but the software allows only integers. In the preface, the author, Steven Roman, correctly identifies this book's deficiency quite explicitly: It presents the theory before explaining the motivation. Later, when he gets into application to concrete examples, Roman also seems to view such application as the only source of motivation. The book is primarily about Sheffer sequences. A Sheffer sequence is a certain kind of polynomial sequence. A polynomial sequence is understood to be a sequence indexed by the nonnegative integers, in which the index equals the degree. Many of the well-known special polynomial sequences are Sheffer sequences, among them the Hermite polynomials, the Laguerre polynomials, the Abel polynomials, the Touchard (or &quot;exponential&quot;) polynomials, etc. The concept of Sheffer sequence can be characterized by saying that the linear transformation on polynomials that maps the nth polynomial in the sequence to n times the (n-1)th polynomial, is shift-equivariant. It can also be characterized in a colorful way by the relationship of each Sheffer sequence to a polynomial sequence of binomial type. But neither of those is the definition that Roman gives. His definition is not motivated, until and unless you eventually figure out why it's the right thing by digesting the theory, as you eventually will if you keep at it. The solution to the motivation problem is to read &quot;Finite Operator Calculus&quot; by Rota, Kahaner, and Odlyzko. That paper, published in 1973, appeared in a book of the same title in 1975. That remarkable paper ends with a huge list of research problems, many of which, if I'm not mistaken, have not yet been addressed. Roman's book works through the theory, and its application to many examples, with great thoroughness.&quot;The umbral calculus&quot; is traditionally the name of what is also called &quot;Blissard's symbolic method&quot;, which is a notational device for proving identities involving indexed sequences of numbers by pretending the indices are exponents. The flavor of the technique can be seen by looking at John Riordan's book _Combinatorial_Identities_, which uses it extensively. In what sense that weird notational technique is the same thing as the study of Sheffer sequences, which is the subject of Roman's book, is something the reader should think about."},{"Title":"The Umbral Calculus (Pure and Applied Mathematics, Vol. 111)","review":"Another viewpoint on this subject than the one in the paper of Rota, Kahaner, and Odlyzko is in a paper titled _The_Umbral_Calculus_, by Steven Roman and Gian-Carlo Rota, published in Advances in Mathematics, volume 31, pages 95-188, in 1978. That paper makes the connection between the theory of Sheffer sequences and the &quot;symbolic method&quot; of Blissard much clearer than does the one by R., K., &amp; O., and can also serve as motivation if you need that before tackling this book.I'm writing this second review in order to mention that other source, but, since I earlier said I'd give this four-and-a-half stars, I'm taking this opportunity to raise the average to four-and-a-half by giving it five stars this time."},{"Title":"The Umbral Calculus (Pure and Applied Mathematics, Vol. 111)","review":"Have you come across the umbral calculus? The umbra (Latin: \\"shadow\\") is the darkest part of a shadow. But in mathematics? Perhaps a generating function is the shadow of its distribution? Or the term umbral calculus refers to surprising similarities between otherwise unrelated polynomial equations, and certain shadowy techniques used to prove them.It is used in the study of orthogonal polynomials, in differential equations, in computations generally, and in the study of probability distributions. In fact it is an old (classical!) theory, but it undergoes periodic revivals.An especially notable revival was pioneered by Gian-Carlo Rota in the 1970ties. He put the subject on a firm (rigorous!) foundation; with axioms, operators, diagrams, and duality arrows.Previously it had been more like a bag of tricks involving formal power series and ad hoc computations with generating functions.Motivated by Rota, Steven Roman came out with a different book: offering a wider view, a striking elegance, and including numerous new and intriguing applications. Roman's book was now reprinted in 2005 by Dover in this attractive little volume. Review by Palle Jorgensen, September 2007."},{"Title":"The Umbral Calculus (Pure and Applied Mathematics, Vol. 111)","review":"This book is a reference text on polynomials that are useful in quantum mechanics. Orthogonal polynomials are the backbone of Hilbert spaces and solutions to problems like the wave mechanics of hydrogen.The only problem I have with the book is that he has only 5 categories and leaves out the matrix generated polynomials that are related toto Heisenberg's matrix mechanics which is equivalent to Schr&ouml;dinger's wave mechanics. I wish that I could already say I understood things like Vandermonde's convolution formula,but that is why I bought the bookand why it delivers the goods."},{"Title":"Women Who Love Men Who Kill","review":"It's been a few years since I read this, and some of it blurs a bit with time. As of the reading, my now ex-wife had believed she was in love with a gentleman doing life for the murder of his own wife. I felt a need to gain some understanding for this incredibly bizarre manifestation of her then current needs.Although most of the analyses of the author as to cause did not seem at all applicable in our particular case, some things did stand out. I remember reading of the building excitement and anticipation visitors would feel about an upcoming visit and the feelings they experienced going into the instition and having the doors close behind them. Then comes that exultation of finally seeing their love 'across a crowded room', and having someone's undivided attention for a time was a reward. Inevitably, there was the exquisite pain of parting and being figuratively ripped from the loving grasp of one's partner and leaving them to the mercy of cruel guards and the other, truly guilty inmates.My ex had been diagnosed with bi-polar disorder, and there seemed to be definite parallels to those happenings and needs experienced by those who experience addiction to the exciting highs and debilitating lows in living with that difficulty. For some reason, this insight helped me to realize enough about her needs and motives to recognize that I would never actually fully understand, and it would be futile to attempt to do so. This pretty much freed me get on with my own life, and I thank the author for helping with this insight.If you read this hoping to gain some insights in a particular situation, it may possibly be of help. As I recall, the author did not explore in much detail some of the possible motives and needs of visitors. In my instance, I felt that she could have delved into such things as control issues; elimination of responsibility for others, both financially and emotionally; a quest for adventure/drama in ones' life; and even a few others. She deserves great credit and admiration for tackling a difficult and depressing subject and helping others understand what can go on in such incredibly bizarre circumstances. It isn't hard to extrapolate what loving families must go through as they also must pay for mistakes of incarcerated relatives and friends. While not a comprehensive treatise on a subject that would require volumes, the author's effort provides valuable insights and examples. And as much as we'd like to forget that others still share such circumstances, the fact is that they do. My hope is that the author's efforts still are able to bring readers a valuable measure of information and understanding, and, as in my case, a measure of peace. Personally, I'm very grateful to her. ~EdMac"},{"Title":"Women Who Love Men Who Kill","review":"Well,I am reading this book at the moment and I have to say that there are some strange accounts in here.There are women from all walks of life who fall for men in prison who have murdered and raped and some of the men even boast about it.Still, these women are convinced that their men are innocent (nudge,nudge,wink,wink),and I find myself reading over and over again stories of how these women fall for their 'innocent' partners. This book is interesting purely for the fact that there seem to be so many women falling for these monsters and even leaving their homes and children for these men.I wonder if these women would have so much understanding if it were one of their family that was raped,tortured and killed! Although this book is interesting,I still feel that we are only getting half of the analysis of these women and that the information is coming only from the author.Not enough background work and the author tends to repeat herself quite often."},{"Title":"Women Who Love Men Who Kill","review":"In my job as a social worker I have encountered women like the ones that Isenberg describes in her book. I found her book to be insightful and, although it reads like a page-turner, I find myself referring to it frequently in my work."},{"Title":"Women Who Love Men Who Kill","review":"The author is simplistic, repetitive, and amateurish. This book is already 12 years old. It would be interesting to go back and reinterview the case studies andsee how the women in the chapters are doing now...Certainly needs to be updated.One thing the author says is not true...that women who love men who kill...always believe their men are innocent. WRONG.Sheila, go back and revisit these women and write WWLMWK part two!!!"},{"Title":"Women Who Love Men Who Kill","review":"Women Who Love Men Who Kill is a fantastic read. It sheds enormous light on the lives of women who go to the edge and fall in love with murderers. They don't just fall in love with convicted killers, they support them, provide them with all their needs while in prison and advocate diligently for their release. The author generates profiles of these women and provides analytic insights about their motives. This is forensic science with a behavioral approach written for the lay person by a writer who knows her subject. The book is shocking, exciting and intense. It evokes the reader's concerns about how these things are possible. After reading this book you will know why."},{"Title":"Women Who Love Men Who Kill","review":"Women who love men who kill by Sheila Isenberg is an unscientific, unprofessional attempt by the author to pathologize based on her own biases. It is obvious that her motive is to sensationalize and sell books. I suggest to readers interested in this subject that they read professional literature based on scientific research."},{"Title":"Women Who Love Men Who Kill","review":"I'm glad someone tackled this subject; I read a lot of criminal psych stuff and I've always wondered about this. I can't validate or disprove her conclusions though. They seem intuitively accurate though, how someone might want someone aggressive who can't hurt them. But her prose was really bad; I remember her using the phrase \\"dizzying dance with death\\" more than once, as if it was such a good line, she couldn't help but use it twice. It was very tabloid-ish. But I think this topic needs more serious research."},{"Title":"Women Who Love Men Who Kill","review":"Looks great - newstate. Beside the discolored flap round the book - which can happen, for a book printed nearly 20 years ago - it's perfect."},{"Title":"Women Who Love Men Who Kill","review":"Although the book is interesting to read for what it reveals about middle class (Isenbergs)unacknowledged limitations, her own unexamined frame of reference prevented her understanding much about her subject/s.This is mostly a rehash of tired, condescending, \\"accepted truth\\" about women who are \\"contaminated\\" as far as the rest of society (and Isenberg) is concerned. She twists every story into an \\"example\\" of the rightness of her forgone conclusions about \\"these women.\\" She couldn't really get past herself/her own non objective point of view and I'm not sure she even tried (or even realized she has limitations which are exposed in her writing and devalue the book's conclusions.)As a result the book largely disrespects the women who were willing to reveal their lives honestly to her and adds nothing new except to reinforce society's ingrained prejudice toward them: a \\"cautionary tale\\" of the cruelty meted out to women who don't stay in line? And Isenberg's conclusion? \\"It's their own fault.\\"I'm sorry this book wasn't more orignial, since there is so little available on this subject.The Prisoner's Wife is far better written, more thoughtful and more honest."},{"Title":"Women Who Love Men Who Kill","review":"When I began reading &quot;Women Who Love Men who Kill&quot; I could not put the book down. I remember after reading the book, I was in shock about the way certain women could so easily fall in love with murderers. &quot;Women Who Love Men who Kill&quot; gave an emotinal yet unbiased perspective on the darker side of love. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Women Who Love Men Who Kill","review":"When I purchased this book I had seen a review of the author on Good Morning America. I thought the topic was weird, yet interesting, so I jumped on Amazon and ordered a copy. I have been reading this book now for a week and it's just OK. Literally. The subject matter is very interesting but it very repetitive. Although there are many women who fall in love and marry men who have killed, all their stories are similar. The author also repeats information she has stated over and over. There is a lot of insight on women in this state of mind, but it's not a book I would recommend."},{"Title":"Women Who Love Men Who Kill","review":"A very interesting book explaining the reasons why women THINK they are in love with men who have been convicted of murder/s and are serving life terms."},{"Title":"Women Who Love Men Who Kill","review":"When this book title caught my eye on the book shelve, I purchased it immediatly...when I got home I started reading it , and could not put it down until I had read to the last page. To my surprise there were a couple of wives and their stories, that I have actually met, one of which I had became friends with..and knowing her story, it was not hard to identify her In the book. As a wife of a California Department of Corrections Inmate, I can relate to these stories even though my husband Is not a killer. It is a very informational book for any person that has a family member, loved one or friend that is incarsarated."},{"Title":"Women Who Love Men Who Kill","review":"I think this book is great.Too often people harshly judge these women unfairly.I enjoyed hearing from the women themselves and I admire their devotion and courage in standing up for their love,a love that society looks down on and harshly condemns.That takes guts.Another thing I enjoyed about the book is though it did have sone psychiatric analysis, it wasn't full of psychobabble.I would recommend this book to anybody.Its a good read."},{"Title":"Women Who Love Men Who Kill","review":"People will always try to explain what is foreign to them as being pathologic, evil, or whatever the specific label may be.Prison and what is related with it is a somewhat mysterious and dark theme for most people. To couple this with the theme of love is certain to catch the interest of many potential readers; at the same time, however, it is doomed to become a foggy pool of stereotypes.For those who have more first-hand experience with prisoners (who by the way are usually primarily human beings) and their relationships, the \\"phenomenon\\" of women falling in love with inmates, and yes, also those convicted of murder, is not so mysterious at all. In fact, it is not even a \\"phenomenon\\".In abstraction, human experiences are not so different from each other, and once we bother to actually listen to someone, our initial judgment is usually replaced by understanding. If this \\"phenomenon\\" is to be made the theme of a book, let it be a book by those who are most directly involved in it: the women and the prisoners. And I'm sure the readers who have no previous experience with the theme would come to entirely different conclusions, and even - understanding."},{"Title":"Women Who Love Men Who Kill","review":"This book was nothing but the same old stereotypes: Women who love men in prison are mentally warped in some way through abuse, low self-esteem, blah blah blah. I wasn't impressed. The author's constant use of the title \\"Master of Death\\" to describe a prison who has killed is a bit dramatic. Not all are \\"Masters of Death\\"; the author seems to put everyone in the same category as Ted Bundy or John Wayne Gacy. There are stories behind every crime, as there are human beings in prison. This book was overly-dramatic, judgmental, and reeks of condescendence. Maybe if the author had talked to some of the murderers, some of the family of the murderers, she would have been able to write a better book. Don't waste your time on this one."},{"Title":"The good sisters","review":"Kathleen Fitzgerald provides a warm-hearted, down-to-earth reflection of her first year after profession.

Mrs. Fitzgerald has given us a remarkable book, one that I've never really understood why it hasn't gone farther or been made into a movie. Something you'll want to read again and again!"},{"Title":"Belly Flop","review":"WOW!I LOVED THIS BOOK!Check out Morris Gleitzman's other books:Water Wings,Blabber Mouth,and Misery Guts."},{"Title":"The Little World of Don Camillo","review":"I fell in love with both the priest Don Camillo and his faithful adversary, Peppone the Communist mayor, when I was only ten, and since then have read all of the books, several times. After my experiences of being in the USAF in Taiwan in the 1970s, and now a permanent resident in mainland China's Fujian Province, I can appreciate the kinds of clashes that can occur between Communists and Christians--serious, but at times quite humorous also. I appreciate the zany humor but most of all the down to earth warm portrayels of both Don Camillo and Peppone. The author shows good and bad sides of both, and Don Camillo's conversations with Christ, who speaks to him from the crucifix above the altar, are priceless. After a few stories, one realizes that neither Don Camillo nor Peppone are the good guy or the bad guy, but simple ordinary people--and though enemies, they each sometimes go out of their way to help the other (though secretly, to save face). The cast of supporting characters, like skinny Smilzo, is also a delight.The line drawings of the angel Don Camillo and the devil Peppone are, of course, priceless. Simple and to the point, they are the icing on the Don Camillo cake, and probably the reason why I draw cartoons on everything from greeting cards to my books on China--Amoy Magic, Fujian Adventure, Mystic Quanzhou, deng deng (which is Chinese for \\"etcetera\\"). I highly recommend not only Little World but all of the Don Camillo books in print."},{"Title":"The Little World of Don Camillo","review":"I first read Don Camilo when I was 13. The thing that I have always liked the most about this book is its central lesson: it is possible to fight about ideologies, but when the community is in danger, we must forget the fight and help our neighbors. We'll continue the fuss later. Episode after episode, Don Camilo, the local priest, and Peppone, the communist mayor, confront each other, sometimes in a serious and violent way. But every time, both men negotiate their way out of trouble. That is a related lesson: public enemies / private friends. When you finish the book, indeed, you get a feeling that these two enemies and rivals have developed, over the years and innumerable shared experiences, a friendship that is deeper than most people's relationships. I like very much the parts when, in the midst of a crisis, Peppone and Don Camilo run secret negotiations in the middle of the night. But if you think this is a &quot;rosy&quot; book, full of childish situations, you are wrong. The problems that both characters have to solve are often deep and painful. This is the best kind of educational book, because it does not really have a &quot;moral&quot;. The intelligent reader -and most children are- gets his own conclusions in a funny and humorous way. Those are the lessons likely to stay for life. A lovely book."},{"Title":"The Little World of Don Camillo","review":"Guareschi's books should rank among the classics of Italian literature and ought to be read at school, but they are not. Why? Who knows.... Maybe because the so-called Italian intellectuals think that comic stuff isn't deep enough. Anyway, don Camillo, Peppone and his comrades are the most loved characters in Italian fiction and their stories are real masterpieces. A must read both for the old and the young. You'll love Guareschi!"},{"Title":"The Little World of Don Camillo","review":"I was at a summer fair recently and browsing on the book stall when I found a very old copy of the Little World of Don Camillo dating from 1953. I had no idea what it was at the time as I'd never heard of it but i was intrigued by the blurb. this book is HILARIOUS! I kept laughing out loud and getting very strange looks! but it was worth it! I am now determined to find the rest of the books and read them although I am aware that they may cost me slightly more that my 25p find at the Fete! It's a brilliant book that transports you into another world with ease and lets you meet characters that you can believe in and love. A very well spent 25 pence!"},{"Title":"The Little World of Don Camillo","review":"Having first entered Don Camillo's little world at 10, I have returned innumerable times over the decades, and frequently given directions to friends, too. This little work is a masterpiece. There is more wisdom, faith, hope, and love, to be found in its pages than in many far more &quot;serious&quot; works of fiction. All of that is accomplished in a deceptively simple gem of literary style. Like any great work of fiction, it captivates the heart as well as the mind. It is impossible to spend time in this little world and not come away with a smile on one's face and hope in one's heart. The Little World of Don Camillo is ideal reading for anyone, of any age or condition, anywhere."},{"Title":"The Little World of Don Camillo","review":"I have never read a Don Camillo novel that I didn't like. Comprising short, humourous, often heartwarming, tales about a parish priest in a small Italian village and his battles against the local communist mayor, his conscience, and other local crises. It has a charm, warmth and local flavour that take the reader on a journey through time to a different world. These stories are simply excellent! If you only read one book this year, make it this one."},{"Title":"The Little World of Don Camillo","review":"Being a collection of humorous short stories, this volume has ups and downs - some stories being well-written and funny, others less so. Guareschi's talent is undeniable; he opens this book by writing, &quot;My life began on the 1st of May, 1908, and between one thing and another, it still goes on.&quot; This is written humor at its best.I think partially the fault for disliking a few of the stories lies in the way I've read them - I've read too many too fast; that's like eating too much chocolate. Perhaps a more paced reader will really enjoy this book and be able to give it a 5-star rating."},{"Title":"The Little World of Don Camillo","review":"I stumbled upon &quot;Don Camillo and His Flock&quot; when I was 13.

Not that that makes any real difference, it's still a good read, nice and easy for youngsters and old alike.The print is not perfect on some pages, but does not spoil the book overall, only the odd line slightly smudged.

He wages ceaseless war on the local Leftists, particularly their leader, Mayor Peppone. Although the good father must occasionally resort to a well-aimed kick or a thunderous right cross to maintain strict adherence to proper religious and humanitarian principles, he keeps his congregation unified despite political differences.

As the Unkerlanters (Soviets) advance into Grelz (Ukraine) there is bitter vengeance for all collaborators... Falling back too are Plegmund's Brigade, a sort of Kaminski Brigade of bloodthirsty volunteers from Forthweg, whom I can easily predict razing Eoforwic (Warsaw) to the ground in the next book.Further east (or west) in Algarvian-occupied Forthweg (Poland), bookkeeper Ealstan and his sorcerously disguised Kaunian (Jewish) wife Vanai try to keep a low profile as Vanai's people are in turn persecuted and massacred, but the deception is proving ever harder to maintain. Amid all this, corrupt Algarvian occupation cop Bembo can't seem to stifle the odd flickerings of a conscience every now and then.As the tide of war turns against Algarve, collaborators in Valmiera (France) start to wonder whether they've backed the wrong horse (or behemoth, if you like). I see a shaven head and a tarring and feathering for Krasta in Book 7!Transferred away from the forest front in remote western Unkrlant, a platoon of Gyongyosian infantry have a terrible secret to conceal that could exile them from their own people forever. Funny, I didn't like curried goat either.In a magical world where trains are leyline-powered caravans, fighter-bombers are dragons and cinnabar is the oil that powers them, and where behemoths substitute for tanks and leviathans for U-boats, World War II progresses in the fourth of seven volumes, covering the equivalent of roughly February to November 1943.I'm completely hooked and can't wait for the next one. Thankfully, Harry Turtledove is astonishingly prolific, keeping on the go not only this epic saga but the second of the American Empire trilogy at the moment (and those follow three Great War books and their prequel, and three more still to come!).All proof that Potter's not the only wizard Harry in town."},{"Title":"Rulers of the Darkness (The World at War, Book 4)","review":"Even though less happened with the war in the series than I might have expected, I still considered it a worthwhile read. The stories of each of the characters were interesting and easy to follow. I know that some reviewers here complain about how nothing much happened with the war and how it is dragging on, but I think that is exactly the feeling that Turtledove wished to convey because that's exactly how the series' characters are feeling about the raging conflict about them, as though it is never going to end.It was also interesting to see certain point of view characters interact as they meet for the first time. But I did feel that one of the characters: Cornlu, the leviathan rider, behaved a bit out of character in the end. I am also curious as to how the blossoming romance between the two mages, Pekka and Ferno, will develop.I eagerly await the next installment of this fascinating series."},{"Title":"Rulers of the Darkness (The World at War, Book 4)","review":"The Darkness series is one of those things that shouldn't work but does so anyways. The setting- a fantasy world war II sounds interesting, but it is little more then a backdrop. Harry Turtledove's works are usually based around their plots (as in the Great War series) being interesting Alternate History. Harry has managed to put his viewpoint characters in a world large enough that they can all be interesting, and just a little famaliar enough to us that we can nod knowingly and learn a little about real history. In this installement the war grinds on as Algarve begins to lose in Unkerlant, and Kuusamo and Legaos prepare their magic to invade Eastern Derlevai. The plot is little more then the backdrop for the personal tales of the characters, all of whom are well sketched out this far into the series, and therefore we feel empathy for them. It's much better done the say, The Center Cannot Hold, if less compelling, and provides a good setup for the decisive volume Jaws of Darkness, coming this April."},{"Title":"Rulers of the Darkness (The World at War, Book 4)","review":"Harry Turtledove's fantasy adaptation of World War II reaches a pinnacle with Rulers of the Darkness. As two massive forces collide, fallout from the chaos affects everyone involved.Algarve (Germany) fails at its third attempt against Unkerlant (Russia), and stubbornly refuses to give up what it gained. But its influence is slowly slipping, as they are pushed from the Duchy of Grelz, an allegorical Ukraine. And with the aid of a new secret weapon, the Lagoan/ Kuusamon (British/ American) alliance throws Algarve from the island nation of Sibiu (Denmark.) Meanwhile in Forthweg (Poland), more trouble is brewing for Algarve.Ealstan discovers a secret about his new boss, Istvan is struggling to keep his own. Sidroc discovers he likes soldering, as long as he's winning and there's plenty to rape and pillage. Talsu is released from prison to play a dangerous cloak and dagger game.The characters make the story more interesting than the action. I feel strongly for Vanai and Ealstan, I respect Hajjaj, great pity for Cornelu, and watch with interest in what Pekka and Fearno are up to. I want to watch Krasta to see what stupid thing she'll do next. I am a little bored with Garivald and Skranu though.Was it my imagination, or is Turtledove letting up on his reduntant character descriptions? If so, that's good!The story is still going strong. Looking forward to reading Jaws of Darkness."},{"Title":"Rulers of the Darkness (The World at War, Book 4)","review":"Rulers of the Darkness is the book for you if you like fantasy and/or action books. The setting takes place in Derlavi and its bordering islands. This book contains many character's points of view so it is your opinion whether certain people are evil or certain people are good. There are way too many characters in this book, so I can't really tell you them all. Instead, I will tell you two of my four favorites. Pekka is a Kuusamin mage helping on a project to make a very powerful magic to turn the tides of the war. Fernau is working with Pekka and he likes her a lot but Pekka is married.I think this is an awesome book. Harry Turtledove is my favorite writer and I have only read one of his books! I recommend this book to good readers and people who like fantasy and/or action books."},{"Title":"Rulers of the Darkness (The World at War, Book 4)","review":"This is the fourth volume of Turtledove's Darkness series. This series is a fantastical look at the Second World War, with dragons taking the place of aircraft, leviathans the place of submarines, and so on. I liked this book, it provides a good continuation to the series; Turtledove proves once again that you can't count on him to keep all his characters alive, and action is well-balanced, with a wide variety of viewpoints. The only problems that I saw were basically structural; we already know how the series will end, but undoubtably with a few curveballs thrown in too, and there were a few errors with characters being called by the wrong name, things like that. If you're just beginning this series, I recommend you start with the first book, otherwise you may totally be lost in terms of story. Good book if you have read the previous volumes, the series is getting a little long, though."},{"Title":"Rulers of the Darkness (The World at War, Book 4)","review":"The war on Derlavai continues on into it's fourth year, and the momentum is shifting away from Algarve. Turtledove continues to follow the history of our own world's WWII in this interesting and enthralling series. After their defeat at Sullingen(Stalingrad) in the last book, Algarve(Germany) re-groups, and looks to finish off Unkerlant(Russia) for good. But the Unkerlanters don't look to lie down so easily. Meanwhile, the sorcerous version of the &quot;Manhattan Project&quot; continues to progress in Kuusamo(America), but not without it's own setbacks. At the same time, there are several conquered nations, where the people are trying to survive, and fight back, under the rule of the Algarvians. This does not prove to be an easy task.Again, we follow the action through many different viewpoint-characters from all of the involved nations. Most of them are well developed enough so that you come to expect many of their action and reactions.Turtledove portrays the war in a way that makes it difficult to &quot;root&quot; for any particular side. The portrayal of King Swemmel(Stalin) makes it very easy to want to see Unkerlant destroyed. But at the same time, the atrocities being commited by the Algarvians make them a less than suitable champion.I enjoyed this book, and anxiously await the next installment in the series."},{"Title":"Rulers of the Darkness (The World at War, Book 4)","review":"This is book four of Harry Turtledove's series of having World War Two fought in a fantasy setting. Guns, bombs, planes and tanks are replaced by sticks, eggs, dragons and beheamoths, while events roughly parallel those in our own world. This book begins with the \\"German\\" defeat at \\"Stalingrad\\" and continues through the events of 1942 into 1943.Usually by the fourth book in a series, especially one as long and complex as this one, the author begins to loose some of his momentum that made the first few books so good (i.e. - Robert Jordan), however, Turtledove does a very good job of keeping his narrative thread and throwing in enough twists to keep things exciting. While readers with any knowledge of World War Two will certainly know the outcome of some battles long before Turtledove writes them (and maybe become bored in the process)it is intesting to see who survives and who doesn't. This book also sees the introduction of iceberg aircraft carriers and finally some results with the \\"Manhattan Project.\\"The same problems remain from the first few books. Some characters lack depth and always seem to be doing the same thing every time we read about them (i.e. - Krasta going shopping). The author's sex scenes are overwhelmed with dirty cliches and should have been skipped. The author also does not explain certain things that would have been an integral part of the war - yes, there are guns, but what about machine guns? or what about the strategic bombing campaigns launched by the \\"allies\\", are they using different types of dragons for that? In my mind, these kinds of inconsistances would have only served to make the book better. The devil is in the details, as they say.Since this is the fourth book in the series, do not read this one before you read the first three - you will be lost. But if you read the first three and enjoyed them, you will not be disappointed by this book."},{"Title":"Rulers of the Darkness (The World at War, Book 4)","review":"This is the fourth book in Harry Turtledove's _Darkness_ series, a fantasy retelling of WWII where there is no technology but plenty of magic. Instead of airplanes, pilots ride dragons, they drop magic exploding eggs instead of bombs, and people ride ley-line caravans rather than trains (ley-lines are magical meridians that trained magicians can tap for many purposes, and the confluence of two lines creates power points). Even the level of magic differs depending on which country Turtledove is writing about, corresponding with our world's distribution of engineering and manufacturing. And then he describes, in passing, each country's dietary, musical, and physical traits, while showing that people are people the world over.The same characters viewpoint characters from books 1-3 are back (except for those who managed to die), each being pulled in yet more directions as the Derlavaian War affects just about everyone. While the first book was pretty much all soldiering, all the time, this one has pulled back from a lot (not all) of the fighting to show how civilians are affected too. And some of the civilians have become fighters as well, just as the real WWII turned so many lives in new directions.If you have not read Books 1-3 in the series, I'd suggest you do so before tackling this one. Not only would the plot development make more sense, but so would each character's history. It's very difficult to have an emotional stake in each character's adventures without their backstories, and each of them has a lot going on. Sidroc, a soldier in King Plegmund's Brigade, joined the army to fight on behalf of occupying Algarve, and he did so to escape being charged with murder of his cousin Leifsig. This book continues with both Sidroc and his cousin Ealstan's stories (yes, Ealstan was Leifsig's brother), but if you aren't aware of their relationship and how it soured over years, their slightly intertwined stories won't have the same effect.One interesting plot development in this book is how Turtledove continues the fanstasy worldview that killing people releases magical energy, and how he retells WWII while using each country's history in our world with this additional fillip. In this installment, Gyongyos (Japan) makes plans to use life energy, but not as Algarve does (murdering Kaunians, as the Germans killed Jews in death camps) or Algarve's enemy Unkerlant (killing their own peasants to fight back, as Stalin's Russia killed so many countrymen).The war grinds on, and there are many signs in this book of things falling apart. Bembo, an Algarvian constable, wins a rare vacation from his duties in occupied Forthweg (Poland) and finds home isn't the same as when he left. The resistance movement in Valmiera (France) continues with a lot of hit or miss, with some of its supporters changing sides when convenient. And the tide turns in the Big War, as Unkerlant now has Algarve on the run after the latter loses yet another big battle in the southwest (think northeast, the entire planet is flipped upside down with Derlevai in the southern hemisphere with Unkerlant in the west.Meanwhile, the equivalent of the Manhattan Project continues, but the Kuusamans (USA) still haven't officially entered the war, and their relationship with the Lagoans (British) isn't one of 100% trust yet.What I love about Turtledove's books is how he can spin out a story with so many characters, get me to care about what happens, and get me thinking about how the real history went down while I read this world's version. I wanted to know more about European history and politics in 1942 so I could more appreciate this book."},{"Title":"Rulers of the Darkness (The World at War, Book 4)","review":"The fourth volume of Turtledove's six-part parallel history of the second world war in a world where technology uses magic instead of engineering.Most of the books of the series covers about a year of the war's history: in terms of equivalent time this one is the shortest, corresponding roughly to late Spring, Summer and Autumn 1943. It starts immediately after the Algarvian surrender at Sulingen (e.g. the German sixth army's surrender at Stalingrad) and the main thrust of the book describes the attack on the Durrwangen (Kursk) salient.This series of novels all have \\"Darkness\\" in the title but they are sometimes referred to as the \\"Derlavi\\" series, that being the name given in the stories to the huge continent which is historically equivalent to Eurasia. I have also seen it described as the \\"World at War\\" series.The full series is:Into the DarknessDarkness DescendingThrough the DarknessRulers of the DarknessJaws of DarknessOut of the DarknessMost alternative history books are \\"what if\\" stories which begin with a situation exactly as in our real history, change one detail, and depict how things might have gone on from there. Turtledove's \\"Darkness\\" series, and a similar series he wrote about the American Civil war, beginning with \\"Sentry Peak\\" are quite different.These novels describe how real events in our own world might have seemed to the people taking part in them. However, by mixing up details like North and South, skin colour, hair colour, etc, the author makes it easier for the reader to put aside the strong opinions which everyone holds about events like World War II. This helps you to identify with all the characters sufficiently, not to approve of what they did, but enough to begin to understand why they might have acted that way. As one person says in the following book, nobody is a villain in his own story.Sometimes the parallels between the fantasy world of these book are impishly amusing, for instance that the role taken in our world by Finland is played by an hot equatorial country whose inhabitants are more like Zulus than Finns. The North African desert becomes the \\"Land of the Ice People\\". Sometimes the irony is a lot more biting - for instance the \\"Kaunians\\" corresponding to the Jews are tall, fair skinned, and blonde.Both the strategic outline of the war and many local details of the books have been inspired by actual events. There are no major surprises in the main historical sequence of the story, although in a few places it has been simplified, and one or two of the countries and events in the story do not have a single precise analogue.\\"Sibiu\\", for instance, is an island nation in roughly the equivalent geographic location to Britain. However, in terms of the events of the war the country in these stories whose history corresponds most closely to Britain is not Sibiu but \\"Lagoas\\". For the first three books, the history of Sibiu, which was conquered by the Algarvians early in the war, matched most closely what happened in the real world to Holland and Norway. Comments in this book about wars between Lagoas and Sibiu two or three hundred years earlier match the Anglo Dutch wars of the 17th and 18th centuries so precisely as to suggest that Sibiu is Holland.However, from this book onward Sibiu has no precise real world analogue, though the events which happen to characters from Sibiu bear some similarity to real events in many parts of occupied europe as the Nazis were driven back.The main exitement in the books come from the uncertainty about what will happen to the large cast of \\"viewpoint characters,\\" the vast majority of whom are fictional, but who seem real enough to make you care about what happens to them and thereby make the books compulsive reading.Turtledove is firm enough to allow the occasional sympathetic character to get killed so that the reader cannot take anything for granted. For example, one of the principal heroes of the series up to now who had survived great dangers is killed in tragically ironic circumstances in this book.These novels may also inspire the reader to pick up a work of real history and find out which of these stories are based on fact. If you read Anthony Beevor's \\"Stalingrad\\" and \\"Berlin\\" or Simon Jenkins' \\"Armageddon\\" after reading the \\"Darkness\\" series you will find that many of them are, to such an extent that Turtledove is really writing a novelised parallel history rather than out-and-out fiction.Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"Rulers of the Darkness (The World at War, Book 4)","review":"Rulers of Darkness (2002) is the fourth novel in the World At War fantasy series, following Through the Darkness. In the previous volume, the Unkerlant trap the Argarvians within Suligen and cut off an escaping column. Major Spinello is flown out of Suligen with a chest wound. Outside Suligen, Leudast saves a man in the penal battalion and shares food with him. Within Suligen, a behemoth drops an egg on Transone.In Kuusamo, Pekka, Ilmarinen, Siuntio, and Fernao blow a great hole in the ground with the new sorcery and produce a clump of green grass amidst the snow. In far western Unkerlant, Istvan and his men scavenge felt boots off Unkerlanter corpses. In Zuwayza, Hajjaj learns about the new magic development from the Algarvian ambassador. In Forthweg, Vanai goes to the public bathhouse and finds Algarvians enjoying the public nudity. In Lagoas, Cornelu gets a new uniform coat, but finds Balio's cafe burnt to the ground.In this novel, Leudast's unit leaves retaken Suligen and heads north to the next hot spot. There, near Durrwangen, Sidroc and the Plegmund's Brigade are trying to hold back the Unkerlanter assault and are rescued by counterattacking Algarvians. In Trapani, Major Spinello is released from the hospital and assigned a regiment in Eoforwic. In Unkerlant, Marshall Rathar, despite his words of caution, is ordered to attack and keep attacking.In Valmiera, Skarnu has escaped to Ventspils but the red heads are close on his trail. In Kuusamo, Pekka and Fernao speculate that they are producing energy by twisting time with the new sorcery. In Jelgava, Talsu is interrogated by local constables who want names, but don't care whose they are. In Forthweg, many walls are beginning to bear the word \\"Suligen\\". Elsewhere in Forthweg, Bembo and his partner arrest Vanai's grandfather. In Grelz, Sadoc tries to hide footprints in the snow and makes them luminescent instead. In Valmiera, Krasta is beginning to think about the Algarvians loosing the war and not liking her thoughts.This series is an allegory of the World Wars. However, many of the details are deliberately scrambled. For example, the names for these nation states seem to have been taken from cities in various parts of the world: Kaunas, Valmiera and Jelgava are Latvian cities, Siaulia is Lithuanian, Algarve is Portuguese, Bari is Italian, Yanina is Greek, Gyongyos is Hungarian, Kuusamo is Finnish, Sibiu is Romanian, and Zuwayza is Jordanian. Lagoas means lakes in Portuguese and there are several towns and cities in Brazil and elsewhere that include Lagoas in their name.The geography in this series includes only a small number of nation states as compared to the real world. Everybody agrees that these states represent one or more of the real world countries as constituted after WWI: Algarve represents Germany, Unkerlant is the core states of the Soviet Union, Gyongyos is Japan, Zuwayza is Finland, Forthweg is Poland, Lagoas is England, Yanina is Italy, Kuusamo is the USA, Ortah is Switzerland, and the Land of the Ice People is North Africa. Less certainly, the Duchy of Bari is Austria (and probably the Sudeten and Czechoslovakia), the Duchy of Grelz is the Ukraine (including Galicia), and Obuda Island is the Philippines. Jelgava and Valmiera would seem to be France and Greece, but not necessarily in that order. Others have asserted that Sibiu is Norway, although the Low Lands -- Belgium and Holland -- seem to be a better fit. Siaulia is a complete mystery to me.Regardless of the correctness of these associations, several important countries are missing. These seems to be no equivalent of Spain and its Civil War, which was a significant training and testing ground for the Nazis. Moreover, the Balkans and the successor states to the Ottoman Empire are never mentioned and China and other Asian mainland countries are conspicuous by their absence. Once again, the background has been simplified to remove distractions.Recommended for Turtledove fans and anyone else who enjoys speculative fiction with a strong historical and moral component.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"Rulers of the Darkness (The World at War, Book 4)","review":"The 576-page \\"Rulers of the Darkness\\" should have wound up Harry Turtledove's World-War-II-as-fantasy epic and brought us through to the end of the war. If nothing else, it should have at least brought us to the Algarvian (the German-equivalent country's) surrender. It certainly had the length to do so. As it is, though, it takes us only through the first nine months of the equivalent of 1943.\\"Rulers of the Darkness\\" covers the retreat from Sulingen (Stalingrad) through the battle of Durrwangen (Kursk) to the retaking of Grelz (the Ukraine) by the Unkerlanters (Soviets). In all, this covers about nine months of time and the first 55-60% of the book is just the preparations for the Kursk-equivalent battle - about three months in all. Turtledove also works in, as before, the magical equivalent of the Manhattan Project and the Kaunian (Jewish) and Valmieran (French) resistance movements.However, as before, virtually all other aspects of the war are ignored or are missing completely from his book. The equivalents of Finland, Belgium, Britain, Japan and the Netherlands are all given minor attention while the Italy-equivalent has been all but forgotten and anything representing China or Southeast Asia is completely absent. The Pacific Conflict between Gyongyos (Japan) and Kuusamo (America) is given more attention towards the end of the book and something looking a lot like the Omaha beach invasion of France takes place in Sibiu (The Netherlands), but much of World War II is still largely ignored.As always, I appreciate Turtledove's efforts to distance the immediate emotional reaction felt from words like \\"Nazi\\", \\"Soviet\\", \\"concentration camp\\" and \\"atomic bomb\\" from the lives of people trying to survive an alternate World War II and to show shades of gray where we tend to see only black and white in school texts. Nonetheless, he does this forgetting much of what made World War II a 'world war' - virtually the entire Pacific War. The plights of the Chinese, Koreans, and Southeast Asians were every bit as terrible as the plights of those who struggled under Nazi Germany - or Soviet Russia. To ignore them, I think, does a disservice to his work.That said, though, \\"Rulers of the Darkness\\" remains good, compelling fiction - especially in its second half. If you've followed the series so far, I recommend continuing with this book. If not, go back to the first - \\"Into the Darkness\\". Turtledove's \\"Darkness\\" series has gotten to the point where it's compelling enough as it's own tale and not just as a rehash of World War II. Nonetheless, I wish he would finish it rather than continuing the story for at least another two books. He only enriches the publishers by stalling out the series."},{"Title":"Rulers of the Darkness (The World at War, Book 4)","review":"Everything I was expecting and more! This is one book that needs to be read! Master piece til the end."},{"Title":"Rulers of the Darkness (The World at War, Book 4)","review":"The World at War series continues to plod along here, with more of the same as we got from the previous couple of books. Familiar characters dealing with familiar situations take up the entirety of this fourth book in the overly-long series, as Turtledove fails to introduce anything very new to the lagging story. While the overall plot does progress here, it is very slow and nearly every character seems caught up in some sort of Groundhog Day-like repetitive cycle to the point where you feel like you've read it all before. All that being said, if you've enjoyed the first three books, you'll want to press through this one if for no other reason than to learn the fate of these well-developed (by now) characters.One good thing is that Turtledove has cut back on his overly-repetitive descriptions of characters, places, and customs. While there is still plenty of frustrating writing quality issues like bad puns, not-quite-clever witticisms, heavy-handed plays on words, and just-plain-stupid metaphors, you at least get a break from the maddening reminders of how camel meat tastes bad or roofs leak in Zuwayzi. So, you might still cringe when you read that \\"His voice was powerful and smooth, like strong tea with milk.\\", but you do get a break from being reminded that Gyongosians don't eat goat every 50 pages.Overall, an improvement in the writing quality, but a loss of excitement in the majority of the story content."},{"Title":"Rulers of the Darkness (The World at War, Book 4)","review":"The Derlavian War that has devastated the world is now over three years old with no end in sight. Led by the magic derived from slaughtering the Kuusamians, the Algarvian Empire continues the fight with the Kingdom of Unkerlant in spite of the recent loss at Sullingen.In Kuusamo mages work on developing a new magical \\"genie\\" that will stop the Algarve aggression. However, though distant, even here Algarvian magic attacks try to disrupt the mage project that the Kuusamo is turning to successfully end the war as the victors.In the conquered lands, small resistance movements to overthrow the yoke of the Algarvian Empire have sprung up. However, gains are so minuscule that even the resistance fighters feel they are just gnats attacking dragons.Harry Turtledove's latest magical portrayal of World War II is an interesting alternate history tale. The author shows that war is gritty and the two prime heavyweights (the Algarvian Empire and the Kingdom of Unkerlant) both are nasty and use people as fodder. Mr. Turtledove also shows numerous perspectives of war so that it is difficult to understand any viewpoint. In spite of six hundred plus pages, the magical history of World War II seems more like the trench warfare at Verdun during World War I as the story moves forward less than a year and there remains two more years of fighting. Like the three previous Darkness novels, RULERS OF DARKNESS is a rich complex tale that adheres to the core message that regardless of the weapons (magical or mundane) war makes hell look like a tropical spa.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Elton the Elf (Canadian Edition)","review":"My first grade class at St. Theresa School really enjoyed this story.

Editor Mitzi Szereto has pulled together an eclectic mix of stories inspired by the not-so-true lives of some of history's sexiest symbols.While not everyone will be inclined to read erotica, for those who are willing there's something for every taste in this anthology. Stories run the gamut from humour (\\"Elvis, Axl, and Me\\") to graphic (\\"The Ballad of Scott and Zelda\\").Writing styles--and talents--also vary, but that tends to be true of most multi-author anthologies. Overall, however, I found several literary quality stories within these pages. \\"Eva Braun's Last Tragic Abortion\\" stands out as one of the most compelling pieces.Szereto understands that there's more to erotica than sex.

This book is a compilation of short stories. They are not about the actual sex lives of the famous. They are fictional versions of how those, such as: Lincoln (who fears that the Whitehouse guards will see them, which is something that Mary Lincoln greatly enjoys), Freud, God, etc., might have enjoyed sex, or, if you will, graphic sex or as the publishers call it-erotica.The stories are very well written, inventive and better than most in this genre. To me, it's all about sex acts or what should be called pornography, which is defined by its prurient appeal. If it doesn't appeal to such interests, it fails. I am an old fart, so my bias about this book should be taken in that light.The problem with this book, I suggest, is that all the stories are based on one theme-the famous having sex. Short story mystery anthologies are similar in this respect but the differing plot lines make each story different. The prurience (if that's a word) gets old pretty fast.There are only so many ways that sex acts can be performed or described-Karma Sutra and all that. So, it gets boring and by the middle of the book the prurience disappears and it becomes just a lot of wrestling and contorting.I applaud the editor for getting a bunch of good writers together to write the stories. And I appreciate the inventive idea. Those alone make it worth a read."},{"Title":"Wicked: Sexy Tales of Legendary Lovers","review":"Wicked: Sexy Tales of Legendary Lovers is an engaging and entertaining mix of sexy stories that offers so much more than the typical erotica collections you tend to see around. This is the first anthology of its kind and the content is wholly original, with standard of writing well above excellent. Editor Mitzi Szereto has pulled together a skilled group of writers from around the globe and they have taken to the task like gangbusters, speculating on the lives of the famous and infamous, giving readers a generous glimpse into the bedrooms of those we're often wondered about, and even those we have not, with a cast ranging from Elvis to Marilyn to Valentino, and, if you can believe it, Eva Braun and Adolph Hitler!

This exceptional book is more than a reference tome of dry, dusty treaties and treatises. Milton Viorst has used these documents to launch a nimble (less than 370 pages and easily read in excerpts) world history filling and fleshing out much of the US-centric history learned in those same dry textbooks.Viorst's well chosen excerpts (from personal writings and speeches as well as sealed docuemnts) and his taut, even witty introductions serve as puzzle pieces to assemble man's slow struggle to free himself and his surroundings from repression and tyranny (Magna Carta, Mayflower Compact, Declaration of Independence). He then uses them to build cases for the worldwide political and cultural changes which followed (revolutionaries from Simon Bolivar to Garibaldi, the fall of dynasties from France's Bourbon monarchy to the Russian czars.)Viorst also uses \\"Great Documents\\" to chart struggles and the changing role of power within the Catholic Church. He charts from its early temporal strength (Pope Siricius' decretal) to Martin Luther's Reformation and its bloody aftermath, to its role in the French and German monarchies to, finally, its moral assertions in Pope Leo XIII's \\"Reram Novarum\\" encyclical, which defined its new (and, to Viorst, most praiseworthy) role to this day.Although \\"Great Documents\\" could use an update, it's fitting that it ends with the high-ideals expressed in the United Nations charter (in itself a continuation of themes first expressed in Woodrow Wilson's proposal for the League of Nations). That document seemed then to provide some closure and hope after the unspeakable horrors of the 20th century's first half (Viorst calls Hitler's announcement of Germany's invasion of Russia \\"a moment of salvation for the world.\\") It also pre-dated a time when nearly all defining world moments would be listened to, watched, and clicked on before they would be written, read, or signed.Nonetheless, \\"Great Documents in Western Civilization\\"(which also features an exhaustive list of future reading) is must-read for anyone wanting to more deeply understand evolving political and social systems with the high ideals and failed attempts which followed. Essential for history buffs."},{"Title":"The great documents of Western civilization","review":"\\"I would like to thank the countless scholars who, by preceding me in recording the history of Western civilization, made this work possible.\\" (p. ix). -Milton ViorstThe author has assembled 103 documents that trace the history of western civilization from its roots in the ancient Hammurabi code to the 1945 United Nations Charter.

While I could calculate how my Mercury can be quincunx to my Saturn, it would have helped if I could see a picture of such planetary positions. In addition, I found the book to be helpful in a general sort of way, but it did not offer much practical advice.

Despite the above criticism, I liked the book for its detailed explanation of each planet and each of its position towards other planets in simple, friendly language."},{"Title":"Astrology: Woman to Woman","review":"A lot of astrology books favor predictions and statements that hint of determinism.

Dair, a stage actress, quickly finds herself in the middle of the suspicious death of her best friend who is an actor that she often plays opposite of. The police have dismissed the death as a drug related suicide but Dair doesn't believe it was a suicide. Dair has her suspicions about who the murderer is but is she right? As she copes with her best friend's death she must also deal with her own problems. She is battling to convince herself that she doesn't have a drinking problem. Dair constantly lies and she is afraid one of her biggest lies will hurt the person she is closest too-her husband. Her husband, Peyton, has his own secrets and lies, as do most of the characters in this book.Kittle uses the backstage atmosphere and the life of the performers off stage as the backdrop for this novel full of twists that will keep readers guessing. The cast of characters include actors, dancers, directors and even the stagehands. Dair's mother, someone that can talk to animals, plays a large role and her unique ability to communicate with animals makes her another of the unforgettable characters in the novel. There were a number of characters to keep straight in this novel, but the uniqueness of each of them coupled with their genuineness made it easy. I will definitely be on the lookout for more by Katrina Kittle."},{"Title":"Two Truths and a Lie","review":"Wow! What a unique book. I couldn't put it down. Murder, mystery, addiction, reincarnation, acting and animal communication are just some of the many elements involved in this intricate and fascinating story. In simplest terms, it can be described as a mystery, but it's also so much more. Set in Cincinnati, Ohio, the book explores our relationships with and how we communicate with other people as well as with animals. In fact, animals play a huge role in helping to solve the primary mystery of the story: the murder of one of the best friends of the protagonist, Dair Canard. If Dair could just overcome her addiction to alcohol, all the answers would be clear for her to see. And then there's her addiction to lying, which is getting her into deeper and deeper trouble. As Dair fights to overcome her addictions, she reconnects with her family and with an ability she had long buried. And she finds out that one of her biggest lies actually contained a truth that even she was unaware of. Also, I must mention that this book contains one of the most memorable fictional characters I've ever encountered: Captain Hook, an African Grey parrot who provides one of the keys to solving the mystery and who helps to bring a small community of neighbors closer together."},{"Title":"Two Truths and a Lie","review":"Dair Canard is a master at lying. She has embellished on so many stories that she cannot tell fact from fiction anymore. She realizes her problem when her lying begins to affect her relationship with her husband Peyton.Addiction and lies are at the centre of this novel. Dair has a drinking problem, something else which she cannot admit to herself. Peyton has his own addiction which he struggles with every day.In the midst of these problems, there is a murder mystery unraveling. The death of Dair and Peyton's close friend, Craig. Kittle throws some twists and turns into this plot and we are able to see the wonderful character development along the way.The whole premise of this story is to communicate, with each other and with all creatures, respect for one another is of utmost importance. Dair has to learn to be honest with those around her and herself.I loved Katrina Kittle's first novel, Traveling Light. It was an amazing story told with heartfelt honesty. This follow up, while different than her first novel, is equally as good. The writing grabs you and doesn't let go. I can't wait for her next creation."},{"Title":"Two Truths and a Lie","review":"From the first page, Two Truths and A Lie grabbed me and wouldn't let go. It's one of those rare, delicious books that sweeps you up and keeps you up past your bedtime as you travel deeper and deeper into the labyrinth of deception and intrigue that author Katrina Kittle has so masterfully crafted. I loved that this book is even more than a top-notch page-turner of a mystery. It's also a complex psychological portrait of Dair Canard, a compulsive liar who finds herself tangled up in her own untruths. I relished the rich layers that addiction, animal communication, sexual identity and the ambiguity of relationship add to this story. Most compelling is Dair's dawning realization that, more than anyone else, she has deceived herself. Before the truth can set her free, she has to go about the tough business of dis-covering the lies she's lived, peeling away layers of self-deception and denial to find herself. All this and a dynamite murder mystery, too! Like Kittle's first novel, Traveling Light, you quickly realize you are in the hands of a master with the most fascinating kinds of stories to tell&#65533;fiction that rings true. I can't wait to see where Kittle's next book takes us! Two Truths leaves me hungry for more."},{"Title":"Two Truths and a Lie","review":"\\"Dair was a habitual liar. Not pathological or anything, just...recreational.\\" Thus begins this story about lies, deception, and what happens when the truth is sometimes less believable than the lies we tell. Let's face it we've all been guilty of telling \\"little white lies\\". Stories we enhance, niceties we introduce to spare someone's feelings, the occasional all out fib. Whether we like it or not, lying is part of human nature.And it is with this introspective into someone who has spent her entire life telling little (and sometimes not so little) lies that begins our story. We meet Dair, on the way to pick up her husband Peyton from the airport, plotting the lie she'll tell him to explain why she is late. It is the accident, or apparent suicide she witnesses on the way, which truly does make her late, and turns out to be stranger than any fiction she could have concocted.From here a web of lies, not only Dair's, but also everyone else's, begins to spin out of control. We meet Peyton, her husband, who has his own demons to contend with, we learn more about the reasons behind Dair's \\"habit\\" of stretching the truth. We meet Dair's mother, with her unusual talent of communicating with animals. We learn the identity of the alleged \\"suicide\\" victim, and his relation to all the players in this book. And we open up a whole lot of questions in the process.I really enjoyed this book. I wasn't sure what to expect from it, not even having a clue what the story was about (it was sent to me by a friend), and so was glad to discover that it was full of twists and turns and surprises. The characters were very real, and easy to identify with. The author creates a world not unlike the world her reader's live in, and therefore, these characters could be our neighbors, our friends, our co-workers. Their secrets and their lies, possibly making them people we don't truly know. The relationships between the characters were realistic, deep, captivating, and I could identify with Dair, I felt for Peyton, I adored the cranky upstairs neighbor, Mr. Lively. But it was the \\"secondary characters\\" in this story, the animals, which really tied it all together for me. Katrina Kittle did a wonderful job of making the pets as much a \\"cast of characters\\" in this novel as the humans. Shoddan and Blizzard, Peyton and Dair's dogs, with their huge personalities, Captain Hook, Mr. Lively's parrot, with his extended vocabulary, Dair's Chickadee, they were vital to this story, and added a nice twist to the mystery and the drama.For me, this book had it all, great character development, wonderful storytelling, mystery, humor, a bit of sadness, fantasy and realism. A+"},{"Title":"Two Truths and a Lie","review":"Kittle's previous work, Traveling Light, was beautiful because, while the bare plot is sad, the story feels hopeful. In Two Truths and a Lie, her skill with mood shows through again, but is now complemented by innumerable convolutions of plot. Two Truths is fascinating and wonderfully complicated. Her work reminds me of Ann Tyler's because the characters are the best part of each novel. They're beautifully developed, and seem to drive the story rather than the other way around."},{"Title":"Two Truths and a Lie","review":"I read Ms. Kittle's first book and thought that she could not be topped. But, in her second book, Ms. Kittle has almost done just thought. In her suspensful novel, each page turn brings a change of emotion and reality flies off the page. Readers will begin to think that the characters are real, their probloems real, and the story actually happened. Ms. Kittle's novel has left me speechless and in awe of her writing. The novel is a must read for any reader and an excellent follow-up to TRAVELING LIGHT, the first masterpiece by Ms. Kittle."},{"Title":"Two Truths and a Lie","review":"Two Truths and a Lie is a poignant exploration into the art of communication, an eloquent insight into the fact that, like dance, theatre, or aikido, communication is a discipline, which, without proper attention and practice, will become rusty and ineffective. That we can learn this lesson from the subtle communication of animals lends a breath of originality to Ms. Kittle's work, which ostensibly constitutes an intriguing murder mystery. Yet this work is so much more than the typical suspense novel. Every bizarre twist, far from leading to incredulity in the reader, rather contributes deftly to the above-mentioned lesson of the work. That the characters deal convincingly with real-life problems takes a page from Ms. Kittle's first novel, \\"Traveling Light.\\" Indeed, the author's work runs deep with themes that would be far easier to ignore, and she should be applauded for having the courage to portray them so candidly. Also reminiscent of \\"Traveling Light\\" are the masterfully delicate relationships between characters that Ms. Kittle handles with great poise, teaching us that no relationship is self-sufficient.Ms. Kittle's anticipated second novel does nothing to let down. Having created new possibilities for the suspense novel genre, it is exciting to see what she will do next, and furthermore, throughout her promising career."},{"Title":"Two Truths and a Lie","review":"Dair Canard has problems, big ones. A compulsive liar with a drinking problem, she has a husband that seems to have something to hide, parents who have separated, and a close friend whose recent and suspicious death was bizarre to say the least. Dair's life is definately spiraling out of control, and her lifetime of lying is starting to take it's toll.This is a well written page turner with just enough twists to keep the reader guessing. My only criticism would be that I found the &quot;animal telepathy&quot; angle a little difficult to swallow. Even an animal lover such as myself grew tired of the endless references to the character's pets. That said, this is still a enjoyable, albeit unusual mystery novel worth reading."},{"Title":"Two Truths and a Lie","review":"Two Truths and a Lie is an enthralling mystery rich with fascinating characters, enveloped in acute attention to the complexities of the human spirit. Each taken separately; the riveting murder mystery, the human connection to characters so true and exposed, and the keen awareness for human nature, might arguably stand alone to comprise a fascinating novel in their own right. Together, they create a tour de force that takes the reader on a journey of entertainment, enlightenment and reflection.The bizarre incident that quickly culminates to a beloved friends' death, grips you from the first few pages. What keeps the grip tight throughout this book, is Ms. Kittles' powerful attention to each character; their dimension and complexities. Every character is embellished with a fascinating insight of the human psyche on many levels. Such revelations bring a truth to each character that keeps the reader caring, guessing, and reading.Fans of the murder mystery genre will not be disappointed by this whodunit. Two Truths and a Lie is exceptional in this genre as the plot continually thickens through meticulous character portrayal and the discerning disclosures surrounding them, rather than manipulative clues. A serendipitous bonus to this mystery can be found in the revealing and compassionate observations regarding addiction, the human need for communication, the intricacies of intimacy, and the respect for all creatures great and small; all of which enhance rather than detract from the plot of this masterful work of fiction.Truth be told; P.D. James used to be my favorite author of the mystery genre. That opinion changed after reading the first chapter of \\"Two Truths and a Lie.\\""},{"Title":"Two Truths and a Lie","review":"In Cincinnati, Ohio, drama teacher Dair Canard's philosophy of life is simple. A well-designed exciting lie is more fun to tell than the boring truth. That technique combined with adding kernels of truth within the fabrication has enabled her since childhood to refine her fabricating methodology to the point where she sometimes cannot find the line separating truth from falsehoods. Still Dair and her husband Peyton take immense pleasure in her story telling abilities. However, keeping track of the mountains of lies that serve as the foundation of he marriage is beginning to take its toll on a weary Dair as she has reached a point of no return where the fibs seem to run her life.Things further unravel for Dair, already struggling with alcohol, when a close friend Craig MacPherson jumps off an overpass into traffic. Craig's death has a deep impact on Dair almost as much as the years of lies piled on lies. Now she seeks solace while trying to understand her friend's suicide even as Dair will soon learn the one underlying truth about life is that everyone, including Peyton has secrets, hidden behind lies and half-truths.TWO TRUTHS AND A LIE is a strange tale that is more of a relationship drama with a side mystery. The intelligent story line is deep as it peels away the human mask to reveal that lies are part of the ego. The characters including several animals, seem genuine and turn Katrina Kittle's novel into must reading for those who enjoy a powerful look at the underside of the human psyche.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Two Truths and a Lie","review":"I simply adored every detail of _Two Truths and a Lie_. How rare for a popular-fiction mystery novel to have true character development *and* a plot! I'm one of those who always figures out the who-done-it way too early and finds little reason to finish the book (except to skim the important bits to see that I'm right). This time, I didn't want to miss a word all the way to the end. Dair, Peyton, and their friends, family and animals were real down to the last detail. Anyone who has ever struggled with an addiction (or loved someone who has) must read this book. Also a must for understanding compulsive lying."},{"Title":"Two Truths and a Lie","review":"I've never read another book which combines two subjects so well. Another author might have written a murder mystery without the caracter depth of this novel, or a relationship oriented story without the suspense that grabs the reader. This novel is definately on my top 10 favorite list. Of course this may just be the absinthe talking, but I can't wait for Kittle's next masterpiece."},{"Title":"Two Truths and a Lie","review":"Two Truths and a Lie has you hooked in the first couple of pages with some amazing insight into Dair...a woman for whom lying has become something of a habit, if not a compulsion. She witnesses a horrific incident which ends up having an effect on her, her husband and their entire circle of friends and family. Secrets and lies abound and leave you hungry to find out more about everyone this tragedy affects."},{"Title":"Two Truths and a Lie","review":"In Two Truths and a Lie, we follow the story of Dair, a truth-challenged actress, and her dancer husband, Peyton. The story events are propelled by the bizarre suicide (?) death of a close male friend, who happened to be wearing a familiar purple dress when he went careening over the overpass. But the real heart of the story centers around such deep issues as the danger of denial, and the damage done by lies, particularly when they are to ourselves. As we watch Dair and Peyton's relationship mature, we are faced with the realities of the sometimes arbitrary forces that bind us together. I don't want to give too much away, but the reader should know that the author takes us on some wild plot twists, but not too worry. Ms. Kittle skillfully brings in all back to an almost-too-real reality in the end. I read this book in one day! I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Two Truths and a Lie","review":"I loved reading this book! I could not put it down! The mystery itself was a page-turner, but the character development is what made this book so rich with depth. Dair, an alcoholic who has lied to her husband since she first met him, goes through enough pain to finally agree to rehab. The relationship between a child's addiction and her parent's is a compelling part of the story in itself. Dair's mother's ability to communicate with animals was another aspect of the book which was profoundly thought-provoking. Ms. Kittle's novel was a powerful look at the dark side. One I am glad I didn't miss."},{"Title":"Two Truths and a Lie","review":"Two Truths and a Lie, Katrina Kittle's second novel, is witty, charming, and utterly suspenseful. It is a perfect blend of character development and page turning thrills. Dair Canard has come to the point in her life, where her many lies are finally catching up to her. The tangled web she has woven has begun to come undone, and at the center of everything, she has to face the fact that her marriage is at risk, serious risk. The lie, her biggest, has spiralled out of control, and as she faces the death of one of her closest friends, among other blows, she must finally begin to be honest, with not only her friends and family, but maybe hardest of all, with herself. As the mystery behind her beloved friend's last hours unravels, Dair learns a lot about herself, as she comes close to losing the man she loves most in the world, her husband.Excellent story telling Katrina, I couldn't put it down until I was finished. And yet, I dreaded coming to the end."},{"Title":"Two Truths and a Lie","review":"For those of us who were left in a constant state of craving after reading Katrina Kittle&#65533;s first book, Traveling Light, her second novel is a strange blessing. It has satisfied our need to read more from this brilliant young writer with a thrilling and profound novel, but it has left us with an intensified desire for more.Two Truths and a Lie will literally change the reader&#65533;s life. Things will forever look different, deeper. I do not read mystery novels, in spite of the thrill they bring, they always leave me unsatisfied, lacking. I believe this is due to the fact that they are usually missing a second layer, a depth that makes you feel you just stole a glance at part of the meaning of life. In Katrina Kittle&#65533;s case, that is exactly the strength of the book. The mystery is almost a sideline to the novel&#65533;s agenda: to explore human relationships with all beings.Reading Two Truths and a Lie is a reevaluation of our values and understanding of life. Our view of animals will be changed forever. I found myself reliving my whole life, remembering my relationships with animals and discovering many things I had missed before, about them, about myself, about the people I love and don&#65533;t love. I watch dogs and cats now with my new eyes. I see them and feel them, their happiness, their pain, their unconditional love. It has brought a whole new set of dear friends into my life. Friends that have always been there but I had failed to notice to what degree.The insightful ruminations on reincarnation and death will reach people from all backgrounds. Their truth and universality will unravel our own mysteries as the novel&#65533;s mystery reveals itself, each character undressing slowly, painfully, with utter grace and courage. I recommend this book to anyone looking for days of exhilarating immersion in a world where everything seems upside down, but where they will find many pieces of themselves whispering wisely about their truths."},{"Title":"Two Truths and a Lie","review":"It is scary how real these characters were. As a matter of fact there were times that I had to put the book down and walk away from it because I felt such a strong connection with them. I say bravo a job well done and a toast to a book that is the finest I've read in years. If you only read one book this year pick this one up you won't feel sorry. The narrative is beautiful, the characters are life like, and even the animals have a personality of their own. There is not a single place where the book falters or gets drab. It will grab you and won't let go until the very last word."},{"Title":"Two Truths and a Lie","review":"It's been a long time since a book held me captive!

Add it to your cart right now. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS EXCELLENT BOOK."},{"Title":"Two Truths and a Lie","review":"I was so disappointed in this second book by Katrina Kittle. I had been looking forward to it for so long, but unfortunately, it bears no comparison to her first, &quot;Traveling Light&quot;, which was outstanding. &quot;Two Truths and a Lie&quot; never seemed to find its genre. Was it meant to be a mystery, a romance, a psychological study, or what? The book is weird and contrived. One thing I really disliked about it....the main characters were named Dair and Peyton (married couple). Isn't that just toooo cutesy? Besides which, I could never keep straight which one was which. And several times Peyton was spelled Payton! I never felt engaged by these mostly unlikable, angst-ridden, self-absorbed, unsympathetic, tiresome characters. None were ever fully developed, in my opinion. They were not people I cared about, in whom I could invest myself. The mystery part of the book was very weak, I thought.

He wrote many books, such asSystematic Theology, vol. 1,A History of Christian Thought (Touchstone Books),The Courage to Be,The Shaking Of The Foundations,The New Being,Eternal Now (scm classics).This volume was published in 1967, after Tillich's death. The first essay is, \\"An Autobiographical Essay: Early Years.\\" In this essay, he refers to his \\"predominiantly aesthetic-meditative attitude toward nature as distinguished from a scientific-analytical or technical-controlling relation... It is theologically formulated in my doctrine of the participation of nature in the process of fall and salvation.\\" (Pg. 25) He summarizes his \\"positive\\" philosophical discussions with his conservative Lutheran father, which ultimately \\"made me immune against any system of thought or life which demands the surrender of autonomy.\\" (Pg. 32) After mentioning an \\"early polemic\\" between himself and Karl Barth, he refers to the \\"balancing\\" of the romantic and revolutionary motives, which \\"has remained the basic problem of my thought and of my life ever since.\\" (Pg. 33)In the other (non-autobiographical) essays, he notes that the term \\"absolute\\" is difficult to use because many people associate it with the image of an \\"absolute thing\\" often identified with God; \\"This, of course, is not what I mean... I prefer to use the term 'ultimate' ... I should like to emphasize that there is no such thing as absolute knowledge, an impossibility.\\" (Pg. 66-67) He summarizes, \\"Each of our statements about the absolutes in knowledge is relative, and this is true of my own statements here and now.\\" (Pg. 80)He describes as the \\"most fundamental of all absolutes\\" that being is the power of resisting non-being. (Pg. 81) He suggests that the reason why we should not destroy our dignity as a person is that, \\"From the point of view of the holy, we do not belong to ourselves but to that from which we come and to which we return---the eternal ground of everything that is.\\" (Pg. 96)This is a relatively \\"personal,\\" more \\"inside\\" view of Tillich, and is of great interest for anyone interested in his philosophy."},{"Title":"Grey Seas Under-Canada","review":"I read this book about 5 years ago, lost it and have been trying to find it for about 5 years.

I have recomended it to all my marine friends but have not been able to locate it until today."},{"Title":"Grey Seas Under-Canada","review":"This book is an unexpectedly riveting episode-by-episode story of the Foundation Franklin, a marine salvage tug that sailed out of the ports of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland in the 1930s and '40s. This working ship, built in Scotland in 1916 to craftsman's standards, eventually found itself unused in a Hamburg shipyard in depression-strapped 1930 where it was identified as a possible vessel for the Canadian maritime salvage fleet. From that day to its final heart-stopping drama, the trials of this unprepossessing high seas coal-fired tugboat are recounted in all their adrenalin-filled reality in Mowat's gripping and evocative prose. Managed by callous profit-seekers, officered by experience-hardened seamen and crewed by men desperate for employment, Foundation Franklin's story is, as well, a slice of social and commercial history. The mood is workaday danger, fortitude, struggle and courage, marred by a single passing dismissive remark about &quot;union mechanics&quot;."},{"Title":"Grey Seas Under-Canada","review":"I first discovered &quot;Grey Seas Under&quot; about 15 years ago, appropriately enough as Able Seaman on an Ocean Salvage Tug. I was immediately enthralled. Out of the many books on the sea I have read, this one remains very dear to me (not that you have to be a mariner to enjoy it). Grey Seas Under is the true story of the ocean salvage tug, FOUNDATION FRANKLIN and the brave men who battled the North Atlantic to save hundreds of ships and thousands of lives. Farley Mowat, a master srory-teller, passionately desribes the exploits of FOUNDATION FRANKLIN with geat admiration and humor. Grey Seas Under is a true masterpiece saga of the sea. I've read this book probably 6 times in the last 10 years and I'm sure to re-read it for many years to come. I cannot recommend this book enough. I also highly recommend &quot;The Serpents Coil&quot; also by Farley Mowat, another first-rate tale of the sea."},{"Title":"Grey Seas Under-Canada","review":"This is probably my all-time favorite book.

I hope Bantam reprints it soon - I'm ready to by at least 10 more!"},{"Title":"Grey Seas Under-Canada","review":"This is my favorite book. I felt as thought I had been there, spellbound.

I suppose the Rodney Dangerfield of maritime subtopics. Even the term tug boat rings a bit derogatory. Disregarded and disrespected. But . . . .I am excited to report my discovery of this extremely well authored true story of the proud ship, Foundation Franklin. Built by the British as HMS Frisky in 1918, and between the Wars, rescued from a mothball yard in Hamburg and put into service by Foundation Maritime Company as a deep sea rescue/salvage tug out of Newfoundland and Nova Scotia. Renamed \\"Foundation Franklin\\", the Franklin and her men performed heroically for decades, extending through and beyond WWII, saving hundreds of ships and thousands of lives, often operating under absolutely deadly conditions.I'm impressed. I learned something about a little part of the world and the men/ships that work it which I will never forget, nor forget to appreciate. Farley Mowat wrote superbly in this work, which was at times pulse-pounding. I learned to grow fond of the Franklin, and mourn her absence maybe as if I had steamed on her myself.A rather obscure topic and title, but this is a great maritime story, lived out and told in the tradition of The Cruel Sea and The Caine Mutiny. Very much recommended."},{"Title":"Grey Seas Under-Canada","review":"Another Farley Mowat adventure in northern waters. He gives you your money's worth, and more. Great writer, and a sweeping subject: rescues at sea."},{"Title":"Grey Seas Under-Canada","review":"The ocean-going salvage tug, \`Foundation Franklin' was more than a match for the worst the North Atlantic could throw at her, including Force 10 hurricanes and Nazi U-Boats. Perfect Storm, eat your heart out! Here is the real book about the great-hearted men and their staunch little ships that survived blow after blow from the Atlantic and bobbed up for more.If the author, Farley Mowat is sometimes guilty of over-the-top prose---well, he lived and worked on the Franklin, and he loved her sturdy lines, her jaunty roll, and every rivet that held her together while she rescued ships that were Goliaths to her chubby, little Baby Huey. No work could have been more dangerous; none required a higher degree of seamanship and courage than dropping a line on a berserk, lunging, steel-hulled freighter, and then towing her through the maw of a mid-December gale, or the shoals and \`sunkers' of the Newfoundland coast---something the Franklin did so many times that her crew lost memory of all but their most freakish or man-killing expeditions.\\"Grey Seas Under\\" will give you an interesting perspective on the true maritime heroes of World War II. Farley Mowat doesn't pull any punches when he describes the tension that existed between the expert seamen on the ocean-going salvage and rescue tugs, and their relatively \`amateur' counterparts on Canadian and American naval warships. Some of the funniest scenes in the book involve convoys of merchant ships under the \`protection' of corvettes and destroyers. Once a U-Boat had been sighted and the merchants steamed for cover, it was up to the Franklin to rescue the ones that ran into each other or shoaled themselves. Usually, the tug had to perform her duties without any cover from the warships.\\"The days the salvors (tugboat seamen) spent tethered to fat and crippled merchantmen, crawling along on a straight course at a speed of two or three knots like mechanical targets in a shooting gallery, were the kind of days that would drain the courage from the most heroic man alive...The Germans knew, that for every rescue vessel sunk there would be a score of crippled merchantmen who would never make safe port.\\"This is a great book about men against the sea, even though the language gets very nautical at times. Read it and you will learn all about Lloyd's Open Form, and the tricks that wrecked merchant masters play to cheat tugs out of their salvage fees. You'll learn to tell the difference between \`Monkey Island' and the poop deck---and the difference between \`brass monkeys' and true seamen. You'll thrill to the dangers of sunkers, beam seas, and Arctic white-outs. You'll bite through your pipe-stem, just like the Franklin's captain did during those tows when his sturdy little tug steamed back into port with barely enough coal in her bunkers to \\"cook a pot of beans.\\"Someone ought to make a movie out of \\"Grey Seas Under.\\" It's got everything---romance (between man and ship, at least); life-and-death adventures; heroism; humor; and the treacherous ice, wind, and sea of what the author respectfully refers to as \`the Great Western Ocean.'"},{"Title":"Grey Seas Under-Canada","review":"I have read this book twice and I loved it. Mowat wrote as if the tug was a living thing. It was wonderful. I actually cried at the end when Franklin came into the harbor with barely any power left and covered entirely with ice, thus ending her life. The people who captained Franklin intriqued me as well. In the book they were the only ones that really cared for her."},{"Title":"Grey Seas Under-Canada","review":"Farley Mowat can make the stars sing with the sheer beauty of his writing. His writing is a little old-fashioned by today's standards, (all the better) but his craftsmanship is unsurpassed. You ARE there. You feel everything his characters felt, you see what they saw. The book ends happily and I know it, but I cry through the last chapter every time I read it because his writing takes me there. One hedge: the book does start slow, but if you keep plugging away, you will be richly rewarded."},{"Title":"Grey Seas Under-Canada","review":"This is one of the best sea stories that I have ever read.

Do NOT tear the pages as you frantically flip them from one spine-tingling adventure to the next. Do NOT hesitate to wipe the freezing saltwater spray from your brow as you marvel at the courage and sheer bravado of the Captains and Seamen who risked their lives to help vessels in distress in the turbulent waters of the North Atlantic. Farley Mowat brings it to you in spades with this excellent book, I CANNOT recommend it enough! I would give it 6 stars if possible. An Uncle of mine served aboard U.S. Navy salvage ships in the early 60's, and after reading this book for the 3rd time was still in awe of the skill and seamanship displayed in these tales.

Not so for the salvage and rescue ships running out of Nova Scotia. The more intense the storm, the more likely they would get an urgent call to leave home port and take the full bruntin order to salvage a foundering ship or rescue the survivors.The salvors make their living in the chaos of wind, sleet and an ocean streaked white with rage.Absolutely amazing feats of men against the sea and the massive forces of big ships &quot;on the rocks&quot;.The story line follows a salvage ship, the Foundation Franklin, from its own recovery, refurbishment, and baptism into the salvage business. The author breathes life into the old ship with eloquent imagery and dry wit. He explores the stalwart character of her crews, which evolve throughout the book; a collection of individual short stories revealing each fantastic rescue.Well worth reading if you like real-world adventure and appreciate the power of the sea."},{"Title":"The sin of Monsieur Pettipon and other humorous tales","review":"I really enjoyed these stories. Connell really has a captivating manner of narration. What impresses me about these stories is the diversity of characters and settings that evidence the author's familiarity with a diverse crowd of psychological specimens and vivid imagination capable of portraying settings.These narratives gave me a feeling of watching \\"The Twilight Zone\\" again. The shows, similarly, portrayed a diversity of stages and characters. Like this show, the narratives are at times predictable, not so much (I think) because of the simplicity of the narrative as much as the vividness of the characters; if one understands the character or the story's implicit message, he can often predict the ending. Also because this is a compilation of \\"humorous tales\\" it is clear that these stories aren't likely to end poorly for the protagonist.My only real complaint with the stories is their lack clear cut social propriety. In point of fact: the stories often advance the theme of \\"coming out one's shell\\" and learning to affirm/sell one's self (Capre Diem). While the characters do shed the shell of social disquiet (which is a good thing), they sometimes do things that are not appropriate. In one story, for example, a character learns to stick-up for himself but does so by \\"bluffing\\" when it comes time to pay for food that he has eaten. Its as though Connell condones treading over social etiquette and decency for the sake of overcoming one's timidity in social settings.This being said, his esteem for self mastery, fortitude, and civility (usually) are persistent themes throughout his books. Additionally, his critiques against: idle curiosity, arrogance, superficiality, and imprudent/uninformed decision-making are also persistent themes. If I could I would probably give it 4.5 stars."},{"Title":"The Man Without a Country","review":"&quot;The Man Without a Country,&quot; written by Edward Everett Hale in 1863, tells the story of Philip Nolan, a young lieutenant in the United States Navy, who, at his court martial for treason, damned the United States and cavalierly wished that he might never hear her name again. Nolan's sentence was to have his wish fulfilled. For fifty-five years he was kept at sea, being repeatedly transferred from ships that approached land to those that were headed out to sea. Although Nolan was not treated like a prisoner, a unique protocol was developed that kept him from hearing or seeing any news from home.Because of obscure references (especially early in the story) and some archaic wording, reading the story aloud is recommended. This provides an excellent opportunity to demonstrate that much can be gleaned from a story even when references are not completely understood. Pausing periodically to summarize the main points can help to keep students involved until you get to Hale's anecdotes that will truly captivate them.In addition to delineating the consequences of an impetuous act, &quot;The Man Without a Country&quot; provides a thought-provoking portrait of a patriot. In essays or debates students might consider Was Nolan's sentence fair? Should he have been pardoned?"},{"Title":"The Man Without a Country","review":"I can't believe the reader from Allentown didn't care for this book. I first read this story in high school and remember how choked up I got over Phillip's absolute and total love for a country he hasn't been able to see or hear about for over half his life due to his impassioned, yet stupid youthful declaration that he &quot;never wanted to hear his country's name again!&quot;.I hope other would-be readers listen to the other reviews and try this book.

It makes you proud to be an American and live under the glory that our forefathers fought for. So many times have I read this story, and each time I can barely get past parts that bring a tear to my eye. Ultimately a great and powerful book for any reader who enjoys a story of love, agony, and pride."},{"Title":"The Man Without a Country","review":"When Philip Nolan spewed out the words, &quot;Damn the United States!

The poignancy of this consequence through his long years of exile/imprisonment on U.S. ships crescendoes to the denoument, when the evidence of Nolan's encounter with what he had lost is described.

The book was just as I remembered it. However, with a greater understanding of the world, I have learned to appreciate this classic even more. While an American may not agree with that the United States does, a perfect country or government has yet to be created. Philip Nolan made a statement in which he disowned his country in his younger days. It was a statement that he would quitely regret for the rest of his life. Even in exile, Nolan reflects loyalty to his country in his behavior. On his death bed, Nolan only wants to learn of what has happened to the country since he was exiled. He was able to die a happy man knowing how the country he loved had prospered.The story is intended to made readers appreciate their country. Sometimes it may be difficult to agree with the government. In the end, one realizes that they love their country like a parent or their own child. Nolan had to learn this lesson the hard way."},{"Title":"The Man Without a Country","review":"How sad that to some of the reviewers reading has become a chore and that a book without &quot;hair pulling&quot; and other action is boring.

I wish I may never hear of the United States again!\\" The court sentenced him to what he wished for.(As the plot unfolds, some young readers -- future attorneys, perhaps -- focus on the irregularity and inhumanity of the sentence. Of course, there was no Philip Nolan, and the entire plot is fiction, a vehicle used by Hale to prompt reflection on the meaning of \\"country\\" in every person's life.)This story was read by every American high school student from the time it was published in 1863 to the 1960s. The availability of many old editions from used booksellers gives testimony to its enduring power over the years. It surely helped form the patriotic sense of the World War II and Vietnam generations.A few years ago, I was with a group of American missionaries in Bangladesh, and in a relaxed discussion about what we had read in high school, hardly anyone remembered \\"Thanatopsis\\" (by William Cullen Bryant), \\"Great Expectations\\" (Charles Dickens), \\" or \\"Evangeline\\" (Henry Wadsworth Longfellow) -- all staples of our generation's high school canon. But when I mentioned \\"The Man Without a Country,\\" every one energetically nodded and said \\"Yes, that really made an impression!\\"\\"The Man Without a Country\\" deserves a revival. It is \\"accessible,\\" by which I mean that young minds can easily follow the plot and understand Hale's point. It can be related to lessons in American history -- Aaron Burr's treason and the \\"copperheads\\" of the Civil War, for instance. It conveys ideals from the young republic across the years to the present. It keeps alive a famous passage from Sir Walter Scott's \\"The Lay of the Last Minstrel,\\" sung with feeling by the chorales at the service academies:Breathes there the man with soul so deadWho never to himself hath said,This is my own, my native land!Whose heart hath ne'er within him burned,As home his footsteps he hath turnedFrom wandering on a foreign strand!If such there breathe, go, mark him well;For him no minstrel raptures swell;High though his titles, proud his name,Boundless his wealth as wish can claimDespite those titles, power, and pelf,The wretch, concentred all in self,Living, shall forfeit fair renown,And, doubly dying, shall go downTo the vile dust from whence he sprung,Unwept, unhonored , and unsung.Read the story and ask yourself this question: Did Philip Nolan love his country because he longed for the land where he grew up?

Its brief, but imparts a strong message to us.We must always stand together in times of war and peace.America is the best country in the world despite world opinion.The deep, psychological punishment inflicted on Nolan can only serve to remind us what life would be like without our country even with all her imperfections.She is still the best the world has to offer as far as freedom and opportunity are concerned.Why would everyone be trying to get in as opposed to out.This little gem of a story makes plain why we need to stand together as Americans, more now than ever and should be read by every American both old and new."},{"Title":"The Man Without a Country","review":"I LIKE TO SAY THAT THE BOOK WAS VERY GOOD.

I can't say enough good things about the story. It paints an amazingly complete picture of the life of a young man turned soldier in the american west during the civil war. It's hard to convey the adventure and high drama of the story, but suffice to say that back then it ranked high up on my list of most entertaining things ever (just below star wars). My Jr. High didn't have the book in the library, and since then I've always kept an eye out for Rifles for Watie, but haven't encountered it since. Thanks to amazon.com I'm soon going to get the chance to read it again!"},{"Title":"Rifles for Watie","review":"This book was the first real novel I ever. I have read it four more times since.

Jeff Bussey, a farmer boy, heard about the new war and is very exited. He is very eager to join the volunteer army. He left his farm, mother, and Father, and goes out to fight against the rebel army. Lead by the half-blooded Stand Watie. During the War, Jeff sees many of his new friends die. Jeff discovers a rebel girl that he really likes named Lucy. Then Jeff is sent o spy on the rebel side. He finds the rebels are not so bad and Jeff starts to admire Watie. In the rest of the book Jeff had to decide if he should stay with the rebel side or the union side. This action packed historical fiction should be highly rated. You can feel the troops live through the War conditions while you read this book.

I never realized that there was so much going on in the Civil war. I first read this book in 5th grade and I loved it. Rifles for Watie is a facinating book about a boy called Jeff who joins up in the army and gets more than he expected! He is a infantry man, a cavalier, a cannonier for two hours and a spy.While Jeff is a spy he finds out that his enemy ,the confederates, are not a bad bunch. He falls in love with a girl called Lucy and she wants him to join the confederates. Will Jeff stay with the Unions or will he betray them to join the confederates?In all I have given Rifles for Watie for it is exciting and full of adventure. It has deserved the newberry award.

Rifles for Watie goes deeper into history than any other book I've read. I never realized that there was more to the Civil War that fighting over slavery. In this book, you get to see what life was like on both sides of the battle grounds, when Jeff fights for both the Union and the Confederacy, as a Union spy. Besides being wonderfully researched, this book also has a great collection of lifelike characters. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes historical fiction, and even those who don't.

I just love stories full of romance, battles, spies, and heroes. And this book was historical fiction, too, so I learned a lot about the Civil War.

I'm now 18 and just read it again. This book was the beginning of my adiction to Civil War history.

But if you are a Civil War buff (like me) you will instantly notice the historical faults. For example, when Jeff gets to see the new Spencer reapeting rifle he says wow &quot;You can load her on sunday and shoot her all the rest of the week.&quot; That was the classical comment that followed the Spencer, and I dont think that a made up character can take the credit for saying it. Also, the quick paced beginning of Jeff's enlistment is unprobable. The fact that Jeff got less than a month of training on the drill field is unlikely. It would take much more drilling and training to prepare for battle than the amount proposed in the book. If you are not interested in the Civil War, I'm sorry I had to bore you with those details. Before I began to write this I put a 4 star rating, but now I decided to change it to five. It is a fun book to read and very exciting. If your are just starting on the Civil War I would recommend it!!!"},{"Title":"Rifles for Watie","review":"I first read this book when I was ten years old, I have read it fourteen times since then.

The story involves Jeff's enemy Captain Asa Clardy and Jeff's love for a beautiful young rebel girl named Lucy Washbourne and his many roles in the infantry, the calvary and even as a spy. It should be required reading in elementary schools, especially for young boys."},{"Title":"Rifles for Watie","review":"The book Rifels For Watie is a thrilling book thet takes you back in time during the Civil War and helps you undestand the reasons this war was started.I liked this book because it gives you different points of views from both sides of the war.When Jeff Bussey joings the union spies he has to go behind enemy lines.There he meets young men like himself and meets friends.Jeff even thinks of joining with the confederets.This is a great book to learn a little about history.I can't wait till I get my own copy."},{"Title":"Rifles for Watie","review":"Rifles For Watie takes place during the Civil War in the Ozark Region of America (Kansas, Missouri, Arkansas).

Written by Harold Keith, this book takes you with Jeff Bussey as he moves from his family farm in Kansas to the forefront of the civil war theater. Keith vividly depicts Jeff's interaction with the union army and many of the battles fought. Keith does an exceptional job of adding dimension to Jeff's experiences.

Jeff joined up with high hopes of glory and romance, but quickly learns what a skewed perspective he had on war. As he loses sleep, filling meals, and friends, his perspective grows quite grim, sometimes despairing. The battles are intense and gory, the marches grueling. Never knowing what day might be his last is emotionally draining. Yet there is no turning back. The plot thickens as Jeff is appointed as a spy to gather information about the Cherokee Indians by joining their camp as one of them. What he finds in doing so not only surprises him, but gets him thinking. Suddenly, he's questioning what he's been fighting for all along. Is the Union Army's cause really the right one? And will he betray the rebels, or join their ranks?Rifles for Watie offered a unique perspective on this piece of history. The fight against Colonol Watie is not something commonly written of or discussed, so I appreciated this look into a rarer aspect of the Civil War. I'd recommend Rifles for Watie as a way to enjoy a good fictional story and study history simultaneously.If you'd like to read more of my book reviews, visit larsenreviews.org."},{"Title":"Rifles for Watie","review":"Just finished reading this aloud to my 5th grader and we both thoroughly enjoyed Rifles for Watie.

Beautifully written, this book is a truly intelligent story of the war and all its mind-boggling twists and turns. And the ending is excellent."},{"Title":"Rifles for Watie","review":"I first read this delightful novel in 1968 or 1969. It continues to be one of my favorite books. Historian and former OU sports information director Harold Keith actually makes history \\"fun\\" for teenagers with this award-winning tale, as RIFLES FOR WAITIE gives readers a full account of the brutal Civil War campaign in the Indian Territories of the frontier.At the heart of Keith's story is young Jeff Bussey, who joins a regiment of Kansas volunteers as a 16-year-old, idealistic adventure seeker. Jeff's idealism is short-lived once he confronts the horrors and barbarism of war; it is replaced by disillusionment, bitterness, fear. Although written in the Fifties, Keith cuts no corners in portraying the brutality of the Civil War in Oklahoma Territory; the reader can smell the smoke, hear the deafening roar of cannon, feel the bullets whistle past. And as young Jeff matures. . .becomes a battle-hardened survivor. . .he is sent on an assignment behind enemy lines--only to discover the men he is fighting are just like him: cold, tired, hungry, and ready to go home.Wonderfully written and flawlessly paced, RIFLES FOR WAITIE is an absorbing read.

Help keep the union together and get rid of slavery or fight to help save the cherokee indians lands fighting under conel Watie of the confederete army? Sounds pretty good doesn't it? Heroic battles where Jeff is pitted agains't Rebels in pitched battles including a time where he gets a medal for bravery.Deadly skirmishes(that really give the story it's excitment)often by suprise from the enemy.Jeff meets and loses friends on both sides that are each nice in their own way.Both sides have very different ways they fight the war.A captivating cherokee girl(totally a rebel) named Lucy meet and come to love each other utterly despite their differances.I have given only a few of the points that would make this book a good movie.I don't have room to write more.I guess it could be rated PG-13 for battle sequences but not for other lewd content thats not in the book.I hope in to it in theaters in a few years!(I think Peter Jackson could do a good job seeing how he did Lord of the Rings so well."},{"Title":"Rifles for Watie","review":"I actually went back and re-read \\"Rifles for Watie\\" several months ago, more than 40 years after I had first encountered it. (It won the 1958 Newberry Award for children's literature and was a hot item in my elementary school library.) In reading the book as an adult, I was disappointed in the episodic construction of Harold Keith's narrative. He makes some big leaps as he jumps along through the Civil War; in some cases, several months pass between one chapter and the next. This weakens the development of the characters, in particular the youthful focus of the book, Jeff Bussey. At the end of the novel, despite his four years of experience as a combat soldier, spy, and lover, there is little sense that this teenager matures or changes. Even without war, and even sequestered in college, most kids do a fair amount of growing up between ages 18 and 22. At the end of a terrible war, Jeff seems to be as callow and even innocent as he was in his recruit days.This failing, however, probably won't matter to the young audience for whom Keith was writing back in the 1950s. The book reflects the sensibilities of that era, especially in the equal regard in which Keith holds the supporters of both the Union and the Confederacy. Jefferson Davis Bussey, a Union soldier (named by his father after a respected Mexican War comrade from Mississippi!), learns to like and respect his Confederate adversaries, and he falls in love with a Rebel girl. The only real villain in the story is a Union officer. Even in the 21st century, younger readers (ages 8-14) will likely identify with Jeff and his perspective on the events of the 1860s. They also will enjoy Keith's colorful description of battles and soldiering, as well as the more sober scenes of the war's cruelty and destruction.When \\"Rifles for Watie\\" was first published, it revealed to many Americans, including a lot of Civil War scholars, that the conflict had been irrepressible west of the Mississippi as well as in the East. Keith doesn't really deal with all the causes and ramifications of the war in the Indian Territory, and a search of the amazon.com website reveals many more recent scholarly books about the subject. But for readers young and old, \\"Rifles for Watie\\" still can be a painless introduction to the topic -- for all of that episodic narrative, it's still a Good Read."},{"Title":"Rifles for Watie","review":"Rifles for Watie is about Jeff Bussey a sixteen year old farm boy from Kansas. This story takes place in the Ozarks region(Kansas, Missouri, Olkahoma, and Arkansas). Jeff's family gets &quot;bushwacked&quot; by Confederate bushwackers and because of it Jeff joins the Union Army. Jeff thinks war would be fun so he's excited to be in his first battle. But when friends die in the battle Jeff changes his thoughts about war. He finds out that war means destruction and killing. I think Rifles for Watie deserves a five because I think it was well written, took place in a very important American historical event, and it has a wonderful plot. I compare this book to War in the Ozarks. It takes place in the same region as Rifles for Watie, and it has about the same plot. Rifles for Watie was a extremely exciting and excellent book."},{"Title":"Rifles for Watie","review":"Keith presents the Civil War from a different viewpoint: that of a Kansas farm boy who joins the Union Army to protect the family farm from rebel Bushwackers across the Missouri border. Like Michael Shaara's THE KILLER ANGELS (Pulitzer Prize winner about the Battle of Gettysburg), this book presents a fair portrayal of conditions and mindsets on both sides of the Mason/Dixon line. There are no clearcut military antagonists--just men in opposing uniforms. Keith's detailed research offers a variety of reasons for enlisting with one side or another, plus the tragic case of displaced Native Americans who were caught in the political crossfire of a nation undergoing rebirth.Sixteen-year-old Jeff (Jefferson Davis Bussey, if you please) serves his country first in the Infantry then in the Cavalry. While on a dangerous scouting expedition (Spy mission), he is tricked into enlisting with Col. Watie's Mounted Cherokee Rifles. Poor Jeff endures more than the normal risks of battle though: he falls for a Rebel gal--part Indian too. Befriended by kind and generous Southerners, he experiences increasing guilt as he grows to respect his erstwhile enemies. He develops true bonds with the common soldiers who become his new messmates.Yet Jeff privately realizes that time is relentlessly drawing him to the brink of a fateful decision: when he must choose which ideal (Union or division) to champion. Whichever way he goes, he will be branded a traitor by former friends--either his sweetheart or his family! How can the youth maintain his honor, especially when his heart is set on his sleeve? Even worse: he knows a dangerous secret about a sadistic Union officer who might well shoot or stab him during battle--just to assure his silence.Toward the end of the war the 7-shot Spencer Repeating Rifles were phasing out the older, one-shot Springfield rifles, but if both sides possess these new weapons of destruction, will the war be strung out even longer? Can Jeff prove his loyalty by ferreting out the identity of the traitor who is selling repeating rifles to the South? Excellent details of the dilemma of the border states and the regrettable suffering endured by many Indians, who were tragically divided in their loyalties--just like countless white border families. This is a very good read (based on research for a Master's Thesis), but too long and detailed to appeal to most high school students. The plot and supense eventually capture the reader's imagination."},{"Title":"Rifles for Watie","review":"As a Civil War historian, I found this book fascinating!

It tells of friendships on both sides of the war. His love of the rebel girl Lucy, his friend Noah the tramp printer and the life of a common Union soldier and a Rebel Cavalryman. The book recounts battles and the small world within them that a soldier plays, often missing the large results that are defined with the outcome.

I got it at about age nine and was not very inclined to read it... but now at thirteen it is an exciting read. Don't turn away just because of the fact that it has the word 'rifles' in the title.

He made the battle scenes and the towns seem so real in my mind. This book is a one of a kind. Jeff has been on both sides of the war, seen both side's point of view. He had to make up his mind on which side he stayed on. I was really thinking that he was going to stay with the rebels just because Lucy Washbourne was on that side, but I was wrong. He made friends on both sides of the army and they took him in as their own. His name had a lot to do with it. Jeff's father fought in a war with the south. His name was well known there. I think that if he didn't have that name he wouldn't have been able to get into the rebel front lines. I loved this book and I urge everybody else to read it. It is truly a great book. I will have to get my own copy very soon."},{"Title":"Rifles for Watie","review":"Jeff, a Union soldier from Kansas, decides to join the Union army after his family is bushwacked by two rebel soldiers.

Excellent reading!"},{"Title":"Rifles for Watie","review":"Rifles for watie is about a young man who is living in thecivil war era. The best thing about this book is it gives us a lookinto both sides of the war and is very informative about the ideas andfeelings that were going on at the time of the civil war.

It was one of the few books that left me spellbound to read more about the coming scenes and twists of plot. I especially loved how Mr. Harold Keith incorporated the thrills of chivalrous adventure (beginning with the boy's attempt to stop marauders from harrassing his family) to an act of human virtue that ultimately won a fiesty young belle's heart! Becoming absorbed in the unravelling events of this book was definitely time well spent! Furthermore, I was increasingly fascinated by Keith's extensive research before the creation of this novel and how he formed the characters out of actual personal letters from Union and Confederate Soldiers."},{"Title":"Rifles for Watie","review":"I'm certain many of you have the habit of returning to certain books again and again over the years; sort of like renewing acquaintances with an old friend you haven't seen for years.

You'll have to read it to get more information. and also when all this is happening the boy is falling in love with a confederates daughter!"},{"Title":"Rifles for Watie","review":"Rifles for Watie is a good book.

Then he has to solve more problems when he falls in love with a rebel girl. He has to find a way to make her like him while still staying on the Union side. I could go on and on with the content in te story but i must leave some excitement for you so you would enjoy the book. He has lots problems.

I never realized that there was so much going on in the Civil war. I first read this book in 5th grade and I loved it. Rifles for Watie is a facinating book about a boy called Jeff who joins up in the army and gets more than he expected! He is a infantry man, a cavalier, a cannonier for two hours and a spy.While Jeff is a spy he finds out that his enemy ,the confederates, are not a bad bunch. He falls in love with a girl called Lucy and she wants him to join the confederates. Will Jeff stay with the Unions or will he betray them to join the confederates?In all I have given Rifles for Watie for it is exciting and full of adventure. It has deserved the newberry award. If you haven't read it yet then I would recommend you go to the libary or to a book store and read it!!! But be warned once you red this you will not stop until the end!!!"},{"Title":"Rifles for Watie","review":"I loved the book!!! It's about Jefferson Davis Bussey joining the Union Army and fighting the Civil War. Jeff is a intfantry man,a cavalry man, and a spy.

He is probably the only soldier to fight the Civil War and understand the South and the North sides."},{"Title":"Rifles for Watie","review":"This is a book about a boy named Jefferson Davis Bussey who fights in the Civil War. It's full of historical information but the book is also very interesting. I normally don't read war books but this one I found pretty good. Only some parts drag a little. But there are many interesting characters, including Lucy Washbourne, Noah Babbitt and many more. Definitely get this one for your library!"},{"Title":"Rifles for Watie","review":"I've always been a military history buff, especially back in my youth when I had dreams of valorous service to my country. One of my favorite military fiction books as a young high school sophomore in the early 1980s was \\"Rifles for Watie\\", which I probably checked out from my school library more than just about everyone combined.Young Jeff (around my age at the time) gets caught up in the Civil War, joins the Union army, and heads off to fight the Confederates. He makes some solid friends and experiences harsh combat in the infantry. However, he's soon directed to go undercover as a faux Rebel and spy on Stand Watie, something of a Nathan Bedford Forrest figure. Jeff grows to admire Watie and his comrades, and even manages to fall for a fiery young Southern woman named Lucy. We follow Jeff's adventures through the war from beginning to end along with a fine cast of supporting characters.In light of our own overexposure to war in the last eight years I suppose there are some who might criticize \\"Rifles for Watie\\" for its dearth of, say, PTSD portrayal or making war look like a grand adventure. But then again, should a romance book include a bitter divorce or flagrant adultery? Yes, Jeff does change as a result of his wartime experiences, but mostly in a positive way. What young man wouldn't want to dream about embarking on a similar heroic journey?With that in mind, \\"Rifles for Watie\\" is an entertaining adventure tale of a a boy who becomes a man as a result of his tour of duty in the military. Of course, I'd recommend that the reader balance this book with more sober and realistic books about wartime service, if only to see how things can go bad in such a context. But this book is highly recommended for the young person interested in a piece of exciting and non-nihilistic military fiction."},{"Title":"Rifles for Watie","review":"I can't believe this book is still available! This was one of the very few books I remember by title that I read when I was in the 4th Grade in 1957.

It had to be great to leave such a positive impression for so long."},{"Title":"Rifles for Watie","review":"this book is so close to the truth about the civil war that it is a must read. I have studied the civil war for several years and when I read this book It tought me stuff I didn't know about the times and the wars that happened especially the not so famous wars.It also tought me alot about the behaviors of the officers and of the soldiers. Since i joined the army sometimes I thought I had a hard time because they didn't feed us that much and some of the punishments are alot different today than back then but alot of the horrors of war are the same like being in the infantry is still similar in some cases and the calvary is alot different in some ways but the same in other ways."},{"Title":"Rifles for Watie","review":"Jeff Bussey is only 16 when the Civil War breaks out, but he immediately leaves his home in Linn County- after two bushwhackers's break into his house - to join the Kansas volunteers.

He has to cope with a mean officer, Captain Clardy, and his love for a rebel girl, Lucy Washbourne.Then he is sent on a scouting mission,behind enemy lines where he makes an important discovery. The rebels are just boys like him, only they are fighting for a different cause. He is left with a tough decision to make.

I had to read it for school, and my literature teacher usually picks boring books, but \\"Rifles for Watie\\" was great throughout. It tells the story of Jeff Bussey, a Kansas kid, who enlists in the Union army to defeat the enemy Cherokee Indians and their leader Stand Watie. Jeff quickly dislikes the rough life in the army, but learns to appreciate it. Soon, he is sent by his captain to go to the rebel side as a spy and gather information and bring it back to the captain. I don't want to give away too much, but it is an exciting book.

I had a very supportive librarian who understood that I was not a 3rd grade reader and she was quite pleased that I subsequently checked it out 7 more times that school year. After a lapse of 50 years, I found RFW again and gave my old friend a try.Well...50 years of reading and life do make a difference. I had not lost my love for the story, it is and will always remain one of my top five reads. However, some of the cavils from other reviewers are valid: a few lurches in time, etc.That doesn't really detract from the overall quality of this tale. The protaganist, Jeff, has a marvelous and harrowing adventure and encounters a bit of dreamy adolescent love with Lucy...what could be better than to be kissed 'neath the rosebud tree?And...one mustn't forget Jeff's crusty sergeant...a great character whom, sadly, will never be played by Victor Mclaglen.The action scenes are well written and the Jeff's journey through both sides of the warring combatants is most excellently delineated. He finds that combatants on both sides are people with more in common than not. It is not overtly stated, but I found the futility of war a profoundly somber co-reader with me...when I was 8 and now.There is sooo much in this story: young man off to war, a civil war(although the brutality of that conflict was heinous), violent encounters, the hard nosed but caring sergeant, young love, spying, the Cherokee struggle.RFW would make a tremendous movie...as long as Spielberg doesn't get hold of it. I would prefer Steven Soderburg."},{"Title":"Rifles for Watie","review":"I've never read a book about a soldier in the middle of a war until now.

Finally, he is set up against the Southern Army and he finds it is not the glorious adventure he thought it would be. He makes an enemy of his commander and has to fight not only the Southern soldiers, but his own commander. Jeff is selected to infiltrate the Southern Army and to bring back information to the Union soldiers. He ends up spending many months with the Southerners and finds they are not so different from his Union friends. My son has raved about this book for years.

Since I could not remember the details of the book I decided to read it again as an adult. The book is covered in a hard, glossy cardboard cover with updated artwork. It is the perfect size to carry on an airplane, which I did as soon as I received it. It is easy reading and has an interesting fictional storyline, based on actual testimony of living Civil War veterans personally interviewed by the author (a former University of Oklahoma History Professor) back in the early 20th Century. The description of life on the Kansas-Missouri border, as well as facts about the Five Civilized Tribes in Oklahoma (and their connection with the War of Northern Agression) was of particular interest to me. \\"Rifles for Waite\\" reads similarly to \\"The Red Badge of Courage.\\" another school time book club read. Every school age child should read this book, and I highly recommend it for adults as well."},{"Title":"Rifles for Watie","review":"I personally feel that anyone studying the Civil War should read this book. \\"Good\\" and \\"bad\\" are not not easily identified by the color of a uniform. How Jeff deals with each situation provides many opportunities for discussion.

Crowell Company, Harold Keith's \\"Rifles For Watie\\" is a kind of novel rarely ever seen. In fact, I have never seen another quite like it, before or since. I can't quite say it to be the greatest novel I've ever read- Pat Conroy's \\"The Lords of Discipline\\" retains that title with me- but it is a close second, and most of all it is the all-around best novel focusing on the American Civil War that I have ever seen.I first picked up a copy of \\"Rifles For Watie\\" when I was in elementary school. I don't recall which edition or printing it was- the copy I have now is a 1957 hardcover, second printing- but I recall that I enjoyed reading it immensely and to this day I credit \\"Rifles For Watie\\" with greatly increasing my interest in reading. It wasn't even a book we were required to read in class, which was a real shame. The Henrico County K-12 public school system ignored \\"Rifles For Watie\\" but simply couldn't get enough of rubbish like \\"The Pearl\\" and \\"Brave New World\\", both of which I loathe to this day for the mediocre-at-best works of literature that they are. I do recall being required to read one Civil War novel at one point- the lamentably bland \\"Across Five Aprils\\"- but that isn't much next to the honest, simple brilliance of Harold Keith's novel.This book's honest, simple, yet deep and complex nature is the very essence of why it's so good. It is the result of five years' work by the author, and if you know about him before reading, or learn about him after, you'll realize that Keith really knew what he was writing about. The Western front of the Civil War, much neglected by most authors, happened in the exact area of the US that Harold Keith lived, Oklahoma.Jefferson Davis Bussey, in the wake of a pro-slavery bushwhackers' attack on his family's farm, decides to head to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas and join up. Several friends living nearby follow him, and they do not return for more than three years. The storyline sees Jeff, honest, stubborn, and brave, stand up to the cruel injustice of the cowardly, self-serving Captain Asa Clardy, go from infantryman to cavalryman to scout, earn a Medal of Honor at the Battle of Prarie Grove, serve in both armies and fall completely in love with a girl whose fiery patriotism and stubborn, hard-headed manner are a perfect match for Jeff's. He survives when so many around him fall, and is lucky from beginning to end. Jeff is even luckier in that when he finally returns home, having travelled over 100 miles on foot in escaping Stand Watie's army and convinced the bloodhound sent after him to switch sides, he is not cynical, not bitter or in any lasting way mentally or spiritually harmed by war. He has learned to keep faith when nothing else remains, and to keep going when many would see no point. He single-handedly ends the illicit shipping and sale of Spencer repeating rifles to Stand Watie's troops, done by no other than the treacherous Captain Clardy. It is true justice that both Jeff and Clardy both meet the fates each of them deserves. Jeff goes home alive, while the many dark deeds Clardy has committed throughout his life finally return to visit him.Jeff is the kind of young man America and the world will never have enough of- simple, honest, and fierecely dedicated to his chosen causes and ideals. In my mind, he earned the Medal of Honor many more times than the one he was given it.I'll always wonder why books like this are not more common reading in American schools, public and private. And by the way- since I have begun reading over reviews of this book that others have posted, I feel compelled to comment on the idea of making this book into a movie. I am if anything opposed to the idea. Because \\"Rifles For Watie\\" is a brilliant, truly great work of literature. Of literature. Not of film. I have seen many books adapted to film over my 19 years, and while I've seen a few done very well I've seen more done very badly.

If so, then Harold Keith's book, Rifles For Watie, is the book for you. It follows th journey of a teenager named Jeff, who, in his youthful enthusiasm, joins the Union Army during the Civil War. On this journey he meets friends, makes enemies, and falls in love. He is surprised by the ferocity of the fighting and finds no glory in the victory. This book would be good for teens to young adults.Rifles For Watie is organized in an easy to read, orderly fashion. There are no jumps from here to there to confuse you. There are however, periods of time with little or no action. An example is, \\"We stayed in the fort for 3 whole months waiting to get into action.\\" The author also gives you side information about the war as a whole, which will help you keep your bearings on the years.The age group that I think would get the maximum effectivenessfrom enjoying this book would be young adults or people interested in the life of a soldier. The vocabulary is easy to read but the fact that Keith puts in the Kansas accents and spellings might make it slightly harder to read for some. The author also deals with subjects akin to young adults, changing emotions, questioned ideals, and loss.The amount of emotion in this book is astounding. The author weaves in how Jeff feels and thinks. He describes in detail his thoughts using fear, suspense, and longing, among them. He uses Jeff's emotions by telling how flustered he gets when he met Lucy, a young Rebel teenager his age.Rifles For Watie is a \\"must read\\" for young adults teens and people who like war novels."},{"Title":"Rifles for Watie","review":"I was somewhat skeptical of reading &quot;Rifles for Watie&quot; when I saw that it was originally written in the '50's, believing that any book that old must be sappy and cheap. I was certainly suprised! This book ranks very high in my favorite books.Jeff Bussey, a teenage Kansas boy, decides that he wants to join the Union army, especially after southern bushwackers come near his family's home. Jeff is sure that fighting the Confederates will be a great adventure for he and his friends, but he is soon suprised - when he sees the results of terrible battles, he begins to doubt the honor and excitement of war. When Jeff falls in love with a spirited Cherokee-Confederate girl, and also when he gets involved with some other Confederates, he learns that the other armies are just made up of boys like him, who fiercly honor their country.This was an excellent, exciting, interesting, and, at the same time, educational young adult novel on the Civil War, and I'd definitely recommend it for ages 12 and up! You may also enjoy &quot;The Journal of James Edmund Pease&quot;, &quot;The Boys' War&quot;, and &quot;Soldier's Heart&quot;, also on the Civil War, and, on the also intriguing Revolutionary War, the book &quot;Johnny Tremain&quot; and the wonderful movie &quot;The Patriot."},{"Title":"Rifles for Watie","review":"This is my absolute FAVORITE book of all time!

My personal favorites are Murphy's \\"What Is Branding\\" which provides a basic but precise introductory briefing on the subject. He concludes by noting that branding is a creative process. \\"It uses research techniques and the skills of a number of specialists. But in the end it is about creating distinctness -- in a consumer-relevant fashion.\\" I also admire Fogg's analysis of \\"Brands as Intellectual Property.\\" (Those who share have a special interest in this subject are urged to check out Lessig's Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace.) Carratu's essay follows, probing even further into \\"Commercial Counterfeiting\\" which is, he concludes, \\"a profitable and growing activity that poses a serious threat to manufacturers of branded products. It is frequently very well funded and organised and is prevalent throughout the world....[Fortunately], brand owners are becoming more vigilant, but the battle has yet to be won.\\" Tragos has much of value to say about \\"International Branding\\" as do Andrew about \\"Brand Revitalisation and Extension\\" and Hart about \\"The Future for Brands.\\" For executive-level managers who are either directly or indirectly involved with marketing (in general) and branding (in particular), this really is a \\"must read.\\""},{"Title":"The Attraction","review":"A group of young folks has some car trouble while traveling across the country. They are not particularly good friends but the bonds get tested on the trip. At one point their car breaks down almost in the middle of nowhere. This puts them in position to view a roadside attraction of a strange little beastie said to be from South America. Although it appears to be mummified a sign warns not to feed it.When the creature is accidentally fed it becomes animated and begins to fulfil its purpose of taking the skin off the living. It is fast, brutal, and intelligent. Is there any way to stop it? The dwindling cast must find an answer and find it quickly. Things move quickly all the way to an acceptable and believable ending. A very good read.Also in this volume is a short novella of Clegg's Harrow stories called The Necromancer. This tale tells the story of the very beginning of Mr. Gravesend and how he first becomes familiar with the occult and its mysteries. As part of a larger story it is quite good. As a stand alone tale it is a little dry and slow at the beginning. But if you have read any of the Harrow novels, you will surely want to read this one."},{"Title":"The Attraction","review":"Five college friends decide to take a road trip cross country to California for spring break. They want to get away from their little private college in the Virginia mountains and see the country. They start noticing road signs in Arizona that say \\"Come see the Attraction! The unspeakable unknowable Mystery!\\" They end up having a breakdown in the Arizona Desert and a trucker gives them a lift to a local gas station.It is called the Breakdown Palace and it is the very place where the \\"Mystery\\" is kept. They decide to go have a look and see what it is all about. Located in the back of the store in a glass case with a sign above it saying \\"Do not feed\\" is a small, mummified corpse with long, sharp fingernails. It is called a Flesh-Scraper. The ancient Aztecs used it to scrap the flesh off the bones of sacrifices. One of the friends thinking it is all a stupid hoax decides to steal it, but when they have another breakdown in the desert they soon realize that Flesh-Scraper is a lot more than just a road side attraction hoax. They have awaken an Ancient Evil with one thing on its mind. \\"Human Flesh\\"I had never read any of Clegg's work before so I wasn't sure what to expect when I started. I am kicking myself now for not giving his stories a chance sooner. I couldn't put this book down. It grabbed me on the first page and wouldn't let go. I ended up reading most of the night away. I had a stiff neck and only got a few hours sleep, but it was worth it. The Attraction has a original plot and very believable characters. The story moves at a incredible rate and never lags. The only complaint I have is that it was a little short. I thought it could have been at least a lot longer than 175 pages, but that aside The Attraction is worth every cent.There is also a Novella called The Nercomancer in this book. It is a prequel to the Harrow House novels and it is mainly drawn from the diaries of a young Justin Gravesend. Fans of the Harrow House books will love this story. I have got to read the Harrow House trilogy now.To sum up The Attraction is one of the best stories I've read this year. I got a whole lot more than I expected, and I am now a Clegg fan."},{"Title":"The Attraction","review":"Delirium Books has achieved a justifiable reputation as a publisher of superbly crafted science fiction/horror fantasy titles for the true connoisseur of book that conjures nightmares to life! The latest title offered to horror fantasy enthusiasts is Douglas Clegg's The Attraction. A desiccated corpse from the Aztec era is displayed in a glass case for anyone to see. When it is deemed to be a counterfeit, just the remains of a small child with some glued on fake fingernails, Griff says to his friend Ziggy by way of a practical joke, &quot;Let's feed it!&quot;. That's when the the horror awoke and the Flesh-Scraper is loose! Douglas Clegg blends a unique and macabre imagination with a genuine gift for developing his characters and presenting the reader with a vivid story that will separate the timid from their sleep and the bold from their complacency whenever they next visit a sideshow or museum mummy display!"},{"Title":"The Attraction","review":"5.5\\" x 8.5\\" hardcover, limited edition of 500 copies. 154 pages.\\"Please Do Not Touch Glass. We at the Brakedown Palace have nicknamed this special ancient mummy, Scratch, and he has been good luck to us all these years. We must warn any who view it that there is a legend that once Scratch gets fresh human skin under its fingernails and the taste of blood, he'll come back from oblivion to reap the human harvest. Do Not Touch. Do Not Feed.\\"While a sign that reads the above would be slightly ominous yet silly, if you were watching a movie about a bunch of college-aged kids standing in-front of this mummy then you'd be screaming 'Don't touch the mummy! Don't feed the mummy!' just like you'd yell 'Don't go into the basement!' or 'Don't hide in the closet!' There are certain conventions to slasher films and we all know them.Douglas Clegg certainly knows them. He even admits it in the Afterword: The Attraction was meant as Clegg's \\"own version of the Slasher Movie\\" -- \\"a homage to them, without being an exact replica.\\" And he certainly succeeds. Leave it to the man who re-imagined the haunted house in his Harrow series to be as creative when re-envisioning the slasher film.The Attraction is fun; a bloody and gutsy and fun read. The reader is given an experience akin to watching a good slasher film. Can you remember the first time you watched Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Halloween, A Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th? You'd probably seen slasher films before, so you knew how it would all turn out because you knew the 'rules' that the genre obeyed. But you were still scared at times and, more importantly, you wanted to know how the story played out.You know those stupid kids will touch and feed Scratch and you probably even know what the aftermath of that foolish maneuver will be, but the heart of this book -- like the film counterpart -- is not in the twists and turns of the plot but rather in the gory details. And Douglas Clegg's The Attraction delivers."},{"Title":"The Attraction","review":"Both The Attraction and The Necromancer were originally released as limited edition novellas. They're expensive for readers who are not collectors or die-hard Clegg fans. This edition is great because both are amazing stories and together make a great book for those new to Clegg or fans.Clegg has a knack for creating compelling characters, sinister stories, and intriguing histories. Douglas Clegg is a master of the genre and perhaps one of the most reliable authors in the business.With this Leisure release, the reader has an opportunity to get their hands on the stories at a less expensive price. Although I highly recommend the beautiful limited editions, this mass market paperback is much easier for the general reader and this book will give two excellent stories the exposure they deserve.My personal favorite is the Necromancer because I love Harrow. I have gone on at great lengths about Harrow as more than a house. The world Clegg has created is staggering.Kudos to Clegg."},{"Title":"The Attraction","review":"The first time I became acquainted with Clegg's work was through this Harrow series with a novel called \\"Mischief\\" and let me tell you, the man can write! I still remember reading the book through the night and simply being unable to put it down. Just as with the other book, his writing is very smooth, easy to digest and simply impossible to put down. This book is really two short novels in one. The first being a 170 page story about an Aztec monster out for fresh blood in the desert and the second, an introduction to the Harrow series, about a man who was reborn as a monster with insatiable appetite for lust and sacrifices. Each one is so very different but it showcases Clegg's intense way of conjuring ideas and his ability to translate them into books that are easy to read. He's slowly becoming a staple on my bookshelf and I can always count on him for a fantastic mix of horror and fantasy that somehow feels real.The first story is called \\"The Attraction\\" and its strength relies on the sharp and spot on character development. I adored the relationships he build between the five friends who went on a road trip though the dry, hot desert, somehow getting stranded in middle of nowhere, close to danger. I got to like some, dislike others and then I got to read about them coming across an ancient Aztec mummy, said to be the scraper of the bones who drank the blood and danced for rain in the ancient times on top of the pyramids. Its no secret that something happens and the monstrum comes to life, what happens next is the real beauty of the story. Be prepared for some gruesome devouring, the tale is good but ends a little tame for my tastes. Overall I love the characters and enjoyed the imaginative new nemesis that I have never read about before.The second novel is about a very bad man who gets entangled in some very dark magic; it's a little intro to the wonderful Harrow series, about a haunted private school with many skeletons in its closet. It was a really dirty and intense story but really good at the same time, perhaps it's a good thing it was short because it was immensely dark and rich with truly horrific ideas.I engulfed this book over the weekend and can't wait to get back to reading some more of Clegg, he's a real diamond in the rough and his stories entertain both the mind and the imagination.- Kasia S."},{"Title":"The Attraction","review":"The Attraction, story #1, is a great little piece about 1970's teenagers opening an Aztec Pandora's box when they smash a glass case open and release a little mummy (Scratch) with a BIG mean streak. There are the teenage archetypes: the Stoner, the Intellectual, the Regular Guy, the Bimbo, the Jock and each gets time trying to escape the blood-thirsty mummy. This is a fun read and the development of characters, feel of the times, is great. The story, captivating at first, petters a bit out at the end and, would have liked to see MORE! MORE SCRATCH! The second part is a short intro into the Harrow series. It was an interesting character development, hero to villain type of story. I have read some of the Harrow stories and find it does not add that much, but a good little story nevertheless. Clegg again dishes out the entertainment for horror fans with these two offerings."},{"Title":"The Attraction","review":"The Attraction attracted me through the first half, but then fell off in a hurry. The Necromancer, however, attracted me from page one and left me wanting more. I could not have written a better story myself. The Necromancer is a definite 10 on my all-time short list of tens."},{"Title":"The Attraction","review":"Not the worst book in the world, but just pedestrian horror fare. The book is about college kids on a road trip that run afoul of an ancient mummy or curse or something. It was really too short to be called a novel but the publisher did add a little novella at the end to keep us from feeling truly ripped off. They shouldn't of bothered. This was much worse than Attraction. Called Necromancer, it was just plain dull. Truth be told, I couldn't finish it. I'm sure Clegg is capable of much better and I did read enough to give another book a chance. But this one was kind of a thowaway."},{"Title":"The Attraction","review":"ok Douglas Clegg strikes again with an hit. Although it really should be classified as a novella, it starts typically with college students on a road trip to Cali. They stumble across a roadside attraction that they accidently bring to life.Kind of reminiscent of the killer doll short trilogy with Karen Black (does anybody know what im talkin about?).Not really too in-depth of the how or why and the ending is kind of blah but overall quite a good read and recommended for Douglas Clegg fans.Bonus novella of Justin Gravesons'beginning of Harrow but lefting with a thirst for more."},{"Title":"The Attraction","review":"I enjoyed The Attraction a lot.

However, I'd have liked more to the story.I would have liked to know more about Scratch. I can't say what I specifically would like to know, because it would be a spoiler, but I was left with a question about him afterwards.The story could have been stretched out, but with more Scratch or Aztec stuff (not just the kids trying to get on to their destination), because it caught me off guard when I got to the end.

The only problem I had is that I didn't realize that the entire book wasn't The Attraction but rather only about 175 pages was. The rest is a novella called The Necromancer (this is about Harrow House, a book series of Clegg's that I have not read). However the writing skills of Clegg made The Attraction very interesting even if it wasn't very long. The story is a fast paced one about a group of 5 college students on a road trip. At a pit stop they come across a horrible attraction (The Skin Flayer) that eventually makes their trip a nightmare. Material of this nature has been covered in books and movies before, but Clegg's story-telling adds something fresh. His writing is way above average and he manages to make a somewhat predictable plot still fun to read. Since this book only took me a couple hours to read I would say you've got nothing to lose by reading it. I think I will probably read more of Clegg's books."},{"Title":"The Attraction","review":"This is campy, easy writing at its finest. That's not a good thing. Clegg keeps the pace up in this short novel but really doesn't offer much else. Its not a thinking man's horror novel i.e. most of King's novels. Its a shallow, short, campy story about a bunch of college kids on a trip trough the west. The story doesn't have any beef to it. A good read for a plane ride. Not so good if you want depth."},{"Title":"The Attraction","review":"THE ATTRACTION/THE NECROMANCER by Douglas CleggReview by Nickolas CookThe novelette format is a tricky business for a writer. Too short, and a reader can feel as if it's been rushed and incomplete. Too long, and it becomes perplexing as to why it wasn't left as a novel instead. But Clegg handles the format admirably with his newest release from Leisure, \\"The Attraction\\". He gives enough back story and characterization to keep the pace moving along, as he makes use of Native American folklore and even cleverly references the infamous Southwestern tourist trap, \\"The Thing\\" (anyone who's ever traveled I-10 through the desert knows of which attraction I speak).Clegg takes the idea of a cheapjack tourist hustle for a decrepit gas station in the middle of nowhere, Arizona and turns it into a terrifying quick punch of horror for his readers, as a group of college drifters make a run across the country and find themselves the unwitting targets of an ancient creature in need of flesh and blood. I found myself cringing in parts as his descriptive passages covered me in dust and sweat, blood and gore. A thoroughly enjoyable B-movie ride. And if you live in the desert, as I do, the end sentence is chilling, for it is happening even now.But the story isn't without flaws. Clegg tends to use some distractingly flippant prose here and there, a little too avuncular in parts, and glosses over some of the death scenes in less than a sentence or two. Which deflates his hard won characterizations. There should be a stolid rule in horror literature: if you're going to take all that time making us care for the characters we should see their deaths. Morbid, yes; but expected by most horror readers.And no less wonderful reading is the second novella part of this Leisure issue, \\"The Necromancer\\", part of the ongoing Harrow House saga. I was astounded that Clegg hadn't found this style of writing before now. It was like reading a cross between the Marquis DeSade and Charles Dickens, as a poor Irish lad is drawn into a world of evil and darkness in the mean streets of old London. His prose is scintillatingly brilliant in parts and I was sucked right into this squalid tale of black magic. If for no other reason, the book is worth this little gem of horror literature. I plead with Clegg to consider writing a complete novel using this first person narrative in the way Dickens once did. \\"The Necromancer\\" adds yet another piece in the puzzle of the Harrow House and keeps you wanting more.--Nickolas Cook"},{"Title":"The Attraction","review":"If you are a goth, you will love this book; it will be a 4 star.

However, if you have even passing knowledge of the case, or at least have seen the movie, you wouldn't make that mistake. The person on the cover of this book, Heriberto \\"Eddie\\" Saeda (The New York Zodiac copycat) is clearly too young to be the Zodiac, who was always described as 30s, or even in his 40s, and who was a chubby white guy; clearly different than the trim, hispanic Saeda. Also, this picture and case came from the 1990s, so anyone would know that the Zodiac from San Francisco, even if he was only in his 20s during his active period, would be in his 50s or 60s already.Now that that's out of the way, let's get to this book: It is a little brief, and doesn't have a satisfying ending, mostly because it was written before the trial of Saeda concluded, but other than that, it was a very good read. This is one of only known copycat cases out there; they happen in the movies a lot but not so much in real life. It's a very interesting case. The New York Zodiac isn't as mysterious, or clever as the original, but he is just as brutal in his ways. One of the most intriguing aspects is how Saeda constructed his own guns, and also how he was able to actually kill people by their astrological signs (making him a more true zodiac killer.)Just because he is a copycat doesn't make his story less interesting; in fact the original zodiac was just a copycat. He got his name and famous crosshairs symbol from a watch; and his outfit and even some of his writings were knockoffs from the book and film of Most Dangerous Game.I wish this book had been finished after the trial, so it could contain a proper ending, however, everything up to the ending makes for a thrilling read"},{"Title":"Sleep My Little Dead : The True Story of the Zodiac Killer","review":"Heriberto &quot;Eddie&quot; Seda is a close proximity of the &quot;Zodiac Killer&quot; of the 60's, the story is quite good, if you get past the fact that Eddie acted quite normal, if you're into True Crime, this one is in the Top 10 of my favorite list."},{"Title":"Sleep My Little Dead : The True Story of the Zodiac Killer","review":"I have not read this book but when I came across it at the book store one day I immediately recognized that the author uses the notoriety of the San Francisco Zodiac murders as his selling point.

Sackville-West's record of her journey by rail and road from London to Iran in the 1920s will delight you. Her sensibility as a novelist and poet enrich this book of impressions and her strong personality shines through every comment on her adventures. Ms. West follows a meandering and leisurely land route to the Near East from England and, later, returns via Mother Russia, using all means available at the time: automobile, train, donkey, camel, and her own two feet. She braves bandits in the mountain passes of Iran; street beggars in Baghdad, English travelers who dismay and bore her at every turn. She conveys the pageantry of Iranian royalty during a Coronation; surveys the ancient landscape and ruins of Persian gardens on her tramps through the mountainsides of Tehran.

On the subject of September 11 he is deeply moving, his articles on this subject brought tears to my eyes. he can just as easily make you laugh, he's hysterically funny on the subject of the 'brutal Afghan winter' among other things.

There isn't a false note in his prose, and even if you don't subscribe to his warmongering right-wing madman bigotted homophobic ... am I leaving anything out? -- I quote from memory his own self-description ... oh! intolerant views, you can still admire the clarity and self-assurance of his style.My own wonderful son is now serving in the US military, and I'm sending him my copy of Steyn's book, just to help my own wonderful son (do I repeat myself? I am vast!) stay focused on the whole point: if it is to be Jihad vs Crusade (and it seems that it is), we have to know which side of the line ... or should I say \\"razor\\" ... we're on ... or should I say \\"box-cutter\\"?There is a folk tale, variously attributed, about the fox that is persuaded to carry a scorpion on its back across a river. \\"Oh, I surely will not strike you with my venomnous tail,\\" assures the scorpion, \\"for then I too would drown.\\" But halfway across, the scorpion does indeed sting the fox, and as they both flounder, the fox reproaches the betraying creature. Its reply came thus: \\"It is true that I too shall perish. But I am a scorpion, and to strike is my nature.\\" How Islam is practiced by the vast majority of its adherents is as it may be. But its nature is Jihad.In any case, Steyn is laugh-out-loud funny, and there is hardly a page that doesn't have some master-trope that just makes you shake your head and wish you'd thought of it first (I just pretend to myself that I did). It may be that even those on the far left would be convinced, if such a thing were possible. In short, a whole-hearted recommendation ... and did I mention my son is wonderful?"},{"Title":"The Face of the Tiger","review":"Particularly here in the People's Republic of Canada.

But in the end they saw none of that: to them, he was an American, a Jew, a trophy. So they set a trap.\\" (p. 185). Daniel Pearl was beheaded by his captors. Mark Steyn sites what went wrong and how others think they, too, can \\"ride the tiger.\\"THE FACE OF THE TIGER is a gathering of columns written by Mark Steyn in the year immediately after 9/11. With his dry humor and enlightening eye for revealing overlooked details, Mark Steyn is at his best and most intense in the year immediately following, and focused on, 9/11.In Mark's December 14, 2001 entry, he points out the illogic, or weird reasoning, of a western writer who was attacked by a Muslim mob, yet blamed the west in general, instead of his attackers in particular, seemingly because Muslims supposedly have a moral right to attack westerners and the west!\\"By comparison, every argument the enlightened progressives over on the anti-war side make has at its core the basic proposition that these people are primitives, animals: they are no more culpable for tearing you apart than a pack of hyenas would be... the intellectual assault being waged by the extreme left is explicitly racist.\\" (p. 138)THE FACE OF THE TIGER is full of interesting observations from Mark Steyn, in his popular style and wit mostly, and it is more focused on world politics than other books by Mark, before his bestselling breakthrough with AMERICA ALONE. He makes and supports many interesting thoughts.In Mark's June 1, 2002 piece in THE SPECTATOR, \\"Flying while Arab,\\" Mark asks the question, \\"Does political correctness kill?\\" and then Steyn describes how, before 9/11, the famous actor James Woods witnessed and reported what appeared to be a dry run practice for a hijacking. The FAA did nothing, seemingly because of then recent cases of suspects crying foul due to racial discrimination appearing in the national news. Yet two of the four suspects witnessed by James Wood ended up being perpetrators on the 9/11 hijacked planes.*** On the tensions between the entire Middle East versus Israel, Steyn says:\\"For the squalid thug regimes of the region, giving the impression to their hapless peoples that they're engaged in an epic struggle with the Jews helps excuse their own failures as nation states.\\" (p. 122)\\"In the objective sense, the Arab states are failures. If Israel was \`imposed' on the region in the Forties, the other nations date only from the Twenties. The only difference is the Jews have made a go of it. Both Israel and Egypt get massive subventions from Washington: Egypt, an economic basket-case, pisses it away; Israel is now a net technology exporter.\\" (p. 143)\\"Jews are famously \`in trade', Arabs are just as famously hopeless at economic creativity: they have oil, but require foreigners to extract it and refine it.\\" (p. 141)\\"Meanwhile, the schools teach children about the heroics of the suicide-bombers and in geography class Israel has been literally wiped off the maps.\\" (p. 123)\\"Say what you want about the Jews, but they don't sit around on welfare.\\" (p. 144)\\"the only Arabs living in freedom are the two million who live in the United States...Europe and, come to that, Israel. ...'multiculturalism', but let us acknowledge at least that it's a unicultural concept: it exists only in the west.\\" (p. 31)*** On the USA's importance in the world, Mark Steyn writes:\\"If America falls, or is diminished, or retreats in on itself, there is no \`free world'.\\" (p. 24)\\"Just a quarter-century ago, let's not forget, most of southern Europe -- Portugal, Spain, Greece -- was run by dictators.\\" (p. 25)\\"The only thing that enables Belgium to be Belgium and Norway to be Norway and Britain to be Britain is the fact that America's America...\\" (p. 172)\\"Americans know what they contribute: they're the engine of the global economy and the pre-eminent military power. But Canada and Europe expect the US to pick up the tab for their defence costs and yet still treat them as serious players.\\" (p. 181)\\"But America is also an historical anomaly: the first non-imperial superpower. It has no colonies and no desire for any. For almost 60 years, it's paid for the defence of the west virtually single-handed while creating and supporting structures -- the UN, Nato, G8 -- that exist only to allow its \`allies' to pretend they're on an equal footing. For \`allies', read dependencies: it's because the US provides generous charity defence guarantees that the European governments have been free to fritter away their revenues on socialised health care and lavish welfare and all the other entitlements the Euro-progressives berate America for not providing for its own citizens.\\" (p. 300)\\"The sides the United States and the European Union have chosen to align themselves with say as much about themselves and their own psychological health as they do about Palestine.\\" (p. 145).*** On the War on Terror, Mark Steyn observes:\\"Under our new high-alert procedures, security personnel demonstrate their sensitivity by looking for people who don't look anything like the people they're looking for. Never in the field of human conflict have so many been so inconvenienced to avoid offending so few.\\" (p. 114)\\"The only countries who aren't with us are the basket-cases -- Iraq, the Sudan, Cuba, North Korea -- a handful of irrelevant loser states who contribute nothing, economically, culturally, technologically. We are at war with the world's losers. And losers tend to lose.\\" (p. 95)\\"If we've learned anything since September 11th, it's that, if it were left to the multilateral acronyms -- the UN, EU, even Nato -- Osama bin Laden would have the run of the planet.\\" (p.91)*** Domestically speaking in the USA, Mark Steyn speaks as well:\\"The reason why there are so many plays and TV movies about Matthew Shepard is because what happened to him three years ago is so rare: he's a poster-child for an epidemic that doesn't exist.\\" (p. 57)After you have read Mark Steyn's bestseller AMERICA ALONE, make this book, THE FACE OF THE TIGER, your next read by him!America Alone: The End of the World as We Know ItAnother book by Mark Steyn that I unfortunately do NOT recommend is HEAD TO TOE, which is as much about show business and celebrity obituaries as it is about world politics, so I did not enjoy it as much as the weightier material in AMERICA ALONE and THE FACE OF THE TIGER.Mark Steyn From Head To Toe: An Anatomical Anthology"},{"Title":"The Face of the Tiger","review":"Fantastic, awesome, outstanding!He writes about serious subjects in an hysterically funny and witty manner.Mark Steyn is Da Man!"},{"Title":"The Face of the Tiger","review":"This book is essentially an anthology of Steyn's columns dating back to 9-11.What is accomplished in this collection is reminding the reader of the thoughts and mis-conceptions that abounded in those frantic and uncertain days following the greatest incident of terrorism to reach U.S. shores.Steyn is, as always, witty and insightful.

In this volume, he strays from the more commonly known tales, and instead publishes a collection of exotic tales from Muslim/Hindu countries. I've never heard many of the PLOTS before, and we all know that many fairy tales share common plots. These tales are surprisingly different, and delightfully enjoyable. Anyone who is tired of the traditional Europeon tales that, while still fantastic, are just too well known, this book is a wonderful addition to anyone who enjoys folklore. The pictures are amazing, too."},{"Title":"The olive fairy book","review":"Andrew Lang ultimately edited 12 colored fairy books. He was one of the first editors to collect multicultural fairy tales into one volume for readers. The Olive Fairy Book offers tales from many lands. Included tales are The Blue Parrot, The Boy Who Found Fear At Last, Diamond cut Diamond, The Five Wise Words of the Guru, Geirlaug the King's Daughter, and many others. These books should also be opened for H. J. Ford's wonderful black and white illustrations. END"},{"Title":"The olive fairy book","review":"This book of fairy tales, coming from Turkey, India, Denmark, Armenia, and the Sudan, opens you up to an entirely different culture and I enjoyed every page. I would also suggest reading this to children just as every fairy tale book to open them up to ideas of other ways of life (and also allow their imagination to run wild!) The drawings are also beautiful and fit the book perfectly."},{"Title":"The olive fairy book","review":"In the late 19th century, historian, scholar, and anthropologist, Andrew Lang, began publishing collections of fairy tales from around the world. The first volume was \`The Blue Fairy Book' published in 1887. Lang was not a true ethnologist, like the German Brothers Grimm. He was far more the \`translator' than collector of tales from the source, stories transcribed from being told by people to whom the tales were passed down by word of mouth. In fact, many stories in his first volume, such as Rumpelstiltskin; Snow White; Sleeping Beauty; Cinderella; and Hansel and Gretel were translated from Grimm's books of fairy tales. Some of his \`fairy tales' were even \`copied from relatively recent fantasy fiction, such as A Voyage to Lilliput, the first of the four episodes in Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels.My inspiration for commenting Lang's series of fairy tale books is for the sheer quantity of tales, the wonderful woodcut illustrations, some few of which may have become almost as popular as the tales (although not quite in the same league as Sir John Tenniel's illustrations for Lewis Carroll's great fantasies), and the fact that I had these when I was young.With twelve of these books, with between 30 and 36 stories in each book, this gives one about 400 different stories. If I were to recommend anything as standard equipment at a grandparents' house, it would be a complete set of these books.Needless to say, there are a few \`warnings' to accompany books assembled over 100 years ago. You will encounter a fair number of words with which even an adult may be unfamiliar, let alone a five year old. For example, on the second page of The Princess Mayblossom in The Red Fairy Book, a character puts sulfur in a witch's porridge. This requires at least three explanations. What is sulfur, what is porridge, and why is sulfur in porridge such a bad thing. More difficult still is when a prince entered the town on a white horse which \`pranced and caracoled to the sound of the trumpets'. In 19th century London, caracoling (making half turns to the right and the left) was probably as common and as well known as \`stepping on the gas' is today. But, if you're a grandparent, that's half the fun, explaining new words and ideas to the young-uns.There is another \`danger' which may require just a bit more explanation, although in today's world of crime dramas on TV, I'm not sure that most kids are already totally immune to being shocked by death and dead bodies. In these stories, lots of people and creatures get killed in very unpleasant ways, and lots of very good people and creatures suffer in very unpleasant ways. It's ironic that the critics in Lang's own time felt the stories were 'unreality, brutality, and escapism to be harmful for young readers, while holding that such stories were beneath the serious consideration of those of mature age'. The success of a whole library of Walt Disney feature length cartoons based on these stories is a testament to how well they work with children. But do be warned, Uncle Walt did clean things up a bit. Lang's versions hold back on very little that was ugly and unpleasant in some of these stories.The down side to the great quantity of stories is that even when some come from very different parts of the world, there is a remarkable amount of overlap in theme, plot, and characters. But by the time you get to another story of a beautiful young girl mistreated by a stepmother, it will have been several month since you read Cinderella or the Little Glass Slipper in The Blue Fairy Book. The other side of the coin is that you can play the game of trying to recall what that other story was with a similar theme.There is one very big word of caution about buying these books through Amazon or a similar on line outlet. I stopped counting when I got to twelve different editions of The Blue Fairy Book, or a volume including several of these books. Not all of these editions have the original woodcuts and even worse, not all have a table of contents and introduction. The one publisher which has all twelve volumes is by Dover. Other publishers, such as Flying Chipmunk Publishing (yes, that's it's name) also have all the original illustrations, table of contents, and introduction, but I'm not certain that publisher has all twelve volumes. Dover most certainly does, as I just bought all twelve of them from Amazon.While I suspect these stories may have been \`old hat' for quite some time, it may be that with the popularity of Lord of the Rings, the Narnia stories, and the Harry Potter stories, all of which have their share of suffering and death, that these may be in for a revival. Again, the main attraction is that for relatively little money and space, Grammy and Grandad get a great resource for bonding with children."},{"Title":"The olive fairy book","review":"This is not an early childhood fairytale collection.

Not only does it contain the records of approximately 40,000 marriages with references to about a quarter-million individuals, it also draws information from a body of sources altogether unique in genealogy. Unlike other published lists of marriages, traditionally based on parish registers, ministers' returns, and marriage bonds, this work derives from Bible records and references found in wills, deeds, court suits, and orphans' court records, as well as the traditional sources just named. The result is a collection of marriage records that is both comprehensive and unique.As a rule the marriage records relate to three classes of people: (1) those who were married before settling in Virginia; (2) those who were married in Virginia; and (3) those who married after moving from Virginia to another colony or state (absolutely essential for determining the colonial origins of ancestors who removed to states like Kentucky, the Carolinas, Georgia, Tennessee, Missouri, and Indiana).Most items are a composite of data found in various records. In general, each entry consists of some or all of the following: names of bride and groom, date and place of marriage, names of parents, sureties and bondsmen, place of residence, and a specific source citation. Brides and grooms are listed in a single alphabetical sequence; all other persons mentioned in the records are indexed separately.EDITORIAL REVIEWS\\"...researchers are indebted to Ms. Wulfeck who, over many years, industriously accumulated evidence of marriage...\\"--THE VIRGINIA GENEALOGICAL SOCIETY NEWSLETTER, p. 11.\\"...these two volumes constitute a gold mine.\\"--THE AMERICAN GENEALOGIST, Vol. 61, No. 4.\\"...it is valuable for providing clues for further research.\\"--NATIONAL GENEALOGICAL SOCIETY QUARTERLY, Vol. 74, No. 1."},{"Title":"Henrietta Goes West","review":"Three children, a crazy great aunt and uncle, and an even crazier car set out on a roadtrip west.

Padgett is a scrupulous researcher, so I am always certain that what I am learning in her books is authentic. And I admire her great concern with and commitment to integrity, honor, honesty,compassion, and justice. Her absolutely wickely fabulous sense of humor is highlighted in this new series in a way that makes me laugh remembering a couple of the funniest scenes I've ever read. I agree with an earlier reviewer who commented that the book transcends the genre -- while at the same time fulfilling all that we mystery lovers crave from the genre. I think this is a tremendously important feminist novel. I can't wait until BLUE comes out in paperback because then I will be able to afford to make it the chief gift item to share with women friends for birthdays and Christmas/Chanukah for that year. To men friends, I will be giving etiquette books for the next few years, inspired, as those of you who have read BLUE already will understand, by this memorable mystery."},{"Title":"Blue","review":"I bought this book on a 'gamble' when it was in the amazon.com Bargain bin and really enjoyed it.

As neither a rampant feminist or a lesbian, I found this twist to be a simple character feature rather than the driving force of the whole book. Well written, it pulled me through the whole plot in less than a couple days. Hard to put down!"},{"Title":"Blue","review":"BLUE is a wonderful read. I found myself laughing and cheering as it unfolds. It's militantly feminist, compassionate, humorous, well-written, suspenseful and action-packed. I bought it in hardcover, and I don't usually, but I knew I would want to read it again."},{"Title":"Blue","review":"Oh my goddess...Blue McCarron, Ph.D. is one hot character. A recluse out in her desert hotel, Blue and her wonder dog Bronte (loved Bronte). Blue has many skeletons in her closet...Misha, the woman she loved who one day disappeared. Her aunt, Carty, is acting mysteriously and there's the necklace Blue's seen before. The mending of her relationship with her twin brother David, who in prison, but is getting married. And there's Muffin Crandall's friends who are being picked off one at a time by someone unknown. Blue and Bronte survive many encounters in the desert with some unsavory characters. Her new friends BB and Rox are better friends than she knew. Beautifully written with character and environmental development."},{"Title":"Blue","review":"I have been following the Bo Bradley books from the beginning, since they combine several topics of interest to me: Native Americans, Child Welfare, and bi-polar disease. I run around giving copies to people who I would like to have understand these issues. When I got &quot;Blue&quot; my first reaction was momentary disappointment because it wasn't a Bo Bradley book. But, as I read, I quickly became entranced. I agree entirely with her analysis of human behaviour in terms of chimpanzee (NOT gorilla) behaviour. I am a 64-year-old cultural anthropologist, and as every new chimp study has come in, over the last 20 years, I have seen clearly how closely human behaviour is tied to our genes. It has discouraged me greatly. Padgett's riotous take on it has cheered me up. As for those who can't take the lesbian side of the story, it's a love story, for pete's sake! Love stories are not tied to gender or gender preference. What I hate is lesbian mysteries which ape certain male mysteries, serving as excuses for soft (or not so soft) porn. Like &quot;Cathy&quot; (comic strip): I spent the first half of my life learning everything I could about men; now I'm spending the last half trying to forget it. I will look forward to another book in this series. Don't forget Bo, tho!"},{"Title":"Blue","review":"Padgett's Blue McCarron is so well-written and has such an unusual mind and point of view that I hope she becomes an ongoing character in other novels. The novel's plot is interesting and was sufficiently complex to keep me interested from start to finish. I am recommending this book to everyone I know."},{"Title":"Blue","review":"The Bo Bradley books are great; with 'Blue' the author has managed to create what sounds like a great mystery while at the same time telling the story in such an off putting manner that it is a struggle to get through even a few pages. It is NOT the orientation of the female lead that is the problem but rather the excessive psychobabble that fills Blue's mind. After the first 3 chapters, I decided that dedicated mystery reader though I am, I didn't really care whodunit. Please, more Bo!! No more Blue!!"},{"Title":"Blue","review":"I love the personal challenge aspect of Padgett's books; heroes that proceed without regard to personal jeopardy, staying true to their moral principles. Blue is such a character and I am really hoping that now that the initial book has detailed her ENTIRE feminist theory (she's a Ph.D. that parallels gorilla behavior to human) we can proceed with a more coherant mystery. I am also not all that interested in lesbian life and would like it to become only (?) a characteristic of Blue not the focal point of each story.All in all - I liked the book and will read futher in this character series BUT I really miss Bo Bradly!"},{"Title":"Blue","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Blue, filled with suspense and humor. The characters were diverse and interesting, each filling his/her role superbly. The complicated plot with its many twists and turns kept me guessing until the very end. Padgett is quite the wordsmith and writes with intelligence and passion. Move over, Sue Grafton, Abigail Padgett is here!"},{"Title":"Blue","review":"Blue McCarron is a character that rewards fans of both gay/lesbian fiction, and general mystery/suspense fiction. She's complex, intelligent, and real. You don't forgive Blue her faults, you are drawn to her because of them. Blue takes us on a roller-coaster ride through an old crime, some old relationships, and some new ones. Aside from the suspense at the heart of the novel, is a rich and unforgettable cast of characters who leave us longing for the next in the Blue McCarron series."},{"Title":"Blue","review":"I loved the previous books with Bo Bradley and really looked forward to this. Unfortunately the main character is a flake. I was also put off by the lesbian angle and though I tried to be open minded about it, it was just too much in your face. I hope this was just an experiment and we can see more of Bo Bradley."},{"Title":"Blue","review":"Abigail Padgett's new series is introduced by the remarkable novel, BLUE, which should become a classic. BLUE rises above genre to become what is, in my opinion, the best feminist novel ever written in the United States. Neither a whiney attack on men nor a separatist utopia, BLUE presents a world view that challenges the male and female of the species to escape the primal ape-like behavior that often threatens personal relationships as well as the fabric of society.Set in the scorching desert of Southern California, a frozen body melts into a complex plot that only a writer of Padgett's skill could pull together. Her protagonist is a dropout lesbian psychologist whose insights into human personality include an explanation of the art of shopping that is a must read for all women who insist on taking their menfolk shopping and for all men who desperately need to explain to the women in their lives why they don't, won't, and can't enjoy a day at the mall.BLUE is solidly scripted and enchantingly amusing. Populating the story's background is a group of women who, being post-menopausal, become figuratively invisible when they lunch together. By the final chapter the best of human nature triumphs, however temporarily, with the help of a caring brother, a line-dancing psychiatrist, and a fashion designing ex-con.I know the ending, but still I want to re-read the book because I loved the characters so much that I miss them."},{"Title":"Blue","review":"I had never read any of Abigail Padgett's books before finding Blue. I was really surprised by how good this book was. I couldn't wait to get on the train for my daily commute (my prime reading time, despite being prone to motion sickness). Nausea aside, I'll be reading the next Blue book tomorrow morning!"},{"Title":"Blue","review":"Blue was a lot of fun to read. After getting confused in the first 40 or so pages, trying to keep up with Padgett's tangents and non sequitars, finally the plot began. Then it got riveting and fun. And the humor is great. I laughed out loud many times.It is a woman-centered, pro-women book and that is fine. Can't wait to read the next book in the series and hope that Padgett keeps on adding more books to it. Don't want to write more or it'll give away the conclusion but this is a book many women will want to read. And it makes good points as well as being a good read."},{"Title":"Blue","review":"Oh my goddess...Blue McCarron, Ph.D. is one hot character. A recluse out in her desert hotel, Blue and her wonder dog Bronte (loved Bronte). Blue has many skeletons in her closet...Misha, the woman she loved who one day disappeared. Her aunt, Carty, is acting mysteriously and there's the necklace Blue's seen before. The mending of her relationship with her twin brother David, who in prison, but is getting married. And there's Muffin Crandall's friends who are being picked off one at a time by someone unknown. Blue and Bronte survive many encounters in the desert with some unsavory characters. Her new friends BB and Rox are better friends than she knew. Beautifully written with character and environmental development."},{"Title":"Blue","review":"Blue McCarron is hired by a man whose older sister Muffin has been arrested for murdering a man five years ago and hiding his body in a public freezer. Muffin has confessed, but Blue doesn't buy the confession. Blue is still mourning the disappearance of her lover Misha two years ago, and likes getting the money, but she ends up with more than she can handle when Muffin is murdered in prison and Blue is targetted next. It's a thoroughly enjoyable ride, but the mystery elements get baffling fast and while this could certainly derail many readers, I found Padgett's witty characters and exciting style drew me further in. Like Laurie King's &quot;Night work&quot; and Lauren Maddison's &quot;Witchfire&quot;, there's a strong feminist thread through the story that educates as it entertains. And while the density of the convoluted mystery plot annoyed me until the very end, I highly recommend this book, and I can hardly wait to read the next in the series."},{"Title":"Blue","review":"Having loved the Bo Bradley series, I had high hopes for this book... and it easily surpassed them all. Again, Padgett has created a protagonist with an idiosyncratic and fully realized human consciousness. Blue McCarron isn't merely a smart, funny, educated and thoughtful person whom I'd like to know; she's someone whom, after reading this book, I believe I DO know. The plot elements in this book fit together a little too neatly, I think, but I don't really care--and neither has any of the many other people into whose hands I've pressed this book. I'm looking forward to seeing much more of Blue."},{"Title":"Blue","review":"After 5 Bo Bradley mysteries Padgett has set out on a new, yet similar course. Both Bo and Blue view life from a sociological/psychological perspective and there is a stong concern for people with mental illness throughout. Both find themselves in situations that they do not like or can not make sense of, and, as each gets progressively more involved, the tension builds. In neither case are we treated to a group of clues that are available to reveal the solution. Instead, each woman, led on by a head-stong tendancy to pursue what seems right, becomes progressively more involved with a series of characters. Neither friend nor enemy can disuade them, and after many plot twists, they uncover the &quot;haunted past.&quot; There are also noticable differences between the two. While there were important gay characters in Padgett's earlier books, Bo was heterosexual. While Blue has had sex with men, she clearly has come to prefer women, and Padgett seems more comfortable writing love (not sex) scenes involving women. The lesbians here are woman-loving, rather than man-hating; although men are often tweaked, they should not find themselves &quot;bashed&quot;. Padgett writes very well; there is humor as well as social commentary and adventure. Once the &quot;chase&quot; begins, the book is very hard to put down. I hope there will be more."},{"Title":"Blue","review":"A side effect of a minor earthquake that recently rocked the San Diego area was to disarm the timer of a public food locker just outside the desert town of Borrego Springs. With the hundred plus degree temperatures pulsating on the faulty freezer, a body begins to thaw out. A widow, sixty-one-year old Muffin Crandall confesses that five years ago she killed, mutilated, and froze an intruder breaking into her home.Muffin's much younger brother, Dan, refuses to believe that his sibling killed the man. For a sizable fee, he hires social psychologist Dr. B. McCarron (better known as Blue among her friends and relatives) to see if she can somehow refute the confession by analyzing his sister. After meeting the raucous Muffin in prison, Blue is convinced the woman is too smart and experienced to have dispatched a body in the place that the victim was found. This leaves Blue wondering why an obviously intelligent and hard-woking woman like Muffin would confess to a crime! she did not commit. Blue's investigation soon places her life in jeopardy as she tangles with a female conspiracy that forces her to dig deep into her gut in order to survive.BLUE is an interesting who-done-it, fully constructed around a viable, courageous, and gay heroine, who will steal the heart and soul of readers. The mystery is fun and exciting, but in the final analysis, the author of the exciting Bo Bradley series, Abigail Padgett, has imbued her new series with a feminist who will leave fans feeling blue if more works are not soon released.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Blue","review":"First of two (so far) in the &quot;Blue McCarron&quot; series. The book introduces us to Blue who is a Social Physcologist hired to evaluate an elderly woman who's been arrested for murder when a man's body is discovered in the old woman's rented food locker.The plot twists &amp; turns from there. I enjoyed the set up, characters and sub plots. I particularly liked how Padgett interwove the physcological makeup of male species and behaviors and their effect on women's culture, throughout the book. In fact, I found her theories and poignant insights interesting as well as thought provoking. Regardless of your literary detection skills this is a good read for mystery buffs of all levels.

These books are not like \`The Joy of Cooking' or \`James Beard's American Cookery' where you get a lot of advice on cuts of meat, types of potatoes, and techniques for making an especially good pie crust. This type of book contains mostly bare bones recipes. They are one of the most common to find on the discount pile in the Borders foyer.But, this book is a little different from most books of this class.First, it is a collection of recipes from Craig Claiborne and Pierre Franey, and that is something special. As Paul Prudhomme states in his introduction, Craig Claiborne is one of the three most influential figures in American culinary writing in the last fifty years, along with James Beard and Julia Child. I suspect Claiborne's influence worked as much or more behind the scenes and may be less durable than the works of Beard and Child. What was public was almost entirely done in daily newspaper columns and reviews. Much of his other work was in the support of charity events and in the support of the careers of up and coming journalists such as Jim Villas and chefs such as Jeremiah Tower.Second, this collection gains cachet by being the best of newspaper columns in the New York Times. Some very discerning editors picked them over at least twice. First, they were selected to appear in the paper. Then, they were selected from the best of these to appear in this book.Third, the variety of dishes in this book is outstanding. The range of dishes is far better than, for example, a collection of 1000 Chinese dishes or the best 800 Jewish recipes. These come from around the world, from some of the best chefs in the world. My favorite finds are recipes culled from Danny Kaye, who has the reputation of being quite literally one of the finest Chinese cooks in the world, in his time. The sad fact is that the only remains of that talent are in the occasional recipe in collections such as this.Fourth, unlike earlier large \`New York Times' cookbooks edited by Claiborne, these recipes contain headnotes citing the source of the recipe and tips on their execution. The book also gives an excellent index of recipes by contributor, which is the way in which I was able to locate the recipes from Mr. Kaye. I'm certain these headnotes came from the newspaper articles in which the recipes were embedded.If you like to have access to a large variety of dishes but do not wish to have a large cookbook library, this is the book for you. The closest competitor to this book may be \`The New New York Times Cookbook' that has even more recipes, but no headnotes. This was my first cookbook and I believe every recipe I made from it was sound.Highly recommended for all, especially those with a budget."},{"Title":"Best of Craig Claiborne: 1,000 Recipes from His New York Times Food Columns and Four of His Classic Cookbooks","review":"When in doubt about a particular recipe, I always turn to this book.

I'm a very busy man. I'm not important, I'm just busy. I only read novels during my summer holidays beside a swimming pool somewhere very warm. Somebody told me I had to read '11 Emerald Street' so I gave in to temptation and reluctantly abandoned marking mounds of exercise books and writing politically correct, positively motivating, reports on two hundred teenagers' academic progress.Eight hours later I was fecken knackered. For the uninitiated, this is an Irish technical term describing a level of exhaustion reached when you're still reading at three in the morning even though you know you have to go tearing down the motorway at 6.55am to beat the worst excesses of the traffic at the M60/M61 Interchange.I couldn't put the book down. I was pulled into the pages of the story and transported back to the Dublin of my childhood forty years ago. You're hooked from the very first page. Our hero, Robbie is sat in class and his teacher, Brother Finch, is a terrifying bully about to pounce on any poor eejet who looks crooked at him. If you haven't sat in a class like that, you haven't lived. Robbie survives to take us on a journey through the streets of Dublin and lets us peep into the world of his family, friends and enemies. The Demon Drink is ever present but somehow manages to avoid brutalising the story or stereotyping half the nation.Hugh O'Donnell's skill in story-telling is that he remembers the little things we've long since forgotten and he brings them back to life in minute detail, almost in a stream of consciousness technique. At times he is weaving little anecdotes together to make sure we see Robbie and his family as real three-dimensional characters, the next minute he's painting detailed word-pictures of the whole neighbourhood.Robbie's most endearing quality is the fact that he accurately recounts events for us so that we fully understand golliwogs and other facts of life, but he hasn't the foggiest idea of the deeper significance of the observations he makes. He is an innocent abroad and consequently causes havoc wherever he goes.Humour leaps out at you. In fact, most of the time it's controlled, steady, but now and again, it catches you unawares and leaves you in hysterics. Wait 'til you read about the live goose in the parcel from Wexford...And that's another startling thing that Hugh O'Donnell has done. He's captured the special relationship between the Dublin city dwellers and their families down the country. Those of us who emigrate to foreign shores leave behind our country and our loved ones. The move to Dublin from a farm in Kerry or Wexford is an equally traumatic and lonely experience. The writer gently touches on this theme and reminds us that the lines of communication between city and farm are still wide open.Robbie's life is turned up side down when he suffers a head injury. His near-death experience has transformed him - he believes with a religious fervour that he has healing hands and he enthusiastically sets out to lay hands on those who need curing.I got a bit of a fright at this point in the story. Was the author indulging in a little 'magic realism', was he asking us to suspend disbelief whilst he took the Irish novel to new areas? Had he created what a fella called Barth referred to as 'a text of bliss', a piece so difficult it almost defies comprehension? Rest easy, Hugh O'Donnell's feet are firmly on the ground. Robbie has total belief in his powers but to some extent, you're allowed to interpret the events in the rest of the story anyway you want. The humour remains but alongside the hilarity comes reality in the shape of suffering, often too close to Robbie for our comfort. If you want to know any more, buy the blooming book...I loved the story because Hugh O'Donnell accurately re-creates the Dublin of the period, with its poverty, humour and its strength. It made me laugh, it made me think, it upset me. It allows fun to live alongside tragedy and permits our hero to grow up despite his best attempts to remain innocent. Buy the book now, especially if you have children at school. In a few short years, it will be on the secondary school Literature Syllabus in the English-speaking world and you can tell your hooligans you read it with weeks of it hitting the shops.Well done, Hugh O'Donnell. don't publish anything for a few months.

Beauty is not what you own, whom you know, but what you bring to the world and who you are. How can you be a beautiful neurosurgeon and write this well. It is simply not fair !!!!"},{"Title":"Zenzele: A Letter for My Daughter","review":"This Book is definately Top NOtch, I hope the Writer goes very far in Life, because i am delighted by her Style.I advice all and sundry to buy this book and enjoy a touching story of a Mother advising her daughter about the way of the World and what it is to her to be an African."},{"Title":"Zenzele: A Letter for My Daughter","review":"I was really impressed with this work, and I would recomend it to anyone who had an interest in Africa, but definately to any mother or daughter.

The daughter has just left for her first year of college that is located in a society that is much different from her own, Harvard. The mother is overwhelmed as well as overjoyed with her daughter leaving, and is writing her a letter to express her feelings. The mother describes many different stories that helped shape ZenZele, and the many different experiences that she herself went through that helped her discover what life is all about. The letter is almost like a gift, the greatest gift a mother could give to her daughter. The letter describes many different things worth sharing with her daughter, the experiences that have helped her shape her own life, the description of the joy that her daughter brings to her, and the life that she can live through her daughter's accomplishments. All those things that cannot easily be spoken about are included in the letter, especailly feelings. This book offers very good criteria for a first year college reader. It especially applies because it is a letter from a parent to their child that has just went away to their first year of college. I believe this book to be a very good choice when choosing a novel to be read by the entire freshman class. This novel could also fit very well into criterion of the Global Perspectives class because it explores another culture and offers insight into how other parts of the world live."},{"Title":"Zenzele: A Letter for My Daughter","review":"My friend was carrying this little book with her on a weekend trip we took with some friends and waiting for the airplane I thumbed through her copy.

Each chapter contains a conversation from the mother to her daughter, giving her some life lessons, family history, folk lore so she doesn't lose her roots, her culture, and the values her family and village have instilled in her before her flight to America.She shares the lessons she learned growing up in Zimbabwe when it was Rhodesia, the segregation between the blacks and the whites, her disappointments and her hopes. What it means to be a proud citizen of Zimbabwe. She shares what she learned from her mother-in-law on her wedding day in what it means to be an African woman.She writes of the struggles by the men and women who fought for Zimbabwe's independence, including Zenzele's father, an activist lawyer and Zenzele's Aunt Linda, a guerilla fighter, and a cousin who was a spy while working as a maid. The reminiscences are poignant as they are vivid.You feel so much love flowing from each sentence you want to reach out and embrace the woman writing them tightly to your heart."},{"Title":"Zenzele: A Letter for My Daughter","review":"This book is definitely one of my top five favorite books.

I absolutely LOVED it!"},{"Title":"Zenzele: A Letter for My Daughter","review":"Zenzele, A Letter for my Daughter is lyrically written, filled with wonderful untold history, stories and lessons of growing up in Zimbabwe, Africa. This novel is an absolute must for the American classroom.Zenzele, is a long letter from a mother to her daughter written in a series of short stories. There is a story about Tinawo; the feigned imbecile. The tale was funny yet scary and very telling. Then there was also the story of Mukoma; the boy who went to America and came back unrecognizable. And among many other stories there was one about Sister Africa. This was of particular interest because of the all too misunderstood relationship among Africans around the Diaspora. The mother, Amai, in the telling of the story \\"Sister Africa,\\" says: \\"we are standing on the ground of our ancestors; we are rooted, where others are scattered. . . We have struggled and won what was truly ours.\\"Yet I wonder if the character Amai knew the actual events of an African American would she relate to her a daughter a different story? You see, some Africans were not as lucky to fight off the colonialist. There were those stripped away from their motherland, killed, thrown in the water, sold, raped and beaten. The character, Amai, didn't relate that part. Looking at the Ghanaian, Diallo, case involving New York police in 1999, Amai may come to understand a little more of the African American's experience. Unlike Sister Africa's experience, as told in the novel, prisons in America are not a place where men and women gather and learn from each other about a revolution. The prison system in America is far, far from the way Robbin Island is described in \\"Zenzele\\".There is a racial apartheid in the America. And through that experience has sprung many Black intellectuals who could teach the mother, Amai, an understanding of the African American's plight And it may surprise her to know that their fathers would not be first generation Nigerian. The character, Amai, seems confused by the Black exploitation period; the \\"Super-Fly, Shaft, New Jack City\\" era which lured many into thinking the present myth that African Americans are just basketball players, entertainers, lucky, or stupid. There are many many working for \\"the cause\\". (There is also an exploration of the feelings between Caribbean Americans, African Americans and Africans in the book \\"Tamika Jones' Adventure\\".)Zenzele is an absolute wondrous book. A lesson for us all. A letter for us all. A marvelous book highly recommended.

This book carries with it all the tender and profound wisdom of a mother, a freedom fighter, a woman, and citizen of Zimbabwe."},{"Title":"Zenzele: A Letter for My Daughter","review":"Zenzele was a wonderful overview of colonial to independent transitions and how they progress at different speeds for different generations and for society as a whole. The ability to also transmit the feeling in relationships (especially the mother-daughter relationship) is profound. I read it quickly and then again more reflectively. As a white woman who has spent time in Zimbabwe and loves the people and the land, I was deeply affected by this book. As a psychiatrist, I was enthralled by the relationships portrayed. I recommend it to anyone with an interest in Africa, racial issues, women's issues, and families."},{"Title":"Zenzele: A Letter for My Daughter","review":"It's always good for an American to get another perspective on African culture, and this is a very nicely written book that does just that.

I would highly recommend that anyone read it. However, there are some flaws. First, this is fiction, but I think there is a real possibility that readers will take it as non-fiction, due to its presentation. And many of the stories in the book are so extreme as to be unbelievable. For example, I'm sure the cousin that goes abroad to study and comes back as a stereotypical Englishman, complete with a monocle and walks around the bush in a 3-piece wool suit and pipe. Has anyone in the past 100 years worn a monocle? And I just felt like that entire segment was so unsubtle it took away from the message. Also, one of the most interesting points in the book to me related to the \\"brain drain\\" in many poor countries, where the intelligent and ambitious leave to study/work abroad, perpetuating the cycle of poverty in their own countries. And the mother in the book strongly criticized those Africans who stay abroad, going so far as to say they have \\"fall[en] from cultural grace... succumbed to moral anarchy and glittering materialism.\\" (p.69). Yet the author herself (a native Zimbabwean I believe) lives in Connecticut!!! Isn't she the very person she criticized (through her protaganist) so strongly? Anyway, I thought the message of the book and the various authentic details were great, just thought parts of it were implausible."},{"Title":"Istanbul Boy Middle School Years : The Autobiography of Aziz Nesin, Part IV, Translated by Joseph S.

In its imaginative, symbolic, and numinous depth it is one of the most unusual, striking books I have ever read. Through the nature of its story, its characters, its language, and the encounters that the characters have with multiple layers of human experience, it is an imaginative feat on the part of the author, Walter de la Mare (1873-1956). Originally published in 1910 as The Three Mulla-Mulgars, The Three Royal Monkeys is in effect an Odyssey for children, telling the story of how three monkey brothers undertake a long and arduous voyage encompassing multiple adventures and encounters with diverse, deep, and mysterious aspects of life in order to arrive at a paradise-like land from which their late father originated. The richness, vividness, and numinousness of the story is conveyed not only by its content but by its partially invented language. That is, the English is liberally sprinkled with names and words in the language that the monkeys themselves speak, so that it conveys the sense of being inside of a mysterious, far-away, magical, animal world that is at the same time human in its resonance: as a child I had the sense of being transported to a place where I intuited things and experiences that were way beyond my years. In a way this book would be beloved of Jungians because of the way it captures \\"archetypal\\" experience. I was fortunate to have had an uncle and aunt who always gave me and other members of my family special, unusual presents, and I consider myself so lucky that they gave me this book when I was eight years old, although I don't remember if I read it then or somewhat later. It is sad that it is currently out of print. I hope that other children will be similarly blessed by having this book given to them or made accessible through the library."},{"Title":"The Three Royal Monkeys","review":"The Three Royal Monkeys is an old book- most little kids wouldn't want anything to do with it, but if you just read the first couple of pages, you'd fall in love with it. It's got a children's book idea, but it's written for older kids. It's kind of like Lord of the Rings- not the story line or anything. These simple little \\"mulla-mulgars\\" (monkeys) have magic, their father goes in search of Tishnar, his brother's kindom, and he doesn't return in seven mulla-mulgar years. So his three sons, Thumb, Thimble, and Nod go in search of Tishnar. They have interactions with Oogmars (humans) and learn how to speak their language. I'm a seventh grader, and I love it. I know some adults that love it. It's an enchanting book, you have to read it."},{"Title":"The Three Royal Monkeys","review":"If you like the Hobbit, you'll love this &quot;children's&quot; novel about three royal monkeys (or mulla-mulgars) who journey across a strangely wintery fantasy Africa so that they can live with their &quot;Uncle Assasimmon, Prince of the Valleys of Tishnar&quot;. On the way, they encounter flesh-eating &quot;minimuls,&quot; &quot;mountain mulgars&quot; who do battle with eagles, the deadly beast Immanala, a beautiful water-midden who tricks one of the mulgars and takes his magic &quot;wonderstone&quot;, a lost &quot;Oomgar&quot; from England, and many other adventures.

It was like walking in Clarke's shoes every day, wondering where the next shot or explosion's going to come from. His style of writing is direct, immediate, descriptive. He took me into the heart of the action, the emotions, the fear, the sadness and outrage at the senseless loss of life. And despite his own medical suffering and fight with life and death he still manages to crack a joke or make me smile at what he and his \\"boys\\" did or said to kept their sanity intact!It's a raw, in your face, honest presentation. I highly recommend it for anyone who's never been on active service and wants to better understand what that really takes. And I'm sure anyone who has served in more recent times in Iraq or Afghanistan would (unfortunately) see the similarities to their own experience and identify with the challenges of coming home to a so-called \\"normal\\" life."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Contact is the best account of military service in North Ireland during the latest eruption of terrorism. It gives us a fresh view of the &quot;Troubles&quot; from a British paratrooper who served in Belfast and Crossmaglen. It discusses lessons that might apply to the violence now taking place in Isreal."},{"Title":"Contact","review":"A few years ago I was a guest speaker at a \`Peace & Reconciliation' conference hosted by the Tim Parry Peace Centre in Warrington. Various figures from the military were there to speak about our experiences of serving in Northern Ireland at different stages of the conflict; I was there to discuss how it felt in the very end stages, when 'The Troubles' had all but petered out. But by far our most illuminating guest and powerful speaker was a former Parachute Regiment Captain and author, AFN Clarke - which brings me to the purpose of this review.In 1983 Tony wrote Contact, a blisteringly honest and deeply controversial account of his two tours in NI at the very height of the troubles in the 1970s. Contact rapidly achieved cult status amongst the rank & file of the army, won critical acclaim from prestigious reviewers and at the same time drew stinging criticism from the retired Brigadiers & Colonels establishment brigade - which usually means you're doing something right because you've got them rattled. As the saying goes: \\"You judge a man by the strength of his enemies.\\" Well Tony gained plenty; not least of all in the highest ranks of the MOD and politics - so much so that a smear campaign was launched against him and he was forced to defend his name with aggression and grit. The attacks only strengthened him and Contact was immediately made into an award-winning BBC film.Tony went on to live in America where he built a new career as a Pilot, Yacht Charter Captain for hire and general all-round adventurer. If ever you have the privilege of meeting him you'll instantly recognise the classic \`rebellious officer' streak that runs right through him and so irritated his former paymasters. But maddeningly for them he was undeniably a gifted soldier; he joined 3 Para as a Private \`Tom', made Lance Corporal within a year and was commissioned from the ranks after just two; a difficult task in today's army but damn near impossible in the class ridden 70s - unless you were very, very good. And he was.Contact deals with his first tour in Belfast in 1973 and his second tour in South Armagh in 1976, before culminating in his tragic and premature medical discharge from the army as a 28yr old Captain with his entire brilliant future cruelly ripped away from him. During his first tour the temporarily \`friendly' locals spiked his tea with ground glass as he drank it on hearts & minds patrols, which resulted in internal organ failure, the removal of his entire bowel region and the almost complete ruination of his health. He soldiered on for six long years passing glass shards and undergoing a dozen operations, before his body finally gave in and literally half of his belly was removed. It was only his previous dogged fitness and determination that kept him in the army and on his feet for so long. Of course, he fought back and went on to climb mountains and fly planes, but all the time since he's carried a permanent pain and dreadful scars.But the pride, fierce glint in the eyes and inner steel remains...It felt a little odd at the Warrington peace talks because some anti-war types and \`Troops Out' members were there and they clearly had strong feelings about British soldiers. And there was Tony, sat there with injuries that they couldn't imagine, this hard-as-nails former Para, and he was cool as a cucumber, effortlessly batting away their attacks with genuine warmth, humour and compassion. He'd seen more action than everyone in that room put together and paid the highest price, yet he was the calmest, most graceful and forgiving one there. It was inspiring stuff and a lesson in how to handle yourself when you're getting it from all sides.Tony has now fully updated Contact to take in the aftermath of his own service, that of his former colleagues and his own assessment and true feelings about the peace process - something that I know he's a great supporter of, however painful NI was and continues to be for him. I can't recommend his book highly enough to you - truly it's a superb, timely read - especially in light of the recent deaths in NI and roadblocks that seem to constantly block the path to peace. I think too that it's an important and hugely relevant book in that we seem to be bogged down in an eerily similar \`terrorist War' in Afghanistan, and there are lessons and parallel conclusions to be drawn for our military involvement \`out there'.Certainly I reckon that any young Squaddie going on his first tour abroad would get a hell of a lot from this book, because for me it was an object lesson in how to treat and interact with the locals; they're never going to be your friends and they'll never accept your presence, but if you at least treat them with a modicum of tact, diplomacy and discretion (whenever you safely can), then a wary tolerance and fragile mutual respect can sprout. Which is a damn sight better than the alternative...Contact is one of the best military stories that I have ever read and I recommend it to you in the highest terms; it's a book from a past conflict that has timely and resonant lessons for a present one.Steven McLaughlin,Author of Squaddie: A Soldier's StoryMainstream Publishing"},{"Title":"Contact","review":"Tony has a flare for excitement and reality.

Rather than teaching you how to write a great screenplay, it tells you how to market it. Having worked as a script evaluator, I can tell you that the format of a script is as important as the dialog within it: if your submission doesn't look professional, everyone will assume it ISN'T professional, and won't bother to read it. There are always 10 times more scripts out there than anyone has time to read, so evaluators cut corners. It may not be nice, or fair, but it is reality. Following this book's advice can keep your masterpiece out of the circular file.EXCEPT! This book's description of the format for theatrical plays is simply dead wrong. To find the proper format, you should consultDramatists Sourcebook 25th Edition(or whatever is the current version). While working for a theater company evaluating plays, I can assure you I would have never read a script that was formatted the way that is described in the book. (For those of you who want the basics: scripts should have the character name centered or greatly indented, and stage direction should be indented about 1\\" on either side and kept to a minimum. People often format their plays according to what they see in published scripts; this is a re-formatting that is done to save space. Get the Sourcebook for more detail).Straczynski's information on screenplays is beyond reproach (I can't speak about radio dramas, but my guess is there aren't too many of you clamoring to write one, anyway).This is an excellent book in every way except for the one huge caveat I mentioned above."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Script-Writing","review":"If someone were to go up to Straczynski (JMS) and ask him &quot;How can I write good?&quot; chances are he'll be met with a Narn batsquad, not to mention a grammar textbook.

Micheal Stracynski! This guide will solve all your problems! When I wrote my first play, i thought it was pretty good. Now that i've read this book, i realize all the things i could change to make it better. I think the best part of this book (possibly) is the play reading list it gives you. Some of them aren't the most famous of plays, but i dived into the list and i can't get out! With reading that selection of stagedramas, i could practically write a Broadway Smash! Bottom line: GET THIS BOOK!

It's so inspiring, full of information and well laid out. Best of all, it's very easy to read because of its conversational style. I've read it for a few times and it still doesn't bore me at all.

I read this book cover to cover before I even considered what it meant to be a writer. I've produced a few scripts and read dozens more now and can promise that the information inside is both interesting and reasonably accurate.For someone who isn't a published author, this book is filled with sound reasonable advice. If you need someone to teach the basics of grammer, how many lines on a page, how wide the margins should be and other such minutia; then this is not the book to help you. I'd suggest going back to your english teacher for that or perhaps just reading a script.Scriptwriting is a art that like most art, needs someone to appreciate it. If you can't sell your script; then you aren't getting the point of writing. If you have a bookshelf that's full of writing books, then pick out your second favorite one and replace it with this. It'll be worth the read."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Script-Writing","review":"JMS's book is definitely worth a look, but unfortunately it tries to cover a little too much. This means that some of the topics are only covered piece-meal. However, if you're serious about \`getting into the industry' then grab the book. It has some valuable lessons inside."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Script-Writing","review":"This is the perfect book to read on a lonely Saturday night. It begins with an introduction (and, I believe, a forward) by Mr. Straczynski, which don't give much introduction to him, but they do to his career (which I already knew about, anyway, but I still loved the intro). The intro was humorous and inspiring, telling other readers and I something that I have known for a long time -- out of the world and I, which one is wrong? This book will give you the answer.... Then it goes into the history of television, the correct format of a script, etc., etc.This book is definitely complete...it even had a section on writing for radio. Even though the material the book covers on how many picas indented whould the title be, etc., is boring (in my opinion), it is presented in such a way that it comes across as useful information that you want to know and have fun finding out, because of the way Straczynski presents it.The best part about the book were the bits and pieces of scripts scattered throughout. Unfortunately, some of these have not ever been produced, and I may never know how they end.... Of these scripts, the complete television script, Coming of Shadows, winner of a Hugo award, was the best. It was in the back, by itself, no analysis or anything, and it was uncut -- having actually watched the produced version on television, I recognized some lines and an entire scene that got cut before the final version was made. In my opinion, it's worth it to buy the book just for the back (but that's not what Straczynski wants you to do, I think...he probably wants people to actually use the book for what it is...sigh....).In any event, this book is definitely one to get. It appears hard to get in bookstores, but you can special-order it, or, as might be the reason you're hear...put it in your shopping cart (or however you buy it from Amazon). Great advice, great reference, and great scripts, all in one. You can't go wrong"},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Script-Writing","review":"The Complete Book of Scriptwriting is an excellent book to begin with in terms of scriptwriting. It gives you a good idea on one of the most important aspects of scriptwriting, selling. It serves as a good learning tool and gives you a few points on how to go after deals. It's also a good book if you are just interested in Hollywood and would like to know more about the business side. If you are interested in the business behind closed doors in Hollywood or if you are just interested in one day writing a script and finding a way of selling it, look no further - this book is for you."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Script-Writing","review":"This was the first book I ever got on screenwriting, and found it useful, but long.

It is far from complete.I expect a lot more than some tips and guidlines for formatting. The actual writing of scripts was hardly mentioned. There was a lot of interesting material -- mostly about the business setting of many types of scripts. Some stray tips were useful. But this did not tell how to write a script. The glossary was minimal with terms used in the book not even being defined. And many terms did not appear anywhere. Mike had a column in Writers Digest that was excellent. I was expecting more how to write a script advice and less filler and tangential material.There were places he teased us but never told us about the things he mentioned. Browse this book at the library if you are curious. You don't need it on your bookshelf. Overall this was very disappointing. Mike knows how to write a script and how to teach it. Why didn't he?

Save your $ for something worthwhile."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Script-Writing","review":"I will spare You the same comments as the other reviews, as we are all in agreement that this book is incredible. There is a business that any writer must deal with, and JMS tells You how to go about it. Without this knowledge, You will *never* get hired. Also, JMS challenges the reader to not simply go around telling others, &quot;I'm a writer.&quot; Rather, he wants You to have discipline and write whenever You have a moment's time to do so. There are a lot of talkers, and then there are those who succeed by hard work, discipline, an understanding of how the business works, and perseverance. I would highly endorse this book over other books that are simply made to take Your money, not unlike many of those scam writers' workshops who tell You the winning &quot;formula&quot; to a great work. JMS has paid his dues, written hundreds of scripts, and has worked as an Executive Producer for many successful shows. So please don't waste Your money on a fly by night writer who has never succeeded herself, but listen to the honesty and sincerity of a man who wrote this book under the premise that he wished he had had this book when he started. Best of luck to You all."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Script-Writing","review":"Scriptwriting is a great all purpose review of both the creative and business sides of writing for TV, movies, animation, radio drama, and the stage. Straczynski is the perfect authority to write on these subjects, having garnered success in all those fields.The book is a how to manual, with plenty of examples to follow. It also traces out the business side of selling what you write. Straczynski writes in a personable style, but pulls no punches. He helps a potentional writer separate his dreams from reality without crushing one's ambition. This book has been used in colleges as a textbook and upon reading it, yu'll see why. It's a handy reference tool that I have thumbed back through scores of times over the last 3 years. I give it the highest praise. It should be the starting point for anyone serious about writing in the performing arts."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Script-Writing","review":"The Complete Book of Scriptwriting by J. Michael StraczynskiWell, I think we all know of Michael Straczynski's accomplishments if not I will name one of his projects Babylon 5 and leave it at that. With that being said, The Complete Book of Scriptwriting is an excellent book for any scriptwriter. In The Complete Book of Scriptwriting Michael Straczynski touches on every genre of scriptwriting. From TV and movie writing all the way down to stage and radio. Now The Complete Book of Scriptwriting is not really a how to guide for writing. The Complete Book of Scriptwriting touches on these aspects such as a scripts length, margin settings, subtext and dialog. However, The Complete Book of Scriptwriting is more so a guide to the business of writing written by a writer who was also a TV producer. So Michael Straczynski provides you with a wealth of information from an artistic and business point of view, you cannot go wrong there. With great efforts he takes you through the step-by-step process of pitching a script. Need a way to land you an agent well, a few ideas are presented in this book. How about when to register with the WGA, it is all in there. Not only does Michael Straczynski take the time to go through each genre of scriptwriting he provides in rich detail the history of each medium of scriptwriting as well as the future of that medium. If you take your time with the history of the medium of scriptwriting that you are trying to write for you will have a better understanding of how that medium works and all the little quirks that you may overlook in your zeal to become the next great scriptwriter.Again The Complete Book of Scriptwriting is not really a how to guide to writing it is a guide to understanding the business of scriptwriting. Which includes everything from how to write, how to find an agent, how to deliver a pitch, how to understand the way a network, studio lot and even a producer go about in the process of dealing with writers. Do not get me wrong The Complete Book of Scriptwriting does provide a great deal of information on how to write a script but that is not this books single sole purpose. All in all if you are serious about being a professional scriptwriter this BOOK IS A MUST HAVE. You will refer to it a lot especially when you are ready to start dealing with the business aspects of scriptwriting..."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Script-Writing","review":"J.

(I finished the book in a weekend!) It'sobvious from the outset that this is a book that's going totell you the way things really are, instead of some kind ofsnow job. If you really have the &quot;burn,&quot; says Straczynski,your options are almost endless...and here's how to explorethem realistically. I found the book extremely informative."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Script-Writing","review":"Salted with script excerpts and script layouts in equal measure, THE COMPLETE BOOK OF SCRIPTWRITING is written with humour and a prose style which makes it almost as easy to read as fiction. It even includes the award-winning Babylon 5 script, &quot;The Coming of Shadows&quot; as an appendix. But is it an effective textbook?The book covers the areas of film, screen, radio, animation and stage play scriptwriting in detail. It will show you how to develop a script in each genre from original idea through synopsis, then outline, to first draft, demonstrating at each stage who you'll be dealing with on the production side, and what you should expect to receive in payment. The pitfalls and the cynical traps some companies use are well signposted.A significant failing, though, is that it does not cover as much of the art and technical aspects of scriptwriting as one might like - jms, as he's universally known on the Internet, seems to have the approach that the best teacher is practice. He devotes much more space to the layout of scripts (crucial to acceptance), their development and their marketing, with many anecdotes to illuminate, entertain and illustrate.This is all very well, but layout and marketing details are local to the US. If you are intending to live in L.A. and write for the local market, this book is essential reading. If you live or work abroad, you may find the scriptwriting tips in the Complete Book a little incomplete for the cover price, although many Babylon 5 fans have bought it simply for the full episode script at the back.None the less, this is a very well-written book (as one would expect from jms). It is not remotely starchy - unlike many books for writers - and it covers areas of scriptwriting which most other tomes on the subject fail to address, or at least in such detail. If you need to learn from scratch how to write, or to write a script, you'll find plenty of books already out there. But if you need a guide through the almost inpenetrable jungle of L.A., jms is your man, and the Complete Book is your map.Jon Green (jonsg@pobox.com"},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Script-Writing","review":"I bought the 1996 edition book for the sole purpose of how to write a sceenplay for film.I was impressed by the way JMS managed to incorporate camera moves and visual information within the scene descriptions. This proved to be valuable to me since my films are very visual and helps me to allow the Reader/Producer to understand how I would present the scenes on screen. These lessons helped me to get funding for my film project as a result of this book. I was complimented on how I was able to get the reader to visualize my script.I have Final Draft software as well so I have no concerns about formatting, but JMS does give instructions of how to format if you don't have such software.I also appreciate this book because it doesn't tell you how to structure your creative writing into a formula. There are enough formula scripts in the business already so this is actually a bonus for myself. I was free to create as I wish while still paying heed to his advice of how to market your scripts.The only fault I found was that he didn't have instructions on how to construct a shooting script which involves more detail than the conventional screenplay. This would be useful information for pre-production of a film."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Script-Writing","review":"HELL YES!This book gives you *suggestions* for story and structure, without cramming some step-by-step stifling &quot;guaranteed&quot; method down your throat. JMS's advice is open-ended and encourages you to strike out on your own and write unique, one-of-a-kind scripts that are completely yours. No Syd Field type &quot;paradigm&quot;, no top secret formula that the author claims can be found in ALL successful movies (or TV shows or cartoons or plays...)--No BS!But what this book does best is function as a reference for a wide variety of script formats and styles, from television to radio to the stage to the screen (even cartoons are covered). The book gives you ideas on how to market your particular script, helps the reader to decide what kind of story he'd like to tell or what kind of script he'd like to write, even gives you some ideas of what to expect depending on your choices. (You even get solid guidelines on what producers and professional readers expect the script to look like, right down to page margins.)No scriptwriter should be without this book. It is crammed full of refreshingly useful and relevant information, it's funny, it's no-nonsense, it's fun to read, and it makes you want to sit down and get writing.Let the &quot;wannabes&quot; read something like &quot;How to be a Megarich Screenwriter in 24 Hours&quot; or &quot;PROVEN Hollywood Secrets&quot;.

JMS, the man behind the TV series &quot;Babylon 5&quot;, is an excellent teacher and his writing style is both comfortable and informative.

I read this one before reading her very popular title \\"Stiff.\\" I enjoyed this book a lot. I love random facts and always keep them filed away in my mind, and this book provided me with many random facts indeed. The book is really humorous and very informational, it does not read like a novel in any way. Therefore, I can see how someone might have trouble reading it. This book was not written for the dull-witted.That being said, if you're looking for a definitive answer on whether or not ghosts exists..Then this book is not going to answer your questions. No book will. If we find out that answer, scientifically speaking, I'm sure it will be all over the news!! Don't blame the author for a really educated attempt at finding answers, because there is nothing to find. All you can do is research and draw your own conclusions. However, people have day jobs, and so the author is sharing her research.

After reading her other books I hoped this one would help answer many questions I, and humanity in general, have about the afterlife.

In the end, it's a decent read, but all-in-all a bit disappointing.I recommend her classicStiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadaversover this one."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"I still can't get over the quality of Roach's writing. She takes her subject very seriously without removing the humor and mystery. If she wrote high school science textbooks, I might now understand biology, chemistry, and physics."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"I thought this book was great. I have to admit, when I got this book and quickly thumbed through it I thought it was going to take me much longer to finish. On first glance it looked longer and more *non-fictiony* than I'm used to. However, I am totally on the Mary Roach band wagon! She is funny, quick-witted, and makes me think not only about the subject at hand, but about how much fun it would be to write like her. She fully admits to knowing virtually nothing about her subjects before starting out, and to asking dumb questions and laughing at inappropriate moments during interviews. I love it!This book explored 12 chapters worth of the possibility and proof of life after death. She talked to people who try to prove or disprove reincarnation and everything surrounding people who believe in that. She read about scientists trying to weigh the soul, or rather, weigh a person at the moment of death do see if there is a decrease in weight (the soul leaving). She read about ectoplasm and looked at a preserved box of it. She enrolled in a weekend *medium* course. Mary Roach did quite a few other things (I don't want to tell everything in the review!) to prove or disprove the presence of a soul or ghosts.Mary Roach is hilarious as well as informational. I loved it. Her footnotes are just as informational and entertaining as the text. Occasionally, she finds interest in something not having to do with the task at hand and shares that with the reader as well - always funny. Kind of like if you were doing the research yourself and after you found what you were looking for in a Biblical and Talmudic Medicine book (yes, there is such a thing), wouldn't you be curious to see what other (and possibly more interesting) opinions/rules those who wrote the book had? I know I would! Thus, a lengthy footnote including cattle, cleansing, dogs, and \\"hairy heart\\"; none of which had anything to do with the other.Also, while I will in no way remember any of the names of people she read about or talked to in her book, I can quickly glance at the \\"Contents\\" page and read the titles of chapters as well as the little phrase with each and remember what each contained. And that's the point, right? Not necessarily to remember who did what and when, but to learn a little bit about what was done in the past and what's going on now."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"This is the first Mary Roach book I've read and now I've GOT to read her others. This book is thought-provoking, educational, quirky, fascinating, entertaining, and at times laugh-out-loud funny. Each chapter covers a different topic under the umbrella of spirituality/death/the afterlife. That might not sound like light, enjoyable reading for most people, but this book was just that! I've recommended it to my family members, my boyfriend, and friends. Don't let the topic scare you away, you'll come out of reading this with knowledge of spirituality in other cultures and time periods, a new outlook, or at the very least some fascinating trivia/conversation-starters! Five big stars. Love Mary Roach!"},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"I loved this book for its entertainment value, but ... Science Tackles the Afterlife? I mean, let's get real, this is Mary Roach. Author of Stiff. You're not getting convincing science for your money, you're buying a colorful ride along the surface and around the edge. Mary touches on reincarnation, electromagnetic fields, where the soul resides physically in the body, mediums in lab studies, haunted houses, and near-death experiences.Did you know the soul weighs three quarters of an ounce? In 1907 Duncan Macdougall measured how much a dead person's body weight abruptly drops at the precise moment, it is assumed, that the soul leaves the body. But pursuing the study became difficult. Who would volunteer to die in Macdougall's lab? Stymied by friction with officials, Macdougall resorted to weighing dogs on a scale he set up in his barn. Owing to the difficulty of finding dogs dying from a disease that rendered them exhausted and motionless, he immobilized and then killed them via injection. Unfortunately, not a single dog showed a drop in weight as it died. Macdougall's conclusion: Dog's don't have souls.The book's finest quality is its ability to ride the fence, simultaneously teasing you with dubious but honest-to-God studies of the afterlife while bordering on tongue-in-cheek humor. Occasionally, Mary slips up, as in her explanation of the soul's weight. \\"Theory one: Macdougall was a nutter.\\"Oh, and the ghostly pictures ... I loved them, too.Can any study or anybody in this book be taken seriously? Oops, gotta go, it's time for Ghost Hunters on the telly."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"I love Roach's style of research and exploration.

Believers and disbelievers alike will find no substantive information on the subject. What you will find are Roach's endless ramblings and anecdotes leading to no conclusion. Roach comes off sounding like a bad comedienne, spending her time meandering about here and there seeking out people that she can ridicule rather following any real research methods. Her overuse of \\"amusing\\" footnotes does nothing for her already weak manuscript. This is not to say that Roach does not have some talent as a writer. But her skills might be put to better use writing political satire or humorous essays. As someone who has done a fair amount of research on this subject, I found this book offensive in it's frivolity. If you are looking for a thought-provoking look at the subject of the afterlife, you will be very dissapointed. In short: don't waste your money or time."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"\\"Stiff\\" was the first book of Roach's I read, so this book had big shoes to fill ... and it didn't. As far as my complaints about the book, it was simply boring."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"This book is really riveting and entertaining to read - there's never a dull moment! It's not bogged up in heavily scientific explanations either, which may or may not be a good thing for you (it's definitely a good thing for me).I realize a lot of people will probably discount this book either because it's too \\"skeptical\\" or because it's not hard enough on religion. But if you have an open mind, this book is really fascinating and fun. If you already have an ideological point of view on the afterlife (whether religious or militantly atheist), this might not be your thing, though I hope it is, and I think everyone should give it a try!"},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"In my opinion, this was a great book. I enjoyed the fact that she delved into the historical and even geographical aspects of what people percieve about the afterlife.

I'd recommend it for anyone."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"Sure she may be very partial to the idea that ghosts do not exist; however, all writers of nonfiction have an opinion. Roach and I do not agree on this point, but that does not take away from how well researched and --if nothing else-- entertaining this book was. My boyfriend got irritated that when we lain in our beds at night, me reading this book, I would sit there and laugh too much- which apparently is distracting. Stiff was an excellent book, this was also a good read as well. I am looking forward to future books by Mary Roach."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"I liked Stiff. And I wanted to like this. But honestly? I was bored with the majority of this book. Every twenty pages or so Mary Roach explores interesting themes but within a couple of paragraphs she completely exhausts them. Toward the middle of the book (which I felt like I needed to finish) I found myself skimming through and skipping several pages at a time.Her jokes weren't funny. Her writing was condescending. Her footnotes gradually became more and more annoying (and redundant)."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"I really enjoyed \\"Stiff\\" - but seeing that I gave that 4*, I can only afford to give \\"Spook\\" 2...I am disappointed with this one. I was really looking forward to reading it, but as another reviewer commented, there is so much filler, that the substance is lost.Especially the chapter about mediums, there are pages and pages of wadding (written) about a bit of wadding (muslin)!The space would've been better used discussing other mediums. Britain boasts several. It is an American book, but since a fair bit of research was done in the UK, Roach could've mentioned the 2 Dorises (Stokes, Collins).There are omissions - why mention John Edward so briefly? Those of us outside the U.S especially, don't know as much about him as U.S. residents might. And if he's so famous, why not interview him?And why nothing about spirit-, or automatic-writing?What information was there was buried in amusing but overlong and over-frequent character/physical descriptions of those around the author.There was far too much history - I'd rather have read about what's going on the modern day re. spiritualism and the paranormal.Basically, it seems like after the success of \\"Stiff\\" Roach was commissioned to write a similar book with a quirky one-word title about a freaky subject (which, as she admits somewhere in the acknowledgements, she knew nothing about!).I wonder whether she actually had any interest in it to begin with..."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"I was expecting more here. I thought there were many far-fetched stabs at explaining the afterlife. It explains what any normal human should know without looking for it. I can appreciate her search for answers, but this is not the right track."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"Mary Roach looks at the afterlife through the eyes of science, both past & present. It's a tough subject to pin down, as she shows in her typically thorough & funny way. If you read this looking for what actually does happen after you die, you've picked up the wrong book. She says that in her introduction - obviously some reviewers don't read introductions. Yes, she was trying to find out. She interviewed dozens of scientists, read up on more & even went on outings or classes with a few paranormal clubs. The upshot is, no one reliably knows. But her explorations & the facts she turned up makes a wonderful read.Her research seems pretty exhaustive to me. I don't know much about the subject nor do I have a lot of interest. I confess, I bought the book because I enjoy her writing. She has a quirky sense of humor, but doesn't overpower me with it. Just flashes it to lighten what could otherwise be a boring subject. How many people want to read about someone going to medium school, after all? Well she did & made it interesting.I can't wait to read her next book \\"Bonk - the curious coupling of sex & science\\". After having several kids, I probably know all I need to about sex, but the trip with her should be interesting!"},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"There's something different apparent in SPOOK: SCIENCE TACKLES THE AFTERLIFE: it smacks of solid investigative research rather than sensationalism, and traces the author's journey to understand what happens upon death. Will personality remain? Is there another world beyond ours? Author Roach searched out scientists, engineers and mediums alike who are all trying to prove or disprove that life goes on after death. She journeyed from rural India to the US, enrolled in an English medium school, and interviewed university professors conducting research. SPOOK follows her journey, which includes a healthy dose of history into the scientific investigation of an afterlife.Diane C.

I was very excited to get this book home and begin reading, but have found that I can't make it past the second chapter. Mary needed to get to the point that she was trying to make a little quicker and with a little less hoity-toity language/writing. I loved Stiff, so I have to say I was quite dissapointed in this attempt at writing by Mary...try again!"},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"There are warning signs early on. Although she is to be commended for her professed openness to \\"spooks\\", she demonstrates her laziness when she describes her take on the world's religions, supposing Christian doctrine of the afterlife to be about \\"lying around in one's coffin clothes until Christ returns\\" (paraphrase, but close enough).Seeing as how important she acknowledges the subject of the afterlife to be, you'd expect her to have tried to obtain a *basic* understanding of what the only faith that be investigated objectively (see \\"The Case for Christ\\" for an accessible, entertaining, challenging treatment) says about it.OK, so she's not *that* open. But the book looks intriguing. So let's read it.Sad to say, it turned out to be lower on content than I'd hoped. The author is much too chatty, providing a lot of useless incidental detail about her trips to interview different people; it's almost like a travel book. She describes the people, the surroundings, the buildings, what she ate, what others are eating, etc. etc. until you're screaming for her to get to the point. And when she does, it's usually centered around one or two cases. She presents some good points, and there is some historical information that is interesting, though, but in most cases you're left asking, \\"Are those really the most interesting/convincing cases?\\" Perhaps yes, perhaps not. But the incessant chatter! I'm not reading to find out your personal preferences or your traveling adventures; I want to read about spooky stuff."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"what a waste of time reading this book...poorly researched, and certainly not even close to a serious look at the 'afterlife'....the author attempts to use humor to get her points across, with little success....what a disappointing book!!"},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible. What a waste of time and money.I think the author wants to be a stand up comic. However, I did not find anything that was funny to me due to the subtitle of... \\"Science Tackles the Afterlife\\" on the cover. There was nothing that read like true science. Very, very disappointing. I would give it a Zero rating but the stars only go down to 1*."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"The idea for Spook might've been good if talking about paranormal anomalies either physical or ethereal hadn't already been done a thousand times before and in much better ways, e.g. from Shakespeare to Houdini to comic books!Too bad our fine friendly poltergeists didn't have enough personal powers to keep the editors from giving this one a green light.In what could've been interesting views on already well-known subject materials, the author's narrative storytelling is just plain jane so what! Her attempts at trying to inject humor makes the whole work choppy, and is quite distracting at best, extremely lame at worst.While she finally admits she does believe in entities comprised of ectoplasm - Too bad she didn't believe in using a collaborator or, shall I dare say it, yes: a ghost writer! (Pun or not intended.)From her travels in whatever dimensions she was traversing (or tripping on and through), she might've best been served by holding a s&eacute;ance to channel the likes of Totie Fields and Moms Mabley. At least they would've instructed her across \`The Veil' how not to inner chuckle at their own inside jokes while talking about almost any subject, spiritual/metaphysical topics included. And taken from The Muses: Humor is fine when it's actually funny to others and not just oneself.To sum it all up then and get the gist of how this book poorly reads, just think of The Amazing Randi doing a stand-up routine on amateur night at the Improv. Come to think of it though, The Amazing Randi and his troupe of skeptics are a whole lot funnier.Final Analysis: Absolutely nothing new to learn here. SPOOK is SPLECH!

I was able to fix it, but would have preferred a book that was still bound together."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"I love ghost stories and stories of the 'beyond' and all that those categories entail. That said, I hate this book. Mary Roach has the authorial voice of a 12 year old. I read the first chapter thinking, 'wow, this book might as well have been edited by a middle school yearbook writer.' There are a plethora of books on the market dealing with this subject matter. Pick any of them. Leave Mary Roach on the bookshelf."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"On a surface read of some sections alone, I noticed inaccuracies and sweeping statements that are not backed-up by facts, other than the author's bias, about some of the people mentioned. I know, for instance, the medium Glyn Edwards extremely well and that he does 'not' wear a medalion on a ribbon, as negatively described in the book. This is something Ministers of the SNU sometimes wear and demonstrates how the author has got him mixed up with someone else. It may seem like a minor point, but leads me to question just how much else is inaccurate.The writing, in the places that I bothered to read, seems to be more about the author's own rubbish and paints her as someone who is more concerned about appearances and with a dislike for anyone with any physical weaknesses or impediments. Most people would consider someone, such as Glyn, who has the courage to continue working publically after a serious illness, which left him slightly disfigured, as admirable.The author is hardly writing objectively. She suggests that Glyn would cut-up doubters to pieces, yet doesn't find out if he actually does. Glyn, in fact, is open minded, has in-depth knowledge of many traditions and has never said that he has all the answers. This style of research and writing wouldn't be accacetable in the first year of a Religious Studies degree course. I'd be suprised to know if there is anyone in the world that could possibly live up to the author's cynical judgments."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"THIS HAS TO BE ONE OF THE WORST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ....

Can we communicate with the dead? And just what the heck is ectoplasm anyway? This are all questions that investigative journalist Mary Roach tackles in her latest book \\"Spook, Science Tackles the Afterlife\\" somewhat of a sequel to her earlier book \\"Stiff\\" in which she explores what really happens to people's donated bodies (you don't want to know).Roach's investigation takes her to several continents, exploring reincarnation in India, haunted spots in England, and lots of research in the U.S., and exposes many of the anecdotal stories we've all heard, but were not sure of the sources.Although the book is highly informative, as opposed to her earlier book, Roach's injecting frequent sarcastic remarks about the subjects of her study detract from what could otherwise have been a well researched tome on the questions all of us ask."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"Do we not all wonder where we came from and where we might go? There will never be conclusive answers. Not from religion and not from occultism or witchcraft. But it is fun to speculate and it is great that books like this cover the subject so well. It does not matter if one agrees with all of it, but it is a good read anyway."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"I have never read anything else by this author, but I have to say that I liked this book.It is a hard subject to cover, and she does it with humor and wit. She starts with reincarnation, then goes to the religious view, then to scientific, then on to the paranormal...then a little back to science.You can tell that the author is a skeptic when it comes to the paranormal, however, her interview with the woman who was the basis of the show \\"Medium\\" left her a little on the \\"Wow\\" side.The author does her best on a sticky and enormous subject. It does get a little tedious at times, however her humor keeps you going. She does tend to occasionally jump from subject to subject which is a tad annoying, for example her experience in going to paranormal school (never knew there was such a thing) kept being interrupted with other experiences.Considering the magnitude of writing about the after-life, I think she did a very good job."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"I consider myself to be a spiritual person, but am also a scientist. The perceived mutual exclusivity of these aspects of life by some has always interested me, so I decided to buy the book about the scientific search for the soul and hear Mary Roach speak at my favorite bookstore.She is just as funny and full of energy (despite serious jet lag) and curiosity in person as she is in her writing. She is a warm person, and her writing is nonjudgemental and the most objective I've ever encountered in someone claiming to be open minded, although it does seem that she naturally tends a little more to facts rather than faith.Contrary to what the Amazon reviewer wrote about Roach concluding that we're all just bags of bones to be committed to the soil, the author herself told her listeners at the bookstore that she found herself more open to the spiritual side of the debate after all of her research.For me, what I got out of reading the book is a lot of good laughs, much random and interesting and sometimes bizarre knowledge, and a sense that certain research we're taking so seriously right now may be laughable in the future. But that's how we learn. I wouldn't have it any other way.I can be picky with my books, as it's not enough for me to be interested in the subject. I like for books to be well-written, as well, and in this Mary Roach does not disappoint."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"It wouldn't be truly fair to say that Mary Roach has the sense of humor, maturity level and research skills of a fourteen-year-old boy - fair to a fourteen-year-old boy that is. Because I assume many of them are forced by their teachers to look beyond Google searches for their information. And surely many of them don't see the necessity of finding toilet humor in every odd name or tangential topic they happen to uncover in that research. (Consider this gem on page 73, when discussing phrenology, she suddenly finds reason to diverge into one of the subject's inventions, a \\"portable hydrogen gas generator [which she proudly references Google for, no less], and goes on at length to describe the machine's use to detect flatulence...I mean...is this really relevant information? And I'm being gentle. This is actually a fairly mild example of her constant and unnecessary deviation into detailed discussions of bodily functions.) This is how Mary Roach and fourteen-year-old boys are best distinguished; I'd be less worried about the 14-year-old embarrassing me in public.I can't rightfully rate a book lower than 3 stars if I actually *finished* it - which I did in this case. But it sure feels like a 2-star bomb thinking back on it. From such an intriguing title comes an awkward, displaced, meaningless and utterly irrelevant collection of chapters that are each just a quick editor's glance away from taking their rightful place as B-rate magazine articles. And, most poignantly, none contain the slightest bit of the actual intrigue so latent within the title. It's as though she wants to be a satirical writer rather than present any actual information on the alleged subject, and there isn't the slightest hint of a journalistic mind present in the writing. Here. Imagine David Sedaris had the \\"talent\\" part of his brain removed, and then tried to write a book on a random topic he had little or no previous knowledge of. Essentially, you would have \\"Spook.\\"What Roach has done is simply recounted the most obvious hoaxes in the history of supernatural studies, and in other cases she's dabbled in some variety of modern science attempting to discover actual paranormal activity, all the while admitting how little she actually knows about what the experts at hand are talking about. In one case she mentions asking a researcher to respond to her by \\"pretend[ing] you are talking to a seventh-grader,\\"(p.105). Is this the level of authorship and topical knowledge that we've come to accept as publishable material? Apparently so, judging by Roach's high sales.Ultimately, this book is complete and utter fluff with not the slightest bit of substantial information that an average person with a laptop and internet connection could not find out for themselves in about an hour and a half on Wikipedia. The only sense of awe the reader of \\"science tackling the afterlife\\" is left with, is that an average college graduate with a B.A. in psychology convinced a publisher to fund a book on a topic that said author may as well have picked out of a hat of a hundred other subjects about which she admittedly knew next to nothing."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"Well, yeah, I was happy to pick up Spook since the previous Stiff was so great but couldn't have been more disappointed. Spook is unquestioningly the too quickly researched and written book with the offensive and misrepresentative title. Ms.Roach is neither amusing nor wry or even especially skeptical in her treatment of other worldly matters and her crisp intelligence, so abundant in Stiff, is hardly present. She obsesses about irrelevancies like ectoplasm but happily skips through more meaningful subject matter such as reincarnation and serious, known psychics like Alison du Bois of whom Ms.Roach merely presents as being all too pretty. Ms.Roach is altogether too sneering to a variety of personages in Spook in a way that made me cringe on her behalf. Yikes! What gives?"},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"Well, I guess it's a step up from the pop tabloid treatments we see all too much of. Chapters are allocated to separate subjects such as reincarnation, search for the physical evidence of the human soul, spiritualism, physical mediums, etc. Unfortunately, Ms. Roach seems to be far more intertested in milking wisecracks out of her \\"research\\" than she is in doing any heavy lifting, and the breezy, smartacre style wears out its welcome quickly. You can certainly tell she comes to the subject with a tabula rasa: she obviously never heard of Harry Price, much less other lesser-known parapsychologists. It's an entertaining read, but I couldn't recommend it as anything approaching what I had expected it to be: a sceptic's investigation into the survival of human personality after death.

The writer also goes off on weird tangents and after a while of reading, you don't know what she's talking about half the time.

I affirm Ms. Roach's entreaties for access to and examination of the raw data of the U. of Az Mediumship experiments, at least.Ms. Roach has done her homework, I dare say I share her healthy skepticism, so I rejoice in a serious examination of recent scientific claims positing proof of one kind or another in favor of the idea that we all survive death, or hit \\"the big sleep.\\"In the end, Roach concludes \\"I do believe in ghosts.\\"Interesting.How I wish, now that the book is out, to clarify so many points regarding Chapter 6, especially.

Whether or not you agree with the author's conclusions, you have to love her flippant writing style. I purchased this book because I love her column in Reader's Digest. I certainly was not disappointed. I can't wait to read her first book."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"Spook is not a book about the afterlife. It's about Mary Roach's Zany Adventures With The Afterlife!, and to enjoy it, you better enjoy Mary Roach. Otherwise, this book will annoy the hell out of you.Spook was a disappointing read. First off, let me say that I am not a believer, so please do not count me among the handful of one star reviews below from people clearly irritated that Roach did not take their beliefs seriously.In the book, Roach covers a spread of supernatural topics, from ectoplasm and auras to near death experiences and seances. One thing you get out of the book is that a number of ridiculous modern paranormal beliefs harken back to shoddy science of the early 1900s spiritual movement that refused to die.However, the book was disappointing for several reasons. The first is that Mary Roach professes to know very little about the subject and, modest or not, it's pretty clear after reading it that she does in fact know very little; and that further more, she did very little more than surface investigations for this book. I imagine part of the problem is the subject matter - this stuff ISN'T very deep to begin with, and certainly has little to no scientific basis to draw from.But, for example, at one point, Roach goes to a weekend course in communicating with the dead. She is, predictably, surrounded by kooks and nutballs all of whom think they can communicate with the dead. And then the course ends, she's learned - predictably - nothing, and that's about it from that section of the paranormal world. To the reader, the weekend was clearly a wasted trip that would result in nothing more than comic anecdotes. On top of it are a number of stories and facts clearly garnered from Google searches, which really takes away from her abilities as a researcher.Another problem: Roach really, really needs to take a course in comedy. The subject matter she's dealing with is so zany, so ridiculous, it is simply hilarious at times by just writing down what happened. Instead, Roach sticks in very, very obvious and forced jokes that really do nothing but detract for the humor at play. It's annoying at times, like a third rate Dave Barry. It would be like writing about people who bathe in Jello, then making a joke about how dumb they are for bathing in Jello. You don't have to - the reality is far funnier than any joke could be.Overall, it's a scattered, fluffy read that serves more for a series of comic (yet not so comical) essays on crazy, zany paranormal stuff starring Mary Roach. Read it if you want a very light primer, but beware the horrible, horrible jokes to come."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"I was really looking forward to listening to the audiobook \\"Spook\\" by M. Roach. I should point out that generally I prefer when authors themselves narrate their own books, and am only marginally disappointed when they don't or can't.The narrator of this audiobook is Bernadette Quigley. To put it plainly, I had to stop listening shortly after the 3rd CD because Ms. Quigley was blatantly disrespectful to subjects being interviewed in the text. To clarify: this is not a criticism of Ms. Roach's writing, research, or approach to the topic. In all cases Ms. Quigley (narrator), uses extremely unflattering imitations to represent East Indian and American scientific professionals making them sound at various times \\"kooky\\", pompous, clueless, and out-of-touch. As a scientist myself, I was frankly offended by Ms. Quigley's cruel imitations.While I enjoyed the content of the book, Ms. Quigley's rendition of \\"Spook\\" was so maddening and off-putting that I had to stop listening to it. I hope to have enough time to pick up the text of \\"Spook\\" so that I can give this work its due respectful attention."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"I have read three books by Mary Roach, Bonk, Stiff, and now Spook. This is by far the weakest of the three.Roach's approach to a subject is to take a year and immerse herself in the topic. She enters the field of study with little more than the average person's knowledge of the topic and starts from there. For this, and for how committed she is to delving into her chosen topics, I award her the three stars of this review. For actually imparting knowledge and information about this topic, she fails and therefore the deduction of two stars.If you need a light read, believe it or not this book about the afterlife is as \\"lite\\" as they get. Roach travels, interviews, witnesses, and researches numerous aspects of what happens to \\"us\\" after our physical body stops functioning. She also delves into the validity of \\"mediums\\" and who they may really be talking to or for.This is an almost 300 page book of \\"fluff\\" and pop-culture writing about the afterlife. For a quick, escapist jaunt on the topic, go ahead and read this one. If you want anything at all serious, pass on this one."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"With a title like Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife, you might think that Mary Roach is about to present a serious book about a topic that many take seriously.You'd be wrong.Spook is pleasant reading, but it's not serious reading, and certainly not as \\"scientific\\" as the tagline would suggest. Roach really writes about some people past and present who were or are out on the fringes of parapshychology, and a few who are well past them. Some of the people in the book are little more than caricatures.In Roach's defense, she treats their often wild claims with a light, if critical touch. She's pretty humorous in this book without making the odd characters she studies the butts of her jokes.Spook is a quick read, but, it's a collection of vignettes about such long discredited notions as theosophy and ectoplasm, and modern oddities such as electronic voice phenomena. Writing a book that's basically a humorous tract on psychics is fine, but not when the trappings suggest something more substantive."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"I've read some of reviews from the disappointed here on Amazon. Some have complained that the book \\"isn't serious.\\" This is true, but I argue that this is the book's greatest strength. Roach approaches the world of the paranormal as a skeptic, pointing out the idiosyncracies of it's inhabitants and their Quixotic quests to detail the afterlife. She meets many charlatans, quasi-scientists, genuine scientists and genuine self-deluded believers. I found the book hilarious, witty, and engaging; I would recommend it to anyone looking for an entertaining read. I don't think there's that many (or any) serious scientific works about life after death; in fact, I would think it rather difficult to find a truly scientific book about a something non-scientific.However if you want a very entertaining, sometimes irreverent treatment of the subject, give Spooked a chance."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"Mary Roach has delivered another bound-to-be-bestselling piece of non-fiction about a curious subjects. Last time is was cadavers; this time she tackles the afterlife. Unlike her comprehensive and eye-opening research done in Stiff, however, the material in Spook comes across very uneven.The early chapter on reincarnation in India (where reincarnation is a part of the religious culture) is a fascinating bit of journalism, executed perfectly with a healthy amount of skepticism balanced with acceptance, and it makes a great start to the book. For the next few chapters, though, Roach loses focus. The book's subtitle really could be \\"a look at dubious science through the ages.\\" We get scientists learning how eggs and sperm interact, the search for the soul in various glands, organs, and bones of the body, early dissection practices and beliefs, experiments trying to find the weight of the soul, photographers capturing halos and auras, and a tediously long chapter on ectoplasm excreted by charlatan mediums in the early 1900's.Like other reviewers, I feel there is a lot of modern day afterlife science that was left out. I would have enjoyed more interviews with contemporary scientists and mediums, and less on the oddball science dating back to Greek times. If you are trying to get a look at the science of the afterlife in the modern day, this isn't the place.My complaints on the subject matter aside, Roach does make the reading a fun journey. I love her wit and conversational tone. Her footnotes are fabulous! On the subjects she does address, her research is exhaustive.For anyone who likes good non-fiction on unusual subjects, Suburban Safari: A Year on the Lawn, by Hannah Holmes, is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"While this book was at times witty, charming, and thought-provoking, mostly it was a very cumbersome read. The thoughts and ideas presented kept going around in circles like something that goes around in circles a lot!! The endless footnotes (nearly every page) kept interrupting what little logical flow sporadically existed. While the footnotes did give the impression that well researched material was being presented, they crossed the line from footnote/s into foot fungus. A persistent itching, that never seems to go away. The end result was that I could only read about 20 pages at a time, before I became uninterested in what might come next. The time I wasted could have been better spent doing my own research on the internet, instead of reading what Mary found in a google search."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"There's an old adage that says the best way to counter an opponent's position is not to attack it directly, but to ridicule it. I suspect that's precisely what we have here in Mary Roach's latest tome, Spook; Science Tackles the Afterlife.Ms. Roach carefully positions herself as an open-minded investigator, but it is quickly apparent that she is, in fact, nothing more than a master debunker who uses wit and her good-natured sense of fun to disembowel the entire paranormal realm. So good is she at ridiculing almost every aspect of the issue that after it was all over, even I came away certain that the entire subject was bunk, despite having been (and remaining) a firm believer in the post-mortem existence of the personality. It was a fine demonstration of the awesome power of satire to make almost anything look silly.The question it leaves me with, however, is what it is exactly she is trying to achieve with this book. Is she really searching for evidence of post-mortem existence or simply trying to demonstrate how nearly everyone associated with the possibility is either a conn artist, daft or hopelessly eccentric? Even two of the paranormal community's most respected investigators, Dr. Ian Stevenson (reincarnation researcher for the last forty years) and Dr. Gary Schwartz (author of the ground-breaking and much maligned book, The Afterlife Experiments) come across as looking either senile and gullible (in Stevenson's case) or a little kooky (in Schwartz' case; she calls him \\"...a pooh bear among the skeptic society eyesores.\\") Unfortunately, she doesn't really examine either man's work in detail, preferring to stick to superficialities and problem areas, rather than delve into the less amusing realm of established, solid, data. She sounds more like a ringer sent over from Skeptical Inquirer more than anything else, but that's just an opinion.Not that I didn't learn a lot from this book, or even find myself, at points, enjoying it. Roach is, after all, an excellent writer who leads her reader along by the hand to new and ever more hilarious vistas. While I occasionally found her sense of humor to border on the bawdy and even, in some cases, the crude (she has an unusual body orifice and sperm fixation, for example, which is a bit unsettling) for the most part, this book is great fun. Whether it gets one any closer to learning about the paranormal is another question, however, and it must not be taken for anything other than what it is: a light hearted and dismissive romp of a subject seriously in need of more balanced and careful consideration. This book won't give you that, but you will have fun reading it anyway."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"I'd read Mary Roach's book Stiff last year and really enjoyed it. I have to admit that deep down, I have a weird interest in the morbid, and her take (not too heavy, somewhat conversational) on the different things that happened to bodies after they died (other than being buried) was interesting and fun.I just finished her latest book Spook, however, and had almost the opposite reaction. In the book, she takes her conversational writing at least two steps beyond what it was in her other book and the result is really annoying. Instead of coming across as a curious outsider, she seems rather condescending to many (if not most) of the subjects she interviews. Although the people that she talks to are obviously involved in rather strange (and even non-scientific) pursuits of trying to commune with / prove the existence of the afterlife, her mocking tone is barely concealed most of time and rather frustrating.To top it off, there seems to be a rather base obsession with completely random minutiae in the book (much of it related to toilet-humor) that sidetracks the narrative and makes the book even harder to read. Not very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"I came to Roach's new book as a fan of her earlier Stiff and she did not disappoint my high expectations, but I think my satisfaction this time came mostly from having Roach as a companion. In the first book her eye for the quirky was important but I also enjoyed the information she shared just as much. This time there isn't really that much science to digest, it's her writing, her pursuit of her subject, her observations that really make the book worth reading."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"What a waste of paper. I was in the airport and picked up this book. Shame on you Ms. Roach. This is a poorly written, unintelligent work. Please, next time use what is in between your ears to research and craft what you are trying to convey. What I got instead was a barfbag of poorly written ghost stories that went nowhere. No developed thesis to be found. Nothing I couldn't have gleaned from a chat with a half drunk barfly.Recast this book Ms. Roach."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"I loved this book. Mary Roach explores the science related to life after death with a wry, humorous, and perceptive eye. She examines in turn the concepts of reincarnation, communicating with long dead spirits, hauntings and other paranormal \\"after-dead\\" topics with the perspective of someone who doesn't specifically believe or not believe. She's tries to remain skeptical but not obnoxiously so. So many of these types of non-fiction books have a clear bias either believing or not believing in the paranormal. It's refreshing to read a book where the author has an open mind. The book is chock full of interesting anecdotes, footnotes, quotes and research. But what really sets this book apart is the humor. In almost every chapter I laughed out loud more than once. Whether describing her experiences attending \\"medium\\" school, interviewing scientists on subjects including quantum physics or traveling through the deep south to investigate a haunting, her ability to see humor everywhere around here including in herself is a pleasant contrast to many non-fiction science books that are as dry as a bone. I recommend it highly and also recommend her other books:Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and SexandStiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers.

Spook is exceptional in both depth and breadth. For me, Mary Roach is what you would have if you combined Michio Kaku and David Sedaris.In this clever study of what happens to our spirit and/or soul after death, she presents a witty and entertaining look 12 different arenas that deal directly with after-death. While maintaining a skeptic's edge, Mary nonetheless seems to give the died-in-the-wool (pun intended) believers the benefit of the doubt as she joyfully pursues her research.From the silliness of ectoplasm to the sadness of medium school, the author takes us on an original ride that fascinates while repelling and attracting. I really appreciated the footnotes except that I wished she had explored these side roads a bit more. Oh well...maybe in another Roach book.I hope you find my opinion helpful.Michael L. GoochAuthor of Wingtips with Spurs"},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"The self-deprecating, infinitely-curious Ms. Roach presents a nice mix of the scientific in layman's terms as well as dashes of her eccentric humor. The woman is clearly enjoying herself on this journey of discovery. This is not a book that will answer the big otherworldly questions, but somewhat more of a scattershot inquiry into reincarnation; when does the soul come into being?; (heck) is there such a thing as a soul?; mediums; ghost chasing; and near-death experiences. The author puts her faith (sort-a-speak) in science and its attempts to prove or disprove the existence of an afterlife. I had a smile throughout the entire read. She gently chides some of our history's more morally-challenged flimflam artists as well as an occasional believer who seems to be a few ghouls short in his belfry. Educational, entertaining and funny. You can't really ask for much more than that from a book."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"I really like Mary Roach's writing. I have enjoyed Stiff and Bonk immensely. She does what she does well, and is very objective - but almost to the point of skepticism. I think I wanted her to be a bit more open-minded than she seems - but she is trying very hard to see if beliefs are valid. There is a very fine line there that I commend her for trying to walk. So the lack of star is more for my enjoyment of the book than her skills as a researcher and author."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"Even given the difference in topic between Stiff and Spook, the latter is much less enjoyable. It's not as steady in style and voice as Stiff; Roach swings between goofy personal familiarity and objective prose that becomes long-winded and difficult to follow in one or two spots. Spook also has a Borat Effect absent in Stiff -- I felt uncomfortable when she makes fun of subjects who probably didn't think, while speaking with her, that they would end up fodder for a laugh track."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"This is the first and only Mary Roach book I have ever read so I cannot compare like many of the other reviewers to her other books.I was a little apprehensive about this book as someone who has lost a loved one, the subject of the afterlife is a sensitive spot and I worried that the subject would be treated in such a careless way, that I would only feel upset after reading the book.Ms. Roach surprised me in handling her investigations and findings in a sensitive and yet playful way. I did not feel like she was uncaring in her attempts to learn more and actually took seriously even the craziest of experiments that are going on today in the search for what happens after.If I had to compare the book to anything else I would compare it to a segment from This American Life, the NPR radio show. It is well investigated and Ms. Roach traveled to witness and interview all kinds of people to get a well rounded view.I saw that some of the reviewers felt that it was not well rounded however, I think she did a good job in light of the subject matter. You could devote your entire writing career to the subject of the afterlife and unless you believe in reincarnation, would never fully cover it.After reading this book, I am definitely interested in reading other books by Ms. Roach."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"I love Mary Roach.

Both were immensely readable and enjoyable - 5 stars.SPOOK is not a collection of creepy ghost sightings. Rather, it's the author's first-person description of her one-year survey of the evidence for life after death. It encompasses attempts to discover the soul's seat in the body by dissection and the soul's weight by direct measurement, the soul's visibility as demonstrated by, e.g., x-rays and light diffraction, the nature of ectoplasm, the careers of spirit mediums, telecommunicating with the dead, electromagnetic fields as the possible cause of spirit sightings, ghosts and the law, and current research into near-death experiences.Having read all of Mary's books, SPOOK is the first which left me briefly annoyed. Specifically, the chapter \\"Can You Hear Me Now\\" concerning claimed telecommunications with the dead using both pseudo and genuine technologies - the latter including TVs, alarm clocks, answering machines, sound recorders, computerized spell checkers - was an exercise in beating a subject to death. Halfway through its thirty-four uncharacteristically rambling pages, I wanted to scream \\"Enough already!\\" (I mean, I regularly hear voices in my head, but I don't ascribe anything supernatural to them.) The other chapters were commendably brief and to the point.Mary's strength as a writer is that she takes her subjects seriously, but not too seriously. She presents to the reader with a cocked eyebrow and plenty of wry humor. More importantly, she doesn't take herself too seriously either. A paragraph about an experiment to draw passer-bys' attentions to a staged spirit apparition walking through a field, in one case the costumed \\"ghost\\" being followed by a small herd of cows, is footnoted thus:\\"This comes as no surprise to yours truly, who has twice, on separate continents, carried out an experiment designed to prove the considerable curiosity of cows. This is an experiment I urge you to repeat, simply for the giddy thrill of it. Go into a pasture where cows are grazing in the distance. Shout to get their attention and then suddenly lie down. The moment you do, they will hurry over to investigate, encircling you and staring down at you with unmitigated bovine fascination.\\"Check for moo pies when lying down, though.Roach obviously enjoys researching for her various books. The fact that she has so much fun doing so ensures a volume that'll be no less than four stars, and will most likely deserve five. That's why I'll continue to purchase and read anything she writes."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"I had high expectations for this book. But it ended up reminding me of Christine Wicker's \\"Lily Dale\\" book. And I didn't like that one.

It was not what I expected from Roach at all."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"This book is interesting and well written, in true Mary Roach style.

A fun read, for sure - looking forward to \\"Stiff\\"."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"I agree with other reviewers that this book isn't as good as Roach's Stiff. But then Stiff is an excellent book, so it's tough to live up to. I also agree that this book doesn't cover every single aspect of the afterlife, but it doesn't claim to. Roach's approach is more episodic and anecdotal, and that's just fine.What this book does do is give a very entertaining view of how science and pseudoscience have dealt with the question of whether the human soul exists, and whether there is some kind of afterlife. Roach does go off on a variety of side-trips, but they're so much fun that the reader is happy to accompany her, even if they don't lead to the book's actual goal.In other hands, I probably wouldn't have enjoyed this topic. But Roach is a very, very funny writer. And, while she strives to maintain objectivity, she also never takes herself too seriously.I think the book's biggest downside is that in some places, Roach does drag on a bit. I got a little tired of reading about mediums. However, most of the book is quite lively (no pun intended!).After you read this book, your views on afterlife likely won't change. But you will have learned quite a bit about reincarnation, seances, soul-weighing, and near-death experiences, among other things, and you will have had a really good time."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"I expected a more serious look at this question, that would really make me think about my own assumptions about what happens after death. But, I felt the book was just a forum for the author to make fun of various beliefs. Mary Roach does have a great sense of humor, but if the intent was a light approach, then a more coherent set of explorations would have made a better read. I wasn't quite sure what the point of the book was, and even with re-set expectations, I don't think it was worth the time to read."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"Why, oh Why, did I buy another book from this author? I read \\"Packing for Mars\\", I should've known better than to buy another one.I blame myself, I already knew her style, I already knew she tries to be funny at least once every sentence (sometimes succeeding, but wow... relentless), and I already knew that \\"Science\\" is not really part of her genre, regardless of what her titles suggest.What's bad?Well... endless text is given to such ridiculousness as seances, ectoplasm, and such dribble.What's good?It ends. But even then I was faced with the grim reality of my actions. I bought a second book by Mary Roach.That is exactly like sticking your hand in a fire for the second time. Hurts, and serves you right."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"For as far back as history reaches, it seems that humans have considered what happens to the soul after death. Different cultures and civilizations have come up with diverse explanations for the journey that the soul might make once death occurs, and some of these explanations have become the basis for entire spiritual belief systems and religions. In her second book, Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife, author Mary Roach takes a skeptical look at modern views of the afterlife from all over the world, and researches what information it is that believers have presented as evidence for these views. Her journey takes her from a reported case of reincarnation in India, to the University of Virginia to explore Near Death Experiences; from trying to record the spirits of the Donner party in the Sierra Mountains, to Massachusetts to investigate research regarding the weight of the human soul.In one of the earliest chapters of the book, Roach travels to India to learn about reincarnation, and, specifically, a purported case of a young boy who is supposed to be the reincarnation of a dead factory worker. Right away, readers are confronted with the difficulty of applying science to the afterlife. As Roach says, \\"Like most psychological and philosophical theories, reincarnation can't be proved in a lab.\\" With her Indian guide, Dr. Rawat, Roach visits the boy, Aishwary. Aishwary, his family, and many others, maintain that he is the reincarnation of a factory worker named Veerpal. The man had died a violent death from electrocution not long before Aishwary was born, and, as Dr. Rawat explains, violent deaths are often typical in reported cases of reincarnation. Apparently the child began talking about people from his previous existence around the age of three, which is also fairly typical as one researcher has found: \\"Ninety-five percent of the children in Stevenson's cases began talking about a previous existence between the ages of two and four, and started to forget about it all by age five\\" (Roach, 26).So much of this case, and other similar cases, are based on what young children have said and what their parents can recall them saying, since they often do not write down specifics. Researchers then have the task of trying to sort through all of this information and come to an objective conclusion. Not only that, the topic of the afterlife, and of course of the idea that a person's soul may live on in this world through reincarnation, is an emotionally charged and sensitive topic.However, Roach does an excellent job of laying out the situations she encounters for her readers. She never fully debunks any claims, yet never commits to any either: her book is more an exploration of the different views of the afterlife than a conclusion to which may be valid. As Roach says herself in the introduction, \\"I'm trying hard not to make assumptions, not to have an agenda\\" (14).This is especially clear when, at one point in the story, Roach delves into her research experience by enrolling in medium school. Because Roach does not have a true agenda, she is free to explore all types of avenues of thought through her book and research. She resolves to commit to trying to connect with her potential skills as a medium. She works hard within her medium classes, even if she is somewhat skeptical of her abilities and the abilities of her fellow classmates. At the end of her experience with the medium school, Roach reflects, \\"I have learned that I was wrong about mediums. I no longer think they are intentionally duping their clients. I believe that they believe, honestly and with conviction, that they are getting information from paranormal sources\\" (177). Though Roach is skeptical, she goes into each experience with an open mind and fresh interest. She not only explores the concept of a potential journey that the soul makes after death, but her experiences throughout the book also open her eyes to the world around her, and allow her and her readers to understand various beliefs and the people who possess them.Roach is extraordinarily curious throughout the book of the different takes on the afterlife, but maintains a skeptical, somewhat playful tone. She often has sarcastic side- comments and humorous insights that keep the book light, which is quite the feat considering the topic. Her footnotes are also not only informational, but intriguing, tidbits scattered throughout the narrative. Overall, the book is an entirely interesting, entertaining read that is also exceptionally well written. The book is less focused on the science of the matter itself than on the journey of discovery.Roach's narrative is for anyone who would like an engaging read regarding the human soul and the possibility of an afterlife. For those who might be wary to pick up a book shelved in the \\"Science\\" section of the bookstore for a recreational read, they should be pleasantly surprised at the ease and entertainment value of Spook."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"I bought this book for a club read and did not enjoy it at all.

It is fun and funny and informative. Though not exhaustive, her research was pretty inclusive. The book has been called \\"anecdotal\\" but what else could you possibly call stories about this subject????? All they can possibly be is anecdotes. Questions aren't all answered but there are some pretty good explanations that themselves bring up more question.If you don't expect this to be the definitive book with a definitive answer waiting in the pages but more informative with humor about the biggest question that we all have then you will enjoy it.

Mary Roach is someone I'd like to have to dinner. What a great sense of topic and humor. I can't wait to read Bonk."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"Interesting topic, and the logical follow-up to her previous book, Stiff: the Curious Lives of Human Cadavers. But I thought the title \\"Spook\\" was rather misleading; perhaps \\"Soul\\" or \\"Spirit\\" would have been more apt. And that misnomer lead to my greatest frustration with the book, I thought it would be more about ghosts, hauntings, that side of the afterlife. Roach's quips are out in-force in this book, more than the gently humor she shows in STiff, and the book is actually less enjoyable as a result. Her humor is always biting, but seldom appropriate and often distracting. Still, the majority of the book, about 70%, was highly entertaining and educational."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"This is a fairly comprehensive review, from a (mostly) western European perspective, of the efforts made to communicate with the dead, and to ascertain the existence of ghosts. It does a good job of describing the legitimate and the fraudulent. Although written with some levity, it does bog down somewhat midway through the book because it is apparent that the writer is a determined skeptic, and it is evident before the end of each section, except perhaps for the last one, that the outcome is going to be of yet another fraud exposed, or another means of communicating with the dead debunked. It is in some sense a depressing book because it talks about our existence after death, and how, in all probability, we will never know what lies beyond until, well, we're dead."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"Publisher's Weekly hit the nail on the head, calling the audio book version, \\"a grating listen.\\" Quigley's snarky tone, distracting dialects and insistence on telegraphing the funny parts clash with Roach's deadpan writing style to the point where I had to give it up -- I couldn't even concentrate on the content. I love reading Mary Roach's books, and very much enjoyed listening to \\"Bonk\\" but this was flat-out unendurable."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"This book didn't cover the information that I had originally thought it would. With a name like Spook, I had expected Ms. Roach to go undercover and research along with paranormal investigators (or maybe that's just me watching too much Ghost Hunters). Instead, she takes different parts of the afterlife, such as reincarnation, EVP's and focuses briefly on a different subject each chapter.The first chapter, You Again, details her trip to India where she explores reincarnation. More specifically, she joins another researcher who is trying to see if a young boy is really a reincarnated villager from another town.The next, is The Little Man Inside the Sperm, Or Possibly the Big Toe. This chapter was somewhat odd and explained the beliefs through history of where the soul came from and the belief that it was mainly located inside sperm.How to Weigh the Soul, was just that. An exploration through various scientists attempts to weight the sould as it was leaving a dead body.The next chapter, A Vienna Sausage Affair, moved on to what the soul might look like, and the colors it would have if it were seen.Hard to Swallow, covered ectoplasm, or at least in this book, debunking ectoplasm and showing the various contrivances Mediums often made to \\"create\\" ectoplasm.Continuing on that aspect was The Large Claims of the Medium which she watched researchers perform experiments on well known mediums and there results and even had some experiences herself. She follows this with the next chapter Soul in a Dunce Cap where she enrolls herself skeptically in Medium school.Can You Hear Me Now, briefly covers the use of EVP's (Electronic Voice Phenomenon) in researching through records and other devices. More specifically, she joins a team who are trying to collect EVP's of the Donnor mountain party.Inside the Haunt Box, she subjects herself to high EMF fields in a controlled research. EMF is electro-magnetic frequency. The chapter Listening to Casper takes this a bit further to specific locations.Chaffin v. the Dead Guy in the Overcoat details a families experience with a ghost having appeared and showing a \\"new\\" will in order to contest the unfair inheritance that had been executed to the family. She uses an expert witness as part of her debunking.The last chapter, Six Feet Over, details her research into near death experiences and the research that is currently being done on them. She is allowed to witness one such experiment but doesn't actually give a great deal of information about it.While her books are easy to read and contain quite a bit of humor (some not even relating to the topic) I found that she is not very objective. In spite of her claiming in the beginning that this was not a book for debunking, and in the end saying she doesn't know what to think, this book seemed to poke a lot of fun and strongly try to debunk everything that she was studying. In order to truly be objective, she should have offered evidence for the other side of the debate as well instead of poking fun at those researchers she did work with who did believe.While it is a bit of a tedious read due the sheer amount of research and peoples names, places, etc. since she is not an expert she tells it so anyone might understand it. She is no more an expert than any regular person reading the book would be and that makes it easier to understand what she is trying to explain.While I enjoyed the premise of the book and certain ideas that came through, the blatant objectivity of it made it a less than stellar read for me.Spook: Science Tackles the AfterlifeCopyright 2005298 pages"},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"This was a very engaging read.Not too long ago, I read a book about ghosts written by a \\"true believer\\". I was, to say the least, disappointed in it. (You should be able to read my review here: [...])\\"Spook\\" was a breath a fresh air after that one. Mary Roach is NOT a true believer, but she seems fascinated by the possibility of life after death. I could identify with that.I consistently got the feeling that she was listening/reading during her research with eyebrows raised thinking; \\"REALLY?!?! You HONESTLY believe(d) that?!?\\"Again, I could identify.While not as clinical as I was expecting/hoping, it's still very entertaining and while no real conclusions are drawn, you still get the sense that although these phenomena may not be quantifiable, wholesale acceptance is a foolish slant to keep."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"This isn't a serious scientific book. It's not even close. Yes, it's billed as that with the science tackles the afterlife subtitle but you probably need to think about Penn and Teller's Showtime series. It's more along those lines. It's not supposed to be serious but it's not funny either. So I'm not sure where Mary Roach wanted to go with this book. It's awful. She uses Google as her sources but yet she attempts to tackle a serious subject and speaks to serious people. Not sure. Just didn't enjoy this book. I doubt I try another one of her books even though friends have said that Stiff is better. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"It required very little convincing for me to immediately delve into \\"Spook,\\" Mary Roach's sophomore literary effort. Her enthusiasm for her material is evident in her first book, \\"Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavars.\\" Like \\"Stiff\\", \\"Spook\\" is a compendium of wit, morbidity, and hilarious anectdotes which converge to form a collection of loosely related (in fact, afterlife is often the sole connector) examinations of what, exactly, actually happens when we die. Ultimately, Roach seeks to answer what really may be the 'ultimate question': Is there an afterlife? While her attempts are ultimately futile in a definitive scientific answer, the conclusion is generally that something happens after death. What this something is remains ambigious - either because we do not have the science to understand, or have not developed an adequate study method.Each section ('chapter' would be a misnomer , as they tend to be 20 - 30 pages in length) examines different methodologies of 'studying,' using what seems to be a generally loose version of the scientific method, the afterlife. The book begins in an anticlimactic fashion, with Roach's journey to follow an Indian researcher, who seeks to interview and categorize supposed instances of reincarnation. It is unfortunate that this chapter is the first delve into the material, as of all the sections, it seems to be the unflattering odd-duck: it is slow, verbose, and not as sharp with its language.The book goes on to considerably better itself in subsequent chapters. In contrast to \\"Stiff,\\" \\"Spook\\" improves throgh the course of the book, the humor never becomes forced. The greater inclusion of her opinions, thoughts, and foibles. Roach explores studies of the afterlife ranging from the infamous '21 gram' experiment, to scientists studying the effect of electromagnetic and infrasound upon the human brain. She is brazen with her mistakes and is never aloof with her viewpoints. Rather than blindly following, or outright denying, what is presented throughout the book, she is objective with her analysis.Roach is talented at writing, for sure, and the inclusion of tangential stories and factoids keep the material fresh. The footnotes are not to be missed: each contains a snippet of Roach's wry, delightful insight paired with a quasi-related factoid. Indeed, the footnotes remain a gem of the book, housing some of the funnier tales of Roach's research.My own praise aside, there are a few shortfalls to \\"Spook.\\" First, Mary Roach is evidently at the the very start of her foray into the afterlife (even explicitely stating such in the epilogue). Her explanations for experiments read considerably differently than her usual prose: this literary behavior indicates (to me, at least) that she is pulling her definitions from other sources, and only superficially rewriting them. While Roach is clearly comfortable with her own prose, her tone shifts dramatically when it comes to explaining more in-depth science. The book,as well, tends to lack in any in-depth analysis. Roach is candid with her responses and reactions, but only superficially examines the experiment setups. She is slow to question or needle her subjects on their work, which makes her ultimate conclusions about the different scientists and experiments somewhat questionable.Overall, a worthwhile read which delves into some very interesting subject matter. It is light on the 'heavy science,' and tends to fall into the tried-and-true regiment of anectdotes and witty commentary. Does it answer, then, the 'ultimate' question? ...Not entirely. Even if the 'ultimate' answer waffles from person to person, it's sure a lot of fun getting there."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"Primed with the same avid, irreverent curiosity that took her to operating rooms, crash tests and anatomy labs in her first book, \\"Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers,\\" Roach now explores what, if anything, happens to the spirits of the departed.From elaborate scales for measuring the weight of dying consumptives' departing souls to computerized validation of near-death experiences, scientists have devised experiments to detect evidence of the afterlife. The result is, if possible, even funnier than \\"Stiff,\\" although not as satisfyingly informative. Given the nature of the quest, how could it be?Roach talks to the families of reincarnated laborers in India, attends medium school in England, helps out with a group effort to commune with the cannibalistic Donner party in California, and subjects her head to low frequency sound waves in an attempt to view a ghost for herself.Along the way, she comes to realize that conviction is mostly a matter of interpretation. After attending the school for budding psychics she reflects that she was wrong in her view of all mediums as charlatans. \\"I believe that they believe, honestly and with conviction, that they are getting information from paranormal sources. It's just a different interpretation of facts. Mediums and the people who believe in them tend to, as the song goes, accentuate the positive. I tend to do the opposite. Maybe they're right. Maybe I am.\\"As she accompanies Dr. Rawat, a retired Indian philosophy professor, on an interview for his study of reincarnation, he explains that the child in question, Aishwary, is typical. At about three he began talking about people from a previous life. Most of the investigated cases are children who begin referring to their past life between 2 and 4 and forget it all by age 5. Aishwary's family believes him to be the reincarnation of a factory worker who lived several villages away and was accidentally electrocuted. Sudden, violent death is another typical factor in remembered lives.The interviews with the boy and his enthusiastic family and the enthusiastic family of the \\"previous personality\\" are inconclusive. Everyone's too enthusiastic. The best subjects, the researchers agree, would come from a culture with no belief in reincarnation. But in those cultures, of course, the child's ramblings would be dismissed as imaginary.Roach moves on to soul weighing, which has a long, if not illustrious history. Its current practitioner is an obstetrics professor at Duke University who is also a quantum physicist and thinks of \\"the consciousness\\" as information content, which has an accepted energy equivalent. Says Roach: \\"Earlier in our talk he prefaced the line \`Quite a few people look at microtubules as what can be considered almost like an abacus for molecular calculation at a subcellular level' with the phrase \`As I'm sure you're aware.' \\"Roach's ability to capture the personalities of her subjects ranks up there with her own insatiable curiosity and sharp-witted humor. And while she delivers numerous facts uncovered in her research - did you know, for instance, that tooth fillings really can pick up radio waves - there isn't room for some of the irresistible tangential stuff, so the narrative is thickly sprinkled with footnotes.Such as this one, picked up in her research on near-death experiences: \\"A celebrity website reports that Elizabeth Taylor saw [ex-husband] Mike Todd during her near-death experience. \`He pushed me back to my life,' she is quoted as saying. Whether this was done for her benefit or his was not clear.\\"But before she gets to the near-death experiences - her personal favorite for \\"a speck of evidence that people leave their bodies when they die\\" - she explores ghost phenomena and comes up with some rather alarming findings for those who live in old houses and think they have ghosts. Electromagnetic fields. Bad, overworked, substandard old wiring can generate them. The EMFs can lower melatonin levels in the brain and (melatonin being an anti-convulsive) leave inhabitants prone to tiny micro seizures and subtle hallucinations. So those who pride themselves on a certain spooky sensibility may simply be more susceptible to micro seizures.Roach leaves her project as she began it - skeptical. But, she says, more open to the possibility of something more. Roach is a delightful companion and guide on a journey that takes in charlatans and true believers as well as scientists willing to risk a dash or more of ridicule for the sake of knowledge. Funny, lively and packed with information, Roach's book is as entertaining as it is thought provoking.--Portsmouth Herald"},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"Don't buy this book - get it from the library and start with pages 293-295. If you can stomach what you read there you might enjoy the rest. The author starts out with what appears to be a fascinating thesis (and unlimited funds) to find out what science has learned about the afterlife. She seems to feel compelled to load each page with mediocre puns which detract from the reading (but which I'm guessing some agent told her were simply clever and marvelous). She seems too bright for the conclusions she shares on pages 293-295. Throughout the book she constantly mentions when her search exceeds her cognitive capacities, particularly in possible relations between matter and consciousness at the particle level. Rather than delving deeper or citing these as the reasons she still \\"believes,\\" she simply says believing is \\"more fun and more hopeful\\" (p. 295) - yuck!

I suppose a lot of it has to do with one's upbringing, beliefs, culture, and religion.The book begins with the concept of reincarnation, an idea that is dubious at best. It seems that the author, Mary Roach, had a hard time believing the occurrence. Of course, with no proof whatsoever, the idea is borderline ludicrous. From there the ideas of mediums, electromagneticism as it relates to hauntings, ghost hunters, conscious weighing, and out of body experiences are all explored.There's even a section of the book dealing with ectoplasm - which immediately made me think of Ghostbusters, and the equal level of realism that movie and this book share. While reading, I began to wonder why there was not a chapter devoted to the Staypuft marshmallow man.The book's idea is a great one with a ton of potential. Unfortunately, it's boring without at least some of the dramatics, regardless of the great research and effort, and weak attemps at comedy. Nobody would want to watch a ghost movie in which the ghost is never seen, and the book's lack of resolution or conclusive findings proves to be borderline pointless since we knew what the book provides to begin with. Maybe next the author can do a book on the mysteries surrounding the alleged heat created by the sun."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"I had expected this book to present an unbiased review of scientific efforts to establish proof of the existence of the soul. However, this book is highly biased in its presentation. Possible non-supernatural explanations get a great deal of latitude, whereas she finds excuses to dismiss any evidence that suggests that the soul does exist.As an example of a non-supernatural explanation, Roach reports on the research of Vic Tandy, who hypothesizes that reports of ghosts are due to people's reactions to very low-frequency sound waves - infrasound. The one haunted site that Roach reports the results from, a cellar under the Coventry Tourist Information Center, does not have any infrasonic readings. There are only infrasound readings in the hallway outside the cellar. Now, if this were the reverse situation (proof of the existence of the soul), Roach would call the experiment a failure and move on. Not here. Instead, she reports Tandy's explanation that people aren't inclined to report ghosts in a well-lit hallway and that they prefer the idea of ghosts being in 14th century cellars. That is just hand-waving, not a scientific explanation either for or against the hypothesis. She also goes on at length comparing how only small numbers of people sense either the ghost or the infrasound (this does not establish a causal equivalence, though that seems to be her implication).On the other hand, when it came to mediums, Roach was very restrictive in what she would consider sufficiently \\"correct\\". In a reading with Allison Dubois (the real life medium that the television show Medium is based on), Roach attempts to connect with her deceased mother. Near the end of the session, Dubois says, \\"I'm showing a metal hourglass, that you turn over. Does your brother have one?\\" Indeed, Roach's brother collects hourglasses. However, although Roach admits being impressed by the accuracy of the statement, Roach has all sorts of issues with Dubois' references to the letter 'K' (Roach's middle name is Catherine with a 'C') and her mother's reference to \\"the man that still has the ring on his finger for her.\\" Her dad never wore a wedding ring. It never seems to occur to Roach that some things might be symbolic rather than literal. And even with the hourglass (which is very specific and certainly cannot be faulted as being a general statement that could be attributed to virtually anyone), Roach complains that it seems an odd image for her mother to send to her. Why not send her birth date or address?Another annoying example was the way Roach dismissed a study on out-of-body projection that had had positive results (144 hits and 83 misses - much better than random chance). The researcher (Osis) and the man doing the projection (Tanous) had both died since the study came out, so she couldn't interview them. Roach summarizes the whole thing by saying, \\"So we are left to conclude that either Tanous was some sort of bizarre on-call living ghost, or Osis was a deluded or sloppy researcher.\\" Maybe Roach was just trying to be humorous (as she does with flip comments throughout the book - and many of them ARE really funny), but in this case it just struck me as a mean put-down for either possible interpretation.I think that the humorous aspect of the book played a huge role in the examples that Roach chose to include. After all, talking about attempts to weigh the soul allowed her to include all manner of bizarre anecdotal material, which provided rich sources for flip remarks. The same with the chapters on ectoplasm and going to a school on mediumship. Perhaps because this was the first book I'd read by Mary Roach, I had certain expectations for a serious exploration of the material that were not met. I read the book through to the end (though at times I debated just chucking it) because most of the cases were interesting on some level. So, if you want a whimsical, humorous, pseudo-scientific discussion of research efforts into the afterlife, you may enjoy reading this book."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"The dedication of this book sort of sets the tone -- For My Parents, Wherever They Are or Aren't.Mary Roach could have been the original doubting Thomas, except that I don't remember him being this funny. From her surprisingly wildly successful book 'Stiff' (about, well, stiffs) she felt she had left readers wondering what the soul was up to while the body was lending a helping hand (or head, or heart) to the betterment of the human race. So she's back with some interesting stories that combine extensive research, a spooky subject, and an ascerbic wit that I find simply wonderful.As she says, this is a book for people who would like very much to believe in a soul and in an afterlife for it to hand around in but who have trouble accepting these things on faith.Don't expect to change your mind from whatever you believe now. The religious, especially those who go around blowing people up because they don't think correctly, will go around blowing people up. Those without the FAITH of even a mustard seed will not suddenly weep with joy as scientific proof convinces every Thomas of his faith.But from front to back you'll have a fun time reading, wondering how people could seriously do these things. Great Fun!"},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"I too am surprised by some people's reactions; for one thing, I think the title alone should tell the reader about the tone of the book. It's not a serious contemplation on the existence of the soul, but rather a fun exploration of all of the quackery and experimental science that has been done in the name of trying to verify the unknowable. As a big fan (but not believer) of things like EVPS and the like, I loved this book. I also liked the silliness; spiritual seekers often take themselves way too seriously and there are some sacred cows out there that need tipping over now and again. It's also a bit of a history of fringe sciences, which is always fun and fascinating."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"I found the book to be glib, superficial and wholly inadequate to the fascinating task of ascertaining the evidence or lack thereof of paranormal phenomena. It was more about Ms. Roach than the subject at hand which was primarily relegated to the status of prop to showcase her dry, sarcastic and ultimately dismissive humor.Anyone who is truly interested in this subject should read the truly superb \\"GhostHunters\\" by Deborah Blum which is a page turning and fascinating account of William James' attempt, in the company of several other prominent scientists, to establish the existence of life after death through scientific methods. Once you are introduced to the remarkable Leonora Piper, a 19th century medium, you will never be able to casually dismiss such phenomena again."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"I was expecting more. given her access tos a diverse group of fascinating but unconventional people, Spook rarely rises above pointing and giggling.Given the skewering Roach gives to her unwitting collaboraters, I wonder how many more books she can write before all doors are slammed in her face."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"Ms. Roach's writing style is certainly very light -- even flip. If you find her style amusing, then you will enjoy her book. I do, and I did enjoy both of her books very much.That said, _Spook_ is a much less substantial book that _Stiff_. This is hardly surprising given that _Stiff_ was concerned with concrete matters (what we *do* with bodies after death), while _Spook_ is concerned with more esoteric issues (what becomes of our 'souls' after death).Myself, I view the paranormal with a great deal of skepticism. I was pleased, overall, with Roach's treatment of the material. She was sometimes a bit more credulous than I would prefer, but she was, in general, more balanced and skeptical than is usually seen in media accounts of the paranormal. She is much more of an observer than she is a debunker. At any rate, I enjoy her writing style so much that I was able to overlook the bits I disagree with.I'm very much looking forward to Roach's next book, whatever it may be."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"If Woody Allen were to write a science book, this would be it. Mary Roach utilizes her enormous wit to make her sometimes highly technical investigations fascinating and fun. She admits to being a skeptic, but suspends disbelief as she investigates the supernatural world. She is enormously fair. She readily admits that the skeptics may be right \\"but they are no fun to go to the graveyard with.\\" So she maintains that spirit of wonder as she exacts the high standard of proof that science demands. If you are looking for validation that ghosts, without a doubt, are watching you sleep, she will not provide that certainty. But she will tell you about the sometimes ingenius ways that spiritualists and paranormal specialists are going about trying to prove it. So her book is somewhat like Lewis Thomas' NOTES OF A BIOLOGY WATCHER in that you get a layman's education on how the soul has been searched for. You get Woody Allen's wit and Carl Sagan's concern for unbiased evidence as you travel through this fascinating culture of afterlife specialists who just may, in the end, be privy to dimensions the rest of us cannot see."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"Although this isn't as interesting a read as Mary Roach's book \\"Stiff\\", it is still a lighthearted look at a subject that many of us wonder about. I thought it would be more about theories on life after death, but it was about methods of the living to contact the dead."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"I read this book in one night. Mary Roach is a superb writer who addresses the possibility of an Afterlife with a scientist's impartial eye and a comedian's deadpan humor. Everyone knows scientists can't write worth a hoot, and thus we have the wonderful Roach to broach the gap between knowledge and entertainment in this uproarious book. Congrats, Mary! I can't wait to see what your next book is..."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"Spook is marred by the kind of humour we find in most college newspapers, to the point that it intrudes so far upon the subject, afterlife research, as to render the actual topic secondary to the attempted humour. This is not what I was looking for, but if you are in the mood for smirking, chatty prose about a dilettante's breezy examination of afterlife research then this book may just be for you."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"Although I liked the book in general, I was aggravated by constantly being diverted by footnotes that only told an anecdote of what she thought was funny. I applaud her for diving right in and experiencing ghost hunting adventures and talking to researchers, but Mary seems to have no respect for people of other cultures or beliefs. BTW I am not a believer, but she should \\"grow up\\" as another reviewer put it. These people are giving her their time, and seem honest and sincere about what they are doing. Mary is not as cute as she thinks she is."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"Perhaps because it was a new york times bestseller, or because someone I know recommended her as an author, i came to the book with high expectations. The book is a fast, easy read, but it is too lightweight for my tastes. Sure, there are a few memorable episodes, and the author certainly went on a fun adventure, but I didn't walk away from the book feeling like I had really learned something. There are so many great science books out there that have similar scope -- picking an interesting topic and then delving in to detail -- but this one certainly doesn't fall into that category. For example, compared to a book such as Your Inner Fish, this book is more of a beach read.Of course, there are a huge number of folks that don't want more scientific depth, but for me I felt that the author could keep her breezy style but also deliver more \\"meat\\" so as to make it a more interesting read."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"I loved Mary Roach's first book, Stiff, about what becomes of our bodies after we die. It was so fresh. It tackled a novel, but sensitive topic in a way that was very funny, but wasn't offensive. On top of that, I learned something. It was sophisticated irreverence.I just learned that Mary has since written two more books and I was very excited to read them. Spook, about science tackling the question of the afterlife and the whether humans truly have an immortal soul seemed like it might be another fresh take on a dicey subject.It wasn't.All of the components that made Roach's sophomoric humor so successful in Stiff are missing in Spook. That form of humor works when you simultaneously demonstrate that you are capable of deeper thinking, analysis and understanding. In that case, it shows that you can work and play on many levels. When you just bring the juvenile humor, you just look juvenile. It's not a good look.Feel free to skip this one, even if you loved Stiff. On the other hand, if you haven't read Stiff, you should, even if you read this book and hated it."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"I was entertained by this book at first because her research covered many areas I was unfamiliar with. I enjoyed that part however I felt like there was much missing. The Author carefully picked the items that already fit into her previous belief system and then rejected everything else. I am glad I read it because I can learn something new from everything...This is overall a very incomplete study of the afterlife........."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"I think it was Bill Murray in Ghostbusters who, during one of their commercials, stared into the camera and said, \\"We're ready to believe you.\\" In Spook, Mary Roach, having already examined dead bodies here on earth in Stiff, turns her attention to one of the oldest of all questions: Is there life after death? The book's subtitle, \\"Science Tackles the Afterlife,\\" is wide of the mark. The characters between the pages of Spook, with the exception of Thomas Edison, who may have entertained some ideas about connecting to the ancestors via new found electrical capabilities, would not by and large not be recognizeable as scientists today. What you do encounter are two groups of people. One group willing to disbelieve but \\"prepared to believe\\" and anxious to demonstrate a life in the hereafter. Another group, represented largely by Mary Roach, who are willing to believe, but reasonably sceptical at the outset. What I was clearly unaware of, until reading Spook, were the sheer variety of mechanisms deployed to ascertain a life in some next phase. Reincarnation, of course, which opens the book, is well-reported, and actually contains some interesting cases, but other areas were new to me. Readers who are unfamiliar with ectoplasmic parties -- I thought Ghostbusters invented it -- and the careful efforts of technicians to determine whether the dead lose weight and to explain that loss by the departure of the soul from the departed will find in Spook an entire underworld of quirky machinations. Actually, one of my favorite passages finds Ms. Roach trying to explain why a particular \\"researcher\\" found that the dead actually gain weight immediately upon extinction. That weight gain prompts Roach to speculate that perhaps the portal to the next life is a Dairy Queen drive-through window. In a nutshell, according to Ms. Roach, this is a book for people who want desperately to believe in a life after death, but who have a difficult time accepting that possibility. By the book's conclusion you are not quite sure where Ms. Roach stands and, fortunately, she provides curious readers with a short summary chapter in which she states that, \\"yes,\\" she would rather believe that not believe, \\"What the hell, I believe in ghosts.\\" I don't know where Ms. Roach's gifts will next take her, She has written about the \\"dead,\\" and now also about the attempt to connect with the spirits of the deceased. I'll likely follow. She brings a genuine personal touch to her work and her humor has an infectious quality about it. These are not typically waters into which I'd venture. It is to Mary Roach's credit that I can wade through them and enjoy the experience."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"This well-written book tackles the search throughout the ages to \\"prove\\" that there is some sort of \\"life\\" after death. It goes through many historical, and some more recent, attempts to do this. Some were obvious frauds: table rappers, estoplasm extruders, etc., but some have no real explanation, even if they are not conclusive on the subject. The author takes a light-hearted approach in many instances, so whether or not you believe in any of the findings, you will have an enjoyable read along the way."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"I agree that Spook was not quite as captivating as Stiff. I found myself drifting off during the section on Spiritualism. Still, pretty much anything Mary Roach writes is worth a glance for her take-you-by-surprise, sharp wit."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"I skimmed through some of the 1-star reviews and they seem to centre on lack of conclusion or lack of substance. Well, if you are looking for confirmation of the soul in Mary Roach's (or anyone's, for that matter) book then you're in for a disappointment. That's not to say the book is no good. Quite the contrary!Roach approached the afterlife from several angles such as reincarnation, near-death experience and medium. I find it interesting and her arguments convincing. It's not hard science (can it actually be?) so I don't understand why some people criticised the book's \\"Science\\" label. She's as balanced and detailed as can be."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"This year for Halloween, I chose to read Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife by Mary Roach. It was a funny book, very entertaining, and I would definitely seek out more by this author.However, (as has been pointed out by other reviewers) science this is not. Ms. Roach did a lot of research on the hilarious work of a number of pseudo-scientists, both historic and recent. And the tales she tells -- e.g., investigating reincarnation in India, examining ectoplasm in Cambridge, trying to weigh a soul, going to medium college -- are fantastic. However, these are all stories of fringe wackos (or at least they should be regarded as fringe wackos).If you are looking for a book that will give you a balanced and impartial exposition on the topic of life after death or a skeptical Houdini-esque deconstruction of various parapsychological claims, then Spook by Mary Roach will not satisfy you. But, if what you want is humorous reporting on the crazy things that people will believe happens during their long nap, then Spook is for you."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"Personally, I could not put it down. It may be just a summary of after life theories, but it was funny and touched on a great variety of speculation. Don't expect to find an answer, but you may very well be surprised by some new 'facts'."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"An often humorous memoir of Roach's efforts to examine scientific investigations into the afterlife.Roach's writing is personable and often laugh-out-loud funny, making the book a quick and entertaining read.But there's little actual information here for anyone curious about how science has been applied to the \\"paranormal\\". Questions of infrasound and electromagnetic perception causing people to think they're experiencing ghosts are fascinating, but not discussed in much depth. And none of the afterlife investigations Roach discusses seem valid in the least -- which isn't her fault, obviously, but leaves the reader looking for legitimate research disappointed."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"In her acknowledgements at the end of the book, Mary Roach identifies the mindset that I think makes her books (this andStiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers) successful despite the seemingly superficial investigation (accompanied by self-admitted Google searches) of her subject matters: she approaches the use of bodies by science and the attempts to scientifically prove life after death from the perspective of the novice, out to learn a thing or two.Does this make either of her two books in-depth studies? Of course not, and though her hasty conclusions at the end do her disservice, this book comes across as a pleasant read into some of the oddities involved in the world of paranormal investigation, from tests of random images that would be visible only to out-of-body spirits above the ceiling to mediums who might have second stomachs to let them cough up ectoplasm on command. For this book especially, the subject of psychics and mediums and those who are aching to prove that they are anything more than yahoos is prime material to spotlight some fools and con artists.Of course, there are some somewhat serious endeavors to try to prove the reality of spiritual visitations, from the possibilities of electromagentism or subaural frequencies on the brain, as well as an interesting look into a legal case that seemed to confirm the possibility that a ghost could have some say over the state of his estate. While the cases in this book were not as in-depth as inStiff, the previous book was almost scary at times for its depth. Roach seems to be treading an area that doesn't let her win very easily--if she gets into too much depth, her interest may seem a little too morbid (like listening to the head ofThe Darwin Awards, who seems a little too amused by these particular deaths), but if she moves quickly through some other subjects, she comes across as being a little too glib and quick to move on. As I mentioned before, the regular Google references almost sounds like product placement as well as making her research sound superficial (though it could be worse with regular Wikipedia citations), but Roach's wit and curiosity are what carry this book. She takes a rather natural skepticism, wanting some answers but willing to let people take their best shots, and more often than not they show their bias and need to excuse rather than scientific curiosity. And along the way, Roach gets to amuse with tidbits about people's conception of science and fact and the way they will bend it into something alien when trying to apply it to paranormal activity. While the side of science does not score highly either, mainly because it has been put in the position of trying to prove a negative (that there AREN'T connections being made with the other world), Roach gives some intetresting cases for both sides, and while she works with the idea that certainty is tough to have in this subject matter, she does show that some well deserved cheap shots can be taken at those who take this area a little too seriously."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"First of all, I am stunned at some of the less-than-enthusiastic reviews of this book. Mary Roach is a very funny writer. I found myself laughing aloud so often while reading Spook that I worried about annoying people around me. Okay, I really didn't worry about it, but they were probably annoyed. Roach (unfortunate last name) tackles a subject that so many people take for granted--either in the no-questions-asked \\"there is an afterlife\\" category or the opposite point of view--which really deserves more scientific or just plain thoughtful scrutiny.Clearly, her aim here was to entertain as well as enlighten, but she wasn't writing an exhaustive inquiry (Who would really want to read that?). What she created is a spirited (yes, the pun is intentional) and hilarious look at the various ways people have tried to demonstrate or prove that there is life after death. Even if you're not interested in the subject, the author's wonderfully wry exploration of mediums, ghosts, near-death experiences, and the like is fascinating and just plain funny. When you're through reading it, you feel like you've been on a trip with an old friend who never fails to make you laugh, no matter what's happened along the way.And if you happen to read this review, Mary, please pardon my comment on your unfortunate last name. Mine is Bacon, so I know about unfortunate last names and all the jokes you have to endure as a kid."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"Roach tries, in this book, to avoid reporting the fixed opinions of the believer and the skeptic. She uses 'skeptic' a bit differently than i usually do, but at least this isn't a whitewash for either side. Usually books on this topic either fully endorse the conclusions of the experience, or completely trash them.Mary holds out for some actual evidence that will stand up to objective scrutiny. She doesn't seem to find any, but does show us where such things have been in vogue, or grabbed headlines or pissed off researchers, and so on. I found it very interesting.I enjoyed the close of her chapter where she attended medium school. Basically, she feels, now, that believers and skeptics differ not in sincerity, but in how they differently evaluate a common set of facts."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"Spook, to me, was an interesting title for a book. Being a huge fan of Carl Sagan's Demon Haunted World, I was hoping for something similar. Mary Roach does discuss a wide variety of topics of the supernatural world. My favorite section of the book was that of reincarnation.Typically I really enjoy the format of short essays that pull together interesting topics, and this book does this to a good extent. What I felt a little shortchanged on was that the themes weren't always pulled together, but were of similar topics.I did enjoy the variety of essays. I think this is an excellent book to pick up in a library. This would be a great book to read when your waiting for a doctor appointment, or when you do not want to get sucked into a large novel. If you are looking for a similar theme, I would recommend Carl Sagan's Demon Haunted World over this title."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"Despite the less than fantastic customer reviews this book has had so far, I bought it anyway mainly because I find the subtitle irresistible. I have read it and here is my evaluation. On the positive side, just about every aspect of potential beyond-the-grave manifestations, at least that I can think of, seems to have been covered in this book. Interviews have been conducted with researchers in just about every one of these areas - most with varying degrees of eccentricity but all very serious and many of them well-respected in other more \\"conventional\\" fields of research. Very original, and indeed plausible, ideas have been seriously offered by these researchers. On the negative side, not all areas covered have been treated equally in the book. For example, the first chapter, on reincarnation, had me wishing that I'd never bought this book - to me, reading that chapter was a complete waste of time. Fortunately, the remaining chapters were much better. Also, I must agree with other reviewers that there is quite a lot of totally unnecessary chatter sprinkled everywhere - verbiage that adds nothing to the issue at hand. Also, the writing style is perhaps a bit too tongue-in-cheek for my taste on such a subject - I would have hoped for something a tad more serious. So, had the book been, say, seventy-five to one hundred pages shorter and the information presented more scientifically but without sacrificing an engaging writing style, it would have made a for a better book. But because, I believe, the positive still outweighs the negative, I feel that four stars is a fair rating. Overall, I do feel that I have learned something from this book and thus I am happy to have read it."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"While I greatly enjoyed real content of the book, for me one of the better parts was the slamming introduction. In it, Mary Roach lays out a case for believing in her God, Science. Even if you're not going to read the book, go to a bookstore and read the intro, it's really worth it."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"Mary Roach is hilariously irreverent. Who would have thought that the serious attempts at contacting the dead could be so knee-slapping, knickers-wetting funny! Mary does do due diligence and follows the route of proper research and interviews but it is her asides that had me splitting mine. I do think she is a bit too sceptical and there are some interesting scientific efforts to look at this issue but nonetheless it's a good read."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"\\"Spook\\" is a gentle and humorous look at the broad spectrum of supposedly-supernatural phenomena. It does not attempt to debunk all supernatural events as rubbish, but it does show how ordinary people can be easily seduced into attributing supernatural attributes to events that can be explained scientifically."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"Basically it was boring, useless information that never really seemed to come to a point."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"Length:: 4:14 MinsHi, this is Joanne, a bioengineering instructor at the University of Illinois.

This book is a great examination of the \\"unknown\\" component of the afterlife. The scientific slant is very weighty, but Roach adds a great deal of humor and her own take of her beliefs."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"_Stiff_ was fun, but I liked this one better. I don't know that it's great science, great journalism or even great writing, but Roach intends the reader to know her pretty well as a person after reading one of her books. She tells you what she's thinking, especially if it's funny in a mildly embarrassing sort of way. She seems to do the same thing during her interviews, and I think it disarms people into opening up to her.Her research style is idiosyncratic and serendipitous. She's happy to follow a lead wherever it takes her, whether that's a village in India, or the Donner Picnic Ground (really!), or a class in becoming a medium. This book absolutely does not answer any questions about the afterlife definitively, or even tentatively. But it may be unique in that the author did not approach the subject with a fixed belief in any afterlife -- or absence of afterlife. It is refreshing.I read this for a book group, after a friend warned me it wasn't nearly as good as _Stiff_. So if you are avoiding this one because you don't want to be let down, take a flyer on it. You might be pleasantly surprised."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"If you've read much about \\"ghost hunting,\\" or the paranormal, you'll learn very little from this book. While I found Mary Roach's book Stiff very interesting and funny, this book was basically a repeat of stuff I'd read elsewhere, and after a while, her sense of humor (mostly puns) gets very, very old."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"This book is a work of academia written by a talented journalist. Mary Roach's eminently readable style makes for an interesting journey into the spooky realms beyond the grave. Her tales of [deceptive] mediums, obsessed scientists, and apparently pointless hauntings bring some memorable characters to life (or not, as the case may be), and the chapter on ensoulment should be read by anyone who plans to have an intelligent dialogue on abortion. Her research is impressive and her citations impeccable. But when all is said and done, the evidence for an afterlife remains slim to negligible. Worth reading if you have an interest in the subject, but not as riveting as her previous effort, \\"Stiff\\"."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"Forgive me dear reader, I have to speak to Roach's conclusions.She explores the question: Is there life after death, and if there is what form does it take. Early on, she tries to make some stab at the fact that she is making a scientific effort at the issue. She goes all over and talks to all sorts of people in various psychical research areas like ghosts, near-death experiences, medium-ship and others. She finds that much of what we humans have tried to explain as ghosts or out of body experiences can be traced to physical phenomenon. This may not be fun, but at least it is honest.But then she cops out. After starting out as a skeptic, her researches have proved to her--something. You know, why the hell not, I believe in ghosts now. In spite of the all the counter evidence, why not. I have a feeling that she wanted to find something -- anything. The best she does is a couple of unverifiable anecdotal stories. The conclusion left me cold.But I was already cool to the author, so the ending just exacerbated the feeling. The topic of the book is a fairly serious subject, but the tone is off. She tells of her studies in this weird, talk-y first person conversationalist form. She then peppers the text with many self-deprecating jokes. The tone and style make it so that whatever the conclusion she draws, it doesn't matter because she obviously knows nothing. I don't understand the idea of undermining your own ethos in a nonfiction work. It doesn't work for me, at all."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"Utterly disappointed in this book. I should have waited to borrow it from the library. I really wanted to like this book. Her previous book, STIFF, was great. She was hilarious! But in this one . . . she came across as \\"condescending\\" and \\"in love with her own wit.\\" All those nasty, patronizing asides while her subjects confided her in earnest belief of life after death. It became really tedious to read. (I was barely skimming the pages by the last chapter.)I'm genuinely interested in the paranormal. (SPOOK seemed such a promising title from a genuinely talented writer.) But this book was nothing but a \\"debunkers\\" wet dream.Some parts were appreciably informative. Like the charlatans she wrote about: phony mediums and cheesecloth ectoplasm. The notion of reincarnation. Figuring out the weight of souls.But as I got further into the book, I got the notion that Mary Roach was enjoying herself at the expense of the people she was interviewing. And that she was out to prove that there is no afterlife. Because ghosts are really nothing more than electromagnetic fields wiggling our eyeballs or that spirit voices are radio transmissions from Belgium-- trapped in a layer of smog or whatever! I mean if you were genuinely trying to get serious about \\"hearing\\" the dead, why would you join a group of tourists who want to record the Donner Party!I think Mary Roach was just milking SPOOKS for some mean-spirited laughs. A generous 2 for this book. Because I just had breakfast.For something completely different but still in the paranormal area, buy THE DEMONOLOGIST instead. A reprint just came out."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"I'm going to switch from the audiobook to a hardcover. The reader is awful! Zips through with ridiculous character voices and odd inflection. Sounds more like an inept standup comic than a professional reader. Avoid the audiobook!"},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"Mary Roach is as entertaining as ever with her journalistic and humorous look at death's possibilities."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"If you want to learn anything about pretty much anything, Spook is not the book for you. Whereas Roach's earlier effort (Stiff) was at once quite funny and packed with interesting details, Spook, though also quite funny, is pretty much totally lacking in the substance area. Why 5 stars then? Because it's a no-brainer to this reader, at least, that MR's principal purpose in writing is to entertain, and only a distant secondarily to inform or instruct. In short, I did not expect to learn much about science, the afterlife, or about approaches to the study of the latter by the former when I picked up a copy of Spook. What I did expect was to be amused, greatly greatly amused. Reading page after page of MR's wry observations and hilarious turns of phrase, I certainly was. Spook is a very fun read."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"When I read Mary Roach's first book, Stiff, I could hardly put it down, so when I heard she had a new book out I immediately placed a hold on it at the library where I work. Am I glad I didn't buy it.As soon as it came in I eagerly started reading. What a disappointment. The humor and writing style that made Stiff so readable are lost here. Instead we're presented with a writer who not only seems to have her mind firmly made up beforehand about the topic but also seems to be writing an essay, craming in way more than enough details and worthless facts. The result is a boring read that I had to force myself to pick up."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"Ms. Roach, in keeping up the pace of her previous book, provides the reader with a humorous and engaging trip through the afterlife. She is a very funny lady and her skeptical sarcasm only serves to embellish the book and gives both the believers and non-believers cause to chuckle while turning the pages from one interesting encounter to the next."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"Would somebody PLEASE tell all of the book stores to move this book out of the science and technology section. Mary Roach is NOT a scientist or science writer. This book is a major disappointment if you expect science or even an understanding of science from the author. It is however an easy read, well suited for a long flight or while sitting in a waiting room. It has the type of humor you expect from the author but not much more. I did NOT like this book beyond the fact that she writes in a nice flowing easy to read style."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"Delivered on all I expected it to be. I learned a little, I groaned a little. A great subway/ airplane read - not for a research paper but will give you something to talk about at your next party. I mean really - Watson thought he had a HALO???"},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"ABSOLUTE NONSENCE.I found this book in the \\"Physics\\" section of Chapters. (Chain book store in Canada.) . Not an iota of scientific effort in Mary's spooky endeavorsIf ever hip-hopping across continents under pretence of scientific research and documenting nonscientific (non-provable, non verifiable, non-predictable) mumbo-jumbo was ever acceptable as how \\"Science Tackles\\" questions then we should all be turning our ears to the Artic Terns or perhaps the Monarch butterfly. These continental travelers may have something more coherent and scientific to relate than Mary's babblings and documentary of her \\"Google\\" searches. To Mary's credit, it must be said, she admits she is no expert on the topic and that should be enough to forgive her seriously unacceptable scientific fallacy. However what peeved me the most is when she junks Quantum Physics. Obviously for Mary Roach the works of John Wheeler (IT from BIT) and Roger Penrose (Shadows of the mind) is just New Age Vanilla Science. Mary would rather dish out to us (dollop upon dollop) her kind of science in which she summarily dismisses whatever is too difficult for her to grasp. Is this how science functions? I really don't care if there life after life or if ghost exists or if mediums work, but when I picked this book from the Physics shelf, I seriously thought the book dealt with the subject matter in a true scientific way. It does not. I am returning this book to the store and request a full refund and more importantly DEMAND it be removed from the science section. BTW Those thinking of the book being spooky or making a good scary ghost topic read... don't even think about it. The only spooky thing in full 300+ pages is Mary herself and perhaps her unsurpassable ability of authoring pages upon pages of oft-incoherent prose."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"A terrifically entertaining book filled with human stories and events that should touch everyone. I'm now better prepared for the afterlife.This was a particularly good book for me to read when I was recently mourning the death of a dear friend, so it may be for others too."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"If you are at all interested in the human body,it's functions and how wonderful a \\"machine\\" it really is.....this is a wonderful reading. What happens to the body when life stops and the blood is still? How can we learn more about how to protect it and prolong it's usefulness? All this and more in this book. I definitely recommend it to all people to read and learn."},{"Title":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife","review":"The two word review: \\"pretty disappointing\\". Ms Roach takes us on a very personal and humorous romp through various aspects of life after death. Reincarnation, spiritualism, psychics, and coginitive scientists all get breezily examined from a very personal perspective. What emerges, though is more of a comedy sketch than a critical examination of the issues. To be fair, she states her intent clearly in the introduction, so you get what she says she will deliver. Although Ms Roach is mostly skeptical (and justifiably so, given the laughable evidence for life after death propagated by many of the characters in the book) there is little in the way of rigorous analysis or comprehensive review of any of the many subjects touched upon. Certainly not what I was looking for in the book, but maybe that was my fault for not reading the intro in the book store.If there is a category somewhere in a book prize for funniest footnotes, this book should be a serious contender."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:W,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],R={key:0},H={key:1};function E(n,e,s,c,r,i){const f=y("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",M,[(t(!0),a(w,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(t(),p(f,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",H,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",R,"See more"))],8,B)):b("",!0)])}const j=u(x,[["render",E],["__scopeId","data-v-ed5a81dc"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/26.md","filePath":"quotes/26.md"}'),q={name:"quotes/26.md"},O=Object.assign(q,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(j)]))}});export{L as __pageData,O as default};
