And \\"Lord of the Barnyard, Killing the fatted calf and arming the aware in the cornbelt\\" was funny, for a long while and it did make me laugh many times..The protagonist, John Kaltenbrunner, was born and raised in Baker, a trash city in no-where land. He has lived a life, continuous with misfortunes and tragic events from even before he was born. As a very young boy he showed extreme interest and talent in running the family farm. School was of no interest, and each hour spent there he thought of as wasted time. As a teenager still in school, his mother Madam Kaltenbrunner falls ill. John helplessly watches how the people from the Methodist church lurks around, takes care of his mother in return for piece after piece of beautiful antique furniture from the farm. I really enjoyed following the war between John and the Methodist church, with Hortense as the focal point.This is certainly not a read for people who like to identify themselves with the story's protagonist, the story is too far off for that. And with over 400 pages of John's insane world - the author outstays his welcome just a little bit..Having said that, I really enjoyed parts of this book, but it is a bizarre more than a funny read.."},{"Title":"Lord of the Barnyard.

That's probably as good a comparison as one can draw. 'Lord of the Barnyard' is, in my opinion, better in every way, and that's not an easy thing to pull off. Egolf's writing style is completely original. A complete lack of true dialogue and the 1st person plural perspective are two almost unnoticeable aspects of the book that make it the most unique book you'll probably ever read. It's got a plot that'll have you on the edge of tears at times and laughing out loud at others. The main character, John Kaltenbrunner, is a classic...on par with Shadow in Neil Gaiman's 'American Gods' and Roland Deschains, of Stephen King's Dark Tower books.

I loved this book for its manic energy and its attention to the details of the assembly line killing and processing of domesticated animals. I can't even imagine standing knee deep in turkey blood slicing off heads all day long for a living. In an odd way this book celebrates individual capitalism and old fashioned gumption like no other. The protagonist studies, tries and fails, tries and succeeds, learns, becomes hopelessly isolated, and gets caught at the wrong end of the paranoia stick more than once. The parallel story track details the assembly line killing of the human spirit which occurs when despair and emotional fragility combine with the quest for the almighty dollar in odd ways in a person's thought process. I enjoyed the energy and the constant seeking for knowledge of the title character. This was truly a fascinating work and I am quite saddened that such an original, twisted, seeking voice has been lost to us all. RIP Tristan."},{"Title":"Lord of the Barnyard. Killing the Fatted Calf and Arming the Aware in the Cornbelt. SIGNED","review":"Surely not the most polished novel that you are likely to read this year, and literary purist will frown at Egolf's overblown style and dialogue-free prose. Egolf is often ham-fisted and can be sloppy with the details (upon reading the climax you'll wonder if Egolf has ever even *seen* a basketball game).But those flaws notwithstanding, Egolf has written an audacious jet-fueled debut which is somehow all the more compelling for it's absurdity. Those reviewers who have criticized the novel have said little which I would directly contradict (no, there is no dialogue; yes, the characters are one dimensional) but somehow the sheer energy and inventiveness of the novel kept me glued throughout its four hundred pages.Lord of the Barnyard is an Appalachian Confederacy of the Dunces on crack cocaine. Egolf uses sheer creativity and his raw intelligence to muscle his way though a rollercoaster plot that takes us on a whirlwind tour of John Kaltenbrunner's backwoods heroism and larger than life exploits.And the novel is funny! It made me laugh!Egolf is a smart writer with talent. Hats off to him for this gutsy first novel, flaws and all; I look forward to reading his future work."},{"Title":"Lord of the Barnyard. Killing the Fatted Calf and Arming the Aware in the Cornbelt. SIGNED","review":"This book was my favorite novel of 1998. Before it hits the american market, the book is already out in dutch translation.Lord of the Barnyard is hard to describe. It is a demolition derby of the soul, a guided tour of hell (no giftshop) and immensely sensitive at that.As every good writer, Egolf has the power to infect you with his worldview. Makes it unescapable. After putting the novel away the world looks like a desolate place. Egolf writes like Marquez on bad acid, or Hunter S. Thompson going cold turkey. Long, weird sentences, summing up years of misery in a couple of strange images. The plot is fascinating albeit incidental, its not the point of this novel. This novel is about the power of writing, about taking the world by its balls and yanking them until it vomits. Dirty, beautiful and unforgettable. Hard to believe this is the first work of a young writer.Buy it, and be amazed. Think the novel as an artform is dead? Think again."},{"Title":"Lord of the Barnyard.

I liked how Egolf expects the reader to be intelligent and I loved how dark his comedy could get.

One of the best books I've read in my lifetime, and I'd recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Lord of the Barnyard. Killing the Fatted Calf and Arming the Aware in the Cornbelt.

It was about the only thing that stopped me from running accross the road in the middle of the night, setting free all the poultry farm chickens, then running back to peel all the lizards off the exterior wall and drowning them in the pool.In Lord of the Barnyard, Egolf weaves a tale of misfortune, destruction, putrification and assertion so involving, intense, and breathless (as much from the narrative as trying to read the free-flowing, pin-wheeling, and exceedingly wordy sentences aloud to my sister) that you can't help but be drawn in. I don't see it as highly likely that even, or especially, John Kaltenbrunner's early exploits would ever be possible, but somehow, it just seems perfecly reasonable.Explaining this book is as impossible as any of John's deeds. I suppose it's fitting that it has yet to be released in the country in which it's set.A book for thinking people who relish the self-mocking edge of post-modernism. But if you're into the surprise twist at the ending thing, or you need to be able to identify with the book's main character/hero, look elsewhere.

There aren't any direct quotes in the book.Second, as you read through the book, watch for certain sections and stories that are told such as John's evaluation and the &quot;unfortunate deckhand&quot;.Third, always keep note of how blatently outrageous the story is as that is part of the entertainment factor.All in all, a great read and well worth getting a hardcover as you'll find yourself refering to it and showing friends your favorite parts.

SIGNED","review":"This first novel starts strong and full of promise and begins to come apart at about the 219 page mark before finally descending into a seemingly amphetamine fueled script treatment for the Dukes of Hazzard. Before that point there are a troll's share of delightful passages and laugh out loud moments. The book goes several pages at a time painting stunningly evocative portraits with the English language as the narrative follows the misadventures of John Kaltenbrunner from pre-birth to the very end. Having worked as a rancher, roughneck, asbestos remover and chicken slaughterer, I have shared all three shifts with every form of dire, grubby human flotsam imaginable and Egolf renders these wage-slave lifers with an accuracy that makes me feel I'm in the trenches shoveling dung and slaughtering hens again. The author has written essentially two novellas in two different voices - had he stopped after the triumphant defeat of the hero at the hands (and body) of a particularly heinous Methodist crone, he would've had a short tragicomedy worthy of high recommendation. As it is, he outstays his welcome, the plot begins to catch wheels in the bog, and I found myself resisting the urge to skim the last 40 pages.As I live 350 miles from the nearest decent bookstore, the buzz and hype surrounding this book escaped me, although it's hard to miss the gushing blurbs from some gatekeepers of literary merit like Salon and Details magazines. In any case, Egolf is no Celine. However, he is a talented writer who could benefit from a more judicious editing (both internal and employed by Grove Press.)"},{"Title":"Lord of the Barnyard.

Adams &quot;Knot Book&quot; in that Livingston covers fewer topics, but goes into more mathematical detail. Livingston also includes many excellent exercises. Were an undergraduate to request that I do a reading course in knot theory with him/her, this would be one of the two books I'd use (Adam's book would be the other).This book is intentionally written at a more elementary level than, say Kaufmann (On Knots), Rolfsen (Knots and Links), Lickorish (Introduction to Knot Theory) or Burde-Zieshcang (Knots), and would be a good &quot;stepping stone&quot; to these classics."},{"Title":"Knot Theory (Mathematical Association of America Textbooks)","review":"I really do enjoy this book - but picked it up as a means of teaching myself Knot Theory... as was the case with many of my text books in college, brevity (for the sake of publishing costs) makes some concepts more of a challenge to grasp.

The opening chapter is a history of knot theory, which is followed by a chapter on the mathematical definition of knots. The remainder of the book is a series of descriptions of knots, how they are represented, classified and the mathematical machinery used to transform them.Very little in the way of deep mathematical knowledge is needed to understand the presentation, one of the most important requirements is the ability to think in spatial terms. Exercises are given at the end of each section although no solutions are provided.Many areas of mathematics began as an abstract theory and after some time, applications are found. Knot theory is an element of this set; one of the applications is that it can be used to describe how proteins fold. A protein is a long chain of connected amino acids, but its' ability to be biochemically active is based on the structure that it folds into after construction. This book is a lively understandable introduction to this fascinating field; it is suitable for self-study or a special topics class in the area of knots."},{"Title":"Knot Theory (Mathematical Association of America Textbooks)","review":"Livingston's book is very concise and dense.

David and John Major are sharing their own personal recommendations with us all. They are offering an intimate tour of the books that have mattered to them. Each essay has an individual approach and when you read it, you feel as if you have had a conversation with the author.Sometimes I am reminded of old friends - books such as Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart that had a profound influence on my thinking when I read it twenty years ago; sometimes I am delighted to find a new book that I didn't know about - such as Louis Begley's Wartime Lies that must go on The List. Then it's nice to remember old favorites such as Raymond Chandler's The Big Sleep. One of the things I like about this book is that this is not a list of classic books that \`ought' to be read - its much more personal than that - broader in range - and much more fun. As I was reading, I found myself saying \\"Oh yes, I remember reading that,\\"- or \\"I must reread that!\\" - or \\"I must remember that one!\\"Each essay elicits a specific response and this review would be too long if I wrote down all my comments.

Now for the rest of us peons, we have to go to work to get the food to get the energy to go to work to get the food....However, 100 One-Night Reads includes a remarkable group of mostly 20th Century authors from around the world and quotes verbatim two pages or so of the books with a little editorializing at the beginning and a short bio of the author at the end.For me, I like about one out of 10 books so maybe by the end of the book I have a list of 10 new books to read. Pretty good (actually, better reading a little yourself rather than buying a book by its cover or what someone thinks about it in a review).So, when I like one of the recommendations I go to the front of the book to the TOC and put a little mark next the the book on the list so I can remember to order the (hopefully) used book. So, at least for me, the purpose of 100 One-Night Reads is actually being achieved.And, it's a very easy read but the editorial tone of the reviewer is a little pedantic (but that's only 5% or 10% -- plus you can just skip it).Overall Grade: B+100 One-Night Reads: A Book Lover's Guide"},{"Title":"100 One-Night Reads: A Book Lover's Guide","review":"As the authors proclaim, this is a book lover's guide. But not everyone will share their tastes.The authors do present one hundred short, informative and entertaining essays on the books they have enjoyed, which they feel others will appreciate as well.I suspect I was not greatly impressed because I have read nearly all the books they recommend, some so many decades ago that I felt truly aged.Many of the suggestions are not -- as the authors admit -- one night reads by any definition.In some ways, I found the range of selections too broad, but that opinion probably reflects my personal tastes.Treated as a descriptive list of the authors' favorites, most readers will discover something they haven't seen or thought of before.

There is at maximum one person who knows, and if he does know, he is unable to communicate it. This is not a case where I can outline the theory, and then ask how well it corresponds to what we know. What the theory is is the central mystery. For example, the theory, Snooks states, employs existential as opposed to deductive models.The above example is the book at maximum wackiness. There are many parts, even whole pages, where the exposition is clear: the discussions of crustal formation (yes, the crust of the earth), Hitler's aims (irrational), the oxygen content of the atmosphere, aggression in men and women (as evidenced by auto accidents), the walls of Jericho, blue-green algae, Henry Thomas Buckle (1821-1862), sea level changes, the Holy Roman Empire, post Keynesians, the ice age, linear time, volcanic eruptions, the nuclear family, Frederick Nietzsche, Joel Mokyr, dinosaurs, dolphins, and the Domesday Book, to name a few examples. The only problem is what the connection of the episode at issue is to the big idea. I know the theory is dynamic, which is why the front cover has charging horses on it, whereas Darwin was static. Dynamism is everywhere - more than one page of the index alone is devoted to dynamism in all its varieties, including \\"dynamics of the earth: formation of crust.\\" Change we learn occurs because of dynamism. I also learned that the theory is \\"economic,\\" and that it involves \\"paradigm shifts,\\" but the theory itself remains hidden from the view of a reviewer trapped in the prison of deductive logic.To take a specific example, Snooks argues, with some persuasion to someone whose knowledge of the subject is limited to the New York Times, that the attempt by many scientists to explain the extinction of dinosaurs by natural catastrophes is unconvincing. But what is Snooks' alternative explanation? Dinosaurs were doomed, he assures us, by \\"having exhausted their dynamic strategies\\" and further dinosaurs \\"suffered from over-expansion owing to the exhaustion of their dynamic opportunities\\" (pp. 77-78). And that's it. With those trenchant observations, Snooks having dispatched the dinosaur issue between pages 76 and 78 as rapidly as an asteroid impact, marches quickly on to tackle the bigger problems. The survival of some organisms, largely unchanged, from long before the era of the dinosaurs is, I presume, because they did not exhaust their dynamic opportunities to not change. Aristotle, who claimed that objects fell towards the earth because it was in their nature to fall, looks like a model of positivist science compared to Snooks.I could go on, but this is enough to convey the point. As we go about the mundane tasks of economic history, trying to prise the occasional nugget of knowledge from hard and stony ground, I am sure we will hear periodically from Graeme Snooks. He will come zooming past, gesticulating wildly and shouting excitedly about new marvelous discoveries made from the comfort of his armchair: discoveries that only he, and possibly Doug North, Herman van der Wee and Stan Engerman, can see and share."},{"Title":"The Dynamic Society: The Sources of Global Change","review":"There are already some good reviews on this book so I will only suggest reading the following books (whose scope is amazingly global) instead of, or in addition to, Snooks' peculiar work: 1) Economy: 1.1 \\"Power and Plenty: Trade, War, and the World Economy in the Second Millennium\\" by Ronald Findlay and Kevin H.

His exploration starts at the beginning of life, some 4 billion years ago. Once we are able to understand the nature of life on earth, we may comprehend the dynamics of human society. The author is not afraid to challenge modern evolutionists by his claim that the development path of life can be explained by an empirical economic model. Charles Darwin's natural selection hypothesis was, in fact, influenced by Adam Smith. Evolution is, then, an economic rather than a physical problem - the struggle by species to gain access to scarce natural resources in order to survive.Snooks's economic model is based on the concept of 'materialist man'. The basic driving force of mankind is to maximise the probability of survival and material prosperity (accumulation and consumption of tangible goods and services) over his lifetime. Materialist man is not the homo economicus of economic theory. Snooks is very explicit about its value. Short-run equilibrium analyses contribute very little to our knowledge about long run dynamic processes.Materialist man tries to satisfy his demands in a highly competitive world, to which end he uses dynamic strategies: family multiplication, technology, conquest, and commerce. These choices are rational, because they aim at the maximisation of material returns, given expected benefits and costs. The ambitions of materialist man in human society have resulted in three technological paradigms: the Paleolithic Revolution (some 1.6 million years ago), the Neolithic Revolution (about 10600 years ago) and the Industrial Revolution (200 years ago). These fundamental changes in economic systems were the outcome of different dynamic mechanisms and dynamic strategies . . .At the end of his fascinating and exciting exploration, Snooks teaches the lessons of dynamic society. His evidence suggests that human nature is genetically determined, unchanging, and unchangeable. Without the materialistic drive, the survival of mankind during the past millions of years would not have been possible. The world of today is, perhaps, facing the exhaustion of the industrial paradigm, but according to Snooks the dynamic society provides an answer. In his view the stationary state, in which there is no room for further technologically based expansion, can only be laid down by ecological dictatorship. However, if we stop technological change as a dominant strategy, there is only one remaining, undesirable, strategy left over: conquest, a dangerous game in the nuclear era. Snooks believes that our environment needs protection, but we should not forget what history tells us. The dynamic society will produce a fourth paradigm shift, and it will come soon. This conclusion is based on the fact that the technological shift of the Industrial Revolution took only 100 years. It is uncertain what this will bring us. According to Snooks a substitution of solar energy for fossil-fuel energy is plausible.This well-documented book has much to offer and is highly recommended. Why should economists, as Snooks puts it ironically, when historical process is mentioned, lose interest and return to their computers?"},{"Title":"The Dynamic Society: The Sources of Global Change","review":"Professor Snooks has produced a magnum opus in \\"The Dynamic Society\\". He forwards an existential (empirical, inductive)economic model that elucidates not only the passage of human society from the beginnings, but encapsulates the rhythms of life itself.The key elements of the model are these -1)A dynamic actor, \\"materialist man\\" (MM) who maximizes material advantage over the course of a lifetime. Snooks is at great pains to distinguish his dynamic MM from both homo economicus (a static concept), and other forms of analytical (passive and active) agents utilized in both the social and the physical sciences. 2) The strategic demands of MM drive history. These demands manifest themselves in \\"dynamic strategies\\", which Snooks identifies as Conquest, Commerce, family multiplication and Technological Change. 3) The waxing and waning of dynamic strategies define cycles and epochs, institutional frameworks, the rise and fall of civilizations, and the level of economic growth (=GDP/capita).The dynamic material model is a serious challenge to established modes of dialectical, idealist, material and institutional historiography. The serious practitioner and the ambitious student can hardly afford to be ignorant of the arguments of Professor Snooks."},{"Title":"Gods from the Far East: How the Chinese discovered America","review":"Lawyer Mertz created this book to show her interest of Fu-sang, an account in Chinese Mountain and Sea Classic reporting the unique plants, animals and geography of America and the 5th century Buddhist adventure to America.She traced the documents Chinese and Mesoamerica with a list of finding on page 51, common to both.

There is a large selelction of bland books about thanksgiving. The wise child will say, \\"But, WHO are we thanking?\\" after reading most of those books. THIS book answers that question...GOD! Yes, while it seems politically incorrect, the truth is that the first settlers to our country WERE religious pilgrims, seeking a safe haven from religious persecution. This book is a gem in a PC sea of bland, corny thanksgiving day books for children. Children will enjoy the simple story; those just getting into chapter books will enjoy feeling successful reading a 'big kid' chapter book; and they will enjoy seeing how God blesses the faithful when they endure through trying times and complete hard work.

The story is told in a manner that is full of historical detail, and yet also delightfully simple. We follow three Pilgrim children--Giles, Constance, and Damaris Hopkins--and read of their experiences travelling on the Mayflower, building a settlement in New Plymouth, first being afraid of and then befriending some Indians, and finally sharing a feast together, each thanking God in their own way.

Above anything else, that is (in my opinion) the best way to score a book. Anything that I say below, should be weighed against the fact that I really did enjoy the book.This book seems to have two audiences. First of all, there are the missionary kids, especially those of us that attended Murree Christian School (the school that the author writes about). I attended MCS for about as long as the author did (1978-87) and I appreciated the first half of the book with the stories of being a kid at MCS. For you MCSers out there, I think that you will appreciate his memories and find how similar they were to yours. However, I can't relate to a few of the things that happened to the author and at the point where he left MCS his life followed a completely different path that I can't even imagine. In the second half of the book, the author describes the hell that his life becomes and how with (maybe too much) self analysis and psycho-babble, he is able to see himself as healed again. To me, it is not clear at the end of the book if he is really healed or if he is just currently at a temporary point of emotional stability. He still seems plenty bitter to me. Anyway, I doubt if the MCS people that I knew would enjoy this much self-centered psycho-analysis. Also, I think that people who follow the religious beliefs that are generally held/taught at MCS would be offended by some of the conclusions that the author comes to in the end.The second audience for this book will probably be the self-help, new age, &quot;I'm OK, you're OK&quot; types. I don't consider myself to be a member of this group, but I don't know if they will really find it all that inspiring (see above) and it is too bad that they probably won't understand all of the MCS specific stuff that we alumni understand.Any way, as I said at the top, I did enjoy the book even though the last few chapters were a little hard to get through. I think the author did a good job of capturing some of the good things about MCS, while making it clear that it was not the ideal place that we were led to believe when we attended it."},{"Title":"Panther: A Pictorial History of the Black Panthers and the Story Behind the Film","review":"I purchased this book expecting largly a pictoral history and a few words dedicated to the making of the film...what I got was a surprisingly in-depth history of the BPP magnificently supplemented with many pictures!

Generally biased towards the Panther founders (...they could do no wrong in the early days of the movement), it offers a much more balanced account of the late days and subsequent downfall of the Party.

For example, Claudine offers explanation and instruction for several different types of image transfer techniques, from transfers using common tape or laminate to more unusual transfers using heat or even Elmer's clear caulk material. And forget about messy glues and decoupage mediums -- Claudine suggests an interesting way of using beeswax in assembling and even coloring your collage. Several other techniques i.e. peeling paint, will lend themselves to applications in many other media. There is also an interesting lesson in assembling a &quot;frame&quot; for your finished pieces that is both simple and effective. I found all of her instructions to be exceptionally clear and easy to follow.Finally, I found Claudine's collage style to be refreshing. These days it seems that collage means seeing how many interesting or artsy things you can pile onto a canvas or paper.

Then in the collage part she steps us through how to build a collage - add a picture, then some words, etc. She shows us how to do those altoid tins too which is fun.

This book's strengths are through the illustrations, clear and easy to follow, loaded with lots of great ideas and practical techniques. However, if you are a serious fine artist you will find this work to be lacking, because you will find little information on creating ARCHIVAL collages. Following Claudine Hellmuth's ideas too closely will have your creations rotting and discoloring within your lifetime. I suggest Jonathan Talbot's COLLAGE: A NEW APPROACH, as he addresses these concerns more in depth. Another weakness I find here from a serious fine art point of view is Claudine Hellmuth's STYLE for collages. Normally this shouldn't be addressed since this is a personal issue, but her style is key for the purpose of this book, which is to show you how to create collages with vintage photos and found objects. I would like to see pictures of other people's work using vintage photos and found objects. Again, following her methods, and now her STYLE, too closely will yield a watered down, mainstream ILLUSTRATIVE approach to collage. These collages themselves say almost nothing, they just produce a hazy, quaint effect, the same effect so rampant now in almost every blasted politically correct magazine you read. Yes, this book is not really meant to trod this avenue, but I still want to issue a warning so you can go beyond any guidelines. Use this book as a guide toward technique only, and meanwhile go research Schwitters, Rauschenberg, Ernst, Heartfield, etc.--and get your collages to invoke emotion in people."},{"Title":"Collage Discovery Workshop","review":"I really love this book a lot because it's so easy for a non-artist student to learn collage easily.

I believe you CAN teach yourself how to collage with this book.You will learn how to create background, tools and supplies needed, basic techniques, making image transfers onto glass and wood, making wax collages and much more. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this book and wish I could give it more than 5 stars."},{"Title":"Collage Discovery Workshop","review":"This is one of those books I read cover to cover. It has great tips in it. The directions were thorough and easy to understand. I learned many things I can apply to other crafts. Worth the money."},{"Title":"Collage Discovery Workshop","review":"Hellmuth has been my favorite collage artist for some time now, but I've never managed to make any of her workshops because of geographical distances and budgets. This book (almost) makes up for it! It answers all my questions about how-does-she-do-that, and it's opened up a new world for me in my own artwork. The book is attractive, clear, easy to understand and to follow.Way to go Claudine!"},{"Title":"Collage Discovery Workshop","review":"Claudine Hellmuth's Collage Discovery Workshop is one of the best collage technique books I've found in my reading. Her directions are clear and concise and her step by step photos help in every way. If you want to learn more about various collage techniques, from the basic building blocks to more advanced projects, this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"Collage Discovery Workshop","review":"I found this a very useful introduction to collage. Claudine Hellmuth explains very clearly several basic techniques for making collages (including peeling paper, peeling paint, textured paint) and image transfers, as well as using wax as a collage medium. The instructions are very well illustrated and there are several tutorials that easily take a beginner from the start to the end of projects to create some fun and whimsical collages. Hellmuth also guides readers in composition and gives ideas for personalizing their art.But non-beginners are unlikely to learn much from the book and its scope is somewhat limited. Most of the ideas are for creating collages using old photos and found items (there is a chapter on techniques to give objects an vintage look). Hellmuth's collage style is distinctive but does not vary much; I like their simplicity but they don't have much depth. I'd advice any prospective buyer to take a look at the book before buying to make sure they like her style and wouldn't mind getting a \\"sameness\\" feeling while reading the book.3.5"},{"Title":"Collage Discovery Workshop","review":"Got this book as a gift and I love it. I finally know how to get the results I frequently see in collage art. I have used two of the techniques so far successfully and now I want to go back and alter projects I have already finished!"},{"Title":"Collage Discovery Workshop","review":"I first came across this book while browsing Ink it!, one of my favorite rubber stamping/altered art stores in Gilbert, AZ. I picked up Claudine's book and just stood there dumbfounded in the asile for a full 40 minutes. I bought the book and soon after started writing a column on paper arts for MEHC. I KNEW I had to feature Claudine in Paper, Scissors...Crop! (June/July 2005) She is an amazing college artist and a sweetheart of a person. This is seriously a great book. One of my favs!"},{"Title":"Collage Discovery Workshop","review":"This is a great book for anyone who enjoys collage or wants to give collaging a try. I participated in an online workshop where we worked through the entire book. I enjoyed every section of the book and learned alot about my style and how to apply it to my everyday work. I use many of the techniques in my altered books. The beeswax section is wonderful! I had never used beeswax in collage before this book and I was not a bit nervous about trying it. Claudine explains everything so clearly and makes even the most novice artist understand the processes in each lesson.If you want to learn more about collage or add to your existing knowledge of this art...you must get this book!"},{"Title":"Collage Discovery Workshop","review":"This book is full of techniques for collage art. Great ideas through out the book. Worth having"},{"Title":"Collage Discovery Workshop","review":"I learned my lesson when I bought her first book online. This time I went to the library and sure enough, this book was there. For the life of me, I can't understand what people see in this. She makes ugly people in square clothes with pointed hats. Every time. Apparently that's all she can do. More power to her if she can keep selling books on this. But my advice is to check your library first. I'm glad I didn't waste my money on this."},{"Title":"Collage Discovery Workshop","review":"Collage Discovery WorkshopThis book is not worth the price. It is very limited in information. It kept my attention for about two minutes and then I put it on the shelf. I doubt I will use it much for a reference. I will give it to my ten year old niece."},{"Title":"Collage Discovery Workshop","review":"It was very dissppointing to find a craft book instead of an inspiring artist's book.It is like watching a tv show that helps bored people at home (house wives, retired people)to pass their time having fun.Collage is not meant to be a crafter's hobby there are many good collage artists with some very impressive styles that use very interesting materials.The ones in this book are way behind those ones in my opinion.Also I had read some of the reviews before adding this book to my basket and I totally disagree with the positive approaches, this is not a creativity book."},{"Title":"Collage Discovery Workshop","review":"Book was in great conditon, but I purchased the book for a project and by the time it came... we were done with the project."},{"Title":"Collage Discovery Workshop","review":"Are you in a rut? Have a hard time breaking out of your comfort zone? If so this book is the one you MUST add to your library! I recently had the pleasure of participating in an online workshop featuring this book and it has changed my artistic side for the better! Every chapter teaches you a new technique with easy to follow instructions and fantastic photos. The supplies are things that are easy to get a hold of and the projects are things that you can use in all sorts of ways, not just in collage! If you are new to the mixed media world or have been at it a while but feel you need a challenge this book is the one for you!"},{"Title":"Collage Discovery Workshop","review":"Claudine shares her techniques step by step! Beautiful inspiring artwork too! This book is a real winner! Great for seasoned artists or those just beginning collage. I highly recommend it!

It inspired me into some great projects! I have read about 8 other books now of similar content and this still rates at the top of my list."},{"Title":"Collage Discovery Workshop","review":". . . . there was paper and glue. This book is a \\"must\\" buy for the beginning artist who has decided to explore the world of collage.

Thankfully, this book was a great teacher.This book is full of well illustrated and easy to understand techniques that help even the most hopeless people create fabulous pieces of art (my favourite are the beeswax collages).If you're interested in creating or learning about collage then I highly suggest you buy this book and use it to it's full potential. You wont be sorry."},{"Title":"Collage Discovery Workshop","review":"A very worthwhile book for all mixed media people. The best book I have seen in awhile! VEry very inspiring! And...you don't even need to read....the pictures and step by steps are terrific!!! Thank you Claudine Hellmuth and thanks to her publisher!!"},{"Title":"Collage Discovery Workshop","review":"I just got my copy of Claudine's long-anticipated book, and I must say that I find it to be one of the best technique books on collage, mixed media and painting that I have ever seen. For sure, it's one of the top five art and craft books published in 2003, and I feel that it will have a very long shelf life in bookstores for years to come. It's classic in the sense that the author covers the basics thoroughly, discussing tools and materials with frankness and good humor before going on to assist the reader with preparing her canvas (or other supports) for a collage. She gives excellent advice on painting a rich background, as well as using papers, old maps, even a sheet from a telephone book to create the first layer of a collage. If you've ever started a collage or other artwork with fear of the blank canvas, Claudine gets you over that in a hurry! She also includes lots and lots of tips and techniques on surface preparation and alteration, making this a great book for anyone interested in keeping an artist journal or scrapbook. Using photos, layering imagey, composition styles, and using 3-dimensional found objects in your art are all included. And the best part--this book is FULL of Claudine Hellmuth collages! I love her paintings and you will, too. She takes the mystery out of this art form, and I for one am deeply appreciative.One final note: The book designers went all-out for this one. It's an approachable \\"craft\\" book in that it provides lots of how-to, but the page layout design is top-notch so it should provide plenty of inspiration to artists working in all types of media.A great book from a great artist!"},{"Title":"Collage Discovery Workshop","review":"I just got this book and just finished reading and enjoying it from cover to cover. Good collage books are hard to find, but Claudine has done a wonderful job of explaining some of the more &quot;artistic&quot; techniques in collage. I especially liked her encouragement to experiment with your design. Most instructors tell you you must have a &quot;theme&quot; even before beginning a collage; I like Claudine's idea of letting the elements in the collage guide your design. Can't wait to get started on some of the transfer techniques!"},{"Title":"Collage Discovery Workshop","review":"At last a collage book that consists of more than pasting down little torn pieces of paper! But who would expect less from the amazingly talented artist and generous teacher, Claudine Hellmuth. Beautifully designed and visually exciting, the book offers perfectly clear directions on techniques to get you started....then, takes you to the next level of composition. All of it is clearly explained even for an absolute beginner while still offering much for more experienced artists. Claudine shares many of the same techniques taught in her wonderful workshops. If you can only buy one collage book, this is the one to buy... hands down. Thanks Claudine for sharing your wonderful gift."},{"Title":"Collage Discovery Workshop","review":"I have been searching for any and every book to guide and inspire my interest in altered book making. I don't own this book yet, but I borrowed it from my library. Inspire me it did! I can't wait to get my own! The book provides very clear instructions how-to photographs,as well as composition exercises. The only reason I felt this book was four out of five stars was because I wish it were longer than its 126 pages! Anyone who may doubt the value of this book should get their hands on a copy before writing a pessimistic review. Thank you, Claudine, for a fine book."},{"Title":"Collage Discovery Workshop","review":"I highly recommend Collage Discovery Workshop. This book isexcellent for personal, class, or workshop use.

We often have expectations from life, and a book and in the case of Collage Discovery, by Claudine Hellmuth, I can say her work and her book exceeded my expectations.The publisher should also be commended for bringing a new voice to the collage audience in a concise, well edited, tastefully illustrated compendium at an affordable price.Claudine brings techniques together in a useful and instructive fashion, encouraging new artists and broadening the scope of the experienced. It is a pleasure to puruse.It is a must have collage book for everyone's library shelf, but don't let it get dusty, \\"use it.\\" I will!"},{"Title":"Collage Discovery Workshop","review":"while this did provide some usefull info. i didn't find that it was my style, was expecting more and maybe more detail about how to's on college and maybe some different techniques on working with other subject matter. this work is kind of dull in color and and i am more into vibrancy. although i did flip through some of the pages before ordering it i was expecting more from what i had viewed. will be searching for another book about college that suits my style."},{"Title":"Collage Discovery Workshop","review":"I love this book.

MS Hellmuth teaches without patronizing. Excellent work. I look forward to other works by this author."},{"Title":"Collage Discovery Workshop","review":"I pre-ordered this book, too, and eagerly awaited it's release. It is EVERTHING I hoped for and waaaaay more! I can't tell you how delighted I am with this book! I had hoped it would TEACH me new things, things to help me improve my technique, and also inspire me to new visions about what I can become/do/create.Like other starving, self-taught artists, I can't afford to attend many workshops. Yet I'm desperatly wanting to know MORE, MORE, MORE about inventive techniques for creating GOOD art. So I am often left with &quot;book learning&quot; to fill in the gaps, and I have to tell you there are not many out there that really TEACH technique. Most of them are &quot;do this, then do this&quot; to produce a *certain* piece. (Which is fine, but I WANT MORE! LOL!)In my eyes, Claudine Hellmuth is the modern master of collage, she has taken it to a whole new level, and I hoped her book would TEACH me. Her book has exceeded my wildest hopes. I flipped through it the minute I carefully RIPPED it out of the package and my little heart swelled with DREAMS and HOPE and GRATITUDE. This book is the BEST giver-of-tools to collage artists I have ever seen! Others have already enumerated the contents and the wonderful production value of this work, so I won't repeat them, but if you have a limited amount of money to spend on tools, spend it on THIS BOOK. You won't be sorry!And now, I gotta go--- I have to go MAKE STUFFFFFF!!!!!!!! :o)"},{"Title":"Collage Discovery Workshop","review":"While the projects in the book are very creative and interesting, I was hoping for a little more information about how to use materials in my own projects. The only process that will be helpful to me is lifting an image off of paper and rendering it transparent. Most of the other techniques will not transfer to my methods of work and I don't like copying another artist."},{"Title":"Collage Discovery Workshop","review":"Collage Discovery WorkshopI like the book which I have on my Kindle but there are so many spelling errors.

A &quot;must have&quot; book."},{"Title":"Collage Discovery Workshop","review":"Claudine gives very detailed descriptions of each one of her art projects. I am a rubber stamp artist and have always been \\"afraid\\" of working with canvas. Claudine however shows you how easy it is not only to create artwork, but how to make the presentation (such as frames) to showcase the artwork.I was very impressed with the way this art instruction book was written and edited. I think Claudine has been hiding her talent as a writer all these years!!! Claudine Hellmuth will be a household name someday and I feel privileged that she shares her secrets and wants others to create art!!!!"},{"Title":"Collage Discovery Workshop","review":"This is a very well-written and inspiring book. I felt like Claudine was in the room with me, walking me through each project, I could SEE clearly everything she explained. I love project-books and this is the best I have ever read. She uses everyday items, you don't have to buy anything special to make these projects. I highly recommend this book! Can't wait for the next one!!"},{"Title":"Collage Discovery Workshop","review":"I loved this book. It gives basic techniques and ideas that make a collage more interesting. I read it cover to cover and have already started incorporating some of the information into my own work. It taught me about how to keep my collages from \\"floating\\" and to actually have a better sense of the work I am doing. I now know that I don't have to have a white background to fill in when I am doing a collage.I would recommend this book to all beginning collage artists and even those who have been doing work for awhile to stretch their craft in a new direction. Claudine Hellmuth is a master at teaching the art of collage and I am really impressed by how easy she makes this medium seem."},{"Title":"Collage Discovery Workshop","review":"*****I am a beginning collage artist; however, this book would be great for anyone at any level. The ideas are creative, very different, and explicitly described so that anyone can carry them out. Materials are listed at the start of each lesson.Some of the topics that are covered are: glazing paint, peeling paint, texured paint, peeling paper, heat transfers, caulking transfers, working with beeswax, antiquing found objects, miniature assemblages, collage storytelling, and much more.I am taking a beginning collage class next month, but probably will not be able to wait to try the techniques listed here. I'm inspired to experiment, and with this book, also empowered to experiment!Highly recommended!*****"},{"Title":"Collage Discovery Workshop","review":"......regarding creativity and the creative process to open the door for everyone to make art! This book brings the wonderful workshop experiences many of us have had with Claudine, into our own homes. Written like a one-on-one chat, the book takes you through the techniques and Claudine's thought process! The exercises and section on composition are especially helpful.Creative Discovery Workshop will augment your workshop experiences (the whole time I was reading my fingers were itching to head for the studio!) and surely encourage others to sign-up for the first time! If you know someone who yearns to create but has not found their voice, I heartily recommend you share this unique book with them."},{"Title":"Collage Discovery Workshop","review":"One of the best books of 2003! I bought Claudine's book for her artwork as she is one of the most amazing and talented artists out there, but I was happy to find that her book is as well written as her class handouts! The instructions in the book are extremely well written and easy to follow. Excellent not only for beginners but for advanced artists as well...there are a plethora of ideas in here for everyone.The reference section in the back of the book is also excellent as well.From a mixed media artist and art instructor's point of view, this is a must have book. Kudos Claudine!"},{"Title":"Collage Discovery Workshop","review":"New techinques that will make the old hat at collage sit up and take notice but the instructions are so easy to follow that a beginner can learn them adn wow her friends and family.

It has been a great help getting me started with techniques and examples. I still find myself refering back to it."},{"Title":"Collage Discovery Workshop","review":"I have many, many books on art instruction, and this is by far one of the best. Claudine doesn't hold back any information. She is willing to share her secrets with us in this inspiring book. This is it! If you are at all interested in the playful art of collage, this is a non-intimidating taste of the essentials. It feels like a work-book that you want to finish in a night. The reader can pick and choose projects throughout, and is encouraged to make the pieces their own. Along with all of the technical information, there is the added benefit of sage advice on content and composition. This book is truly a winner. Buy one for each of your artist buddies. You just can't go wrong with this one."},{"Title":"Flowering Wilderness","review":"Here's my take (with a small spoiler) on the Forsytes, after finishing \\"The Flowering Wilderness\\", the eighth in the series: The first six books are excellent and well worth reading but the next two, with the central character of the first six absent, seem to lack purpose. They're well-written and enjoyable but I don't see the point. This is particularly true of \\"The Flowering Wilderness\\", which (to the modern reader) is full of extreme reactions to a minor incident."},{"Title":"Flowering Wilderness","review":"I sought out the book through Amazon as it was hard to buy locally. I was given the choice of several suppliers. The book arrived moderately quickly and was in an acceptable condition, not'as new' but obviously second hand. This didn't detract from my enjoyment of the novel."},{"Title":"Warhammer: Mark of Chaos Official Strategy Guide","review":"This is one of the best strategy guides I have ever owned. It goes into terrific detail about each of the maps, all of the armies and gives great strategy tips. It even suggests which units to use in each map and what to spend your precious gold at each of the towns along the way. The tactics given work well, and the level of detail while being concise is great. I haven't looked too closely at the multiplayer section, so I can't comment on that. Over all, this is one of the best and I would recommend it to anyone, even if they don't have trouble with the game."},{"Title":"Warhammer: Mark of Chaos Official Strategy Guide","review":"This game needs to be labeled for 15 years and younger. not a game that will interest adults.the price tag is way overpriced."},{"Title":"Masterworks, Paintings from the Bridgestone Museum of Art","review":"This book is gorgeous with paintings that a novice art student or collector would love.

It contains all the necessary references you will need to do beginner to intermediate level DHTML development. However, it lacks anything beyond fairly superficial coverage. For the novice to intermediate developer, this book is probably for you. If you are an advanced developer you won't learn anything new (I was hoping for some nitty-gritty detailed stuff). I would have really liked to see a reference list that not only listed major version support/compatibility for DOM/CSS/JavaScript/Etc. but for all the minor version support. If I could pick 3.5 stars that's where this book would be.Finally, I have to point out that some of her example web pages don't even work in IE5.5...which really turned me off, big time."},{"Title":"Writing Cross-Browser Dynamic HTML","review":"After reading the first 100 pages of the book, I visited the Web site. Just about everything I tried on the site failed: The \\"openSesame()\\" function that was supposed to open another document gave me a \\"not found\\" error. Inspecting the code allowed me to open the intended page..., but text appears on top of images.If this was intentional, the author knows nothing about design; if it was an accident, then I question the author's knoweldge of dynamic HTML. Neither of these possibilities caused me to be confident that the book would be able to help me understand and use dynamic HTML.Even worse, JavaScript error after JavaScript error popped up. There's a \\"references\\" page, but every single link died with an \\"object expected\\" error on line 1, character 1. The most common cause of this problem is a misspelled function name or function all (something as simple as naming the function foobar() and then calling FooBar().I gave up on the site.I gave up on the book.Too bad. I really had high hopes for both."},{"Title":"Writing Cross-Browser Dynamic HTML","review":"In the year 2001, what would you expect from a NEW book about &quot;cross-browser Dynamic HTML&quot; ? I would expect a book showing me how to develop code that will work in Internet Explorer 4.x and up, Netscape Communicator 4.x, Gecko-based browsers like Netscape 6 and Mozilla, plus preferable a general implementation of (or at least a discussion about) &quot;future-safe&quot; DHTML based solely on the recommended W3C and ECMA standards. It is &quot;alternative&quot; browsers like Opera and Konqueror I hope to see support of through the pure standards based implementation (and it will proplably work with the Gecko-based browsers and the upcomming IE6 browser too).Does Heather Williamsen book live up to my expections ? I'm afraid very far from... Heathers ambigition have been to support IE4-5, NS4.x and NS6. I guess this is allright as a MINIMUM, since it covers the browsers most people will use for some time. But at the time of writing the final version of Netscape 6 has clearly not been released yet, and wheather Heather hasn't done her homework good enough or if the specifikations of Netscape 6/Mozilla has changed during its development, I don't know, but it is a fact that none (or very little) of the DHTML-code pressented in the book will work in Netscape 6, Mozilla or other browsers based on the Gecko layout engine. The worst mistake is that Heather takes support of Netscape 4.x Layers for granted in Netscape 6. Layers is not part of the W3C standard, and this propritary Netscape 4.x feature is NOT supported in Netscape 6 or other Gecko-based browsers !Off course you can learn something about generating DHTML that works in IE4-5.x and NS4.x in this book, but without (working) support of Netscape 6 I can never recommend this book to anyone taking webdevelopment seriously. I hope there will be some comprehensive corrections/updates to find on the Apress website soon, becourse if not this book has been a completely waste of money for me. Sorry about these hard words.The day there is a good cross-browser DHTML book that lives up to my expectations mentioned first in this little review, please let me know ! (Why hasn't anybody written a review of &quot;New Perspectives on Creating Web Pages with Dynamic HTML&quot; [ISBN 0619019182] telling about its browser/standard support yet ? - No I'm not gonna buy it if I don't see somebody else reviewing it in a positive way.

Benedetti's nostalgic account of a young boy's first halting steps into maturity is beautifully written. You meet characters who you've known for years but have forgotten, you journey into secret places that are tucked away in the back recesses of your memory and you can literally smell the delicious aromas of favorite dishes that you haven't tasted in years. The trip to the amusement park, the neighborhood bully, the first girl friend, the long ride to the country in your family's Packard; they're all here. A great read!"},{"Title":"The Long Italian Goodbye","review":"You do not have to be Italian(or a Chicagoan) to enjoy this trip down memory lane. \\"The Long Italian Goodbye\\" (for both the author's farewell to his childhood and because of the way all ethnic groups say good byes after family gatherings) is a loving look at one boy's growth from innocence to maturity. It is hilarious, tender, emotional and insightful -- the kind of book that everyone will enjoy. Benedetti's remembers boyhood adventures and discoveries, embarrassments and terrors, and love within the open-hearted bosom of an Italian family and neighborhood. You will miss a lot if you do not read this book."},{"Title":"The Long Italian Goodbye","review":"Although a \\"fiction\\" story, this book mentions real names and places in this great old neighborhood. I grew up througout the 50's and early 60's. We would visit my \\"nonna\\" (grandmother) there every week. She owned a 3-flat on 23rd St. My cousin and I played in the streets of the neighborhood. I remember many of the names and places mentioned in this book. It brought back great memories and it depicts what life was like for the Italians who lived there both pre and post WWII. A great read! It will make you both laugh and cry."},{"Title":"The Long Italian Goodbye","review":"This book is a trip down memory lane. I grew up in the neighborhood portrayed in this book and am familiar with many of the characters. In fact my grandfather is one of the people mentioned. The book brought back warm memories of not only the neighborhood I grew up in but also the love of an Italian family."},{"Title":"Lakota Renegade (Leisure historical romance)","review":"Please do not bother with this book. I have never read anything by Madeline Baker before, so I can't comment on her writing in general, but I couldn't even get through the book. I had ordered it based on the wonderful reviews, but I found the writing to be stilted, and the plot to be amazingly cliche. The heroine was only 17 and the hero was in his 30's! He was supposed to be an experienced gunslinger, and the way Jassie spoke it sounded like she was a little girl, pestering him with questions. It was very hard for me to get past that, but even ignoring the large age difference, there was such annoying repitition. Creed kept saying that he really should leave town, but he didn't because he couldn't resist the heroine. Even the descriptions of the characters were overused, especially Jassie's &quot;luminous&quot; brown eyes. I felt as if the book was a short story within the first 100 pages that had for some reason been extended to include an even more boring plot. I was really very disappointed by this book."},{"Title":"Lakota Renegade (Leisure historical romance)","review":"A wonderful book, that is so enchanting. (you can't help but fall in love with it). I loved this book from the start. A half-breed (indian) gun-slinger who has a soft spot in his heart for a daughter of saloon woman. She is a sweet innocent girl, he is anything but innocent. With her sweetness she finds the good in him and brings it out. This is a very adventurous tale with a lot of action and twists and turns. Their love has so many trials to face. Will love conquer all? Read one of the best books I've ever read and find out!"},{"Title":"Lakota Renegade (Leisure historical romance)","review":"I have read many Indian-White romance books but this one was very different. This is not your silly cliche books but very well written. Jassie's mother and sister are crib workers, something most people now days don't know what is, so Ms. Baker obviously done her research. Jassie is young and her attraction to an older man was very common in that day and time, not sick. Creed is a hard man, he has lived a tough life but he has not allowed misfortune to turn him into a brute. I almost cried when he buys food for little Jassie. Don't want to spoil it, so if you like romantic westerns with respect to that era, this is a good one."},{"Title":"Lakota Renegade (Leisure historical romance)","review":"I could not get interested in the book at first but I am glad that I decided to keep on trying to read it. It was a very good story, how I wanted to shake Creed to wake him up and see that love was looking right at him. I am so happy that Jassy stayed and insisted to keep her love for him and to find it else where. I even had tears in my eyes at times. I really wanted Jassy and Rose to get together ageain and find the relationship that sister's can have, but out of love Rose was there for Jassy at the end. I am happy that Creed and Jassy did get to see the rainbow's together for ever and she name her baby after Rose. I am hooked on Indian Romance Story's they are very passionate."},{"Title":"Lakota Renegade (Leisure historical romance)","review":"Creed and Jassy's story was so amazing and beautiful! She made up her mind that he was the man for her and never lost faith in that, even when things seemed to be at their worst. Creed was a tough and hardened criminal who was determined not to lead Jassy into his rough life until he realized what he would be throwing away: his heart and soul. What a such a passionate story! I felt their pain and happiness, and even at times, laughter. I must congragulate Ms. Baker on another unforgettable book!!"},{"Title":"Lakota Renegade (Leisure historical romance)","review":"After reading this book, I was left enchanted by the characters and longing for more. This story is all that I have ever wanted in a book. Full of romance, suspence, danger, passion, and excitment. I have looked for this book everwhere and I'm glad to know that I have found it again!!"},{"Title":"Lakota Renegade (Leisure historical romance)","review":"Stand by your man! That's what Jassy McCloud did even when Creed Madigan wasn't her man LOL! They form an unlikely friendship when Creed protects Jassy from the advances of the town boys. Creed and Jassy are completely different but they have one thing in common... they're both outcasts. Creed is an half breed bounty hunter and Jassy is the daughter of a salon worker. Circumstances of death and wrongful imprisonment causes Creed and Jassy to run away together. Creed's plan is to help Jassy achieve the life that she wants and leave her forever. While Jassy's plan is to get Creed to stay with her and finally see that he is who and what she wants. Throughout their travel together there some funny scenes with Creed trying to resist Jassy's innocent seduction. Love conquers all for them and they find happines and the respect that they both strive to gain. I love this book. Yes, there was a age gape but I loved that Creed respected Jassy enough that no matter how much he wanted her he would not take advantage of her. He waited which wasn't easy for him but he respected Jassy and gave her the things that may seem simple to others but meant everything to her. Madeline Baker does it again!"},{"Title":"Fruit-Filled (Lifeguide Bible Studies)","review":"This entire series really is the perfect children's/family Bible study! They include application, Scripture passages, discussion questions, puzzles, prayers, and further activities. This series will really impact your child's understanding of God and His role in their lives. My sons really enjoyed them and grew in their faith!"},{"Title":"Run for the Money","review":"Fred Schroder weaves an engrossing story, with twists and turns that make you want to read this book non-stop! His writing is so clear and visual that you can imagine it as an exciting adventure movie, and I hope it gets made into one. I can't divulge much of the plot without giving away some of the twists, which are a delight to discover - but if you're tired of reading the same tired plots over and over, read this one - it is original and unique. Please tell me there will be a sequel!!!"},{"Title":"The Druid Way: A Journey Through an Ancient Landscape","review":"Philip starts the entire concept as a physical journey through the various aspects of his local landscape. Adding to this journey is the manner of processing the deaths of two people that he had great respect for. Further into the journey comes the addition of a newborn child to his family - completing the motif of endings and beginnings that comprise the concept of making a journey. Interspersed throughout the chapters are various concepts on religious belief, local history, and Philip's own insights into weaving the daily processes of life with the mysteries that we all carry philosophically deep in our own being. Not only was it an enjoyable read for me -- it also helped me process an understanding that life's journey has endings and beginnings strewn throughout it. Personally, I cannot recommend this book highly enough."},{"Title":"The Druid Way: A Journey Through an Ancient Landscape","review":"The Druid Way had nothing to do with traditional Druidism with the exception of the historical sites visited within the book. This is my first book that I have read by Carr-Gomm, and it will be my last. The book is filled with too much Psyco-psychology. By reading this Book I find that Carr-Gomm is overly obcessed with Sexuality. If one wishes to follow the tennents of Wicca, then this is a good book. If you want to read about traditional Druidism, stay clear of this book."},{"Title":"The Druid Way: A Journey Through an Ancient Landscape","review":"Once again, Philip Carr-Gomm is NOT an anthropologist and hisbooks are NOT about the ancient druids. Druidry is a modern beliefwith only occasional ties to events/beliefs of 2000 years ago, just as modern Christianity is.I finished this book with a feeling of peace, it was almost a meditation to read it. However, I got very little practical information out of it. I certainly don't feel that it is &quot;a complete description of the Druid Way.&quot; The comments by the author are closer to the book than the &quot;synopsis&quot; is. Wonderfully written, this book brings together a stroll around the countryside with the grief of a loss of a friend to show a path to enlightenment through the power and beauty of the earth....if you want to know about ancient druids, check out &quot;The Druids&quot; by Stuart Piggot or &quot;The Celts&quot; by T. G. E. Powell. The fact of the matter is the historical druids committed very little to paper until after they were assimilated into the Culdee church. And that all had the taint of Christianity on it."},{"Title":"The Druid Way: A Journey Through an Ancient Landscape","review":"The religion practiced by the ancient Celts and their priests the Druids, is and will always be a mystery. It is sad to see people wishing, hoping, and praying that they could defy logic and physics and go back in time figuratively or otherwise and follow \\"Druidism.\\" The sad truth is they would probably tell the Druids they were not worshipping or performing their rites in a historically accurate way either! What these folks believe actually happened is just pure fantasy. They have no crystal ball into the past and are just as at a loss as the historians and archeologists investigating the ancient Celts using scientific means.The fact is Druidry is a modern manifestation and at best based upon guesses at what the ancient Celtic religion was. Philip makes no bones about it. He is not saying in any of his texts that what he is presenting is the unchanged religion of the Celts. Would we or could we really follow the ancient religion in its entirety today? Do we have the same exact needs, hopes, or world-views? A great deal of history has happened since then.What Philip does provide is another spiritual path or way for the modern individual; the Druid Way. The Druid Way is not an ancient religion brought out of context for a modern age but a modern look at an ancient religion which can be of use and import for us today.I have researched the ancient Celts extensively and yet this book is one of my favourites! It is a very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Druid Way: A Journey Through an Ancient Landscape","review":"This is a carefully crafted and well presented summary of the Druid tradition that traces its' evolution from its' ancient origins to its' current somewhat eclectic modern day form. The book takes us on a remarkable journey through the sacred landscape of southern Britain led by a person who is uniquely aware of both its' recent and past history . The book is accurate, highly readable, and entertaining."},{"Title":"The Druid Way: A Journey Through an Ancient Landscape","review":"Though not jam-packed with information, Philip Car-Gomm takes the reader on an immense emotional and spiritual journey through the eyes of the modern pagan druid. An authority in the field, he weaves together basic concepts through his story, and even throws in other chapters merely describing them. For the novice to druidry, bard, anyone interested in druidry, or even the advanced, this book is an excellent read."},{"Title":"The Druid Way: A Journey Through an Ancient Landscape","review":"I have been studing the druid path for 11 yrs and this book is one of the best i have read so far"},{"Title":"The Druid Way: A Journey Through an Ancient Landscape","review":"The Druid Way depicts a fantastic journey in which the reader shares as the author, current Chief of the Order of Bards, Ovates &amp; Druids (OBOD) Richard Philip Carr-Gomm, weaves physical experience with those from the other side of dual, or bi-level awareness.

Includes rituals too!"},{"Title":"The Druid Way: A Journey Through an Ancient Landscape","review":"Philip Carr-Gomm's intelligence - not unlike Andrew Harvey's - has a bright, mercurial and energizing quality that immediately stimulates interest and attention. Far superior to a rote historical study, his book is an experiential pilgrimage, a first-hand account that could only be charted by someone as sufficiently steeped in the ideas from the inside of his skin as is Philip. And here is where it begins: high on the downlands above Lewes on the South Downs Way, as he stands on Itford Hill at the outset of his circular journey of excursion and return. From here, in twenty-one chapters, he unfolds a compelling narrative that is both story and exploration, memory and discourse, homily and lyric exposition, coloured with his own immediate psychic perception.\`I plead very guilty to being indeed my own ancestor', as Nuinn is quoted in the book...and what is everywhere present here is the presence of the past that the whole landscape resonates, and that Philip unearths, naming original place names, tracking lost paths gone to grass and cut through by our present roads - and he does so with a sense of detail reminiscent of Gilbert White, though his canvas is larger.Jay Ramsay"},{"Title":"The Druid Way: A Journey Through an Ancient Landscape","review":"This whole book is a delight. It is the diary of a sacred journey, through sacred space, and through the heart and mind, as well as a useful practical guide to the countryside and its associations and history. It is a book to use and to keep and to remember.Asphodel"},{"Title":"The Druid Way: A Journey Through an Ancient Landscape","review":"If your looking for a book on druidry, you may find this book a little dissapointing. This book is a book that analises man's place on earth, his problems and emotions using some druidic concepts. It is not on druidry, although it could function as an introduction to the concept. This is a very good book and I'd recommend it to anyone who is interested on what has happened to man's relationship with nature."},{"Title":"Managing IP Networks with Cisco Routers","review":"Although Scott, and the editors, exhibit a syle that is excellent for the novice readers, sometimes the technical side is a bit needy. Figures 1-2 and 1-3 blew our entire class away. The point should have been made with /20 as the subnet mask for third octet host id's in the range of 8+4+2+1(i.e., one through fifteen in third octet).Proof through positive example is better than negative non-working examples on the first time through. Additionally, any reader of &quot;Managing IP Networks&quot; who takes the time to read the appendix probably would not be confused in to thinking &quot;twisted pair&quot; is maybe not &quot;copper&quot;. All in all, excellent reading for the networking student."},{"Title":"Managing IP Networks with Cisco Routers","review":"This book is for those who wish to design networks at the router level. If you aren't designing networks, you may find this book not quite as useful.

I work with Bay gear, and this is still a great book. I read very few books from cover-to-cover, but I've already read this one twice. As someone who's WAN is still relatively small, this book targets many of the issues I'm facing as our network grows."},{"Title":"Managing IP Networks with Cisco Routers","review":"I enjoyed the content of this book. I must stress that it is an intro to networking with Tcp/IP. It is rather vague in details on quite a few subjects in the CISCO arena. I was a little dissapointed with it's delivery of IP subnetting. I was looking for more of a detailed description relating down to the binary or hexadecimal values. Overall, I think it is a good book to start off with and to gather the terminologies from. It does give brief descriptions of many of these but doesn't exert details with many. If you are the person looking for an intro into CISCO routers dealing with an IP point of view, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Managing IP Networks with Cisco Routers","review":"This book is not technical enough to manage a TCP/IP network consisting of Cisco routers, as you might have expected from the book's title. Thus I was quite disappointed when I read the book. The interface configuration, for example, was presented in the Appendix. For someone not familiar with TCP/IP and routers, this book may be a helpful start. But if you are looking for a book on managing the routed network, ckeck out the book by Chris Lewis."},{"Title":"Managing IP Networks with Cisco Routers","review":"This is a great book for people just starting out with TCP/IP and CISCO routers. It points out the major concepts when dealing with CISCO routers without reading the thousand page manual which accompanies the CISCO router. However, for those who regularly work CISCOs and TCP/IP this book can provide a quick brush on some basic concepts but it does not contain anywhere near the detail required to properly configure, troubleshoot and maintain a WAN comprise of CISCOs especially with all the various fallacies in the various CISCO IOS revisions.This is one of the most comprehensive book I have seen written on CISCO routers and Internetworking."},{"Title":"Managing IP Networks with Cisco Routers","review":"Very much an introductory book to both Cisco Routers and networking.

In as much as a course is usually built around a textbook, the length and thoroughness of the textbook are of great importance. It is our belief that it is desirable to place such a volume in the hands of electrical engineering students even though only a fraction of the material can be covered in the classroom.The attendant problems of deciding what can be omitted in a college course has been simplified in this text by the arrangement of material. Each subject is treated in somewhat the following fashion:ConstructionDiscussion of operating characteristicsCalculation of operating characteristics from tests'sDiscussions and analyses of various related phenomenaParticular emphasis is laid upon methods of calculation and the physical principles on which the analyses depend. The material selected is well within the scope of fourth-year students, but it is hoped that others will find much of it readable and useful.The book is divided into the following sections:I.

A clerk at a bookstore in West Virginia recommended it to me when I was traveling through there last year. It consists of three novellas, all centering on the aging of the main character, Keith. The other main character is West Virginia - a place so vividly portrayed that it becomes a character itself - much like Ashville in Look Homeward Angel. Depta brings in many other characters. At first they seem rather two dimensional and stereotyped characterizations, but as you read on, the more important characters develop a depth that is truly remarkable. Depta breaks through the \\"hillbilly\\" stereotype and shows us the pain, suffering and joy that we as humans all experience.The only drawbacks that I experienced are that the number of characters at times became overwhelming and I had trouble keeping them separated. Also, there are some editing problems that should have been caught. But these are minor complaints in anotherwise amazing novel."},{"Title":"Religion and Revelation: A Theology of Revelation in the World's Religions","review":"Not as engaging as Professor Ward &quot;live&quot; (be it lecture, luncheon or tutorial); but an endeavour worthwhile, nevertheless: his is a lucid articulation, quasi-rigorous examination, fair evaluation, and creative conceptualization of five major world religious traditions' (Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism) concepts of revelation. Certain to evoke controversy and to stimulate dialogue both within and across these traditions, &quot;Religion and Revelation&quot; will appeal to theologians, philosophers of religion, and anthropologists, in particular; professional scholars and non-specialists, alike. Trig Johnson of Florida"},{"Title":"Religion and Revelation: A Theology of Revelation in the World's Religions","review":"The noble aspiration of this book is to give a theological (&amp; eventually Christian) accountof revelation as an ubiquitous cultural phenomenon appearing in all manifestations of the spiritual. He deals excellently with the conundrums involved with comparing andencountering competing claims of religious truth and the ability of humans to find warrant to choose to believe one or the other. Admirably, he treat the religious traditions featured in his work fairly and even-handedly. He has taken great care not to misrepresent any tradition, and before publication, he employed the criticism of many experts in revising his work where it contained any fallacies concerning non-Christian faiths. While some criticism of them is present in his work, he never takes the tone of a polemicist.His book begins with an examination of the general epistemological difficulties accompanying claims of revelation and then moves on towards specific examinations of Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism and a special chapter on Christian revelation and our belief in God's Incarnation. His last section works out the conclusions of his examination and one is left with a strong argument for a non-provincial theology but, if one is a Christian, a strong grasp of how the doctrine of Incarnation makes Christianity as radical and distinct as it is.Though I didn't agree with him on many small details, I found his general framework to be solid. I highly recommend this book for any Christian seriously wanting to explore revelation in the context of pluralistic market of religions in our post-modern societies."},{"Title":"Warrior Marks: Female Genital Mutilation and the Sexual Blinding of Women","review":"I was very disappointed with this book.

How dare the originators of this heinous procedure presume that what God created is faulty or a mistake? \\"Warrior Marks\\" enhanced what I had already learned about FGM. Any man (or woman) who tries to uphold this procedure as something that benefits girls and women is of a criminal mind. There is no benefit to putting a woman through this torture. If men were required to experience a similar experience, we would soon see the end of FGM. Please read this book if you seek another point of view. The addition of Alice Walker's poetry and the sharing of her experiences as she and Pratibha Parmar traveled through Africa is an eye-opener, and the way the book is written gives the reader a personal view in the same way that Ms. Kassindja's book does. Ms. Walker gives the women that she writes about a certain dignity, and while the reader may not be able to identify with the physical pain, some of the emotions may be felt.

It also gives us the chance for \\"forgiveness\\".

Unfortunately, there is &quot;more heat than light&quot; in most writings on this topic: this is a good example. The book and the movie are more about Alice Walker than about this ancient, puzzling, disturbing tradition. It is easy to confuse a topic such as this one with the book that covers it. Those whose first introduction to this subject comes through this book, will probably find it moving. Those who approach the subject seriously and professionally either as clinicians or anthropologists, will find this book a disaster: superficial, arrogant, condescending, ethnocentric, outraged, uninformed, manipulative, anecdotal, loaded with personal bias and without any serious research methodology. It is not a particularly useful contribution to the debate. If you are interested in this subject, the best thing you can do is move immediately beyond this book and come to grips with the real issues. Alice Walker is an intelligent, articulate woman; but she is hoplessly out of her depth here. Overall, a disservice to the women she wants to help."},{"Title":"Warrior Marks: Female Genital Mutilation and the Sexual Blinding of Women","review":"Warrior marks was the account of all the time that Alice Walker and Pratibha Parmar spent in preparing for the documentary. They did not need to show how the mutilation is done because they painted a vivid enough picture. The book was about the emotional aspect of female genital mutilation. I must say that I commend them, especially Pratibha for the time that they spent preparing for the documentary. The book made me want to see the documentary. When Alice talks about herself in the book, she shows how her experiences were similar to that of the females in Africa. I recommend this book be read and the documentary seen."},{"Title":"Warrior Marks: Female Genital Mutilation and the Sexual Blinding of Women","review":"While I understand the necessity some people feel to understand female circumcision, I find it unfortunate that Alice Walker's book and film have become the main resources on the topic. Walker is a talented, inelligent woman--but she did not do her research, treated African women with extreme condescension (except for those living in Europe), and distorted the topic entirely. The true issue is far more complex and cannot simply be called mutilation across the board. Examples of her errors in the compiling/writing of this information: saying that Wolof people didn't practice a form of circumcision and then interviewing a Wolof woman (she hadn't even taken time to recognize the language), ridiculing the most respected women in society, only defining one form out of 5 or more forms of circumcision, completely denying the validity of any African medicines/medical awareness. While one can be legitimately concerned with the treatment of women globally, and should be, we (especially as outsiders looking in) have to let ourselves be educated on the topic as much as is allowable by those who really understand before we can presume to make any judgements as Walker does throughout her book/film. I also think her use of &quot;dance&quot; perpetuated the making of African women's intellects into physical qualities, creating a sort of veneration in objectification (for those who saw the film)."},{"Title":"Warrior Marks: Female Genital Mutilation and the Sexual Blinding of Women","review":"While I admit I did not read this book in its entirety, I did skim through carefully at a friend's house. The book is less about FGM and more about Alice Walker herself. There is isn't much useful ethnographic information pertaining to the practice of FGM, and Walker has the arrogant habit of leaping to conclusions in regards to what a cultural practice (such as the killing of a chicken in from of the girls before the circumcision) may mean (assuming its intended to intimidate the girls) rather than actually asking the people themselves for information. Walker constantly laments the loss that the women experience from FGM, and while she is of course, absolutely right, her constant handwringing about it throughout the text is extremely tiresome and is preaching to the choir. We get it, FGM is absolutely terrible. Repeating that over and over again is not going to improve the situation.Don't get me wrong, there is some useful information in here about FGM and how to end it, but you have to sift through a lot of self-indulgent and irrelvant text to get to it.

I was VERY disappointed in this book and think it is one of the most misleading titles/text I have ever read. This book barely touches on FGM with any detail or facts. It is 99% about her making the film and what they did on a daily basis. While that may be insightful to some, I wanted to know details about the issue. I have read Possessing the Secret of Joy by Alice Walker and this is a better book by far. I wouldn't waste the time to read or buy Warrior Marks and recommend you start with another book that actually deals with the topic. What a terrible follow up to Alice Walker's great start at educating us on FGM."},{"Title":"Warrior Marks: Female Genital Mutilation and the Sexual Blinding of Women","review":"I had high hopes for this work, hopes that were dashed when reading how the authors wanted to travel and explore their topic first hand but were afraid that they'd be harmed in Africa. As if Jane Goodall worried about being eaten when she studied our primate cousins.Then the authors chose to avoid personal contact and do their research in the library, reading the works of other people, thus presenting older second hand material as accurate without bothering to check the veracity or continuity of the material.Finally, the authors personal bias came through often such as when they complained how combing the hair of a black girl was abusing and degrading and even torturing the girl.At least Dr Godall had the guts to ask if the beliefs we had about gorillas were true and then seek the truth in their homes. Ms Walker and friend rarely left the library or their hotel and passed off the works of other researchers without question other than to blame men for all the ills that befall women.FYI- It is women who choose to pierce their own ears, labia and clits, not men.If you wish accurate information on the subject of genital mutilation, look elsewhere because all you will find here is second-hand data and personal bias and personal insults against anyone who disagrees with them."},{"Title":"The wreck,","review":"Tagore, the definitive master of poetic prose, demonstrates his sublime literary sensibilities yet again in this beautiful tale set in Bengal sometime in the late nineteenth / early twentieth centuries. Originally published in Bengali under the title of &quot;Naukadubi&quot; (which means boat-wreck), this novel tells the story of how the capsizing of a boat carrying a wedding party across the river Ganga in a storm changes the lives of the two main protagonists of the story for ever. Tagore's writing is superlative, especially in dealing with love, melancholy and exquisite descriptions of nature, and this novel brings forth those qualities vividly."},{"Title":"The wreck,","review":"I read this book long back.

Combine Neville Shute, Frederick Forsythe, Ernest K. Gann and Ian Fleming, and you'd get Gavin Lyall. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Under African Skies: Modern African Stories","review":"The talent of story telling is widespread in Africa. Oral history is part of the makeup of the multitude of societies that have evolved in Africa over millennia. Through colonial times the traditions of story telling has continued, preserving the rich culture and history of the communities. Published works of African writers were small in numbers in comparison to other continents and literary training the privilege of very few. With the wave of African countries' independence, the situation of African fiction authors did not improve much. Obstacles were numerous, from political difficulties to lack of a paying audience in the African market. Larson contends that the \\"most extraordinary aspect of African literature [during the last fifty years] is its resilience.\\" His introduction to this collection of African short fiction of the last few decades summarizes the challenges and the triumphs of many African writers. He describes his difficulty of selection among the many and varied writers from across the continent.Twenty six writers from seventeen countries are introduced, including internationally well-known authors like Chinua Achebe, Sembene Ousmane and Ken Saro-Wiwa. Others, locally recognized, in their country of origin or, too often, of exile, deserve a much wider larger audience. The stories, roughly arranged chronologically, range from the very personal vignette to the magical realism of a place or person. Early works might address the domestic-master relationship, such as Es'kia Mphahlele's delightful \\"Mrs. Plum\\" or the moving story of \\"The Black Girl\\" by Ousmane. Landscapes can be important backdrops or become essential elements that lure the innocent into their realm. \\"The Complete Gentleman\\" changes into everything but that once he enters the forest. Conflict and devastation are touched upon as they haunt the living such as in Ben Okri's story \\"A Prayer from the Living\\". While the styles vary from one author to the next, we also find commonalities and parallels in the events described: personal tragedies, war, heroism and defeat. Taken together, the book builds a tapestry of African realities with the dreams and the magic woven in. It reads like one complex literary work with many individual and diverse chapters.Each author is briefly introduced by Larson and their writing placed into context of their life and literary career. Thereby the author instilled some curiosity in the reader to read more of one or the other writer. The book, published in 1997/8, maintains its importance today as an excellent overview of African literary talent. Don't stop there, however. There is a rich field out there to explore. [Friederike Knabe]"},{"Title":"Under African Skies: Modern African Stories","review":"I have always been wary of collections of stories written by multiple authors - I am afraid that they will be lacking in content as the editor attempts to create some sort of image of the type of author he/she is collecting. This is emphatically not the case here.While I was initially struck by the alien nature of the cultures from which these stories come - I am a Brooklynite through and through - this did not stop me from devouring UNDER AFRICAN SKIES: MODERN AFRICAN STORIES. (Here I feel I should note that I read this book as part of a discussion based seminar this past year I spent at Trinity College. My classmates provided me with great insight, but most of the joy I found in reading this work stemmed from the superb quality and provocative nature of these stories.) Although it would be an over statement to say that every single story in this collection is great, some - including Alexander Kanehgoni's EFFORTLESS TEARS - are among the best short stories I have ever encountered. I say \\"encountered\\" and not \\"read\\" because you do not simply read many of these stories, you experience them both intellectually and emotionally. Buy this book, let it speak to you - do not be discouraged by cultural barriers - you will not be disappointed.In a final note, I would like to concur with the \\"A reader from New York City\\" that this book should not be read in a single sitting. Each story should be read more than once: there are layers of meaning that simply cannot be grasped without careful reading and re-reading. This is not to say that the work cannot be enjoyed without careful study, but that it becomes more enjoyable the more time you devote to it."},{"Title":"Under African Skies: Modern African Stories","review":"There's a nagging irony in reading these stories. Africa, the home of our species, must now lament the return of her descendants as conquerors and oppressors. Larson, who has compiled other collections of African writing, presents us with a litany of more than two dozen expressions of frustration and helplessness. That's not to say these tales are merely depressing reading. The authors are too human and witty in their expressive narratives to be so limited. Larson has assembled the works of writers equal in their talents with authors from any culture. Grace Ogrot, Ben Okri, Bessie Head and Ken Saro-Wiwa, may all be placed in balance with those in the \\"Western\\" ranks.The powerful stories by these articulate writers, however, don't offer much in the way of humour. Living in Africa today is no laughing matter. Before the collapse of apartheid and the turning out of colonial powers, it was even worse. Most of these stories represent those times and conditions. Of them all, Ken Saro-Wiwa's \\"Africa Kills Her Sun\\" may be the most poignant and compelling. The title imparts much at the outset. It's the story of a robber facing execution and certainly seizes the reader. That's particularly true when you recall the author would be facing his own martyrdom only a few years later. It's also symptomatic of the tone of the collection with its depiction of government corruption and arbitrary use of power.On the other hand, if you are interested in the African woman's view of life, which of these should you place first in your reading queue? Yvonne Vera's \\"Why Don't You Carve Other Animals\\"? Nurrudin Farah's \\"My Father, the Englishman and I\\"? Or Mzamane Nhlapo's \\"Give me a Chance\\"? Each will lead you to a facet of women's lives in Africa. There's an added fillip when you realise two of those writers are men. Women writers have much to say, but have struggled \\"manfully\\"[?] to gain a place in the pantheon of African authors. Besides Vera, there's Ama Ata Aidoo, Veronique Tadjo, and Sindiwe Magona. Their contributions to this gathering bring a fresh and evocative voice to African writing.It's indicative of the African scene that several of these writers were living in exile at the time these stories were first published. Another aspect of this collection is the number of \\"non-English-writing\\" authors have a strong representation. In the \\"West\\" it's too easy to overlook the plethora of languages permeating Africa - with French and Portuguese translations appearing here. The clash of cultures includes religion, as well. Islam is a major force in Africa and it and Christianity remain in subdued conflict with traditional gods. From these are derived food taboos, family relations and medicinal practices. Only lately have we outside our home continent become aware of the benefits of them. We overlook how many people rely on these social factors for survival - and who are forced to abandon them under external pressures. What happens when a family comes under the domination of a fanatical Christian convert? Ngugi wa Thiong'o's Kenyan story \\"A Meeting In the Dark\\" offers some valuable insight into what the West has imposed there.If forced to choose a \\"favourite\\" among these tales, it would likely be Es'kia Mphalele's \\"Mrs Plum\\". Told from the view of Mrs Plum's servant girl, Karabo - also known as \\"Jane\\" - it deals with the complex interactions between black Africans and whites living in but loathing the culture apartheid created. There are three \\"big things\\" in Mrs Plum's life. Karabo isn't one of them, but she will be. As the longest story in the collection, Mphalele's tale is able to delve more deeply into the issues through his character. He also uses Karabo to explain many elements in the daily lives of South Africans. Apartheid may be gone, but it's hard to believe Karabo's life is any more fulfilled than it was when this was written.

Each story--all are brief, all are powerful in their way--is preceded by an introduction to the writer and context of the work. The book is not long, but cannot be read at a sitting, not unless you're made of iron. These are unblinking stories of colonial and postcolonial Africa. Buy it for Birago Diop's story alone, or Ken Saro-Wiwa's."},{"Title":"Under African Skies: Modern African Stories","review":"This book was published in 1997 and contains 26 works by as many writers, from 16 countries. South Africa and Nigeria are best represented, with 4-5 stories each. Other countries, with 1-2 stories each, include those from the west (Senegal, Gambia, Guinea, Liberia, Ivory Coast, Ghana), the east and center (Cameroon, Kenya, Sudan, Somalia) and the south (Mozambique, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Lesotho). Ethiopia, Congo (Dem. Rep.), Tanzania and Uganda are the most populous countries whose writers weren't included.The stories in the book range from the late 1940s to the 1990s, with most published in the 1960s and 90s. The great majority of the pieces were written in English in the original, a few were translated from French and one each from Portuguese and Arabic. The editor's intention seems to have been to introduce readers to both well-known, older writers and stories as well as to newer ones.Earlier writers included Birago Diop, Es'kia Mphahlele, Amos Tutuola, Sembene Ousmane, Camara Laye, Tayeb Salih, Chinua Achebe, Grace Ogot and Rene Philombe. Younger ones included Tijan Sallah, Ben Okri, V&eacute;ronique Tadjo, Yvonne Vera and Mzamane Nhlapo. The book didn't contain short stories by writers such as Ekwensi, Gordimer, Nwapa, Djebar, Breytenbach, Dongala, Iyayi, Mungoshi, Ndebele, Wicomb, Vassanji, or Marechera, or excerpts by novelists such as Emecheta or Coetzee.The stories in the collection mainly cover daily life, family relations, social customs, and people's behavior in crises such as illness, the search for work, the death of a loved one, government or social oppression, corruption and war. Most of the works were straightforward and realistic. Many, such as Es'kia Mphahlele's \\"Mrs. Plum,\\" Rene Philombe's \\"The True Martyr Is Me,\\" Don Mattera's \\"Afrika Road,\\" Tijan Sallah's \\"Innocent Terror,\\" Steve Chimombo's \\"Taken,\\" Similih Cordor's \\"In the Hospital,\\" and Sindiwe Magona's \\"I'm Not Talking about That Now,\\" contained an element of social criticism; in most cases well done, in a few cases, in my opinion, stylistically uninteresting and strident. A few others, such as those by Tutuola, Camara, Diop and the more contemporary V&eacute;ronique Tadjo, used dreamlike narratives similar to magic realism. The anthology didn't contain any politically satiric works, except maybe Achebe's \\"Girls at War,\\" in which a government member keeps running into a patriotic girl during a time of civil war, and sees the girl's circumstances worsen drastically while his own improve. Emmanuel Dongala does this type of writing well, and a story of his could've been included.Of the newer pieces in the anthology, the ones I enjoyed most were an excerpt from Tadjo's novel As the Crow Flies, which used images in a surreal, striking way (\\"She parted from him, laid her hands on his forehead, and opened his skull. What she saw inside frightened her. It was a desert of sadness and solitude. It looked like a battlefield . . . . in the distance, she spotted a lake and, beyond that, a plain on which the grass seemed green and smiling. The earth there was rich . . . . From that time on, she spent her days devising a means of reaching the valley . . . .\\"). Mzamane Nhlapo's \\"Give Me a Chance,\\" about a mother who goes against the customs of her society, which expects women to ask for permission from their elders or husband when they seek work, to feed herself and her children. And Steve Chimombo's \\"Taken,\\" in which the narrator tries to find out why his writer friend was arrested by his oppressive government, while dealing with the people around him who expect his turn is next. Another piece, \\"A Gathering of Bald Men,\\" by Mandla Langa, was a humorous story about a happily married black salaryman whose life begins to come apart after he starts losing his hair. It had some interest for showing scenes from life in post-apartheid South Africa and being a rather light, comic tale; too light, maybe.Of the older works, I enjoyed Grace Ogot's \\"Tekayo,\\" written in the style of an oral tale, about an older man who violates dietary and other customs and brings disaster on himself and his family. And Sembene Ousmane's \\"Black Girl,\\" about the cultural dislocation and prejudice experienced by a Senegalese maid who's taken by her French employer to work in France.This anthology, edited by Charles Larson, is one of the more recent collections in English of writers from Africa, together with Nadezhda Obradovic's Anchor Book of Modern African Stories, published in 2002. Readers who enjoyed Larson's anthology might also enjoy Obradovic's. The collections differ in that Larson's devotes more space to older writers and earlier decades, and comparatively less space to newer ones.Larson has compiled at least two previous anthologies devoted wholly to Africa: African Short Stories, published in the United States in 1970, and Opaque Shadows and Other Stories from Contemporary Africa, published in 1975. Under African Skies incorporates about a third of the stories from the earlier collections."},{"Title":"Kegley's Virginia Frontier","review":"With its vast territorial rights and claims, Virginia at one time had the most extensive frontier of any of the original thirteen states and colonies. Moreover, Virginia served as a gateway for the various migrations to the west, northwest, and southwest by early colonists, including the intrepid Scotch-Irish. By far the most authoritative and comprehensive account of the advance of the Virginia frontier in colonial times is Kegley's Virginia Frontier--a mammoth work detailing the social, religious, and family life in Southwest Virginia from 1730 to 1790.The importance of this extraordinary work to genealogists cannot be overstated. Kegley culled through a multitude of original records to ensure that his work would be the most reliable sourcebook available on this subject. To help the reader understand the migration into this new area, Kegley focuses particularly on the settlers themselves. He identifies each newcomer with his place of settlement, and then examines the pioneer's experiences and subsequent movements, using nearly three dozen maps to show more definitively the location of settlements and important homesteads. More than sixty additional illustrations further enhance and clarify the text.The narrative is divided into five parts: Part I covers the Virginia frontier from the beginning of the colony to 1740; Part II covers the period from 1740 to 1760; Part III tells the story of the Virginia frontier in the French and Indian War; Part IV covers the closing years of the war and the settlements from 1760 to the organization of Botetourt County in 1770; and Part V details the organization and development of Botetourt County from 1770 to 1783. Throughout each of these parts--in section after section--there are biographical sketches and countless lists of land grants and deeds of conveyance identifying thousands upon thousands of settlers and their family members. This documentary history is without a doubt the premier source of information on the pioneers of the Virginia frontier.\\"Henceforth [Kegley's Virginia Frontier] will be regarded and accepted as the one necessary and sufficient corner-stone in any collection of books dealing with the history of the Virginia frontier.\\"--Samuel M. Wilson"},{"Title":"Kegley's Virginia Frontier","review":"This is a classic piece of history, meticulously researched from available records. It is of particular importance and significance to those, like myself, who are researching family history of those ancestors who lived in this area of the Virginia frontier during the years 1740-1780."},{"Title":"Kegley's Virginia Frontier","review":"I was so happy to find this book at a reasonable price. This will be a great help with my genealogy. It's a wonderful addition to any library for those interested in Colonial American History, specially Virginia frontier."},{"Title":"Kegley's Virginia Frontier","review":"This enormous, chunky paperback is a reprint of Frederick Kegley's original 1938 book. The current book is published by The Genealogical Publishing Company, Baltimore, MD. While the title of the book may give you some idea that this is a work of narrative history, the current publisher's name should clarify exactly what this book is.It is a huge genealogical reference book, full of land grands, surveys, tax rolls, court records, local censuses, household inventories, etc... While the book is very good at recording the movements of people, it tells very little narrative history. Those bits of history that are included are there to explain the motivations for migration rather than an attempt to reconstruct past events.Another thing potential readers may want to know is that the region of coverage is frontier VIRGINIA, and should not be confused with Southwest Virginia. Essentially, this book tracks the migration of German and (mostly) Scots-Irish peoples to the West, over the Blue Ridge, from Staunton down to Roanoke. This is the story of Lexington and Lewisburg, of Moorefield and Union, of Bedford and Fincastle, NOT of Wytheville and Abingdon. The upper James and Roanoke rivers, Augusta and Botetourt counties are most emphasized, beginning with the earliest pioneer movements in the late 1720s. Daniel Boone is not really part of this story, his work being further south and west.There are many interesting black & white illustrations and maps in the book. Many of the old houses are shown, as are good maps of the frontier. All of the maps have been reduced down to fit on a single page, so they are frequently difficult to read.I recommend this book for genealogical researchers, but would stop short of recommending it for general historians. It's a good resource for local historians, and could also be useful for architectural historians.Readers interested in Southwest Virginia should consider Preston's equally huge Annals of Southwest Virginia."},{"Title":"Kegley's Virginia Frontier","review":"This is a VERY comprehensive book on the Virginia frontier in the 1700s. Reference is made to many, many records concerning the settlement of the lands in Augusta and Botetourt counties, although because of the changing of the county boundaries, some reference is made to Orange, Spotsylvania and Caroline counties. Identification of many prominent people and families are contained throughout as well as reference to many skirmishes with Indians and the fates, by named individual, of participants. This book is worth far, far more than it costs, as many tens of thousands of dollars in expenses would be required to gather this information beyond that of the value of your time in doing so."},{"Title":"Critical and historical essays","review":"This edition is replete with ridiculous typographical errors and I therefore cannot recommend it. For example, in the essay on Robert Clive, his name appears as \\"Olive\\" in several paragraphs and as \\"Clive\\" often on the same page. Every essay contains similar errors. Several headings are missplaced. There is no information on the editor of the text and next to nothing on the publisher."},{"Title":"The Twilight of Sovereignty : How the Information Revolution Is Transforming Our World","review":"The basic premise of this sophisticated book is that you can't hold back progress and in the author's mind, progress is information. I was extremely impressed with how many of his predictions of the future have actually come true. A visionary is good way to describe him. I was not aware of his work with Citicorp but it would be interesting to hear what he would have predicted for the financial services world. He barely talks about it in the book. Too many predictions to mention but you will be impressed at his track record. In summary, because of the age of this book many of his predictions have already happened so you really can't capitalize on many of the ideas. However, it's a short read and a very interesting one at that."},{"Title":"The Twilight of Sovereignty : How the Information Revolution Is Transforming Our World","review":"In \\"The Twilight Of Sovereignty\\", the late Walter Wriston, former Chairman of Citicorp spoke to the positive transformative effects of information technology and the subsequent rise of transparency and democracy through globalization. Although this book was written in 1992, just after the collapse of the Soviet Union, his commentary about the spread of modern communications and how better communications will enable the forces of globalism to erode the power of local tyrannies, empower individuals and promote democracy was prescient. His comments predate those of Walter Russell Mead in \\"Power Terror War And Peace\\" by several years, but are clearly in agreement. In \`Twilight\\" Wriston's view that the so-called managerial class has outlived its usefulness as a communications hierarchy and is now superfluous or even destructive to operational efficiency is a clear example of what Mead calls the Millennial Capitalist replacement of the Fordist managerial state. Wriston also set the stage for Thomas Barnett's call for transparency and globalism as a means to fight terrorism in Barnett's recent book, \\"The Pentagon's New Map\\". In Wriston's view \\"the law of technology is the law of convergence\\" and \\"as information technology brings the news of how others live, the pressure for freedom will be irresistible\\". This is a more eloquent if a less detailed discussion than Barnett's chapter entitled \`Mind the Gap', but the train of thought is essentially the same. This book is more a survey than the intensive development of the ideas that Wriston proposed, but it may be that he just assumed a degree of literacy that is no longer general. His historical references include Max Weber, whose theory of state has sovereignty emerging from the exclusive use of legitimate violence, and Frederick Hayek, whose individual choice based market solutions establish him as the intellectual heir of Adam Smith. Wriston also included modern commentators like Carver Mead and George Gilder who rejoice in the ever- accelerating pace of technological change. Wriston said that change is a constant in the global marketplace and that \\"change is what Americans deal with best.\\" Although somewhat dated, I recommend this book as a concise general preview of the technological globalist argument from one of its original proponents."},{"Title":"The Twilight of Sovereignty : How the Information Revolution Is Transforming Our World","review":"This book is not worth half the postage rate. Written by an elite banker out of touch with most of humanity, this book amounts to an early version of Tom Friendman's work on globalization, written for 3rd graders. His grasp of history is juvenile, based on naive (or mendacious) Cold War political assumptions, and white-washes the role of the U.S. government and elites in building our new global reality. The goal of the book is basically to erode the public's \\"faith\\" in a sovereign nation-state, because information technology passes easily across borders. He uses such examples, \\"The fax machine has become, in effect, the pamphleteer of the late twentieth century.\\" What would be more interesting, instead of predictable attempts at U.S. triumphalism over the Soviet menace, would be more insight into how big bankers like himself rushed into Russia during the 1990's and helped destroy any semblance of an emergent democratic system and brought thugs like Putin into power. This book offers nothing, other than an insight into the intellectual poverty (or deceitfulness) of the elite central banker class and seems to be written for a quasi-literate audience. I'd like my time and money back...very, very disappointing. A real dud."},{"Title":"The Twilight of Sovereignty : How the Information Revolution Is Transforming Our World","review":"When a book has an endorsement from Henry Kissinger and Richard Nixon, this should immediately put up red flags in one's mind as to where this book is headed. The author is an elite globalist who is dramatically in love with the coming New World Order. He tries to persuade the reader to believe that this new information age is going to provide new found liberty to the masses under repressive regimes. That corporations( formerly American) becoming multi-national is a positive aspect for the work force, and that loss of a country's national sovereignty will provide a new power for the masses. This book was written in 1992. Can anyone honestly say that government has lost control over its people? In fact the opposite is occuring. Can one say a company like Boeing which used to provide well paying jobs for Americans, now being multi-national, a smaller percentage of their workforce being American is a good thing? Can anyone say proudly,\\" I am a citzen of the world. I will be glad to serve and protect all nations of the world, and will defend her till my dying day?\\" Make no mistake. This is a fool's paradise. The author believes this system is ideal. Why? Because he made a lot of money working for Citicorp, handling all of the funds from these multi-national companies; while the average American worker is losing his or her job.I was also amused at the author's pretentious claim that we shouldn't base our economy by the GNP anymore. This due to the fact that we are a wealthy nation now not by what we manufacture, but by the imagination and ideas that we have in our minds to improve production. I can just see the U.S. telling China not to worry about our trillion dollar debt, because we are not really poor, we are actually rich because of our innovation. This is absurd!As I was reading this book words the author was using jumped out at me. He refers to words as we, us, ourselves. \\"In this world we are building.\\" Who uses a phrase like that unless you yourself are part of the establishment creating this monster! He uses key words and phrases such as imagination,knowledge increasing, alliances being formed, and global cooperation which has been around since the begiining of time. Anyone familiar with the Bible knows all these things are associated with Bible prophecy. I am conviced that all of this relates to ancient history when the Tower of Babel was being built. Men were coming together in a common cause to build a name for themselves, in opposition to God. God scattered the people and confused their language. Modern man is trying to build the same system and \\"tower\\" again.Don't be deceived.

With control of financial markets, they are able to make or break nations who stand in the way of their eternal drive for greater and greater profits. Mr. Wriston asks us to trust that the corporations' managers are now more enlightened while he acknowledges that they have a brutal history. This book should be a wake up call to any one who is not a member of the stock-holding privileged class that our future lies in sweatshops unless we act now to stop the multi-national corporations."},{"Title":"Dostoevsky's the Brothers Karamazov (Cliffs Notes)","review":"At over 1000 pages of rich complexity, \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\" is much to absorb without an instructor. The notes were quite valuable to me, as one not well versed in Dostoevsky's own opinions or in Russian history and culture during the 1800s, leading up to the revolution. If I were reading the novel as part of a class, as opposed to being a middle-aged person reading on my own, then there would be more context provided, discussion with the class, and suitable parallel research. Hence, I drew on the Cliff Notes for supporting information and sharp analysis to help avoid being overwhelmed by the novel.The book is only 90 pages, and I was impressed with the summaries and the commentary, which I would read after finishing major sections. Many times I found myself agreeing or picking up thoughts or explanations I never would have determined on my own. This is not a simple novel where you can skip a bunch of material and still get the essence. Therefore, I have no guilt at all for using the notes, and I suggest other readers consider doing the same if they are hesitating before the magnitude of Brothers K.The notes' summaries were handy for reviewing where I had been, as I read BK over the span of nearly three weeks, and for going back to check some details about the plot and its themes.Keep in mind that some characters' names and quoted phrases may differ from the translation used in the notes, which won't be a problem."},{"Title":"Dostoevsky's the Brothers Karamazov (Cliffs Notes)","review":"This was a wonderful experience.

Some recipes have serving-day components, like topping with cheese and browning, or adding vegetables (the sweet and sour pork is frozen in two components that you combine on cooking day).These recipes are more complicated than velveeta and cream-of-mushroom soup stuff, but few are difficult (good thing since I hate cooking, which is why I like freezer cooking, and I can get screwed up figuring out how to put on a sweatshirt). They have fancy names that mean common things (mirlitons are just apricot jam tarts). The recipes I've tried (none of the fish) have all been wonderful and freeze well.In addition to the recipes, there are party menus, notes about garnishing and stockpiling (whole chapter, actually), notes on what you can and can't freeze, notes on cooling, notes on reheating, etc.It is a very good addition to a freezer cooking library, especially if you entertain or are tired of the more routine dishes. Not for the wiener-and-tuna-noodle crowd, but not for gourmets and gourmands. Good food, not hard to make, easy to freeze.Though you may never convince me that fish-head soup is good (don't get scared. Boullabaise is just regular soup. You make the stock from fish leftovers, like bones and heads, then strain it, throwing the solids away. If you like Manhattan Clam Chowder you will love boullabaise.

In \\"The Third Life of Grange Copeland\\", the author details an American tragedy, perhaps the great American tragedy, of a family destroyed by the effects of racial oppression in rural 1920's Georgia. We are introduced to father and son (Grange and Brownfield respectively) who collapse emotionally, mentally, and spiritually under the weight of what it is to be a Black man in this country. Although the majority of the story takes place pre Civil Rights Era, the effects of racial oppression portrayed in the novel are visible to the alert reader today.We are first introduced to Grange who has worked on a plantation enduring the hatred and cruelty from his white boss for so long he does not know what it is to be a man. Dismissed, disrespected and dejected, Grange's disdain for the oppressor implodes creating a hollow, spiritless shell of a man. In an effort to exert a misdirected sense of manhood, or perhaps feel what it's like to have the upper hand in something, Grange attempts to liberate himself by drinking, gambling and womanizing, further separating himself from a wife and son he feels unable to love, honor or protect. Grange endures the final insult at the hands of his tormentor when the plantation owner impregnates his wife. He heads North with hopes of finding something better, something new. It is up North that his metamorphosis begins allowing him to return to the South with a newfound sense of self and responsibility.Brownfield, Grange's son, is orphaned when his father leaves and his mother kills herself and her mulatto infant. Father and son meet again when Grange returns home and Brownfield has married. The dynamics of their relationship during this time is the true jewel of this novel. Brownfield finds himself in the same situation as his father - working a plantation, barley able to provide for his family, and eventually stripped of all self-respect. Having married an educated woman, he felt further minimized by his lack of schooling. Repeating the pattern of his father, Brownfield turns to a life of free spirits, using whatever force he can muster within him to reduce his wife (\\"knock her down a notch\\") to his standard of existence.Walker is relentless in her assertion that resistance, at any cost, is the secret of joy, the road to liberation. She is steadfast in her rejection of the subjugation of women by the patriarchy; unwavering in her denunciation of racial oppression. \\"The Third Life of Grange Copeland\\" is a very well done first novel. Definitely representative of the acclaim Walker's later work has achieved. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Third Life of Grange Copeland","review":"Often, if an author writes a book that becomes immensely popular and a mainstay in modern literature, their career is then divided up between before and after. For the majority, I'd say their entry point to an author's canon usually is the well-received work, so it's fun to browse an author's &quot;backlog&quot; and experience their earliest achievements. Having been a fan of Alice Walker for many years but only having read two novels (plus a great deal of short stories and non-fiction), I figured it was time to give her first published novel, &quot;The Third Life of Grange Copeland,&quot; a try.Had this been written by anybody but Alice Walker, I'd say this was one of the most impressive debut novels I've read. Since it *is* written by Walker, I should have known to not be surprised by the eloquence, the poetry and the grittiness of this book. Alice Walker is a storyteller with gifts bordering on the supernatural; if the Southern U.S. landscape could talk, it would sound a lot like Alice Walker. This is the story, told in razor sharp prose, of a man and the effect his actions have on his family over a period of many years. It's not an easy novel to read as there are hard truths in the story of Grange and Brownfield but there are lessons that will stay with the reader. This is also an interesting study on the actions of an individual, and who is to blame; society or the man/woman? There are no such easy answers in this book and I found myself wavering between sympathy and outright hatred for some of the characters, but it's the mark of a great read when I can feel so much for a story."},{"Title":"The Third Life of Grange Copeland","review":"I enjoyed reading The Third Life of Grange Copeland because it left me, at the end of each chapter, wanting to know what would happen next. This novel was easy to read and understand. I recommend it to any age group from middle school or higher."},{"Title":"The Third Life of Grange Copeland","review":"Is the perpetual question that comes up through successive parts of the novel.Is it the younger Grange Copeland when you see his behavior toward his wife and child?Is it his son Brownfield, the eventual killer of his wife?Is it the Jim Crow South that created the poisoned conditions under which such destrction could be wrought on a family?Is it the Northerners who brought deluded dreams that the black Southerners had of a free and better life in the North?As expected, this is one of Walker's novels that was written when she was &quot;young and hungry,&quot; and the care that she takes to lead the reader in sundry directions is painstaking and evident.A must read or anyone who is sufficiently cerebral to look for latent meanings."},{"Title":"The Third Life of Grange Copeland","review":"This is a beautifully written, eye-opening tale of life for poor blacks in the mid-twentieth-century South. I highly recommend it for lending perspective to the lives of oppressed people. However, it is an EXTREMELY DEPRESSING book, particularly for a white person who wishes her own race to be less horrible to others."},{"Title":"The Third Life of Grange Copeland","review":"Exceptional writer! Vivid easy flowing language. Not only adresses pregidous, but addresses how humans of any color can sometimes be their own worst enemy."},{"Title":"The Third Life of Grange Copeland","review":"I have only read one other of Alice Walker's books (the impressive, involving, passionate ''Meridian''). But I can tell from her works, she is both a good, and consistant writer. I found this book less involving than ''Meridian'', because it tells of the life of a black family, not a black woman. Alice Walker writes of the lives of a once-handsome, happy black man, named Brownfield Copeland, who grew up the son of a sharecropper named Grange Copeland, living in despair. When his father abandons them he runs from the sharecropper's home and builds a family with a beautiful woman Mem. Soon enough the reality of his trapped despair hits him, and he takes out his anger, and frustration at being a black man in a country where blacks (and other minorities), are treated as less than human. He beats and abuses his wife, and children. After a dramatic, life-changing event, one of his daughter's ,Ruth , goes to live with her grandfather, and Brownfield's father Grange. Being raised with Grange, Ruth lives in a happy and protected world, but is not without her share of pain. She reaches sixteen with her grandfather, but then Brownfield comes back to claim his child. Can Grange protect his beloved granddaughter, from having to live with her father, the monster?I suggest that before reading this book, you read '' Black Like Me'', by John Howard Griffin. This book helps to paint a better picture of the despair of African-Americans and the system of white injustice, which this book, despite all its strengths, does not do vividly.One thing I am exceedingly impressed with in this book, is that, although it is clearly shown that Brownfield's abusive behavior was caused by the trapped reality of his exsistence as a black man, Alice Walker refuses to excuse Brownfield's behavior with the injustices imposed by whites. She points out that there is a solace inside of all human beings, which can resist domination- an inner strength that refuses to allow the opresser to turn him to hatred. Not being a black person, but being a member of a minority group, I highly empathize with Brownfield- who for all his viciousness is still shown to have a side of humanity. But it's Grange who is the true main character in this book- and he is brought to life with honesty, clarity, and a goodness, although he is by no means a saint, or even meant as an example. I would highly recommend this poignant, and sensitive book."},{"Title":"The Third Life of Grange Copeland","review":"This is a great read. I would recommend it for anyone that enjoys reading about racial challenges, suspense, romance, scandal, etc... Classic novel by this author."},{"Title":"The Third Life of Grange Copeland","review":"This is the third time I've read this book. I continue reading because it is such an interesting study of a Black man's life in the South. In my opinion, even though I doubt most people would agree with me, it is the best of Alice Walker's books, including &#34;The Color Purple&#34;/"},{"Title":"The Third Life of Grange Copeland","review":"Although I read it once in 1988 and now again in 2012, I can understand the way the main two characters related to the world and how the way the world treated them shaped they way they treated most people. It was a hard-hitting story that spoke of the very real notion of Blacks being in their place as it related to their interactions with whites especially back in the 1940-1960s in the US. A must read."},{"Title":"The Third Life of Grange Copeland","review":"I rarely read a book in one day, not enough time, but this one I did. Obviously I have no way of knowing what it was like for a black man during the years of this book but every time Brownfield blamed someone else for his pitiful life I wanted to scream, grow up!! Brownfield blames everything wrong in his life on the white people, especially the men. Jealousy is really behind his rantings. He sees what they have and he doesn't. Could he have done better for himself and his family? I would hope so. Drinking and beating your wife until she hates you are not living. Then he starts beating his daughters. Only after he kills Mem and Ruth goes to live with her changed grandfather, Grange, do we see what black men can do to change their lives. Grange changed his. He puts his entire life into Ruth. He learns and he passes it on to her. He adores her and she him. Grange is exactly what a child like Ruth needed after living through hell with Brownfield. I do not want to give the ending away so I am not going to comment except that perhaps a circle was broken.I liked the book, but got very sick and tired of Brownfield's whining and whining. Get up and do something with your life then."},{"Title":"The Third Life of Grange Copeland","review":"I have heard that Alice Walker is an incredible writer, which may be true (it is forgivable, since this was her first novel), but I found The Third Life of Grange Copeland to be extremely disappointing. First of all, I expected more quality in it -- this read like a soap opera story. This is why I shy away from best-sellers, but I thought Walker might be different. I can see her strengths in writing, but I do not even feel as if a vivid portrait of anything was painted. The characters, the home, the reasons behind many of the abrupt actions were all left unanswered. After putting up with that plot throughout the book, I expected a decent ending (I stuck it out). However, the ending was the worst part, as it came suddenly and then the novel was over. I still plan on reading other books by Alice Walker, but I would not recommend this one to anyone demanding a good plot."},{"Title":"The Third Life of Grange Copeland","review":"I know people think that Alice Walker is a great author and I can say that The Color Purple has had a very strong influence over the world, especially the African american community; but this book isn't nearly as impacting as The Color Purple. The characters are flat as paper, and don't have a voice. The only character I could really say that does have a voice is Ruth, but she is the only sane character in the whole book, and everybody else is just tangled in bad writing and horrible plot structure. Now, don't get me wrong, I can see where The Third Life and The Color Purple are similar, but NO one should read this book. It is horribly written, and it is weak. I was expecting better out of her since she wrote such a good and influencing book, but this books sucks. Don't even buy it, save your money and don't get it. Buy another book, like Private by Kate Brian. It is TEN times better and has more juicer drama. Better yet, buy the Color Purple and step away from any other book by this author. Just step away."},{"Title":"The Third Life of Grange Copeland","review":"Occurring within the Jim Crow era, mimicking the unconscious assimilating mindset of the American South, A.

Thank you, wise woman."},{"Title":"The Third Life of Grange Copeland","review":"I was mesmerized by this book. I believe it is her best."},{"Title":"The Third Life of Grange Copeland","review":"Alice Walker has done an amazing job with this story! Not only are the characters thouroughly complex and engaging, their depictions are refreshingly honest and human. The reader will find that no masks are worn in this story. The good and the bad of each are shown, and their internal struggles with this are expressed so well that readers themselves are allowed to determine at most what is just from what isnt and if not, at least why the characters are who they are.I will not describe the story in detail because I believe that it should unfold as a person reads. I will however say that the story itself is about relationships; familial, love, personal, communal, and societal; as well as struggle. However, what this story spends a great deal of time capturing and developing is what it means emotionally and psychologically, to be a poor black sharecropper and a man, living a dehumanizing and de-&quot;man&quot;izing existence in the South, during the beginning - mid part of the past hundred years. If you read this book and are not moved and educated by its story, stop what you're doing and read the book again, you have missed something big.This book makes my personal top 10 list and has opened me up to the world of Alice Walker. I will recommend this book to EVERYONE I know who is interested a well written, informative, and inspiring, quick, great read! Also recommended are &quot;A Gathering of Old Men&quot; and &quot;In My Fathers House&quot;, both by Ernest Gaines.

I read it forty years ago. And have many times since. It is inexplicable, there is no summing it. Nothing you can say that isn't just words.I look at my hand holding this book, and it looks different than the one that turned the first page so long ago. Older. And that's a surprise. This surprise of time and space, life, compressed, love, loss, youth, and the fundamental innocence of perception... self-destruction as life is, by being lived, self destruction ... all of this succumbs to a single singing moment of Nagel's bow on the violin string in Mysteries, and then disappears into the modesty of the final inevitable anonymity. No distinction between chaos and order.Just the heart as it was."},{"Title":"The Mysteries","review":"The existential nightmare par excellence of unrequited love.This is the third book of Hamsun's I've read at this point - Growth of the Soil and Hunger being the other two - and I'd say, probably the best of these. It is an obvious offshoot of Hunger in that it deals with one man's existential crisis, and contains a slight amount of foreshadowing for the pastoral ideals attempted in Growth of the Soil. Like Hunger, Mysteries depicts a man at wits end, alienated and starving for fulfillment in a crass and forsaken world. Johan Nilsson Nagel randomly decides to take up residence in a small Norwegian village and involve himself in its social life. In fact, he falls in love (\\"obsesses over\\" might be more accurate) with two different women and befriends the village idiot, Miniman, about whom he is curious as though he were his own doppelganger. Nagel is living off an inheritance and could care less about money, which he gladly attempts to dispense with in every bar, shop and encounter with his newfound subjects. There's really not much plot to speak of and that's part of the \\"mystery\\" of it all: Where did he come from? Why is he here? What's he doing? It is a testament to Hamsun's success in this most self-reflecting and self-conscious of novels that you'll be looking around yourself and over your own shoulders asking these same questions and reflecting as to whether Nagel's increasingly paranoid delusions and wild dreams are his, or your own. Quite disturbing!On the whole, Nagel is a philanthropic and philosophical man who seeks to do good, but whose deeds are largely unaccepted, much like Christ. His simple wish is to have \\"a mission in the world\\", but failing this basic requirement, he seeks to somehow achieve something \\"that would scandalize the carnivores\\" of the world (p.228). A vial of Prussic acid hangs around his neck and its clear from his nightly wanderings through the local forest that these are his only compensations for an otherwise spiritless existence. As we and the villagers come to know him his conversations grow stranger and stranger and yet they are full of strange paradoxes and premonitions. Whereas in Hunger Hamsun focused almost exclusively on one man's internal battles with starvation, with Mysteries we get a more rounded depiction of a man living from contingency to contingency. Hamsun largely does away with the literary conventions of his day, and ours, and by doing so has divided critical opinions about the success of this novel. Following Nagel's meanderings through town, in the forest, and in his own psyche is often uncomfortable and even a little frightening; a bit like watching a train-wreck in slow-motion, but always compelling and stimulating. On the whole, this is a fascinating and refreshing novel with many potential ideas for modern novelists.This 2001 Penguin edition contains an informative introduction by the translator, Sverre Lyngstad, a comparative literature professor from Norway who is somewhat of an expert on Knut Hamsun. There are both textual and explanatory notes as well as suggestions for further reading (not to mention a great Edvard Munch woodcut on the cover!) making this paperback the sine qua non of Mysteries. Go crazy!! (\\"To be well adjusted to a sick society is no sign of good health\\")."},{"Title":"The Mysteries","review":"I think Lyngstad is right on in translating midget into miniman because the midget is a double of Nagel and this translation reflects the intended meaning of Hamsun. Lyngstad's pacing is a little slower than the older translation perhaps because he is trying to be so very literal his english word count perhaps mounts a little to high. This is a small caveat however. I would rather see more of what Hamsun intended than read a free interpretation which the last translation was close to being. Lyngstad lambasts the other translations a little too much for my taste. If he didn't have his own translation to hawk his criticism would be more convincing. Like Hunger, Hamsun's first novel, Mysteries is great stuff, read it and experience a thousand miniature blind angels showering down on you."},{"Title":"The Mysteries","review":"Mysteries tells the story Johan Nagel, a young man who mysteriously appears in a small coastal Norwegian town, unsettles it with his bizarre behavior, and then disappears just as abruptly.Mysteries does not have a proper plot. Instead the narrative simply follows Nagel as he interacts with the townspeople. Hamsun believed fiction should delve into the intricacies of the human mind, and like the human mind, should move and change directions moment to moment. He didn't think a character should have one dominant trait, which was the fictional mode of his time, but should reflect real life by having many, shifting, and often conflicting traits. Thus we spend a lot of time on the roller coaster ride of Nagel's inner thoughts, which could be alternately reasonable and crazy, arrogant and humble, self-righteous and cruel.As the title implies, there are many mysteries here. Nagel does not reveal a complete history of himself, and when he does reveal something, it's often in an obtuse way. Sometimes we catch Nagel in lies, and we feel as befuddled and intrigued by him as the townspeople who are also trying to figure him out. But Nagel also catches some of them out in their own lies, and this is where the novel gets interesting, as we learn that they are as unique and conflicted as Nagel.The main storylines here are Nagel's love for the town's engaged beauty, Dagny, who Nagel harasses while her betrothed is away (he is a military man), and his interest in The Midget, who, as the nickname implies, is a much-maligned midget. Nagel's love is not so surprising given the young woman's charm and beauty. (as Nagel arrives in town, another man has just committed suicide over her just announced engagement) What is surprising is Dagny's response to him, which some might find conflicted enough to explain Nagel's madness for her by itself. In the Midget, Nagel seems to find a project. When he first sees the Midget, he's being picked on. Nagel tries to show The Midget respect to counter his treatment at the hands of the rest of the town, but The Midget resists. Why is this? In these two storylines, we see all the complexities of human relationships, the highs that human nature can attain as well as the lows, and the sometimes inhuman indifference we can sometimes feel for others, as well as ourselves.Hamsun is not popular here in America for his style, which eschews plot for sometimes rambling emotional narrative. (Hamsun is one of those many cases in art where an influence of more popular artists is neglected in comparison to the influenced. Hamsun influenced many of the giants of early twentieth century literature, including Faulkner, Hemingway, Kafka and Joyce.) But, even if this style doesn't appeal to you, I think you'll find many redeeming qualities in his writing. His prose is lyrical, often lyrical enough to pull you through some of the longer voyages of thought. And he reaches for high goals, no less a one than to understand the human mind. This is a noble cause in itself, but what makes him genius is his accuracy in reflecting it. When one finishes reading Mysteries, some mysteries still remain, but we feel like we know more than we did before about human nature, and that's important. If you've never read Hamsun before, he's worth a look."},{"Title":"The Mysteries","review":"Johan Nagel appears one day in a small Norwegian town. This novel is all about Nagel, a man who cannot be described simply. He is incredibly selfless and kindly to those he meets and generally learns to expect nothing in return. Nagel gives respect to a man who is continuously maltreated by everyone with whom he comes into contact. Yet when Nagel hands this poor soul, aptly named Miniman, a letter to deliver to a particular person, Miniman refuses to comply. Nagel falls in love with a beautiful young woman, Dagny, whom he knows to be engaged to be married. She does not allow Nagel to become interested in her sister, an unusually plain looking woman, simply because if Nagel cannot have Dagny he certainly has no right to her sister either. Nagel offers a substantial sum of money to a woman for a family heirloom, a chair, that she owns, only for the woman to refuse anything but a paltry sum for it. Negativity seems to follow Nagel wherever he goes or whatever he does. He seems surrounded by sadness and impending death throughout this novel.Yet \\"Mysteries\\" is far from being a bore. It is extraordinarily well written and is fraught with a feeling of impending doom. Nagel is such a good and decent man and seems to have done nothing to deserve this life full of emptiness and disdain. Perhaps such an individual can only be appreciated after he has died."},{"Title":"The Mysteries","review":"I have re-read this book a few dozen times. Johann Nagel, a dandyish/genius/maniac/ romeo type in a yellow coat, wanders from the eternal Nowhere into a small town, destroys all it's pretensions, and returns to the eternal Nowhere in the end, his suicide a protest against complacency of any kind. There are scenes in this novel which I simply cannot forget, such as when Nagel brings the town's hypocritical intellectual circle to the point of mortal desperation simply by his presence. He befriends a pathetic hunchback and teaches him how to assert himself. He simultaneously attracts and repulses the town's women with his pledges of undying love and bizarre subconscious visions. Hamsun is on a plane with Hesse and \\"Mysteries\\" is as good, if not better, than \\"Steppenwolf\\". The vial of Prussic acid he carries in his coat is a symbol for the dangerous line we are treading in Western Civilization. This is a dark descent into the mind of a complete outsider. I agree with another reviewer in that this has the subtlety and terror of a Greek tragedy. Hamsun treats his frenetic character with the compassion of a mother with a newborn child, but does not romanticize him a bit. Unforgettable."},{"Title":"The Mysteries","review":"Mysteries, commonly reckoned to be one among a handful of the best books of fiction ever written. It\`s a pure joyride trough mind and soul at incredibly pace, from where you follow the most mysterious main character from his arrival in the little Norwegian coastal town. The reader is just as puzzled as the locals in the town of what kind of man this stranger is, but as an advantage to the reader, you can also follow the stream of conscience in the strangers mind. And just this is something Hamsun basically was the first person to draw into the novel. And more masterly than he did it, it can hardly be done! Mysteries is one of the best and most important books of fiction belonging to the 20th century, even though it was published eight years before it\`s start!"},{"Title":"The Mysteries","review":"Reading &quot;Mysteries&quot; is like being able to read music: our soul is touched, moved and transformed by the sounds coming from these pages. It is also a novel so far of complacency, very modern and surprisingly tough. I hope some present writers could take note."},{"Title":"The Mysteries","review":"With 'Mysteries', Hamsun succeeded at creating one of modern literature's most interesting and dynamic main characters (Nagel).Arguably, this novel's ability to captivate, stun, and thoroughly astound the reader is even greater than in Hamsun's more famous work, 'Hunger'. One can read and re-read this book and develop dozens of various theories as to why Nagel does what he does, who he is, where he has come from and so forth. This is where lies the magic of the novel. Like the main character in 'The Castle' by Franz Kafka, or 'Crepuscule' by Roman Payne, the main character in Hamsun's novel has appeared in a community and all clues given to suggest his personality and origins only make the reader wonder more. It is a well known fact among Nobel Prize winning authors that readers fall in love with characters like him, those who escape definition."},{"Title":"The Mysteries","review":"\\"Mysteries\\" is the story of a bizarre man, John Nagel, who arrives at a little Norwegian town one summer's day. He decides to spend a couple of months there, apparently out of the blue, causing all sort of unexpected situations to the dull inhabitants of the village. Deep inside, he is a distressed, troublesome soul.

Hamsun continues his ground breaking explorations of man's mind and pschology. Admirers of 20th Century literature must read this work! Hamsun breaks down the traditions of fiction and creates something entirely new in their place. Worth the first ever stream of conscience pasages alone!"},{"Title":"The Mysteries","review":"Eight years later, I can still vividly recall the contradicting emotions that were brought on my as I read Mysteries for the first time. I had read &quot;Hunger&quot; already, and was quite stunned to find that this one was even more explicit. If anyone wonders why Hamsun is called the greatest novelist ever, then check this one out. His descriptions of the &quot;Typical&quot; norwegian is still valid in many ways. In fact, creating trustworthy characters is in my opinion one of Hamsun's greatest qualities."},{"Title":"The Mysteries","review":"A book that moved me to the precipice of despair from the very first page, read on a beautiful spring day in the town of Bath, and kept me there long after the last, until I realised that to fall off the edge meant not death or depression but the beginnings of self-awareness and the knowledge that you are not the only one faltering at the end of the pier.Johan Nagel, it's better I think, living in your world, inhabiting towns and streets shaped with every step, thus not real in a sense but with colours, visions, hopes and thoughts, infinitely more intense."},{"Title":"The Mysteries","review":"A timeless novel written by a craftsman. What strikes you and keeps you alive throughout the whole novel is the overwhelming sense of risk and unpredictability. ( I am reminded of Camus's Outsider). And this is Greek tragedy of course, the precursor of existentialism, in which fate, that inexplicable force, which can either lift us up to the Gods or bring us to our knees at a whim, plays its games. Hamsun has captured the human condition in its extreme and placed it under a microscope."},{"Title":"The Mysteries","review":"Knut Hamsun is the King. Do not hesitate to read anything by the man.

The novels of the clenched fist. Hunger and Pan (which was dedicated to the central character of Mysteries) are the other notable companions of the set. The novel has aged very well. Of course the new translation is like botox for a stylised book, but the content, the themes, are still contemporary. This is an engaging novel and will reward you for the time you give it. Reread it and it will open up further; there's a richness of symbolism and thought that is as deftly concealed to the casual glance as the motivations of the characters it presents to you. If you like the books, wander further and read On Muted Strings - Hamsun returns to the character in middle age to see how its doing. This book is a treasure, the writer a gift."},{"Title":"The Mysteries","review":"A long time Hamsun devotee, I regard Mysteries as his prime work.

Don't believe any b.s. about Knut father of Modern novel etc, he was a great, passionate, unruly jester of the &quot;real&quot; world and a druidic high-priest of the Spiritual one. This book is simply the best book about the myster! y of human love/passion/obsession EVER!!

Nagel arrives in town as an eccentric outsider. He does not reveal a complete and thorough past -- partly because he guiltily enjoys the shroud of mystery people pin on him -- partly because he can not come to grips with it himself. Here is a man able to intelligently articulate (whilst drunk, mind you) on the scope of man's most pressing questions of existence, but struggles repeatedly with his own conscious and interactions with people. The genius of the novel is found in that the way one reacts to Nagel invariably reveals something about you, the reader! Do you hold the wealthy intellect in contempt for not breaking free from the situations he creates? Or do you sympathize with this man and relate to his own pattern of self destruction? The answer does not come easy. There are arguments for both disgust and pity. And out of our own curious need to finalize our opinions, to decide what we really think, we read on and on unable to prevent ourselves from being shaped by this novel . &quot;Mysteries&quot; contains one of the most complex character studies in literature while being completely void of pretentious airs. Nagel has a great mind, but that's exactly the problem, he can't reason out the cynicism he holds for himself. One of Hamsun's underlying themes is an illustration of how the great thinkers of the world end up so tightly wrapped with pessimism that they are unable to function in society. He dispels any sense of romanticism that we commonly hold for the struggling artists, philosophers, and eccentrics of the world.Oh, and carefully read the lines pertaining to &quot;The Midget.&quot; The only place you might find a greater supporting cast member is in Shakespeare's canon."},{"Title":"The Mysteries","review":"This book was the #1 hugest influence on me as a teen. I can't say enough good things about it. It's prose poetry in motion. Hamsun wrote about what nowadays we'd call a manic-depressive or bipolar man who is living on the edge of a deep, mystical Norweigan nightmare where the nights never end. A choir of a thousand voices, violin cases, apothecary smells, lifesaving medals...Johan Nilsen Nagel is the most fully-realized character of all time. This is probably literature's first paranormal, too. The Midget is unforgettable as well."},{"Title":"The Mysteries","review":"He is one of the great writers of the twentieth century, though his best works were written before 1900. He is one of the most influential European novelists of the last hundred years, yet he is not well known in the United States. Winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature, the most important Norwegian author since Ibsen, he is often ignored in his own country. He is Knut Hamsun -- novelist of genius...Hamsun, in &quot;Mysteries, Pan, and Hunger&quot;, wrote three of the greatest novels of the late nineteenth century, novels which created a new literary style and which delineated a new literary hero: the alienated loner. His work was widely admired in the first half of the twentieth century, with writers as diverse as Thomas Mann, Hermann Hesse, and Henry Miller citing Hamsun's work as being of special importance and influence. Isaac Bashevis Singer, in his essay &quot;Knut Hamsun, Artist of Skepticism&quot; goes so far as to claim that &quot;the whole modern school of fiction in the twentieth century stems from Hamsun.&quot; Henry Miller said of &quot;Mysteries&quot; that it &quot;is closer to me than any other book I've read.&quot; The second of Hamsun's great early novels, and my personal second favorite...!"},{"Title":"The Mysteries","review":"Undeniably a book of mystery. The reader always gets a dual sense of distance with Hamsun. There is the proximity - at times alarming - between the narrator and the synaptic impulses of the main character's brain. Yet there is also this persistent sense of not being let into a secret, the key to the disturbing, possibly insane nature of the hero (if you can call the prominent figure in Mysteries that). What Hamsun, and I'm guessing now, was trying to let the world in on was a kind of proto-existential angst - Kafka before Kafka if you like. The hero lives in a constant tornado of emotional highs and lows at times appearing in control, at times not. And this is the unsatisfying, fascinating heart of Mysteries. I urge you to read it, but only after reading Hunger, which set high standardsnot only for Hamsun but for modernist writers for decades to come."},{"Title":"The Mysteries","review":"I honestly do not know exactly what to say about this novel, other than I am thankful I stumbled upon it.I just finished it several minutes ago and it was one of the most fascinating, thought provoking, and mesmorizing books I have ever read. The manic main character is easily one of my favorites found throughout all of fiction. His rambling, yet calculated monologues, never cease to amaze me in what direction they end up taking the reader and the audience in the book. His inner monologues are intense in their portrayel of a highly intelligent mind alternating between exuberance and utter despair. He can analyze and attack the main theories and thinkers of the day, yet in his own life he seems incapable of curbing his self destructive and impulsive actions. Frankly, I am in awe that anyone could write a novel like this without having gone over the edge from genius to madness and back again.I must admit many of the books \\"mysteries\\" remain very much unclear to me, though the ending (the last page) hit me like a smack in the face---I thought better of the particular character of whom much is revealed. I, after the novel sinks in a little bit, plan on rereading it and trying to decipher more out of it.Once again I am brought back to Hamsun....brilliant and ahead of his time."},{"Title":"The Mysteries","review":"This is a sketchy book to recommend. I've recommended it to friends who say it is among their favorites, others who say they don't get it, didn't like it. Arguably there is no plot to the story, yet something beckons you to keep turning the pages. For me it's the kind of book that I can open to any page and I'm into it. Hamsun has a tricky wit, his characters are quirky and unpredictable, and I guess that's the appeal -- you keep reading just to find out what the characters are capable of.What I think is amazing about this book is that it had no forerunner (or so they say). Hamsun just decided he was going to sit down and change the course of fiction, and he did it. Basically, he was tired of the predictable course of Victorian literature, the predictable style, predictable endings, and wanted to shake it up, and in the process efforts like Mysteries became the forerunner of the Modern age in literature. The string of modern novelists that count Hamsun as one of their prime influences is too long to list here, and Mysteries (along with Hunger) are the classic favorites.I don't know if this is my favorite novel of all time (it's close) but Johann Nilsson Nagel is my favorite character. I doubt you'll find a more tragically passionate character. And if you are a self-taught writer this is a tremendous book to learn from."},{"Title":"The Mysteries","review":"Mysteries is that rare breed of book which mesmerizes you and pulls you through its pages, transfixed, before you know what's happened to you. With Norway serving as the idyllic backdrop, we are suddenly living life through the eyes of the charming but insane Johan Nagel. Nagel lands as a stranger in a small coastal town and weaves the unwitting residents into the reckless schemes of his disturbed mind. As he does, he gives desperate vent to his frustrations, dreams, romantic yearnings, joys, rage, love, and compulsion to belong. Peopled by the midget Grogaard, the unattainable beauty Dagny Kielland, the disapproving magistrate's deputy Reinert, and the whimsical spinster Martha Gude, Knut Hamsun's narrative genius lies in the things he leaves unsaid at every stage of the story, and doing so especially brilliantly towards the book's end, where everything coalesces and resolves by subtle implication. Hamsun's artistic mastery is overwhelming and refreshing. I hope you enjoy the dazzling display of his talents as much as I did in this book."},{"Title":"The Mysteries","review":"It is one of the most beguiling and confusing novels ever written.It is not a novel for everyone, but for those of a certain mindset it clicks like a key in a lock, so for others, like as a 1890's christmas gift for Maman, maybe not.It is a complete experience of the disorienting type...ride the bull...see where he takes you.I like it."},{"Title":"The Mysteries","review":"An eccentric stranger comes to a small Norwegian town and proceeds to shock, bewilder, and beguile its bourgeoisie inhabitants with his bizarre behavior, feverish rants, and uncompromising self-revelations.Mysteries is, perhaps, Hamsun best novel--the fullest, most effective expression of his major preoccupation with social hypocrisy and personal honesty--a novel that illustrates, as do all Hamsun's to one extent or another, Schopenhauer's maxim that a man is only himself when alone. In Johannes Nagel, Hamsun has created a man divided against himself, as we all are, but so hyper-aware of his own inherent duplicity that his very existence is a kind of exquisite torture between opposites. He's dishonest even when he's being brutally honest, selfish even when he's selflessly giving, base even when acting nobly.Nagel is never free of his awareness of the psychological shadow that dogs everything he thinks and does, the reaction to every action, the no to every yes. No motive--and no man--is pure; and Nagel feels compelled to point out this fact constantly in his own dealings with everyone he meets.The things we do and think that we'd never tell a soul? Nagel blurts them right out. He has a kind of spiritual Tourette's syndrome. He pushes his worst side forward as if to dare us, as if to say, \\"love one side, love the other, they are both mine.\\"Naturally, the conventional, one-sided townsfolk, each of who keeps his or her own ugly shadow-twin carefully hidden from public view (and hidden even from themselves), don't know what to make of someone as ruthlessly self-critical as Nagel. After all, few people ever seriously consider whether \\"maybe it's me!\\"He's not in town long before he becomes hopelessly infatuated with the unavailable fianc&eacute;e of a naval officer away on duty. This woman has already been the rumored cause of one young man's recent suicide. Nagel, while scorning the young man's melodramatic self-demise, seems nevertheless to be rapidly heading in the same direction in spite of himself. Because for Hamsun, much of what we do is in spite of ourselves and even to spite ourselves. It's a theme Hamsun has also explored in two other great novels, Hunger and Pan.Mysteries is an unusual novel. It doesn't have a follow-the-dot plot. Nagel is given to wild flights of fancy, to telling stories, and recounting dreams that are symbolic and tangential to the main storyline and may not even be true. In the end one isn't sure what to make of Nagel--and that's to be expected. Nagel doesn't know what to make of himself--or anyone else. That is the \\"mystery\\" in Mysteries--the ultimate unknowability that each of us represents--to each other and to ourselves.Hamsun gives voice to both the dilemma and the despair of the insoluble puzzle of identity and does it in language that is surprisingly straightforward--and ephemerally subtle. It may be that few, if any, have done a better job at dissecting human character to lay bare the mystery at the core of our being than Hamsun--a mystery that eludes even the sharpest of scalpels. A vivisection that, like all, leave behind a corpse and more questions than answers."},{"Title":"The Mysteries","review":"This book is Hamsun's masterpiece. A stranger suddenly appears in a small town and performed a number of extraordinary things. His name is Jon Nilsen Nagel. He is hopelessly different from other people and is an eternal-living contradiction.

He seems to be able to read people's mind; he understands human beings' true nature more than anybody else. He is totally stranger to this earth and ultimately an outsider.

One minute he's one thing and then another like he's psychologically disturbed or something. Hamsun has some high regard in literary cirles and I like his simple writing style.

Unlike his other books, the treatment in this one can only be described as surrealistic. He moves between a number of themes - the story of Tantalus, the story of Oedipus, the sinking of the Titanic, an Albanian fable by which a young girl is married to a snake - whose relationship to the main story can perhaps be worked out by readers more sensitive than I am. And one never knows quite where one is, whether in a dream world or a real world, whether the central character is an artist or a deputy chief or police or both. The book also ends inconclusively: one's expectation that the fate of the characters will be resolved is not fulfilled.I take the main theme of the book to be the disappointment with what happened in Albania when the Communist dictatorship collapsed. The vacuum this left was in part filled by a revival of the Kanun, the ancient code, which the communists had suppressed, of unending bloody vendettas between families. Kadare has written about the Kanun before, in Broken April, where one of his characters showed a romantic fascination for its \\"noble savagery\\" (see my review of that book). Now there is no longer any half-acknowledged admiration: only despair that such barbarity wells up again from the remote past, even while the shadows of the communist past still hover over the society and the Council of Europe is an ineffectual occasional presence. The tyranny of communism has been ended; but this is a melancholic and often poetic image of a society that is uneasily adrift."},{"Title":"Spring Flowers, Spring Frost: A Novel","review":"After 40 years of Enver Hohxa's totalitarian rule the new democracy came in many fits and starts to Albania. Ismail Kadare explores the conflicts and contradictions left over from the old regime in a remote mountain town. People are still disappearing never to be heard from again. The secret police appears to remain in place and operating in the shadows. The blood feuds of the ancient rule book, the \\"Kanun\\", are rumoured to being revived. And the stories that the ominous secret state archives are hidden in vaults in the local area won't die. In this tense and confusing time, Mark Gurabardhi, a portrait artist, strives to live a \\"normal\\" life. With Spring Flowers, Spring Frost, Kadare has created an intriguing and engrossing story of realities and imaginations during a complicated period in his homeland. Kadare, who resides in France, was the inaugural recipient of the Booker International Prize and has only since then become better known in the English speaking world.In \\"Spring Flowers, Spring Frost\\", history and legends mix with the banal day-to-day events of the protagonist's life. Greek mythological characters, such as Tantalus and Oedipus, mix with historical figures such as Brezhnev. The iceberg that was rammed by the Titanic takes on consciousness and presents its perspective of the tragedy. In his nightmares, Mark is imagining himself in an alternative role of a secret police officer. Or does he actually lead a double life and these are not dreams? Mark's model and girlfriend has secrets of her own that make her aloof and possibly dangerous to Mark. Can he help at all? Meanwhile his friend Zef is still missing... Kadare succeeds in creating an atmosphere of insecurity and suspense. Facts and imaginings increasingly intermingle, thus creating new realities.Kadare's Albanian work was doubly translated: into French and from that into English. The excellent work by David Bellos makes the reader forget the language distance between the original and this version. Bellos captures the style and tone exquisitely and conveys the rich and poetic language that Kadare has employed. Bellos' account of his discussion with Kadare and reflection on indirect translations are an interesting complement which, unfortunately is not reproduced in the book itself. [Friederike Knabe]"},{"Title":"Spring Flowers, Spring Frost: A Novel","review":"SPRING FLOWERS, SPRING FROST is without doubt Ismail Kadare's most ambitiously experimental novel. On one level, it is the chronological tale of a modestly successful painter named Mark Gurabardhi who lives in the Albanian town of B__ at the close of the Twentieth Century. The former Communist regime has fallen, and the springtime of a new way of life has arrived. New ways and old traditions are competing for primacy in the peoples' lives. As these changes unfold around him, Mark maintains an off again, on again relationship with a young woman who also models for him, but his life is otherwise rather empty of meaning. He works in the kind of cultural institute typical of socialist/communist states, but he has no meaningful relationships with anyone there. His lone friend, the mysterious Zef, never appears in the book, represented instead by his apartment's constantly unlit window as seen from the street.On another level, however, Kadare presents a series of antic digressions that he labels Counter-Chapters. In one, a virginal young woman is married off by her family to a snake, although it turns out after the ceremony that the snake converts in the evenings into a handsome young husband who sheds his snakeskin for the marital bed. In another Counter-Chapter, the mythological Tantalus has stolen immortality from the gods, who hurriedly marshal their forces (including those of Death) to rein Tantalus in and ultimately punish him for the contrived and different offense of \\"voracity\\" based on an insatiable appetite. In yet another instance, Mark the painter becomes Mark the police investigator conducting an interrogation over a secret set of government files.Kadare alternates these realities and infuses all of them with Kafkaesque characteristics and a sardonic humor about life in a dictatorial, socialist state. On one level, the end of the latest regime (presumably that of Albania's Enver Hoxha) signals limited new freedoms and even an awakening to Western Europe. Yet, at a deeper and more threatening level (as can be seen in present-day China), the removal of a heavy-handed dictatorship and police state opens the door to incipient anarchy. New values and old ways rush in to fill the void. For Kadare's Albania, the void is filled by a form of blood lust in the form of an ancient tradition called the Kanun, based on something called the Book of the Blood. Under these ancient rules, there are blood debts to be paid or exacted by one family against another by murder, but each such paid debt automatically creates a new one in its place, in the opposite direction. Kadare's protagonist inadvertently gets caught in the middle of one such debt and struggles to find a way out.From its opening page image of two children uncovering a hibernating snake in wintertime, SPRING FLOWERS, SPRING FROST conveys an atmosphere of threat, of terrors and troubles lurking just beneath the surface of life. Kadare presents numerous references to caves, icebergs, tunnels, old chests hidden in closets, and coffins, suggesting that the most violent and anarchic of Albania's traditions lie forever dormant like hibernating snakes, waiting for the removal of authoritarian government in order to re-emerge. Yet even the most ancient and brutal of these practices must find a way to merge and meld with everything else forbidden under the former Communist Party rule, from unrestrained art to open political discussion.In much the same vein, the author conveys a strong sense of smoldering sexuality lying dormant: the story of the virgin married to the snake/man, references to Oedipus Rex, overtly Freudian references to bush-shrouded cave entrances, and even allusions to Beatrice, Dante's guide to Paradise in the Divine Comedy. In Kadare's world, all are intertwined and all are relative, subject as much to the power of tradition as to the inscrutable power of the State. Mark Gurabardhi is as powerless to control his fate as is Kafka's Joseph K. The atmosphere is one of helplessness and abandonment. Surveying a birdless sky of motionless clouds, Mark thinks, \\"Things must have looked more or less like that when...the gods deserted earth. A sky bereft of its masters, a sky in mourning, stretching to infinity. Who knows why the gods left? Where in the universe did they go? Mark didn't know why, but he felt like crying.\\"As always with Kadare, an original and unforgettable tale of life we can hardly imagine in a place we can hardly understand."},{"Title":"Spring Flowers, Spring Frost: A Novel","review":"What do the thief of immortality from Mt. Olympius, Oedipus, an Albanian folktale of a snake-bride, the fall of Communism in Albanian, the death of the director of an art institute, blood-law and love have in common? Very little unless in the hands of a novelist as skillful as Kadare.The very structure of the novel indicates a less-than-linear style. Chapter 1 is followed by Counter Chapter 1 etc. This structure permits Kadare to present a relatively simple and straight forward account of a love affair in the context of the post-Communist confusion of Albania. The protagonist, an artist assigned to the local town's art center, reminisces about the past - the \\"justice\\" and oppression. He explores his discomfort with the present. And, most importantly, he mulls over the universal questions raised about crime, death, punishment, freedom, oppression, ... in light of the material presented in the Counter Chapters. The Counter Chapters present the tales from mythology and folklore i.e. Tantulus, Oedipus, Snake-Bride.The whole coheres splendidly.

Focusing on an artist who inexplicably finds himself a police officer in his nightly dreams, this Kafkaesque novel is both funny and frightening, finding humor and humanity in what was a national struggle for the Albanian people.Mark is a painter, enjoying a relationship with a younger nude model, adjusting to the fact that one of his artist friends recently disappeared under shady circumstances. Mark encounters news stories of a young girl forced to marry a snake, hears rumors about the return of the mysterious Albanian Book of the Blood, and finds his dreams eerily corresponding to his reality. In trying to deal with this new reality, Mark and his fellow countrymen debate the cost of freedom and favorably harken back to certain aspects of Communist rule. Philosophical confusion reigns.\\"Spring Flowers Spring Frost\\" is a short yet powerful novel, effectively capturing and conveying the existential dilemma of living in a country uncomfortable with the responsibilities of freedom. A must read."},{"Title":"Spring Flowers, Spring Frost: A Novel","review":"Spring Flowers, Spring FrostThere are two tracks in Ismail Kadare's book, the world of politics and the world of domestic interpersonal relations. Kadare has always been great when there are political points to make because he can wrap them in myth and allegory so that they form a seamless and almost cinemagraphic vista unfolding before us. Myth is certainly present in this book in the form of an alluring fable of the woman who marries a snake. The second aspect of Kadare's work is the interpersonal story telling, the sketching of modern characters, and dialog between them. In Spring Flowers, Spring Frost this aspect never coalesces or comes together, and has many more unresolved fragments than we are used to seeing in an Ismail Kadare book.Not that there isn't huge comedy as the modern world intrudes into Albania in the form of a bank robbery, credit cards, and yes, the Internet. Kadare is a master at introducing technological progress to a society that has avoided technology; he did it to wonderful effect in The File On H which was set in the 1930's period of King Zog. Part of this book's disjointed nature is probably connected to the subject matter. Communism is over, the action of the book is set after 1992, the year Albanians voted the Communist Party out of office for the first time since 1945 and there is a natural anticlimax in the life and times of the country and in the art coming out of the country. With dictator Enver Hoxha dead, there is no longer a monster to go after. Kadare tries valiantly to resurrect the reader's interest by having Ramiz Alia, Hoxha's successor, travel in the middle of the night to a secret archive, and this works for a while as our interest is rekindled, but eventually the ploy becomes a dead end, so that Kadare resuscitates Hoxha himself, and has him meet with Leonid Brezhnev and East Germany's Walter Ulbricht, but by the time this happens it's a case of too little too late. Perhaps the main value of this effort lies in the threads Kadare establishes that he will develop later in a much more focused and intense book, The Successor."},{"Title":"Spring Flowers, Spring Frost: A Novel","review":"Not long ago, a Swedish member of the Nobel Prize committee relieved himself of the view that Americans wouldn't be winning the Nobel Prize because they were, well, too American. It's a no-doubt primitive country addicted to pop culture (gasp !) and not given often to publishing the works of those writers admired by the Nobel Prize committee members (like himself). I was glad to read this gentleman's comments because it cleared up a mystery for me. That is, I realized why Ismail Kadare has not won the said prize. He is too Albanian. I fear that does mean that he is in some way compromised; he was unable to avoid history and wound up swallowing a bit too much of the fetid tides of dictatorship for the purist, puerile standards of the (luckier) members of the committee. Every nation, not to say every person, has their own buried, secret archives. They exist in the way water exists on Mars. We know it was there and may still be there, but it's hidden and we are not in a position to do anything about it. We should judge literature and not the behavior of a particular individual stuck in an awful situation.Tyrants try to wipe out the past in order to become the only focus, the only light in the darkness which spreads from them. When tyrants fall, the buried past returns, seeps up to the surface in unanticipated ways. In the case of Albania, we are talking about the return of the ancient blood feud [see \\"Broken April\\", also by Kadare] and its harsh laws after the end of Enver Hoxha and the communist regime. Interspersed with passages of modern banality, of almost European \`normality\\"---sex, love, jobs, and visiting delegations---are hidden icebergs that bob to the surface of life's ocean. The end of Communism didn't mean the beginning of modern life untrammeled. The legend of a girl marrying a snake that was really a man--things are never what they seem, you don't know what lies just beyond in the forest of symbols. Looking for the secret archives of the ancien regime, papers that would reveal all, people dig up mountainsides. We all want to know why those 46 years happened. A totally modern director of the local art center, who has revelled in a trip to Spain, is killed in the inexplicable revival of an old, nearly forgotten family feud. Mark Gurabardhi tries to get down to the essentials of his times pp.145-46 \\"There was always something missing. And as soon as he tried to get it down on paper, he invariably left out some other trait....Obviously it was the hidden past that gave it all the value.\\" The past is there, a low rumble that suddenly splits the night and transforms the present.An amazingly insightful, clever novel that never lectures, never becomes didactic. As usual, Kadare operates on several levels. It's all up to you to unravel as much as you can. In the labyrinth of your soul, you may seize upon SFSF as another brilliant book from a great writer. Then again, if you don't like myth and mystery, you may yawn and scratch your head. That's what the Nobel committee seems to be doing."},{"Title":"Spring Flowers, Spring Frost: A Novel","review":"The old communist regime has fallen after 50 years of tyranny. A new, uncertain Albania is emerging that is mimicking the worst of the free world; bank robbery, fickle fashions, lust for money and delving into a submerged past for social order.Following the story of Mark,an arts director from the old communist regime and his angst of the brutal past and emerging brutal present.At first I found this book very esoteric. I could see how it related to Albania and Albanians, but I found little relevence for the wider world; a message for all mankind. (As say Solzenitzens works). It is also heavily laden with imagry which is a bit obvious in its aims.However, I read it in two sittings and by the end I was quite taken with its messages; man follows all sorts of ideals-most of them murderous-all of them just rehashes of old ideas save in a different order of appearence. Can crime only be prevented in the populace when the state is the biggest criminal of all? Most of what affects our lives is hidden and submerged. I found it quite impressive by the end.Not an easy to like book. I wish I had read some of his earlier work-perhaps the subtlety would have come accross as more sublime.Kadare does have something to say."},{"Title":"Spring Flowers, Spring Frost: A Novel","review":"In Spring Flowers, Spring Frost, the most famous Albanian writer Kadare had to borrow an ancient Albanian folk tale in which a girl marries a snake so he could metaphorically tell us what happens in Albania these days.A large number of Albanian girls are getting married to unknown Albanian men who live in Italy because there &quot;it's much better&quot; then in Albania but the thing is they don't have any idea that a great deal of them are getting married to forced prostitution once they reach the destination.Kadare also focused on other issues in present Albania.Again...very interesting views from the Albanian Kafka."},{"Title":"Spring Flowers, Spring Frost: A Novel","review":"Kadare sets out two stories, that slowly blur together. Not a traditional historical novel, this story helps explain the dichotomy between new ideas and old traditions in present day Albania."},{"Title":"A Time to Rend: An Essay on the Decision for American Independence","review":"A Time to Rend, by John Head, describes how the different American Colonies reacted to the events that led to the American Revolutionary War. In general terms, his thesis is that the New England, Middle, and Southern Colonies had different historical, cultural, religious, and financial backgrounds that significantly influenced their roles in the revolution. In many ways, Dr Head's book, published in 1968, anticipated David Hackett Fischer's Albion's Seed which I have also reviewed on Amazon.com.(1) The New England colonies were highly homogenous, populated almost entirely by Puritans from East Anglia. This cultural and religious uniformity led to a political uniformity that was reinforced by the moral certainty of Puritanism and produced the hotbed of the revolution. After presenting this overview of New England, Dr. Head provides a detailed chapter on John Adams as the leading revolutionary of his region.(2) The Middle colonies (NY, NJ, PA) were populated by numerous and diverse ethnic and religious groups, Germans, Dutch, Scots-Irish, English, Anglicans, Quakers, Calvinists, etc. This diversity led to a tradition of compromise markedly different from the unbending New England Yankees. The Middle colonies were the least revolutionary, seeking compromise within the Empire. John Dickinson of Pennsylvania, who favored reform and compromise within the British Empire, is presented as the representative of the Middle Colonies.(3) The Southern colonies were split between a rich, coastal, English, Anglican planter population and the western population which was largely poorer, Scots and Scots-Irish, Presbyterian farmers. The former felt financially threatened by the various British taxes and restrictions on trade whereas the latter did not have a sufficient financial stake to feel threatened. The Southern colonies were torn by internal strife between patriots and loyalists that typically corresponded to this coastal versus inland financial-cultural-ethnic- religious divide. In addition to this divide, there was a significant difference in the response of individual colonies, typified by Virginia and South Carolina. Virginia, represented in Dr. Head's book by Thomas Jefferson, was the second center of revolution after New England, providing much of the political and military leadership. South Carolina, represented by John Rutledge, might be best described as non-committal on the revolution. In Dr. Head's description, Rutledge is presented as seeking primarily to maintain his own position of political and financial power.A brief personal note: I was a student in Dr Head's class \\"The Early Years of the Republic\\" in the fall of 1968 at Colgate University. This year, 2011, I finally finished reading all the supplemental texts associated with that course."},{"Title":"Sacred Waters: A Pilgrimage up the Ganges River to the Source of Hindu Culture","review":"Stephen Alter's marvelous book is reminiscent of fine nineteenth century travel writing in which the writer, in lucid, and sometimes poetic, style brings the reader with him to see and experience things most people never would otherwise. His credentials are impeccable: the son of missionaries who was raised in northern India, fluent in Hindi and conversant in other Indian languages and possessed of an encyclopedic knowledge of the flora and fauna of the region. A non believer, he traces the steps of an ancient pilgrimage, feeling the spiritual attraction of the place while wryly commenting on the religious hypocrisy he encounters along the way. For all of its gifts it is the writing that commends this fine book. For the author's wise and seasoned view of the world and understatement of the rigors of his journey I would compare it to Bruce Chatwin's, In Patagonia."},{"Title":"Sacred Waters: A Pilgrimage up the Ganges River to the Source of Hindu Culture","review":"Surprisingly, there exist very few good books on the rich myths, and natural history of the hill districts of Garhwal and Kumaon. Till date probably the best known figure from the region is Jim Corbett of the \\"Man Eaters of Kumaon\\" fame.Stephen Alter's latest book titled, \\"Sacred Waters,\\" is a beautifully written narrative of his journey to the sources of River Ganga (or Ganges) in the Garhwal Himalayas. For the Hindus, the Ganga is a sacred river.Alter's book is a welcome addition to the few goods books that exist about this region. The book is a wonderful introduction to understanding the history of the region, and the central place the River Ganga occupies for many Indians.The book is an interesting mix of natural history, myths and Alter's own personal experience of River Ganga, whose source is hidden in the beautiful and rugged mountains of Garhwal, often called as \\"Dev Bhoomi,\\" - the land of the gods. Alter paints a fascinating picture of the changing moods and nature of the river as it bursts from the mountains and courses down to the dusty Gangetic plains, and into the ocean.Alter is a second generation Pahari-American, who was born and brought up in the hills of Uttaranchal. Pahari means someone from the mountain in Hindi."},{"Title":"England's Perfect Hero (Lessons in Love)","review":"This book captured me from the first page, probably because it was about \\"Bit\\". I wondered about him from her previous books so I was hooked. If ever a man was mysterious, it's this hero. What you learn about his experience will shock you.The book was romantic but also had a mystery element that kept me turning pages. The story beyond the romance was excellent. The mystery part of the story satisfied completely. There is no doubt that half way through the book we all knew who the culprit was, but then the excitement of how and when he would be found out was equally intriguing.I love the way Ms. Enoch develops her characters. I had no idea how Michael (Bit) could possible become the romantic hero in this tale, but she accomplished that and more, as well as an exciting plot twisting mystery.This book is also very different than your run-of-the-mill boy meets girl romance. While reading you will feel disgust, sadness, apathy, sympathy,anger and romance of course. This is a sweet, heart-throbbing romance. One that is so differently composed. Michael is not your average hero, and your heroine not a rich princess looking for a royal match. I'm so sad now that I've finished the book because I so looked forward to reading it each night. Now, I'll have to look for another and I feel sympathy for the next author I read because she or he will never measure up to this reading experience. Thank you, Suzanne.I really enjoyed this trilogy."},{"Title":"England's Perfect Hero (Lessons in Love)","review":"Enoch always delivers. The men are sexy, the women are smart & the story touches your heart while it sizzles."},{"Title":"England's Perfect Hero (Lessons in Love)","review":"I have read this one twice as well. It is by far my favorite book in the Lessons in Love series.Bit is a great character with some issues to overcome from the war. Lucinda is pursuing someone else and Robert is just being a friend and trying to come out of his shell. The story is great. I don't want to say too much more and give anything away, but it is definitely worth the time!"},{"Title":"England's Perfect Hero (Lessons in Love)","review":"This is my favorite book in this trilogy. I really loved seeing Robert slowly come out of his shell and start healing and living again. Lucinda was a perfect match for him (even though it took her a while to figure out what - or whom - she wanted). The love scenes were good (well, I could do without the one by the stable) and full of feeling. Their every kiss was explosive. I really liked their chemistry. Well, in the end the story with the stolen papers got a bit wild, but all in all, this was a really satisfying read."},{"Title":"England's Perfect Hero (Lessons in Love)","review":"This is one of Enoch's finest. This book is my favorite in the Lessons in Love series. The premise of the series is three friends creating a list of lessons to teach men(rakes) on how to appropriately treat ladies. The first two books wereThe Rake (Lessons in Love, Book 1)andLondon's Perfect Scoundrel (Lessons in Love, Book 2). Each book has been better than it's predecessor. Enoch has truly matured as a writer and with creativity with each novel. The steamiest book in the series was Book 2. This one is more emotional, but doesn't lack the romance or passion found in the other books in the series.So this is Lady Lucinda Barrett's story. Her friends Georgiana and Evie have already taught their 'lessons' to certain gentlemen and married them. Lucinda now needs to step it up and pick someone. Since her friends ended up falling in love with and marrying their initially unwilling and seriously rakish students, Lucinda feels she'd better start out with marriage as a goal. She picks Geoffrey, a war hero and an arrogant Adonis. One of her criteria is also that her father, a General, approve of and get along with her eventual husband. Geoffrey fits this bill nicely - war hero and shared stories and all.Just as she starts engaging Geoffrey, Lucinda gets drawn into a friendship with Robert, also a war veteran and her best friend's brother-in-law. Robert is a recluse to all but Lucinda, suffering from a trauma disorder and panic attacks due to torture he had to endure in the war. Because of his reclusive nature, he is also not considered an acceptable beau by her father. The story is about how Robert overcomes his disorders to gain her love and how Lucinda faces and handles a conflict on what her mind vs her heart is telling her. Their characters shine and I could easily figure out why both fell in love with each other (way better than the sort of love story where love is based on looks alone).I also loved that the main characters and their husbands from the first two books in the series feature prominently in this book. It makes for a wonderful, warm story where everyone feels like family and so you are rooting for the unlikely romance from the beginning.There is humor, passion, wonderful dialogue and quite a bit of excitement with the climax. You want to step into the book to help Robert or talk to Lucinda - that's how real the characters feel. Definitely read this one. :)"},{"Title":"England's Perfect Hero (Lessons in Love)","review":"What a wonderfully, delightful book! I just love it when an author breaks away from the pack and actually creates an original twist and this one is absolutely perfect!Robert Carroway came back from the Napoleonic war damaged and unable to function in society. No one knows that the reason stems from 7 months of extreme torture in a French prison, unbeknownst to anyone. His loving family are supportive but at wits end as to how to help bring him back to life. Enter Lucinda Barrett, his sister-in-law's best friend and the only person whose calm, peaceful personality draws him in.Oh, it is just sigh worthy! While Lucinda is looking to catch another man's eye, she is surprised, yet flattered that the recluse Robert actually choses her to be the one person he talks to, however little that is. As events unfold, one can't help but fall in love with both these characters, crying and applauding right along with each as they struggle and grow until love finally overcomes. It drags just a little in places and the steam seems a little clumsy in others but for a sheer, unique, heart-warming read this one is just delicious!"},{"Title":"England's Perfect Hero (Lessons in Love)","review":"Suzanne Enoch's England's Perfect Hero is just the book to read on a rainy day, or in front of a toasty fire or really any where you can settle in for a prolonged period of time.There is something to Enoch's quality of writing that simply draws you in to her world and makes you sympathize and love the characters you are reading about.This is a really well-paced romance book with many moments that have you smiling or feeling a little teary eyed.It comes across as real, not always, but for the most part. I enjoyed the slow blooming romance between the two lovers.The only thing that would have been better would be if Enoch had pushed her characters a little bit more, pushed the plot a little be further and sharpened it's edges.However it is good just as it is, though I would have given it 5/5 if it had been sharper.England's Perfect Hero is definitely in the read list and under the the must read it again and again category.For more book recommendations and reviews you should check out [...]"},{"Title":"England's Perfect Hero (Lessons in Love)","review":"England's Perfect Hero by Suzanne Enoch was the third book of the series. This story had more mystery and danger than the others. Three women decide to make a list of lessons that all men should learn to be good husbands.Lucinda decides that all her friends married the men from the 'lessons' so she picks a perfect man - but fate takes over. Robert Carroway is not her pick - he is a injured soldier who has lots of dark secrets. I loved this novel the characters are great. Check out all the series Lessons in Love: The Rake ,London's Perfect Scoundrel and England's Perfect Hero. If you enjoy this genre I would also check out The Lady Lies The Lady Killer and The Lady's Code by Samantha Saxon"},{"Title":"England's Perfect Hero (Lessons in Love)","review":"Robert \\"Bit\\" Carroway is a wounded soldier still suffering from being tortured by the French three years earlier. He's quiet and unsure of himself, often retreating to his room as soon as he feels panicked.He secretly watched Lucinda, the friend of his sister-in-law, for years. He slowly started to make himself known to her and a chance encounter caused him to strike a deal with her. If she helped him with his rose garden, something he suggested having to distract himself, then he would help her with in her lessons to 'train' Lord Geoffrey Newcombe and eventually wed him. He only did it so he could spend more time with her, never expecting he would actually fall in love with her.I must say that I rather liked Robert. His character was very unique from the typical bad arrogant attitudes that get very old very fast. A man can be a man without being so demanding and cocky. I was rooting for Robert and he quickly became one of my favorite heroes. Another unique aspect of this book, to me, was that Robert not only had a nice family (an increasing rarity) but a caring family. His brothers' concern for him touched me. I loved their relationship.I felt as if the twist towards the end of the book took away from the story between Robert and Luce. The reader already knew everything would work out and it just felt like wasted pages. It was mentioned many times that characters were worried that Robert would have to be locked up in prison that I started to expect that would happen. It may sound sadistic, but I was disappointed that it didn't happen. It would have been a touching moment. When everything eventually worked out and Robert is cleared there's only a few pages left of the book and the reader already knew what was going to happen.I think the reader also deserved to have known what exactly had happened to Robert while he was held captive. It was hinted and lightly touched on, with a few experiences thrown here and there, but there were no flashbacks or discussions about what *really* happened. I think the typical \\"let the reader decide\\" ploy is just an excuse for lazy writing.His obvious insecurity with himself was what appealed to me the most, especially when Luce tried to remove his shirt and his discomfort with his limp.All in all, the first half of the book is really good. The reader was exposed to an interesting character and was able to go through his ups and downs with him. The rest of the book is okay and predictable. I'm not really disappointed that I read it but I don't really have that satisfaction of finishing a really good book."},{"Title":"England's Perfect Hero (Lessons in Love)","review":"THIS WAS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE READ BY SUZANNE ENOCH. I LIKED HER CHARACTERS LUCILLE AND ROBERT. THEY WERE FUN AND ENTERTAINING. I THOUGHT THAT IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE LONGER. BUT OVERALL IT WAS A TERRIFIC BOOK AND VERY WELL READ."},{"Title":"England's Perfect Hero (Lessons in Love)","review":"A little more than a year ago, Lucinda Barrett and her two best friends, Georgianna Halley and Evie Ruddick, drew up lists on how they thought a true gentleman should behave. Georgiana and Evie then proceeded to select two offenders in order to instruct them on good behaviour. But both Georgiana and Evie ended up marrying their &quot;pupils&quot; (&quot;The Rake&quot; &amp; &quot;London's Perfect Scoundrel&quot;). Now it's Lucinda's turn. Knowing full well that these &quot;lessons&quot; in good behaviour may well result in her marrying her &quot;pupil,&quot; Lucinda has settled on Lord Geoffrey Newcombe. Like her friends' husbands, Geoffrey is a handsome and incredibly arrogant, and much in need of instruction; but more importantly, Geoffrey is a war hero, and exactly the sort of gentleman that her father, General Augustus Barrett, could countenance as a son-in-law. But just as Lucinda is about to start her campaign, Lucinda begins an unlikely friendship with Georgiana's brother-in-law, Robert. Like Geoffrey, Robert also served in the Peninsula Wars; but he's returned a wreck of a man, prone to panic attacks, and has become quite the recluse, shunning both Society and even his family. As Robert and Lucinda begin to spend more time together, Lucinda comes to the realisation that it is Robert and not Geoffrey that occupies her thoughts and heart. But what can she do? Settle on an uncomplicated and comfortable life with Geoffrey with her father's complete blessings, or risk everything for a complicated and brooding wreck like Robert?Slightly more complex and less humerous than the other two installments in the Lessons in Love trilogy, I liked &quot;England's Perfect Hero&quot; best. And that's because both the hero and heroine were likable and engaging, and because Suzanne Enoch didn't follow the pattern of the first two books and went in a completely different direction. Usually, with a series, books begin to sound like a formula after a while. But you couldn't say that about &quot;England's Perfect Hero.&quot; The &quot;Hero&quot; in the title doesn't even refer to the real hero of the novel! I also liked the fact that one of the obstacles to Lucinda's and Robert's happiness was Lucinda's concern that her future spouse and her father like each other and get along. Not very many romance novels ever address this issue realistically, and I thought that the authour hit just the right note here. The other thing I liked about this novel was that characters from the first two (Georgianna, Evie and their respective husbands) play an integral part in helping Lucinda and Robert achieve their happily ever-after ending. That also was a nice touch. So that even though there were a few howlingly funny editorial mistakes, and the whole theft subplot was incredibly weak, I still enjoyed this novel enough to award 4 stars."},{"Title":"England's Perfect Hero (Lessons in Love)","review":"I have eagerly awaited this last installment in the &quot;Lessons in Love&quot; series and was not disappointed in the least. Suzanne Enoch has given us a tale both endearing and sentimental. I found myself immersed in the character's lives and their emotions. I would highly recommend this book (the entire series, in fact) and this author to anyone who wishes to start reading this genre.Lucinda Barrett finds herself the only one of the three friends who has not taught her &quot;lesson&quot; and therefore, feels a bit the odd man out. She has chosen her pupil, a man she feels needs a lesson in being a gentleman, but is also aware that her friends have found themselves married to the object of their lessons. Lucinda is not averse to this arrangement and continues on with her plan. But, along comes Robert Carroway and he completely keeps Lucinda on her toes, causing her to reevaluate her true motives for teaching her lesson. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"England's Perfect Hero (Lessons in Love)","review":"I was truly enjoying this book as it began. I am always drawn more to character driven romances than those powered by a mystery or event. My problem with the book is that the plot changes mid-story. Robert is a tortured hero in the beginning, having debilitating panic attacks and unable to converse with his family. In a matter of a few weeks, though (the whole story took no more than a few weeks from start to finish) he's completely overcome these problems, fallen in love, and solved the mystery of who framed him. I'm afraid I just don't buy it. I wish Ms. Enoch had just focused on Robert and Lucinda's relationship and left the mystery for another story. It didn't meld well with this one. To add this element, she had to resolve Robert's problems much too quickly."},{"Title":"England's Perfect Hero (Lessons in Love)","review":"One reviewer called Robert a &quot;wimp.&quot; I couldn't disagree more with this statement. Anyone who's gone through torture and almost died well, I think if they started to have nightmares that's normal and as someone else says makes you human. Well I guess some women could see him as damaged or a wimp, and that's fine It's why he needed a special woman to pull him out of it. I didn't like Suzanne Enoch's novella in Lady Whistledown, but this book was very very good, and she has gone up in my estimation."},{"Title":"England's Perfect Hero (Lessons in Love)","review":"I loved this book! I have been eagerly awaiting Lucinda and Robert's story! I wish Suzanne would come out with a book every 6 months instead of once a year - it is hard waiting for them.If you are a fan of the Lesson's in Love series - you will be satisfied thoroughly with this book - since you get to revisit all the characters from the other books.I can only hope that her next book is about Bradshaw!"},{"Title":"England's Perfect Hero (Lessons in Love)","review":"Romances where the heroine cares for the hero when he falls ill simply cannot hold a candle to this. I started with this third book and was immediately captivated by all members of the Carroway family, as well as the way Lucinda's friends all come to their rescue.This is Robert's story, more so than Lucinda's, and the way he decides to get back to normal life deserves respect. Unlike some of the other reviewers I found Robert's recovery quite credible, as I choose to believe that he'd been working toward it over the years.This book didn't have as much of the charming dialog that you tend to get in Enoch's work, but Robert is quite reserved to begin with. Lucinda did pretty well on her own though.Some reviewers have complained that the trilogy is formulaic but I disagree. I've read 2 out of the 3 books now and while there's a hero and a heroine and they're in love at the end of it, that's the basic framework for any romance story."},{"Title":"England's Perfect Hero (Lessons in Love)","review":"This was the perfect hero and the perfect ending for Ms. Enoch's &quot;Lesson's In Love&quot; series. In this the last novel in the series we see Lucinda finally getting her chance to fall in love with a totally wonderful hero named Robert Carroway. Without going into a long synopsis suffice it to say this is a very moving story of a worn torn hero who finally gets a chance to heal in more ways then one with the woman that helps him live again.Ms. Enoch brings back all of her past hero's and heroine's as well as introducing us to a few new characters. This was such a fun series I'm sorry to see it end. Unlike many series that taper off as the stories are added, Ms. Enoch manages to keep the momentum going by giving us such wonderful and diverse characters as well as touching storylines that you can't help but be drawn to the book."},{"Title":"England's Perfect Hero (Lessons in Love)","review":"I adore Suzanne Enoch's work. Since reading my first Enoch book, BY LOVE UNDONE, several years ago I've been pretty much enchanted by Ms. Enoch's Regency romps. For me, even her less-than-best effort is still good.And ENGLAND'S PERFECT HERO, the last in Ms. Enoch's Lessons In Love trilogy, is definitely beyond good.Honestly, I didn't think I was going to like ENGLAND'S PERFECT HERO at first because it lacked Enoch's signature rakish hero. But, oh boy, was I ever wrong. This fast-paced story kept me enthralled from beginning to end. And I just adored this different hero.Ms. Enoch's hero for this piece is the emotionally wounded Robert, who has retreated into a dark world, harboring a secret that leaves him prone to anxiety attacks and more. The one bright light in Robert's dark existence is his sister-in-law's friend, Lucinda. And he admires her from afar until circumstances bring this pair together.Robert is the glue that holds this story together, but it is Lucinda, the heroine, who draws this hero from his dark and lonely shell. Lucinda has chosen a 'student' for her own lessons in love - just as her two best friends had done before her - and it isn't Robert. Oh, she is intrigued by Robert, dubbed the &quot;Mute&quot; by a callous society, but she also has matrimony on her mind - and the Mute isn't good husband material. But she does accept help from Robert for her lessons in love. And when important papers are stolen from the Horse Guard - and suspicion falls on Robert as a traitor - it is Lucinda who comes to his aid.Ms. Enoch's portrayal of Robert is well done ...and touching. This hero's emergence from his dark existence is thoughtful and insightful. ENGLAND'S PERFECT HERO isn't as lighthearted as most of Ms. Enoch's work, but it does have humorous moments ...and some humorous characters.I highly recommend ENGLAND'S PERFECT HERO. Ms. Enoch is quite a story teller and I just love her writing style.Debbie Jett, reviewerromancereaderatheart.com"},{"Title":"England's Perfect Hero (Lessons in Love)","review":"Of the \\"Lessons in Love\\" series, this was, by far, my favorite. Lucinda is a lovely heroine, intelligent, kind, witty and endearingly determined to have an uncomplicated, polite marriage.However, it was our hero that really made the book for me.

He was so withdrawn and so pathetic and so tortured that I wanted desparately to look into his future. And then came &quot;England's Perfect Hero&quot;. It is wonderful. Bit is a man driven beyond despair by the horrors of war and he finds the strength slowly to pull himself out of the depths of his nightmares.

I can't get over the fact that she told her father his secret, which by the way almost leads to his being convicted of high treason!

She's not an incompetent writer, but... this author just doesn't work wonders for me. It's strange, because it's all there - the writing is good enough, and her historical details/research; it's her characters and the plots of her books that just don't hold my interest. I can't escape a \\"been there/read that\\" feeling when I'm reading her work. And I always have a hard time finishing her books! This is the third one I've tried and I have to say, I'm giving her a a pass from now on.I also have to say I find her heroines somewhat childish or maybe the word is naive.

I thought that Robert was truly a wimp &amp; I didn't like his character at all. Lucinda wasn't much of a character either. I have to say that Suzanne is one of my favorite romance writers, if not the best. But this story really disappointed me... Usually she makes the hero alittle more dimensional than Robert was. I know he has his war wounds, but his angst was alittle overdone. Very brooding, short, stilted conversations. I like brooding heroes &amp; all, but this guy had nothing to reccomend him at all. He was really hard to like..Come on, it had been three years since he's been back. Living with his brother, what HAS he been doing these last 3 years. You think he would have dealt it somewhat.. Not what I expect out of her. I really wanted to like this book but I couldn't. Because I do love her books (&amp; I spent alot of money on her older out of print books from amazon) Anyone else feel that way? Was it just the mood I was in? Have I read too many really good books lately??? Maybe I was expecting toooo much..."},{"Title":"England's Perfect Hero (Lessons in Love)","review":"I'm not a huge fan. This book had it's good moments, but for some reason it just didn't flow."},{"Title":"England's Perfect Hero (Lessons in Love)","review":"I do have to say that I enjoyed the book and that it was a good end to the Lessons in Love series. I liked seeing all of the characters from the prior books in good harmony, well characterized.The reason I didn't give this book 5 stars is due to the fact that(now that I have read 4 of her books) they are very formulaic. The hero and heroine have two love scenes in each of her books. The first one is about half way to 3/4th of the way through the book, pretty steamy and well written. The second love scene is always a quickie toward the end of the book. The hero and heroine don't have direct conflict during the last half of the book and it due to an external conflict keeping them apart that needs to be addressed. Once the external conflict is taken care of, the main characters express their love and... the end. Well, we know that many authors have a pattern to writing, but SE's books are too predictable. As other readers have mentioned, she has all the right ingredients but variety to the main story line would help."},{"Title":"England's Perfect Hero (Lessons in Love)","review":"Funny, i've read this book tons of times, but have never written a review on it. First thing first i fell in love with Bit Carroway in \\"The Rake\\". I remember being ecstatic on finding out that he had his own book. I can safely say by the fact that i keep coming back and re-reading it that its one of my absolute favorite books of all time. Being that fact it is a bit hard for me to write a review on it.The book reads the best when you read the whole \\"Lessons in Love\\" series in order. In a way the whole series has been a character development for Bit and Lucinda. You can see each of them growing in each book. This can be said of all the characters in trilogy, but especially true of these two.Lucinda is the last of the trio to enact her lessons. She has no particular scoundrel in mind so she decides to find a man that she'll like to marry. After all, Evie and Georgie ended up marring their students. She chooses Mr. Geoffrey Newcombe. Handsome, the 4th son of a duke, and a war hero to boot. Simply perfect and safe. If not cheating a bit in terms of her lessons. Things would have gone smoothly if she hadn't stumbled upon Georgie's brother in law who had to ask about the lessons. Who \\"also\\" had to have those haunting blue eyes.Bit has been quite the recluse the last three years. Think tortured and hurt hero and here's you man. (He's also mine if he ever decides to make himself solid and comes out of the book). He suffers from what is now known as Post dramatic stress syndrome and finds himself in a black panic whenever he gets out of his comfort zone. Yet he finds himself drawn to Lucinda. She's his ray of sunshine in his black world. Something that he can even admit to himself sounds stupid, but is true. Overhearing Lucinda talking with Evie and Georgie he can't help but be intrigued. When Lucinda brings him some roses to start a garden he offers to help Lucinda catch her suitor as a trade off. Anything to spend time with her.The relationship between Bit and Lucinda is very heart warming. You can just tell from almost the get go that they're perfect for each other. They start off as amiable friends and work their way into love before either of them realize it. A perfect example of how love and bloom from friendship and not love/lust at first sight.This is a brilliant book and one I HIGHLY recommend.Final rating: 5 golden stars. Perfect in every way."},{"Title":"England's Perfect Hero (Lessons in Love)","review":"What made the book memorable for me was the character of its absolutely endearing hero, Robert, and how the author portrayed his total fascination with the heroine.

Robert is a quiet, tortured hero, and Lucinda is a determined, modern woman who brings light back into his life. This novel was very serious, but there were several moments of lightheartedness. I thorougly enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"England's Perfect Hero (Lessons in Love)","review":"The story was really compelling for the first half. Robert's PTSD seemed very real, and the friendship he develops with Lucinda is sweet and enjoyable to read about, and it's very believable that they would fall in love. However, as other reviewers have noted, the book shifts gears in the second half. Robert's issues seem to be more or less forgotten as the hero and heroine are caught up in all sorts of intrigue. Perhaps it is a pet peeve of mine, but I really find most romance authors' attempts at government intrigue to be unbelievable and unnecessary (there are of course exceptions). I'd prefer the story to focus on the relationship, which had been developing so perfectly before that. There could still be plenty of opportunity for conflict - but do lives have to be endangered at the expense of character development and consistency? Enoch was doing so well up until the intrigue started. That said, I'd still be interested in reading more of her work, as I liked the main characters and the friendships and history that were obvious even with the secondary characters."},{"Title":"England's Perfect Hero (Lessons in Love)","review":"I don't think the author had a handle on this story - it was not developed well. I would have liked to have seen Lucinda choose Robert as her 'student' when perhaps he was already attempting to reenter society on his own - and meanwhile being distracted by Geoffrey. As it was, I had no idea why Robert was more or less obsessed with Lucincda to begin with - their romance was told, not felt - somewhat I felt it at the end. Lucinda was never visceral to me, Robert was only a bit more so.Most of the story Robert is with his family, Lucinda is with her family or friends or Robert's rival, Geoffrey. Argh!I was drawn in by the so-called secondary storyline (it was front and center instead of romance) - but, then I wanted more groveling from the General and redemption publicly in the eyes of society - that did not happen. And no epilogue. The story ended abruptly.I wish I was reading what most everyone else did. I love to love romance novels. I'm still shocked at how poorly executed I found this promising story to be."},{"Title":"England's Perfect Hero (Lessons in Love)","review":"Absolutely wonderful. But then again I would be surprised if it had been anything but. These characters are great. What a wonderful finish to this series! Great read"},{"Title":"England's Perfect Hero (Lessons in Love)","review":"That's exactly what this book is about, real love! Not only is it incredibly well-written, but it is very moving, Suzanne Enoch draws you into to the story, the characters, their pains and joys in a way few authors do.The story is my favorite of the \\"Lessons in Love\\" trilogy. Robert \\"Bit\\" Carroway, is a wounded, aching ex-soldier, who has been struggling with his return to civilian life for several years. When his older brother marries, his new sister-in-law's friends visit her at the Carroway home. There he meets Lucinda Barrett and she becomes his saving grace, his means for healing and becoming whole again. When a traitor and thief steal important military papers and accuse Robert of the theft and treason, Lucinda, Robert, the Carroway clan join forces to clear Robert's name. In the process, Robert falls in love with Lucinda, although she has her heart set on another. Robert loves her madly, but knowing his condition adn that he is not completely healed from his military experiencs, he is willing to be content with just knowing \\"that one day she could possibly love him a little.\\"The story is quick, light-hearted in many parts, and a delightful read. One of the many reasons I love this book is because Enoch develops Robert's character so well, she puts you into his mind, and you feel his pain, his heartache, his joy, and you experience his steps toward healing. Lucinda is a delightful heroine, although you do get stressed at times with the fact that she refuses to acknolwedge that Robert means more to her than her \\"chosen student\\".Through everything though, love conquers all and in the end all is made well. Robert Carroway is a perfect hero and this is a delightful ending to a very good trilogy. I only wish Encoh would consider writing another novel which cameos Lucinda and Robert - it would be great to see where they are now. Either way, I highly recommend this novel it is one which I bought some time ago and continue to revisit time and again. It is a definte keeper!!"},{"Title":"England's Perfect Hero (Lessons in Love)","review":"Lucinda Barrett, Georgiana Haley, and Evie Ruddick are tired of the misbehavior of the aristocratic males with money. Each one agrees to select a lord as an object of lessons on proper deportment towards ladies. Shockingly Georgiana (see THE RAKE) and Evie (see LONDON'S PERFECT SCOUNDREL) have married their \\"students\\". Now it is Lucinda's turn to tutor her target.Lucinda thinks Geoffrey Newcombe would be perfect not so much because he needs instruction, but because she believes he would make a perfect spouse for her. As she makes her play, Lucinda thinks a lot about Navy Lieutenant Robert Carroway. She finds herself falling in love with Georgiana's brother-in-law instead of the object she selected. However, Robert suffers from some form of post battle syndrome and cannot compete for the affections of Lucinda with the dashing Geoffrey.The third and final novel in Suzanne Enoch's delightful \\"Lessons in Love\\" trilogy is a fun tale starring an intrepid heroine, a \\"perfect\\" object, and a brooding hero with mental war injuries. The story line moves quickly forward as Robert wants Lucinda, but feels his injuries from the Napoleonic War makes him unsuitable for the woman he loves. Lucinda on the other hand believes that the perfect paragon Geoffrey is her ideal though her dreams keep telling her to follow her heart not her brain. Though a final character twist seems unnecessary except to expedite the decision process, fans will appreciate this wonderful ending to a fine Regency series.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"England's Perfect Hero (Lessons in Love)","review":"Ex-soldier, Robert Carroway, is suffering from war-related post trauma. This tortured man was a victim of unthinkable abuse and degradation by Napoleon's troops. After months in a French hell-hole, Robert returned to England; his body broken and his mind tormented. Long, lonely days of healing, and Robert comes to rely on the vibrant Lucinda Barrett to give him his brightest moments. By far, Robert Carroway is the most riveting character in Suzanne Enoch's \\"England's Perfect Hero.\\"Lucinda Barrett, is a misplaced modern-day girl, and she appears courtesy of Suzanne Enoch's \\"Lessons in Love series.\\" A sequence of books involving three close friends; each friend controlling a personal list. Itemized lists drawn up to teach rude gentlemen the fine art of courting. Lucinda has her list and now she has her selected pupil. However, Lucinda runs into an unexpected problem with her tutoring scheme - Robert Carroway surfaces.As a heroine, Lucinda is very likeable; nonetheless, she commits a romance book faux pas - she betrays Robert's confidence. However, it is the romance and the storyline which suggest a bigger blunder. This love match is wanting. The very idea that Robert is pleased to the first man to reach Lucinda's bed - a triumph over his chief rival so to speak - is - well, need I write more? England, in the early 1800s, kingdom of the \`honor duel' - this hero should be pleased to remove his rival's head.And what is with all the freedom given to these women? Georgie for example, this darling lady, Robert's sister-in-law and Lucinda's dear friend, is in the final days of her pregnancy. Yet, she gads about London, extensively? This story is set in Regency England, set with stringent attitudes and unyielding opinions. But in spite of, her advanced stage of pregnancy, this woman still attends many social festivities. She is a key player in a smuggling operation and eventually Lady Dare is part of the female trio assigned to hunt down the backstabbing villain! Incredible, England's own answer to Charlie's Angels! The very pregnant Viscountess Dare does all this terrific activity without raising a single social eyebrow or apprehension from anyone -- including her husband.The summary: This is a romance that floats - it doesn't swim and it doesn't drown - it floats. Yet, the question remains did I think the author was successful? Well, I do want to read the two parent books; so yes, I suppose it was worthwhile. I only wished there was more believability.Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada."},{"Title":"England's Perfect Hero (Lessons in Love)","review":"I loved this book. Not only do we get to revisit some old friends from previous books, but Robert Carroway is a unique and utterly wonderful hero. Gorgeous but tortured, he is believable and sympathetic; Lucinda draws him out of the shell he has become through simple acceptance and then love. Lucinda's &quot;lesson in love&quot; winds up being more a lesson for her than for her intended student; Robert learns a few things, too, thanks to implementing her list.This story is warm, witty, touching, and divinely romantic. These two lovers are perfect for each other and splendid characters in their own right. One of the best in Enoch's series featuring this set of characters (the With This Ring &amp; Lessons in Love series). While it would be nice to read them in order (as I did not) to fully grasp the interconnections, it's not essential. What is essential, is to include this title in your reading."},{"Title":"England's Perfect Hero (Lessons in Love)","review":"A year or so has passed since the ladies have written down their \\"lesson plans\\" and both Georgiana and Evelyn have fallen in love and married their \\"students\\". Lucinda Barrett has watched from the sidelines with some envy, and so when it came her turn, she chose someone she wanted to marry, someone who would give her a simple, amicable life and who would also be in good terms with her father (a war hero), someone who was so gorgeous he turned young women's heads--the Duke of Fenley's 4th son, Geoffrey Newcombe.But then, there was Robert Carroway, the younger brother of Georgiana's husband, who'd been wounded in the war and who was so traumatized by his experiences that he shunned all contact with Society, because noise and crowds bother him. Yet, he was drawn to Lucinda, for her peace and serenity, and he decided if he wanted to become \\"normal\\" again, he needed help. So, he made a trade with her, and in exchange, he would help her snare her desired husband.Robert Carroway is definitely not your typical historical romance hero. His scars and wounds go deeper than a past betrayal at love or a rakish reputation, and they are not the type to be easily solved with the magic of true love. Yet, love does help, for thoughts of Lucinda enable him to go through some of his worst times. I love how he overcame his own trauma in order to help Lucinda with her lessons. I think the scene wherein he danced with the other ladies at the ball is one of the nicest and heartwrenching scenes in the book. It would be so so so easy to fall in love with such a guy.He also has his own lessons to learn, and one of these is to ask for help from family and friends, people who are concerned about him. I love the supporting cast that Ms. Enoch brings into this book, Georgiana and Tristan, Evelyn and Saint and the entire Carroway clan, especially Edward. I originally didn't like Bradshaw for the comment he made to Robert at the start of the book, though he was merely trying to help, but he more than redeemed himself later on in the story. I like how Ms. Enoch portrayed the dynamics of the Carroway family--realistic and heartwarming.I like how he and Lucinda were friends first, and I like seeing how their friendship developed into something more, especially for Lucinda, who hadn't really set her sights on him. I like how Lucinda is a dutiful daughter, and most especially, I like how she sees Robert for what he is--a man tormented by his experiences of the war, yet a man nonetheless.Lucinda was torn with her feelings for Robert and what she envisioned she wanted in her life, which includes providing her father with a son-in-law he could get along with. Yet, it is no secret that there was bad blood between Robert and her father. Despite Society's insinuations about Robert and even her father's admonition to stay away from him, I like how Lucinda never wavered in her estimation of Robert and how she was strong enough to stand with him at a time when most people wouldn't have.Suzanne Enoch has truly penned a gem in this story that is both heartwrenching and romantic and that celebrates the power of love"},{"Title":"England's Perfect Hero (Lessons in Love)","review":"I can honestly say I enjoy Suzanne Enoch books, they are fun to read and entertaining, the heroes are usually very likeable and the stories are engaging, but in most of them there is always something lacking. In some it is a weak heroine, in others an unreasonable one, in this book, what was lacking was the ending.The book ended abruptly and left many issues unresolved, like for example, where were they going to live, whether Robert is going to do something productive with his life or if he ever got completely cured of his trauma. The book needed at least another chapter and an epilogue, specially because it is the last in the series.I have liked Robert a lot since he appeared in the first book of this series, and was hopping he would get a book of his own. In this book, he didn't exactly dissapoint me (I love a brooding, troubled hero), but I would have liked that he had acomplished something more than just being able to act almost like a norman person.All in all, I kind of liked the series, but it wasn't great. I'm still not very convinced about Suzanne Enoch's writting."},{"Title":"England's Perfect Hero (Lessons in Love)","review":"I first stumbled upon the Carroways (and Enoch) with 'The Rake' and I was really struck by Robert as a character. As soon as I finished that book, I went looking through her other books to see if there was one about Robert. I thought he was a wonderful character, one very different to the typical regency hero, I thought that he had an incredible amount of depth. As one other reviewer said, this was definitely Robert's story.I pretty much cried the whole way through. The way that Enoch portrayed Robert mentally abusing himself as he struggled to put whole sentences together really struck a chord with me. I also loved the way that when Robert saw Lucinda wearing a yellow gown, he would say she looked like sunshine, or when he saw her wearing a green gown, he would say she looked like spring.It was a story that I really enjoyed reading, and I would definitely recommend it to people."},{"Title":"England's Perfect Hero (Lessons in Love)","review":"Ms. Enoch never disappoints. Whether writing stories about the present day or the past, this author has a flair for dialog and creates believable interesting characters. Also in her favor--she can write--unlike most romance authors. If you are a thinking woman with a college education who still enjoys the occasional fairy tale, and knows that most literary fiction is just a romance or mystery with pretensions, look no farther."},{"Title":"England's Perfect Hero (Lessons in Love)","review":"This is the first I've read by this author and definately not the last. This is also the last book in the \\"lessons of love\\" trilogy but I throughly enjoyed it without having read the other two first. The hero, Robert Carroway, steals the show in this powerful tale of loss and love. Lucinda is portrayed as just the right mix of serenity and fun loving to shake Roberts's tortured life up and make him realize his life is worth living and not hidden away from society.This author is very good about introducing and portaying many fun and interesting secondary characters. I also thought the idea of introducing what was either panic attacks, post tramatic stress disorder, or both into a historical a brilliant idea. The love scenes are slightly sensual-nothing too racy to offend readers of straight romance. A tender albeit a bit melancholy regency romance-4.5 stars!"},{"Title":"England's Perfect Hero (Lessons in Love)","review":"I love Suzanne Enoch's books - they're always entertaining and often laught-out-loud funny. But this one was different.It wasn't good.

I believed his reaction to the horrors of the war - and I felt it in no way impacted his manliness.In fact it made him human. And dynamic.This is one of the few romances I've read lately that I didn't feel the need to skip through.

The beginning of the book was great, I loved the Mid-Eastern setting and Egyptian history mixed with the romance and touching details of family's everyday life. But towards the middle it felt too much like the cheap paperback love-novel with cookie-cutter characters: 100% evil uncle, 100% mysterious and adventurous hunk who appears and disappears, a girl who earns 6-figure with hardly any efforts but cannot find a man to date....*yawn*. Characters got so shallow and black-and-white I was struggling to get to the end of the book.The reason I am giving it 3 stars and not 1 is because first of all the beginning of the book is great, plus there is interesting Egyptian historical background to the story. My advice - don't waste your money and rent this book from the library. If you want to buy a great book that is nicely written, has awesome plot twists and Mid-Eastern setting, then buy \\"Mosaic\\" by Soheir Khashoggi instead"},{"Title":"Nadia's Song","review":"This story takes place in Egypt during the decades of World War II. It is centered around Karima, who in the beginning of the story has died. Her long lost daughter Gaby who got to meet her mother before she died is attending the funeral that day. After this point, the story rolls back in time when Karima was young, and a talented vocalist with much potential.Karima Ismail, growing up a child of wealthy parents, has fallen head over heels with Charles, the son of their servants. Though their love was forbidden, they carried on behind their parents back, and Karima becomes pregnant. Charles dies in a terrible car accident, before he even realizes that Karima is carrying his child. Karima cannot tell her father this, as she is filled with shame. When her wicked brother Omar finds out, there is hell to pay for Karima, as he despises her. Once Omar discovers this, then he fixes Karima up with a husband so and moves her oaway from their lives so as not to disgrace the family. Shortly after Karima marries Munir, Nadia is born and is the bright spot in Karima's life, along with Munir who loves her as his own.When Nadia was 2, a horrible fire breaks out in Cairo, and everyone in the building has to run for their lives. Nadia ran off by herself, and stayed on a pile of rubble before being discovered by Tarik and Celine. They mean to rescue the child, and they do. But they don't bother to return her-and instead they want a child so badly of their own, that they adopt Nadia, and she becomes officially their daughter. She is named Gabrille, and is never told what really happened with her.In the meantime, Karima is heartbroken. She is lost without her little daughter like any mother would be; yet she manages to continue on in fame and fortune with her vocal career. She wll not find Nadia for years to come until Nadia uncovers the truth, and by that time Nadia has almost grown up, losing her other mother, Celine, to cancer. After her death, Tarik tells her the truth, and it is at that point that Nadia seeks out her birthplace and finds Karima.The two become good friends and travel back and forth to visit each other often. Tragedy comes into the story when Omar sets up someone to kill his sister. But he doesn't get by with it when Nadia, the perceptive person that she is, uncovers the details as to what really happened in her mother's death."},{"Title":"Nadia's Song","review":"I thought the book was a fun, quick read.

It is a highly readable piece of historical fiction. My husband was born and raised in Egypt and I have heard many of his stories about Sadat, Nasser and Um Kalthoum, and it was great to read about them in this book. The story is well constructed and the historical context it is set in is very convincing. I think Ms Khashoggi wrote her characters well, but I did not like the ending very much. The kidnapping storyline was very rushed, contrived and unsatisfying. Minor quibble, though, as all that came before that was great. Highly recommended, I loved it."},{"Title":"Nadia's Song","review":"I enjoyed this book very much, and I will be sharing the book with a couple of friends.There were times I became a little confused when timelines were jumped.

I think that one's opinion on this book would depend on how it's looked at. To me, the story of the main characters was almost secondary to the political conflicts of Egypt, but I felt they tied in to each other nicely. I had to refer back to earlier sections of the book to remember who some background characters were, but it definitely kept my interest. People have to remember that since it spans several generations, that not everything is going to be perfectly described. The uncle being 100% evil...depends on the perspective. He was certainly not honest, but he is a believable character. The influences that shaped him were definitely shown, so you could understand why he was the way he was. There is a possibility for some sympathy-he was a product of the times. At any rate, I thought this book was well worth my money, and will most likely end up reading the author's other books."},{"Title":"Nadia's Song","review":"I agree with the other reviewer who found this book disappointing because of the poorly developed characters. I am about 3/4 of the way through the book, and am finding it hard to finish; not because it is a difficult read, but because every plot twist (and most of the dialogue) makes me want to roll my eyes. One improbable tragedy is often necessary to create interesting fiction. Ten of them is just... improbable. The characters are either 100% good, or 100% bad. Sometimes the bad ones have a moment of realization and turn good, but there is really not much in the way of multi-faceted characterizations, and even these moments of catharsis lack a realistic feel.However, the parts about Egypt, its culture and history have a ring of authenticity about them.The descriptions of the feasts, for example, are not overdone, and yet enough to make you crave a style of food you've never had. The descriptions of the music are enough to make you want to hear it, and after reading this book, you'll look a little differently at a map of North Africa when planning your next foreign vacation.I haven't read \\"Mosaic\\", but perhaps I'll have to check it out."},{"Title":"Crickwing","review":"I found this book to be one of the best children books i've read.

His eventual acension to savior of the ant colony (from Army ants) resolves the conflict (both internal and external) in a way sure to delight and comfort your child.CRICKWING, although not the best book (by Ms. Cannon, or otherwise), is sure to delight fans of STELLALUNA or roaches (see the movie Joe's Apartment)."},{"Title":"Crickwing","review":"I love the way Janell Cannon takes an animal which may be frightening to children--a snake, bat, cockroach, crow, or mystery animal--and makes it friendly.

I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Crickwing","review":"Children's literature lovers have long loved Stellaluna. Many elementary school teachers use it when they study bats at Halloween. But how unlikely is it to find that not only bats, and then a snake (Verdi), but now a cockroach is a children's book hero? One could not dislike Crickwing. He is handicapped by a broken and painful wing injury, and thus goes his way alone. He entertains himself by making sculptures of his food. After several difficult experiences with predators, Crickwing becomes perverse enough to torment the industrious ants he observes around him. Although their queen has the ants gang up on him, they prove to be his salvation, first by stretching out and repositioning his damaged wing, and then by becoming his friends. Crickwing is a true hero when he sculptures an anteater to scare away the army ants from his new friends, the ants. The iluustrations are lovely as ever. Don't miss this one."},{"Title":"Crickwing","review":"Poor Crickwing, teased and belittled by the other cockroaches because of his broken, crooked wing, leads a lonely, solitary existence creating food sculptures out of leaves, roots and petals and then eating them. Unfortunately, he's a target for larger cockroach eating creatures, like monkeys and lizards who steal his food and leave him hungry, frightened and shaking. One morning Crickwing sees tiny leafcutter ants hard at work and in his frustration begins to bully and torment them. After a few mishaps, the ants band together, swarm and carry him off to their queen to be punished. She decides to give him to the army ants as the annual peace offering. But on the way to the army ant camp, the leafcutters have a change of heart. Nobody, not even a cockroach bully deserves this fate and they let him go. Because of their kindness, Crickwing has an attack of conscience and decides to help save them from the army ant's wrath. He devises an ingenious plan and with the leafcutter's help sends those horrible, mean army ants packing, forever...... It's hard to believe that a cockroach can be lovable and sympathetic, but award winning author and illustrator, Janell Cannon has done the impossible. Her gentle, sensitive text, with its themes of brotherhood and compassion, is only outdone by her vivid, larger than life artwork and youngsters will be fascinated by the detail in the insect drawings. Notes and fun facts about ants and cockroaches are included at the end of the story and can easily be used to expand insect lessons and discussions. For everyone who loved Stellaluna and Verdi, Crickwing is a wonderful addition to the series and a story kids 4-8 will want to read again and again."},{"Title":"Crickwing","review":"Crickwing is a cockroach who is grumpy because a toad have him a crooked wing and it aches. Crickwing likes to play with his food before eating it, but several nights in a row, his meal is stolen from him by large critters like lizards or monkeys before he gets a chance to dig in. Crickwing vents his frustration by torturing leaf cutter ants, but he gets in deep trouble, finding himself elected by the leaf cutter ants as the peace offering for the army ants. The story has a number of points that some kids, especially young ones, may find rather scary. But other kids may enjoy the tension. At the end of the story are some feature articles that provide more factual information about cockroaches and ants. The book has about 1600 words."},{"Title":"Crickwing","review":"The story is about a cockroach that has a crocked wing and is always being picked on. To keep his mind off his problems he always makes beautiful art work out of his food. He decides to pick on things smaller than him after a bit. He picks on the ants. When the ants are in trouble he decides to help them out in a neat way!What did you like or not like about the book?The books main character is a cockroach. I really don't like roaches at all but the book portrays this roach as lovable and sympathetic.The book is marvelous. It is extremely readable for young (3 - 6) year olds, and the artwork is beautiful, with vivid colors and expressive characters. Best of all, the story line is appropriate, with a message that is easily understood."},{"Title":"Crickwing","review":"Crickwing is a very artistic beetle. Everyone calls him that because his wing got twisted in a fight with a frog. If you get mad easily, Crickwing knows how you feel.When the army ants attack, Crickwing uses his artistic talent to scare them away. If you like bugs, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Crickwing","review":"This is a wonderfully told story concerning being a bully. The art work is absolutely the best and is quite eye catching. I have found this book quite useful is talking to children about being a bully and being bullied. The author is qutie on the mark, and while showing a dry humor, certainly gets the seriousness of the situation across in a very good lesson. The detailed illustrations would all be able to stand a lone a works of art. I could recommend this one for primary school counsellors and parents who may have a child with this particular problem. Recommend this one highly."},{"Title":"Crickwing","review":"This book is WONDERFUL. I hate cockroaches, as do many, however this book's lovable main character is one. It is another fabulous storyline by Cannon that follows in Stellaluna, and Verdi's footsteps. ***** A must have!"},{"Title":"Crickwing","review":"This is an excellent book for teaching and explaining bullying to small kids. The illustrations are beautiful. The only thing I don't like is that CrickWing is cockroach; I'd assumed he was a cricket."},{"Title":"The Road from Damascus: The Impact of Paul's Conversion on His Life, Thought, and Ministry (McMaster New Testament Studies)","review":"The conversion of Paul on the road to Damascus has captured the imagination of many artists and writers down through the centuries. Indeed, the idea of a \`Damascus road experience' has become part of the English language. However, it has also been the source of much scholarly debate and critique from an historical, sociological or psychological perspective (witness Krister Stendahl's 1963 essay \`The Apostle Paul and the Introspective Conscience of the West'). This book is designed to examine the biblical material and ascertain the impact his experience might have had on Paul's understanding of Christology, Eschatology, his Gentile Mission, Justification, Reconciliation, Covenant Theology, the Mosaic Law, the Holy Spirit, Women and Ethics. On the whole the authors do a good job (although I cannot agree with Donaldson's views of Paul's Gentile Mission, which work so hard to avoid the idea that Paul was given the mission by Christ at conversion that he misses the mark altogether). The material is well thought through and, despite some of the technical sounding titles, the language is clear and understandable. Seyoon Kim on Reconciliation and Gordon Fee on the Holy Spirit were particularly thought provoking. This book is well worth a read by pastors, theological students or educated lay people who want to think about the impact that the scriptural record of Paul's conversion has had upon their understanding of the Christian faith."},{"Title":"The Complete Preludes and Etudes for Pianoforte Solo (Dover Music for Piano)","review":"Scriabin was a contemporary of Rachmaninoff, in fact, he studied under the same teacher. Like Rachmaninoff, he was a bridge composer between the late Romantic and the 20th Century period. He was far more modern, in fact, than Rachmaninoff, though his early works were profoundly influenced by Chopin (Rachmaninoff less so--he was influenced by Chopin but also Tchaikovsky.)Despite the fact both composers shared Russian heritage and a love of the piano, Rachmaninoff did not admire Scriabin's works, saying he had gone off in a wrong direction. While I love Rachmaninoff's piano works intensely, I have to say that he was really wrong about Scriabin. This is some of the most gorgeous, introspective, Impressionist piano music ever written.Scriabin had a tragically short life, yet he composed quite a number of etudes, preludes, sonatas and other short piano works. Dover has done a huge favor by putting all the preludes and etudes into a single volume. There is enough material here for years of exploration into the music of a piano master. The edition is a compact volume that manages to sit well on the piano music stand, and the music print is clear and easy to read."},{"Title":"The Complete Preludes and Etudes for Pianoforte Solo (Dover Music for Piano)","review":"Scriabin's preludes and etudes represent everything from Scriabin's early days through to the final ones. The preludes etudes show such a wide variety of styles and colors of such a wide variety of difficulties (from very easy preludes to some extremely demanding etudes) that this book would give anyone years of beautiful music to study.Many pianists and aspiring musicians tend to categorize Scriabin as a \\"2nd-tier\\" composer, ignoring all but a few of his works (such as his etudes Op. 8 No. 12 and Op. 42 No. 5, both included in this volume). Before purchasing this volume (and the sonatas and miscellaneous pieces), I was under this false impression as well; however, the more Scriabin I play, the more I am convinced of his incredible innovation, creativity, and talent for writing thoroughly profound music in a matter of a few dozen bars.After having read through most of the book, and having seriously studied a fair number of the works within, I tend to be thoroughly dissatisfied with most performances of his music - I believe that the lack of color and architecture in many modern performances of his music make it sound shallow and boring; thus the general lack of interest in his music.For such a cheap price, I would implore any pianist or piano student to purchase this volume and discover Scriabin for themselves. It's the best ten bucks I've ever spent."},{"Title":"The Complete Preludes and Etudes for Pianoforte Solo (Dover Music for Piano)","review":"This is a good book because it is virtually the only complete set of Scriabin preludes I could find. The binding leaves a bit too be desired but all in all not a bad edition. The music it contains is five stars. Scriabin is one of my favorite piano composers."},{"Title":"The Complete Preludes and Etudes for Pianoforte Solo (Dover Music for Piano)","review":"c l e a r a n d s i m p l e p r e s e n t a t i o n o f s c r i a b i n ' s m u s i c"},{"Title":"1st Infantry Division: The \\"Big Red One\\" (Spearhead)","review":"My great-grandfather was a combat veteran with the \\"Big Red One\\" in World War I. I bought this book, and several others, because I wanted to learn more about what he experienced as a solider in the \\"Great War\\". This book is devoted almost exclusively to the First Division's history from World War II onward. Even the \\"clothing and equipment\\" sections are of WWII vintage. There are only a few pages devoted to the First Division's formulation in 1917 and their major campaigns of WWI. What content does appear for WWI is a high-level summation of events. I hope that the other books that I purchased about the \\"Big Red One\\" provide a more complete history \\"from day one\\". My rating of this book is lower than usual due to to absence of detailed information about the First Division prior to WWII."},{"Title":"1st Infantry Division: The \\"Big Red One\\" (Spearhead)","review":"This book discusses the 1st Infantry Division (The Big Red One) during its campaigns in North Africa, Italy, France and Germany. It looks at unit organization, equipment, weapons, uniforms and even some personalities in and associated with the 1st Infantry Division. The writing is OK but the book is lavishly illustrated with photographs and drawings. Most of the photographs are period but some are of WWII reenactors and are acknowledged as such. The book also discusses the role of the 1st ID in WWI, Vietnam, Desert Storm and the Balkans. A good pictorial reference mostly."},{"Title":"1st Infantry Division: The \\"Big Red One\\" (Spearhead)","review":"A good overall look at the &quot;Big Red One&quot;. Much better than the now dated Osprey Vanguard title on the 1st Infantry Division; some good photos and brief historical section, plus some nice surprises. The price is right as well. The Spearhead series is doing some good work, hope to see many more titles in future!"},{"Title":"Dictionary of Third World Terms, The Penguin (Reference)","review":"If you're looking to a simple, concise, radical introduction to Third World studies, this book is for you. With an excellent introduction to the history and politics of the term &quot;Third World,&quot; this book provides entries for terms such as &quot;Modernization,&quot; &quot;Colonialization,&quot; and &quot;Development.&quot; It also gives short entries on important historical events, movements, and people, such as &quot;Marcus Garvey,&quot; &quot;Mao Zedong,&quot; \\"Rio Summit,&quot; and &quot;Liberation Theology.&quot; Unfortunately, the book has not been revised for a second edition, so some of the entries feel dated. Also, the book is weak on gender issues, reflecting more a tendency of the field up to 1993 rather than necessarily a weakness of the author. I wish a second edition were forthcoming, but until then, I highly recommend this as an important addition to any informed person's reference shelf."},{"Title":"Blessing The House (Pitt Poetry Series)","review":"In the evolution of Jim Daniels's concerns as a poet, we see a steady movement over the last twenty years away from the struggles with the pressures of society and toward the confrontation with the difficulties of existence itself. Daniels's first two books, Places/everyone and Punching Out, illustrate the implacable reality of blue collar jobs. The gritty details of the poems are drawn primarily from a Detroit auto factory where the workers are abused by the bosses and by their fellow workers. His third book, M-80, shows the neighborhood where the autoworkers and their families live. There is no sentimentality here. The neighborhood is full of tough teenagers and wild children, and the adults are often abusive and ignorant. In the long poem Time, Temperature, the trust that the younger generation has in the wisdom of their elders is destroyed by the paranoid racism of the speaker's grandfather. This bleak view of urban life, and of Daniels's own childhood, is mitigated only by the rough love of family, but when family life goes awry, there is no balance to the harsh demands of work and the terror of violence in the streets. Dedicated to his two children, Blessing the House, Daniels's fourth book, has a softer tone. Perhaps the poet has temporarily made peace with the struggles of life, or perhaps he has simply created a safer and more loving environment for his own children than he himself had growing up."},{"Title":"Blessing The House (Pitt Poetry Series)","review":"A strong voice in contemporary poetry. Though his early works deal primarily with factory life, this latest collection deals with life as a father and observer. He captures the situations that go on around us everyday that we are usually too busy to appreciate for what they are. a brilliant collection."},{"Title":"Passover and Easter: Origin and History to Modern Times (Two Liturgical Traditions, V. 5)","review":"If you have not read this book, you are not well enough informed on the subject(s), even if you are a seminary grad and/or Pastor. This book is a complete treatment of the histories and comparison's of Passover and Easter. If you are a spiritual leader in any position, absorbing this book will provide the only way for you to be confident you are leading your &quot;flock&quot; with an accurate, non-biased approach, especially during the Passover/Easter season every year."},{"Title":"Deep Freeze","review":"I picked this up because it sounded interesting, and because I'm a big fan of disaster novels. Imagine my surprise when, 2 pages in, I realize that I've read this before! In the mid 70s (I believe) Racina wrote 'The Great Los Angeles Blizzard'-'Deep Freeze' is a reprint with some revisions to update it and a silly Manson cult subplot tacked on. The book was ok the first time (I really love cheesy disaster novels), and ok this time, but I was a little ticked that the publisher made no mention anywhere that this was a reprint."},{"Title":"Deep Freeze","review":"Even reviewing this bomb seems somewhat pointless! However, it was so bad that I just felt it my duty, as a avid reader, to warn people off from this atrocity. Deep Freeze held my attention (barely) for maybe twenty pages before I knew it was going to be a collosal groaner. The writing is...well...surprising for a multi-book published author. To call it plodding would be generous in the extreme. The characters are paper thin and BORING! The author seems to realize this and gives almost no effort to developing the absymal cast. Sometimes a great story can save bad characters but not in this case. Let's put it this way, if you are stuck on a desert island with the options of counting sand or reading this book...count the sand!One other thing...I noticed that Amazon's # 1 reviewer gave this book a 5 star rating. Hmmmmm?"},{"Title":"Deep Freeze","review":"I just finished reading Deep Freeze and what a disappointment. It was 366 pages of...well, nothing I guess. After reading about 50 pages of people describing the snow coming down I felt like saying, &quot;enough already, get on with the story!&quot; And that was the problem, the story never really progressed beyond that point.The only character I even remotely cheered for was the &quot;bad&quot; son. He was the only one who had even a little bit of depth to him. The other characters were flat and dull.Finally, I still don't get the whole radical faction aspect of the novel. It didn't come into play to any great extent like you're led to believe on the back cover and basically was a minor distraction while reading at best.Save your money and go purchase a novel by Rick Mofina if you want well developed characters, great story lines and suspense."},{"Title":"Deep Freeze","review":"A very good paperback, once you start the story pulls you in. Maybe some negative reviewers were confused because there are several subplots and they wanted \\"a simple boring book\\". Racina writes many stories and interweaves them to tell a great story."},{"Title":"Deep Freeze","review":"Veteran soap & thriller writer Racina combines the best of both his worlds wth this juicy read, perfect for vacation or a long plane trip. He imagines the City of Angels undergoing a \\"deep freeze\\" and all the disasterous consequences that would follow---of course, complicated by various sublots with an assortment of colorful characters.He knows L.A. and he knows showbiz, so he is particularly good with his characterizations and dialogue. It also helps that he penned the famous \\"Ice Princess\\" storyline in GENERAL HOSPITAL's heyday, so he's more than familiar with what happens when a metropolis undergoes a meteorological snafu!Lots of fun to add to your beach bag or summer cottage library collection!"},{"Title":"Deep Freeze","review":"This was my first experience reading Thom Racina. I picked it up at Sam's because it looked interesting. I read Deep Freeze within about 3 days, and was happy with it. With the recent weather problems around the world, the story is somewhat believeable. I enjoyed reading this book, and may check out his other books. I know some others give him bad reviews, but I do not judge a book by reviews or by it's \\"movie potential\\". For me, if it is a good story and written well enough that I do not notice any errors or screwups, then I am happy with it. I would reccomend this book to anyone as it is a good story with decent characters."},{"Title":"Deep Freeze","review":"I don't know about the reviewers who were so upset by this book; I wasn't expecting Joan Didion. I got a solid thriller with a premise that seemed pretty ridiculous (well, that is intil this weekend when the lows in LA hit the low 30's). Is it slightly silly? Sure. But it's also a great big bon-bon of a book that I defy you to not consume in one sitting. Like one of the better disaster movies of the 70's, you may have a few minutes of \\"well that couldn't possibly happen!\\" moments afterward.Then again if we were having precipitation in Los Angeles this weekend it would be snow...."},{"Title":"Deep Freeze","review":"In an area that is known for its warm climate and sunshine, Southern California is undergoing horrible weather including unseasonably cold temperatures and weeks of heavy rain. The worst is yet to come as leading meteorologists predict ice storms and snow with a good chance of a blizzard. The people of Southern California are woefully unprepared for this horrific weather. The Kings, the people who worship Jeffrey the way Charles Manson was once revered by his followers, are waiting for the blizzard to come.The Kings know that the poor people in the valley who will feel the effects of the weather first will go to the hills and take over the homes of the rich people, killing the wealthy because the Kings will egg them on. The family of Robert Hanwell needs to get out their home and get their daughter to the hospital for an operation or she will die. Some other members of the Hanwell family reach out a helping hand while others react to the situation by drinking themselves into oblivion or looting, a microcosm of what is happening in all of Southern California.Readers who like disaster books or movies (this novel would make a fantastic one) like Earthquake, Volcano and Typhoon will want to read DEEP FREEZE. A crisis of this magnitude brings out the best in some and the worse in others as brilliantly portrayed by two brothers who react in diametrically opposite ways. Mr. Racina is a master of suspense who creates deep characterizations and this tale demonstrates the wide range of his considerably unique talent.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Children Just Like Me","review":"Great photographs and info for our 2nd Grade Country and Cultures unit- always great to have realistic resources of the things we're studying!"},{"Title":"Children Just Like Me","review":"Wonderful book of cultural diversity for children.

During the Olympics, she has asked for it every night. She loves finding out about the other children and looking at the pictures. It is one of the best multicultural books I have seen. It does not focus on other cultures as historical curiosities or emphasize their differences. Instead, it provides a snapshot of what each child's life is like (parents, home, school, friends, etc.). It shows what is different while emphasizing common everyday life vs. festivals and traditions. It sparks her curiosity (why does that girl paint her face and body, etc.).

I work for the YMCA and have purchased it for our summer camp so that the children coming to stay at Camp Silver Beach can learn more about the childhoods of the international counselors who are role models for them during the summer. At 2 1/2 years, my son knew the continents and could point out where \\"Ari or Celena\\" lived and tell me their favorite toys or food and point to the countries in which they live.

This is a book that is suppose to be for children, yet I found myself wanting to creep off into the next room to look at the book alone. I even took the book to my dad's house and he liked it so much that I left it for him to look at. I would highly recommend this book for any age. Once you get it, you wont want to give it up. I believe my daughter will relate better to this book than any other book, because it deals with kids her own age. Make the investment. You wont regret it."},{"Title":"Children Just Like Me","review":"I bought this book recently to supplement my primary schooler's global cultures education. Something I did not note before purchase was the publishing date of 1995. Many of the pictures are in fact outdated now. But my chief complaint is that the buyer understand as I did not- this is not an atlas-accurate depiction of children by percent population in each country; it is actually more a compilation of minority cultures. The example children from the United States reveals this. For example, p. 6-7 show sample kids from several countries, some with typical appearances and names for their country like Yannis from Greece, Guo Shuang from China etc, but the US shows five children: two which appear hispanic (Nicole and Carlos), one eskimo, one unusual-looking chunky caucasian girl and one African American male with a seriously outdated hairdo and parachute pants. On the Americas page there is an entire line up of children, 24 in all, and only two caucasian kids in the whole line-up, which is a little odd. There are two eskimo children given two whole pages from the US and Canada (no other children from Canada- apparently they are all Inuit), where other countries with proportionately way more children like China do not get that much coverage. I unfortunately cannot tell if the children from the other countries are represented correctly, but the US is over-represented in general, as all the other countries have only 1 or 2 children. Tbe publishers should have left out so many extraneous US children, two children of ANY race would've been sufficient. I guess Australia's in the same boat as Canada as the only child represented is Aborigine, which is great to learn about, but not entirely a fair depiction of the continent. Oh well. The idea for the book is really cute, and the book is published with UNICEF, and when the subtitle says \\"a unique celebration of children around the world\\" they really mean it. Since this book functions similar to an atlas, it's a bit outdated,as mentioned. Each page includes a picture of the child, their home, food, family, school, favorite toy, friends, signature etc. Countries included: Canada, US (5x), France, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Poland, Russia, Japan, China, Mongolia, Thailand, Vietnam, Philippines, Indonesia, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, India (2x), Tanzania, Ghana, Ethiopia, Botswana, Morocco, Jordan, Egypt, Israel, Argentina, Mexico, Bolivia, Brazil."},{"Title":"Children Just Like Me","review":"I bought this book for my daughter who is adopted from China, and I subsequently bought it for five or six other children and am buying it again.

It captivated me instantly. I would spend hours reading it and rereading it. My teacher noticed how much I loved it and let me take it home for a while. I had kept it so long that my parents eventually bought me my own copy. I'm 18 years old now, and I still believe that this book is an amazing publication, and needs to be present in every classroom. It truly opened my eyes to other cultures and ways of life at such a young age- it definitely sparked my interest in social studies and the way people lived. Shortly after buying me this book, my parents bought me a talking interactive globe, just so I could learn more about all the countries that I fell in love with. I would encourage any parent reading this to buy this and share it with your child- it had such a deep impact on me that I still feel over a decade later. I definitely give this book credit for sparking my love and appreciation of other cultures very early on.Just to give you a sense of how deep of an impact this book had on me- I have no idea where my copy of it is, I haven't been able to find it in years. I probably haven't read it since 5th grade. But I can still describe so many of the children to you- the girl from Brazil who didn't wear shoes and painted her body, the nomadic boy from Mongolia, the girl who lived in Beijing, the girl in the black and white striped shirt from Europe who ate duck, the girl from Vietnam who eats a certain type of bug, the boy from Greece, the boy in Thailand who was training to be a monk.. these children are all still so vivid in my head, years and years later.. this book truly had a lasting effect on me. At 18 years old, I am still thankful I found it."},{"Title":"Children Just Like Me","review":"I got this book when I was about 6 years old, I'm now 19 and I can still remember it very well!

Starting from El Centro, California she follows the Kearny Trail to Santa Fe, the Santa Fe Trail, from there to St. Louis, the Old National Road from St. Louis to Pennsylvania and then down to Virginia. She shares her experiences, fears, problems, joys, and triumphs as she travels along on a somewhat nervous Mustang that is at times friendly and at other times much less so. The two appendixes have a few recipes and a very useful equipment list for anyone wishing to make a similar long horse trip. The equipment list is culled to the bare minimum by virtue of her experience. The book is written in a nice, easy reading style so that by the end you feel you have been on the long trip with a friend. Mustang Journal is a recommended read for anyone who enjoys personal achievement stories with a little history and geography thrown in for good measure."},{"Title":"Mustang Journal: 3000 Miles Across America By Horse","review":"A remarkable story of a lone woman and her horse as theytravel together 3,000 miles across the United States.

Well written."},{"Title":"Mustang Journal: 3000 Miles Across America By Horse","review":"Lisa Wood pens a compelling, colorful, and detailed story of adventuring clear across the continent on a castoff pinto mustang. With powerful, highly literate writing, she documents her sometimes breathtaking encounters with violent weather, unsafe roadways, scarce food,and no shelter. Balancing harrowing and heart-sapping experiences with those of joy and humor, she shows how determination and understanding one's horse can lead one through seemingly impossible barriers. Ms. Wood's accounts of the indifferent, mean and extraordinarily helpful people across the country also provide an update for de Tocqueville's study of the American character. As both a professional writer and avid player of polo, I recommend this book to anyone interested in adventure, horses, or discovering the new American spirit."},{"Title":"Jesus in Beijing: How Christianity Is Transforming China and Changing the Global Balance of Power","review":"Jesus in Beijing: How Christianity is transferring China and changing the Global Balance of Power, is a personal account of a reporter who dedicated the martyrs for their faith from CE 635 to modern time.This book gives a brief orientation on how Christianity came to China in 7th Century known as Nestorian Christians. There was a stele commemorating this east-west cultural and religious exchange, being translated by James Legge in bilingual text that I happened to have a reprint copy. Then he carried on the history to the new millennium. Besides Franciscan, Dominican and Augustinian, Jesuits had a good relationship with the Royal Court in the exchange of knowledge in 17th Century. However, the Pope, a religion authority tried to interfere the cultural and internal affairs of China over the tradition rite of honoring ancestors and Confucius. The Chinese Emperors issued \\"Edit of Expulsion and Confiscation\\" to drive Catholics out. The 19th Century of Anglo-Saxon Protestant ventured back to China in opium boats and gunboats. No wonder why Marx called Religion is the opium of people. Robert Morrison, an Englishman, was credited to translate the Bible into Chinese with no mention to the assistance from his convert Liang Fa. Morrison came in and was employed by East India Company, the monopoly opium pusher and smuggler to Chinese. England waged the Opium Wars 1839 and 1856. He died of diseases and was buried in East India Company cemetery in Macau. The Gospel of John was beautifully translated in Taoist terms, totally disregard to intellectual property. Chinese God Son, Hong Xiuquan who wanted to establish Chinese version of Kingdom of Heaven, made the Christian Tai Ping Rebellion. However, this Heavenly Peace Kingdom was brutally suppressed by the Christian Europe in manpower and gun power in support with The Ching Dynasty The 1900 Boxer Movement was a struggle against foreigners especially missionaries. The book did not mention two humiliating unequal treaty terms known as most-favored nation clause meaning if a foreign power squeezed any Chinese concessions, all other powers would share the same privileges, and extra-territoriality which meant all foreigners in China were not subject to the laws and jurisdiction of Chinese government. This book did not ask the question: why Boxer pick on the disciples of \\"love your neighbors as yourself\\"? These God's representatives did not practice what they peach. There were many exceptions such as American Rev. Hunter Corbett, whose grandson I met last year. The American share of Boxer Indemnity was devoted to Chinese higher education with heavy lobby. (See articles in magazine Chinese American Forum).The Three Self Churches was created by Chinese Christians in 1920s not in 1950s as alleged, to declare independence from foreign masters who dictated power, donations and policy, long before Mao's regime to administer patriotic church affairs. A Chinese pastor confirmed recent incidence of such hard-nose attitude and he rebuked and refused such conditional funding. The subsequent chapters described Christian mainly protestant house church activities and politics under Mao's Republic. Only one chapter was about Roman Catholics. Chapter 14 talked about missionaries came in disguise as English teacher by lies and deception. In mid 90s, some feverish American missionaries came to recruit Chinese converts to smuggle Bibles to China. Why not they themselves do the dirty work? This chapter also exposed a home grown quasi-Christian cult know as Eastern Lightning with an reincarnation of Jesus as a Chinese woman along with others such as Born-Again movement, Falungong and Little Flock.David gave an impressive detail account on the development of Christianity in China. It is \\"love your neighbor as yourself\\" doctrine to the teaching in the land of \\"do not do onto others as you do not want others do onto you\\". He devoted the last chapter in \\"China's Christian future?\\" with the possible answers - a more responsible power, an emerging menace, democracy and changing the fare of Christendom.Reading this book creates the following questions.1. Nestorian Christians came to China but died out long time, Mohammed established Islam and immediately sent his four disciples to China where they all left their body and soul in Beijing. Does it mean China will become Christian or Moslem?2. China is a virgin land from missionary eyes, what will happen if all denominations ranging from Baptist, Mormon, Christian Scientist, Pentecostal, Jehovah's Witness, Seven-Days Adventists, Moon's Church to Branch Davidian of Waco Texas claim their share and dominate with eventual government tanks crushing?3. Will orthodox Christianity accept Chinese Gnostic Christians incorporating the teaching of Buddhism, Taoism and folk religions as cult members?4. What will happen if Chinese Christians find out lie in be(lie)f, history and theology, Jesus and Christ, truth and faith, and Catholic and Protestant?5. Will Chinese Christian burn witches, start Crusade killings, and turn hospitals into churches with faith healing miracle to avoid high medical cost?6. Will Chinese Christian support stem cell research, abortion and the teaching of evolution?7. Will US accept Chinese Christian made according to American compassion self image? (The allegation P.288 about China closed in upon great hostility to US between Korean War and Kissinger's visit was doubtful. If he researched further, he would find that Premier Chou En-lai always wanted American friendship but US red scare prevented it from happening. Chou extended his hand to the American official at the encounter of Indo-China Peace meeting 1954 and was refused. This is why Nixon upon arrival Beijing stepped up and extended his hand to Chou first for a 28-year make-up.)8. Will the evangelical Chinese Christian on west journey to Jerusalem convert Moslems to bring about crush and confrontation?9. Will foreign powers invade Christian China to protect national interest?10. Will a Christian China lamb become the political and economic scapegoat when Christian brothers lose their jobs or rocket secrets?11. Does the American public know about the educator missionary - Minnie Vautrin being honored with a bronze bust and a scholarship fund in her former campus in Nanking, China 2002? Please read about her in book, The American Goddess at Rape of Nanking, by Dr Hua-ling Hu and review.12. The Bill of Rights came about because before American and French Revolutions in Christian world, there were only Divine rights and king's right, but not human rights. Was UN human right draft based on Christian or Confucius idea? Check it out.13. Will Jesus laugh or cry if he witnesses his disciples instead of standing with him on humanity, justice and peace, destroy other ethnic cultures, change their value system and the mode of thinking?14. Will Chinese Christian send back missionaries to first and second world countries to win back lost souls as major Cathedrals serve more as tourist attraction than houses of worship?15. Will Chinese Christian make the same remarks as their American Indian brothers: We used to have land and they have the Bible; now we have the Bible and they have the land?16. Will Chinese Christian be the blessed peacemaker on diversity harmony among the brotherhood of Judaism, Christianity and Islam as God is the Father of three faiths?17. Will a powerful Christian China become an imperial or colonial power as their Christian brothers of 19th Century?18. What will happen when Chinese Christians are Bible lover but ignorant about Buddhism and Taoism both of which are the spiritual salvation for Western seekers?19. Will Chinese Christian want to have the best by declaring to be a Taoist-Christian as so claimed by my American campus minister friend?20. Will Chinese Christian practice what they preach?21. The producer of River Eulogy, Yuan Zhiming and company dreamed of democracy in China based on Christianity. He tried hard to adapt by misinterpreting and distorting ancient Chinese Classics to convert. It is interesting to ask why Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, a devoted Christian failed miserably in bringing about democracy even some of his supporters baptized their troops with garden hose.22. Will a Christian China become American two-party or European multi-party democracy? Why a high number of Christian countries notably in Africa and South America are not relevant?23. What will happen if China becomes a theocracy?24. Will Chinese Christian accept from the DNA burden of \\"Communist five black types\\" to that of \\"Original sin\\"?25. Will Chinese Christians be willing to switch from \\"shame\\" culture to \\"sin\\" culture?26. Will Chinese Christian prevent exposing clergy in sexual scandal and corruption?27. Will Chinese Catholic keep Vatican II in treating Jews, Buddhists, Moslems and people of other faiths in respect without conversion?28. Will Chinese Christian judge others, good or bad depending on their Christian membership?29. What will happen when Chinese Christian create a \\"Chinese Messiah\\" and start a \\"People Temple\\"?30. How will Chinese Christians treat belivers as family menbers or as Confucius teaching that all human around four seas are?31. Will chinese Christians unite Catholics, Roman and Eastern Orthodox,and all denominations of Protestants?32. Will God feel good if the Garden of Eden is full of only Christians, one kind of plant, animal and fish?33. Will Chinese Christians become Anti-Semitics because the Bible said Jews killed Jesus?34. Will Chinese Christians expect the victims turn the other cheek?Will Chinese Christians accept other Christians as brothers and sisters or accept all human as brothers and sisters taught by Confucius?It is a miracle to see how a Jewish cult develops into a culture. Jesus sacrifices his life in protest against inhumanity, inequality and unjust of the Roman Empire. Truly this man was the Son of God, exclaimed the Roman centurion (Mark 15:39)Mr Karl Marx, please sit down!Will the real Jesus please stand up?"},{"Title":"Jesus in Beijing: How Christianity Is Transforming China and Changing the Global Balance of Power","review":"Veteran correspondent Dr. Advid Aikman has given us the fruit of many years of academic study, living in China, extensive travel, and wide-ranging interviews to produce what is possibly the most useful book on the church in China available today.He maintains the high standard set by writers such as David Adeney (China: The Church's Long March) and Tony Lambert (The Resurrection of the Chinese Church; China's Christian Millions), achieving both objectivity and appreciation in a careful balance.After an appetizer-introduction, he traces the history of Christianity in China from the earliest missionary endeavors in the Tang Dynasty to the most current developments. His wide knowledge of history enables him to place each stage of the shurch's story in its larger context.Lively writing, minute detail, arresting stories of many heroic individuals, and strategic insights make a potent combination; the book is hard to put down!We come away with a deep respect for men and women who have risked all, and suffered much, to follow Christ, especially since the Communists took over in 1949. Widespread persecution, often marked by brutal, even barbaric, torture, has brought Chinese Christians through the refining fire that could not quench their zeal.Though he concentrates upon the house churches, who form the vast majority of China's Christian millions, Aikman also offers a careful analysis of both the Protestant Three-Self Patriotic Movement and the two Roman Catholic organizations in China - one, like the TSPM, controlled by the government, the other loyal to the Vatican. He gives credit to those who have chosen to work within the confines of Communisty Party restrictions, but does not cover over the evidence for complicity in offical action against innocent believers by state-sponsored &quot;church&quot; leaders.Perhaps the most arresting chapter highlights the growing role of Christians among the educated elite - artists, writers, intellectuals, even Party members. Such a large number of these talented people are becoming Christians that Aikman thinks they will eventually influence both domestic and foreign policy.He could be right, for Chinese believers think that within a few years they will comprise 20 - 30% of the total population. Would such a critical mass tilt China towards America in the war on terrorism? It is possible, though the author also concedes that China could lurch back into rabid anti-Americanism, especially in a conflict over Taiwan.As he began with missionaries from the outside, so Aikman does not neglect the current role of foreigners who teach English, do business, or even evangelize and educate house churches clandestinely (though certainly not without police cognizance).Some think Aikman tends toward the optimistic, which is true, but he has reasons for his optimism, even if it needs tempering with inevitable realities to be found among Christians elsewhere, such as factions, division, abuse of authority, and neglect of family by many evangelists.But whoever said Christians were sinless? Didn't Jesus die for sinners?No book on Christians in China can be complete or perfect. Aikman could have said more, and does have his own preferences (as for the &quot;charismatic&quot; expression of Christianity, for example). But, all in all, he includes most of what we need to know, and leaves us with a thirst to know more.&quot;More&quot; can be had in the books mentioned at the beginning of this review, as well as in others on sale, such as The Heavenly Man.A first-rate book.G. W. Doyle, Ph.D.China InstituteCharlottesville, VA"},{"Title":"Jesus in Beijing: How Christianity Is Transforming China and Changing the Global Balance of Power","review":"\\"Jesus in Beijing\\" is a quick summary of the events, leaders, and movements behind the explosion in Christianity in China over the past few decades. Aikman breaks his book up into several sections devoted to topics such as the Chinese church patriarchs, the slightly less influential but still very important church \\"uncles,\\" famous Chinese Christian women, the roots of Christianity in China, how Christianity is influencing different artists, musicians, and others contributing to present-day Chinese culture, and most controversially, the debate between the government-approved churches of the Three Self Patriotic Movement and the \\"underground\\" house churches.While Aikman is clearly more favorable to the side of the house churches and their leaders, I do believe he was fair to Bishop Ding, the leader of the government's Three Self Patriotic Movement. While it can be argued that Ding has done much to advance Christian freedom in China, Ding also made statements in the past that go beyond simple respect for Chinese law... statements that were clearly pro-Communist. Ding also at times has professed a theology that is beyond liberal to a point that is simply not Christian. Ultimately, it is somewhat telling that Ding never spent a minute in prison while so many other Christians during Mao's reign, especially church leaders, were being brutally beaten and imprisoned for years at a time.Aikman sides at the end of the book with Chinese Christians that are critical of far right American groups (including some Christians) that seem only to want to exploit Chinese government abuses (which are indefensible) in order to shut off US contact and trade with China. He supports the Christians who believe that China is making progress, even if it has a long way to go. He clearly believes with these Chinese Christian moderates that the worst thing the US could do would be to intentionally antagonize and isolate the Chinese government. So Aikman does understand that there is a reactionary element running in some Christian groups, both inside and outside of China, but he also realizes that there is something suspicious about Christians that are too comfortable with what is still a totalitarian, often repressive, Chinese government as well.This book isn't the most exciting read as there are several typos, and Aikman's writing is fairly dry. But he has done his homework, he clearly cares about the people of China, both Christian and non-Christian, and he does a good job here of introducing the key players and laying out the background behind a fascinating movement occuring in a country that could very well dominate the 21st century, for good or bad, as much as America dominated the last century."},{"Title":"Jesus in Beijing: How Christianity Is Transforming China and Changing the Global Balance of Power","review":"This wonderful new book on the Christian role in China is written by a former Beijing bureau chief for Time magazine. He begins by looking at the history of the Christian church in China, its roots in Protestant and Catholic missionaries. Throughout he reveals the stories and turning points of the growth of the Chinese church. This dynamic group of men and women stood against all odds to bring the word of Christ to the people of China. The author then explores the quick growth and sad repression of Christianity. In many ways he compares it to the relationship between the Christians and Rome. Although they were suppressed they finally came to dominate the Roman empire in less then 500 years. Missionaries have been China for 400. The author forecasts a massive exponential growth of Christianity, showing how once it becomes 10% of China its rise will be unstoppable. The final conclusion of the author is that China will become a key ally of the west against militant Islam and that the commitment China have to Christianity will help renew the faith in the west, where church attendance is down dramatically. A very interesting work. The author helps to remind us that John Birch, who gave his name to the right wing society, was actually a missionary in China before being murdered by the communists.Seth J. Frantzman"},{"Title":"Jesus in Beijing: How Christianity Is Transforming China and Changing the Global Balance of Power","review":"Jesus in Beijing is a well written account of the history of Christianity in China from 600 A.D. to the present. Most of the book deals with the 20th Century. In the early 1970's, after the oppression and persecution of Mao's Cultural Revolution some western observers wondered if Christianity still survived in China. As it turned out, the church was alive and well. In spite of persecution of varying intensity throughout the reign of the Communist Party in China, the church has grown from about three million to approximately seventy million people today. One of the most surprising things about this rapidly growing church is its response to the increasing affluence of freedom within China today. Instead of focusing on material pleasures and toys, much of the church is dreaming of evangelizing the predominately Muslim lands between China and Israel. They reason that the Chinese church already knows how to suffer poverty and persecution and feel that they are prepared to pay the price for spreading the Christian message in Muslim countries. The author's speculation about the impact of Christianity on China's geopolitical future are also very interesting. While the possibility of the emergence of China as a belligerent, adversarial superpower exists, the author feels that the influence of Christianity on China may lead to a future in which China and the United States may in fact become allies. An interesting, informative book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Jesus in Beijing: How Christianity Is Transforming China and Changing the Global Balance of Power","review":"Aikman's text is an excellent field ehtnography of Christianity in China, with a particular bias towards Chinese house churches and the growing evangelical movements in China. This text, however, does not give an unbiased view of Chinese Christianity (it tends at times to be somewhat disparaging of the Three Self Protestant Movement and Bishop Ding), nor does it answer the question about the global transformation of power (my guess is that this was an editorial choice of titles to maximize book sales). What Aikman DOES do, however, is provide a sweeping view of evangelical Christianity in China, giving us a birds' eye view of some of the challenges and problems of China's church today, while documenting major leaders of the autonomous house churches. I heartily reccomend this book for anyone desirous of learning more about evangelical Christianity in China today."},{"Title":"Jesus in Beijing: How Christianity Is Transforming China and Changing the Global Balance of Power","review":"I read with interest the stories and information about Christian brothers and sisters in China. The body of Christ in China has been through, and continues to go through, much travail and persecution. Their faith, and the miracles and healings that occur, make the Chinese Church much like the first century Church under the Romans.I have lived in China recently and fellowshiped at a Three Self Church in a large central China city. It was a church with a strong evangelical sense. Most worshippers carried their own Bibles, they prayed fervently, sang heartily, and took notes on the sermons. They welcomed foreigners.Reports of other Three Self Churches in other places were variable, however. There is apparently quite a range of vitality among the Three Selfs, and so a broad characterization of them is not fitting.Aikman's subtitle -- How Christianity is Transforming China and Changing the Global Balance of Power -- had led me to expect a much greater analysis of transformation and balance than actually occurs in the book. These topics are treated mostly in the last chapter.Overall an enjoyable, and informative read."},{"Title":"Jesus in Beijing: How Christianity Is Transforming China and Changing the Global Balance of Power","review":"Mr. Aikman has presented an excellent picture of the development of Christianity in China, right up to the present. It is very well written, enjoyable to read, and very informative. Having traveled to China on numerous occasions in recent years, I have found that my experiences have been confirmed by what he writes. This book is the best I have come across if you are looking for a picture of the recent development and situation of the church in China."},{"Title":"Jesus in Beijing: How Christianity Is Transforming China and Changing the Global Balance of Power","review":"The former Beijing bureau chief for Time magazine more or less accurately describes the state of the Christian Church in China, both underground and communist approved. He particularly invests substantial portion of his book on the Christians in Henan province and accurately portrays the region as one of the centers if not the center of Chinese Christianity. His approach to the research and description of the missionary work is still Western-oriented although he mentions Korean and Korean-American missionaries frequently. His presentation of the late Jonathan Chao as the father of modern Chinese confessional movement who helped draft various Chinese doctrinal confessions is very interesting, although the confessions are obviously a product of Western-educated Chinese rather than a purely indigenous product. Because of this, the faith statements primarily deal with doctrines that interest the Western Church rather than accurately stating what concerns the Chinese Christians the most. The book is about 90% &iexcl;How Christianity is transforming China&iexcl; and 10% &iexcl;Changing the Global Balance of Power&iexcl;. His vision for pro-America China is narrow and parochial at best. China must become more than a helper to America in the world stage. A Christian China that leads the world as a true leader would also show leadership in world mission to the rest of the world."},{"Title":"Jesus in Beijing: How Christianity Is Transforming China and Changing the Global Balance of Power","review":"As the pastor of a small church for internationals - most of whom are from the People's Republic of China - I read this book with personal interest. It concerns many of my friends and their country - which at times I think of as \\"my\\" country.Let me begin by emphasizing the positive dimensions of the book. Its survey of the history of Christianity in China, its focus on individuals especially of the 20th century and mostly in the house church movement, its (inconsistent!) efforts at balance. It is worth reading, and we need to hear the stories of suffering, courage, faith, and triumph that are found therein.The book does have flaws which center on three loci:1) Its persistent bias against the Three Self Patriotic Movement and persons/groups associated therewith,2) Its casual and uncritical assumption of Christian \\"orthodoxy\\" as more or less coequal with conservative evangelical Protestantism [in my opinion its largest and worst flaw],3) Its hypocritical(?) stance(s) on the relationship between Christianity and politics/capitalism.1) I have persons who have become Christians while attending TSPM churches, and persons who became Christians through house churches. American Christians should categorically call for full religious freedom in China - no one should have to register with or work through TSPM. But we also need a little more understanding of Chinese Christians who choose to worship/minister \\"above ground\\".2) Aikman uses the word \\"orthodox\\" a great deal - and clearly by it he means conservative evangelical Protestant theology. Aikman paints with far too broad a brush \\"Modernism\\" as the opposite of authentic Christianity (see pages 147, 156-157 et passim). Not everyone who rejects \\"conservative evangelical Protestantism\\" is a modernist, or a liberal, or \\"not a true Christian\\". I think Aikman too often presents us with a false dichotomy - either you are a \\"fundamentalist\\" and orthodox, or you are a \\"modernist\\" and liberal. He needs to allow a bit more room for other faithful and committed understandings of the Christian faith.3) Aikman loves to criticize those Chinese who try to blend Christianity and politics. Who say, \\"Make Christianity serve socialism/Communism\\". Fair enough. Meanwhile notice how much Aikman tries to sell the \\"benefits\\" of Chinese Christianity in terms of capitalism, a pro-Western China, a big ally against radical Islam. How often do American evangelicals wed pro-American patriotism to their Christian faith? (If you don't know what I mean, look for cars with stickers that have an American flag draped over the cross. We sing patriotic songs in our churches while some Chinese Christians get in trouble for refusing to do just that.) If Christianity should not be twisted into the handmaiden of Communism, perhaps neither should it become the herald of Western capitalism."},{"Title":"Jesus in Beijing: How Christianity Is Transforming China and Changing the Global Balance of Power","review":"David Aikman has written a book that is based on two suppositions. The first is that China will someday become significantly Christian. The second is that that will feed back into its foreign policy.There are some problems with this book's arguments: The first is that this is not even a good synopsis of any type of demographic research that has been done on Chinese Christians-- and so this makes projections suspect. The notes are only 12 pages long with: 1) a lot of multiply cited single references; 2) virtually no journal articles; 3) A lot of commentary. The end result is that this book feels too speculative (even thought it is easy to read). Throughout the text, the author makes a lot of speculations and gives lots of anecdotal evidence (somebody told me this/ I've seen that/ etc.). If he wanted to suggest the mechanism by which a significant amount of China would become Christianized, why not study the path of countries where that had actually happened (such as Korea) and see if the conditions in China were ripe for that? Or why not study why Hong Kong did NOT become Christianized and then show how conditions in China were different to those in HK. I found no such analysis.The second big problem is with the thesis of his book, which Aikman recapitulates on p. 285 is that: China will become significantly Christian in the future and that will influence its foreign policy. There are some problems with this: Even if China does become 20-30% Christian, that means absolutely nothing with respect to foreign policy. And this is because of two reasons: 1) The government in China represents mostly the interests of the wealthiest minority. The other 90% *should* be able to have more influence because of their greater numbers, but don't. Can we really be expected to believe that IF China becomes 20-30% Christian that believers will have more influence *just* because of their numbers? Not likely. 2) Just because some government has *any* of one type of religion doesn't mean that that has anything to do with its foreign policy. Iraq is a majority Shiite country, but has a very secular government. Bahrain has a Sunni monarch (and a Shiite population), but they have been allied with the Sunni/ Wahhabi Saudi Arabia. It in NO way follows that Chrisitianity will bring democracy or any type of sense of international responsibility.So, in summary, we have a lot of nifty short stories, but not that much substance.There were some good examples of cults and cities like Wenzhou, with its significant Christian minority.If I had the choice to buy this book all over again, it would be worth about $7-8 to me secondhand."},{"Title":"Jesus in Beijing: How Christianity Is Transforming China and Changing the Global Balance of Power","review":"On my opinion, every christian people need to read this book, it's a kind of \\"Ligthed History Book\\" allowed to demostrated What and How is the most impredecible moving of this century: God's moving..."},{"Title":"Jesus in Beijing: How Christianity Is Transforming China and Changing the Global Balance of Power","review":"David Aikman presents the endurance of Christianity in the great nation of China throughout the centuries and especially in modern times as the Church continues to grow even while facing brutal persecution.

It is full of details-- facts, figures, places, events, people, and so forth. The reporter has clearly seen many things and interviewed many people.It is exciting to see how God is at work in China, causing rapid growth of the Church in spite of persecution that at times and at certain places has been tragically severe. The Chinese Church not only envisions-- and is working toward- bringing all of China to faith in Jesus Christ, but is also working toward bringing the whole Muslim world to Christ. The Chinese believe they are better able to do this than the western Church, and that it is their turn to spread the Gospel, just as it has been the west's turn to do so for the last few centuries.This book is a fascinating account of past history, present history being made, and a glimpse of the future Christian world.

By far the biggest problem in the Chinese church is poor teaching and abusive practices. This exists almost exclusively in the underground churches.Aikman wrote a book that caters to the palates of American Christian evangelicals who want to hear exactly what Aikman is telling them. Young \\"missionaries\\" who have yet to understand the difference between culture and faith or have even critical thinking will use this book to find inspiration and funding.As a Mandarin speaking Christian who has spent considerable time in China I was hoping to like this book.

China has been one of those \\"iffy\\" places where publically the government would want us to believe there is religious freedom, but there are real doubts. What is truly fascinating from this read is that China Christians feel God's call to the Islam nations!This book serves to provide a view of that very thing, with a well documented history and insights into the Far East power, with this well written former editor of Time magazine in China.The profiles of the key players both from the government's Religious Bureau and the house churches and foreigners is illuminating. Theology is not discerned much, just a journalistic type mentioning of its leanings at times, along with some of their confessional publishing appendixed.God bless all those that have and are and will take a stand to confess Christ in that place."},{"Title":"Jesus in Beijing: How Christianity Is Transforming China and Changing the Global Balance of Power","review":"This is a recreational read for me. I am interested in China and in Christianity. The book struck me as shallow and superficial from the beginning and despite my best intention to believe it could be more never overcame that first impression. The author is too influenced by his newspaper training, for the book reads like a series of short newspaper articles, it leaves you wondering what it is that you learned and asking for more.Now i don't know how much is available to the Western world concerning what is going on to Christians in China. As a glimpse into this world, via short biographies of the people involved it is just acceptable. He obviously travelled to places and saw people that i can only dream of and i can admire and wish to learn from that experience. But i wonder about the depth of the conversations or the critical judgement of the author if these snippets represent the meetings. They are like the small talk that takes place at a party rather than the deep sharing that ought to take place between brethren in the faith, trying to share the things closest to their hearts.Several places the author leads into big questions: the role of women in the church, pentecostal character of the church, the role of house churches, the relationship of church and state etc. where there was good opportunity to tell us what the people he met thought. But he doesn't go very far, and leads to a complaint of shallowness and superficiality beyond the style of the book. Even with endnotes he doesn't continue the conversation with references or notes to the same phenomena in the west. I definitely feel that he drops the ball and really doesn't tell us very much about these people.Frustrating, i'd love to learn more about what is going on there. I'd love to put down the book believing the church is exploding and will have a cultural influence. But the book doesn't leave me with such ideas, rather i feel like i read a travelogue that introduced me to a few heroic persecuted brethren in China. Now i appreciate this, perhaps as the first book to recommend to someone to pick up for an idea of the faith in China it is barely sufficient. Since it doesn't point to anything past itself, and it doesn't seem to interact with the people or theology at any but the most hello-how-are-you level i'd just have to pass on recommending it except as a newspaper level intro."},{"Title":"Jesus in Beijing: How Christianity Is Transforming China and Changing the Global Balance of Power","review":"In David Aikman's book he has continued the 25-year old stories and half-truths that the Three Self Movement in China's Protestant community is a tool of the Communist government. Bishop K. H. Ting, who helped as few others, bring the government in the late 1970s to allow the churches to begin to re-open, is one of the finest scholars and Christians I ever met. Knowing him personally I can assure the reader he is not a fellow traveler or Communist. In May 1989 he wrote the Central Committee in Beijing not to harm the demonstrating students in Tiananmen Square. Noted \\"house church\\" pastors hid during that time rather than stand up for freedom. I was in his home in Nanjing when he was writing the letter and in Beijing among the students days before the army came in.Southern Baptists did not begin in the 1980s to do covert work in China as Mr. Aikman writes. We began by working in the open. It was not until the fundamentalist take-over of the Southern Baptist Convention, USA, that covert missionary work began in various ways in China. That was a mistake. Cloak and Dagger missionaries have no place in the ministry of the Prince of Peace. I wish Mr. Aikman, with his skill in writing and his wide experience, had given a broader and more complete picture of Protestant Christianity in China today."},{"Title":"Jesus in Beijing: How Christianity Is Transforming China and Changing the Global Balance of Power","review":"Even though I fancy myself a semi-alert follower of global news, this book took me completely by surprise. Here's the short version of the surprise: there may be as many as 100 million Christians in China. (Does that mean there are more Christians in China than in Europe??)The long version of the surprise is WHY. And the answer comes from the Chinese intelligentsia, in the person of one \\"Dr. Wu\\" (not his real name).\\"One of the things we were asked to look into was what accounted for the success, in fact the pre-eminence of the West all over the world. We studied everything we could from the historical, political, economic, and cultural perspective.\\"At first, we thought it was because you had more powerful guns than we had. Then we thought it was because you had the best political system. Next we focused on your economic system.\\"But in the past twenty years, we have realized that the heart of your culture is your religion: Christianity. That is why the West has been so powerful. The Christian foundation of social and cultural life was what made possible the emergence of capitalism and then the successful transition to democratic politics. We don't have any doubt about this.\\"So said Dr. Wu, in a statement which is beginning to be heard around the world. Chinese society has an aching gap where \\"Mao Thought\\" used to be. Nobody believes in Marxism, Leninism, or Maoism any more. Confucius is respected, but regarded as a bit behind the times, and unfamiliar with global competition. So what is going to fill that gap?Well, there are 100 million Chinese Christians, and I don't think they spend much time listening to our village atheists.This book was a complete surprise for me, a stunning surprise.-----UPDATE-----China is now the world's largest producer of Bibles: 100 million."},{"Title":"Jesus in Beijing: How Christianity Is Transforming China and Changing the Global Balance of Power","review":"Aikman turns a reporters eye to a careful analysis of the incredible move of God in Mainland China over the past 30 years. Three significant movements are identified and explored -- the Underground Church -- the Revival within the Three Self Church -- and the unusual influence of Christian scholars in Chinese culture. Captivating reading -- but apparently the naming of names and inclusion of pictures of famous Christians in China has led to some increased persecution.Aikman's assertion that some day the critical mass of Christianity will reach the tipping point and bring sweeping social change has proven to be an embarassment to the government, And if there is one thing the government of China won't stand for, it's being embarrassed.

Christianity is growing exponentially in Africa, of course, but in China, too, the numbers of adherents continues to grow. Jesus In Beijing speculates that withing the next thirty years, a third of China's population may be Christians, making it one of the largest Christian nations in the world.David Aikman, former Time Magazine bureau chief in Beijing, has written a winsome account of the history and development of Christianity in a nation with which he is very familiar. His personal contacts with House Church leaders, past and present, and with leaders of the Three Self \\"State\\" Church, give the book a clarity not likely to be repeated. It will undoubtedly become a standard reference in years to come. Aikman's style is always well-paced, so the book is a delight both for the scholar and the novice."},{"Title":"Jesus in Beijing: How Christianity Is Transforming China and Changing the Global Balance of Power","review":"As China re-emerges as a dominant power in the 21st century, much will hinge on the beliefs of the people in that country when it comes to the actions it takes and tolerates around the world. Oddly, the fascism of the Communist regime remains largely in place in the era following Mao's disastrous reign, even as capitalism and other Western ideals spread like wildfire through this huge, heavily-populated, and (from a Western perspective)oftentimes strange land. Aikman does an excellent job of covering the basic bullet points of the history of Christianity in China, as well as introducing readers to the many Chinese Christians who have led or continue to lead the church in their country. On a recent trip to China, I was highly impressed by the deep generosity, humility, resourcefulness, strength, perseverance, and kindness exhibited by Chinese of all ages. This spirit hums just below the surface in the stories Aikman tells of the Christian Chinese and their faith. This spirit is also, I believe, one of the major reasons why the life and teachings of Jesus seem to so easily take root in the hearts of so many Chinese. Also, those who are concerned that a \\"Christian China\\" would somehow gut the land of its culture and heritage while propping up a Westernized facsimile in its place should rest easy. It seems that the faith is spreading through this nation in a very distinctly Chinese way."},{"Title":"Jesus in Beijing: How Christianity Is Transforming China and Changing the Global Balance of Power","review":"A vivid and compelling description of an incredibly important storyline virtually unknown outside (or even inside) of China."},{"Title":"Jesus in Beijing: How Christianity Is Transforming China and Changing the Global Balance of Power","review":"On page five A member of CASS, (Chinese Academy of Social Sciences) said they were asked by the communist party leaders, \\"Why is the US pre-eminent all over the world?\\" We studied everything from the historical, political, economic and cultural perspective.

This might upset some people, but its a good read."},{"Title":"Jesus in Beijing: How Christianity Is Transforming China and Changing the Global Balance of Power","review":"Having read The Heavenly Man about Brother Yun, I was fascinated to get the larger perspective in Jesus in Beijing. Written by retired Time magazine correspondent, David Aikman, who has been in and out of China since the 1970s, this book documents how the Gospel has come to China in three major waves over a period of nearly 1400 years.The Gospel first came to China in A. D. 635, but it had all but disappeared by the end of the fourteenth century. The record of a large Christian community from this era was carved on a stone tablet which had been hidden in the ground for over 800 years, until its discovery in 1623. By the time of its discovery the Gospel had returned. Yet by the nineteenth century it seemed possible that Christianity was again in danger of vanishing.It was not until 1807 that Protestant missionaries first arrived in China. And yet Robert Morrison only won ten converts in twenty-seven years. While the Gospel message in the 1800s was then preached in a purer form than was understood by the first two movements, a heretical new movement was also spawned, the Society of God -Worshippers. Hudson Taylor arrived in 1866. While God used the China Inland Mission, there were several anti-foreign backlashes, including the Boxer Rebellion of 1900.By 1926 there were 8,325 Protestant missionaries in China, the most ever. Yet by 1949 Mao Zedong and the communists had forced out all foreign missionaries, leaving approximately three million Chinese Catholics and three-quarters of a million Protestants. Then there was the terrible persecution of the Church during the Cultural Revolution. The Red Guard attempted to eradicate all religion from China. The West feared that the Church in China had died and we did not know until the late 1970s what really happened.In 1977 Christianity Today published an article entitled \\"Where Have All the Churches Gone?\\" A priest who had left China twenty-eight years earlier returned and reported that he saw no signs that the Chinese had any interest in religion. He looked for Catholic churches and found they had been turned into civic centers, schools, and stores.Yet what actually has happened was that the Chinese church has grown to about 80 million believers. China is now one of the leading Christian nations in the world and yet the Chinese government officially is still atheistic. Yet the Church has an annual growth rate of 7%. They have had at least 3000 conversions every day for 40 years. In a sense Pentecost has been repeated daily for a generation. Aikman wrote in 2003 that Christians are everywhere and have even infiltrated the highest levels of government. No longer is Christianity a foreign religion. It reaches deep into Chinese culture and society and has grown \\"at a staggering speed since 1979.\\" \\"China is in the process of becoming Christianized.\\" It is projected that within three decades Christians will constitute 20-30% of China's population. It is estimated that there are now 1000 underground seminaries in China which are training the next generation of leaders. But as recently as twenty-five years ago it appeared that the third wave of evangelism might also vanish.Instead the Church in China has grown in spite of one failure and reversal after another. While we can today rejoice in the growth of Christianity in China, why did a sovereign God take 1400 years to do what he could have done in a day? Why did it take so long for this seed to produce a harvest? Why did he allow his Church to suffer repeatedly and so many of his preachers to be martyred? And how many of these heroes languished and died in prison never knowing the glory of God that would one day come to China? It all seems like such a waste. However, in God's economy nothing is ever lost. It all appears to be such an inefficient plan, but the very process of conveying the message of salvation through human preachers seems foolish (1 Cor 1:21). God does not really owe us an answer, but we do owe him our faithfulness. Yet \\"persecution is the growing pain of the church. It is good for the church.\\" Pastor Samuel Lamb testifies, \\"The more persecution, the more the church grows.\\" In 1999 he asked the government to arrest him again. Chinese church leaders worry, \\"If things are too open it is not good. Under hardship the Chinese church will be healthy. I am concerned that some day when things are totally open there will be corruption.\\" They also worry about the egotistical, affluent lifestyle of American churches. And so God, through persecution, has kept his Chinese Church pure and prepared to carry the Gospel to the rest of the world.In The Late Great Planet Earth, Hal Lindsey declared that the 200 million troops of Revelation 9:16 were Red Chinese soldiers who would fight at Armageddon. This conjecture was based on nothing other than the fact that in 1965 China boasted of an army of 200 million. Forty years later the reality is that there is an army of Chinese Christians marching back to Jerusalem with the goal of converting the Muslim world to Christ. Their goal is 100,000 missionaries, double the current total of American Catholic and Protestant missionaries working overseas.The postmillennial world view is a long-term vision for the success of the Gospel. In contrast, dispensationalism is myopic. According to this near-sighted view the terminal generation was alive in 1948. Despite all its revisions, dispensationalism is running out of time. But time is on the side of postmillennialism.We pray for revival, but revival is simply the acceleration of normal kingdom growth. While it is right to pray for the extraordinary work of the Spirit, we should not despise the quiet but steady yeast that permeates this world (Matt 13:33). Whether or not we ever live to see world revival, we should not be moved from our calling. We should always give ourselves fully to the work of the Lord, because we know that our labor in the Lord is not in vain (1 Cor 15:58). When the Apostle Peter wrote that with the Lord a day is like a thousand years (2 Peter 3:8), he was not giving historicists a formula with which to calculate the date of the return of Christ. Rather he was encouraging us, though we are finite creatures and cannot see the big picture, that God inhabits eternity and his truth is marching on. That truth endures to all generations (Psalm 100:5; 145:4)."},{"Title":"Death in the Peerless Pool","review":"Deryn Lake is a pseudonym of a well know historical novelist.

Good escapism for the reader, away from the bumps and grinds of everyday life.The John Rawlings books that pair the young London apothecary with older and wiser John Fielding, the magistrate, better known as the Blind Beak are becoming more and more popular. John Rawlings is spending less and less time at his apothecary shop and more and more time helping John Rawlings solve some of the crimes that a large city such as London attracts.

Now I have found Deryn Lake and John Rawlins, a character inspired by the real-life detective to invented carbonated water in England. Lake's attention to period detail is meticulous and yet, sadly, the plot is very current. The author plays a bit with the reader in that several of the characters know of an important clue but the reader is given time to either remember it, go back and find it or wait; fortunately, not to long, for it to be revealed. The story is not action driven, but involves you with the plot, period and the characters. I really want to start this series at the beginning.

We start out with Miss Edna Potter in a fictional town called Winslow, Tennessee. She has just retired from the school district that she has worked in for 40 years. At the annual teacher's meeting she stands up and tells all her peers that she is happy to be retiring and is happy to announce that she is a fully licensed private investigator complete with business cards. Everyone in the building is buzzing with the news and Miss Potter can still put the fear of God into those that are around her whether it is students or peers.Miss Potter's first case is to find Carrie Owens, a missing teenager and when she starts turning up leads everyone in town is amazed. From buying guns to finding suspects Edna Potter is a force to be reckoned with. She is not very customer service oriented and has to keep reminding herself she needs to be more tactful. But in a very endearing way she does grow on you and you do get the sense that she does want to belong and does care about everyone of her students and friends. Her methods may be a little different and Miss Potter does get into a few scrapes along the way, which just makes for a very interesting adventure in this first book. Even Police Chief Duncan who at first warns Miss Potter to stay out of police business is able to recognize that Miss Potter will not be going away. She has the tenacity of a bulldog.I really liked this book by Miss Biery and hope that she is able to continue writing about Miss Potter. Miss Potter reminds me a little bit of the M C Beaton books with Agatha Raisin as the start. If you like Agatha, I am sure you will like Miss Potter.

Unfortunately, they fall flat because they are not timely or specific. When written in 1963, the book may have been useful to casual readers with a passing interest in the stock market.

There are references to interesting characters and events--such as Daniel Drew, Jay Gould, and the Erie War. Martino Published went to considerable effort to re-publish this 1963 book.

I think this classic was totally amazing even amongst the books of today. The storyline was fun and easy to follow. Lewis Carroll used an interesting way to describe the feelings of the characters.

Definitely a collector's item, just make sure your bookcase is tall enough! Amazing pictures, illustrations on every page. The inside has some illustrations and highlights, also."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"Some of you could, by any chance, have watched the Animated Alice's Adventures In Wonderland. Most of you should have read Alice's Adventures, and if you did not, you are better off. If you watched both, then you would best understand the major differences between the novel and the animations. Though I am sure there are a lot more to point out, in this review, I will focus on theses three points: the change with characters, the difference in setting, and the alternation of plots.First of all, here are the major character changes! Many agreed on the Queen of Hearts being the one of the most different, and also, the Cheshire cat. The classic portrayal of characters indicated the Cheshire Cat as the property of the Duchess. In the film, there is no Duchess at all!! The Cat stands alone, and instead of staying calm and cool as the novel, it is rather playful and gets Alice into big trouble with the Queen. Not only Duchess was not even mentioned, the gryphon never showed up, and the mock turtle was totally out of the picture. The Queen is selfish and ignorant, and though she rules the kingdom, she shrinks from responsibility. That may not get you much information on why there are so many difference with the Queen, and that will go on to our second point: the settings.Settings were also dramatically changed, kind of combined with the other book, making it a total hybrid. The queen's selfishness was not mentioned directly on the original, only the screaming passion for winning. The Queen of Hearts on the film's personality was combined with the Red Queen (especially the \\"open your mouth wider\\" parts inherited from her personal lines), making clear that she wanted everyone to obey her and to make her as happy as if she could ever be. The other clear facts supporting the idea of the combination between the two books are Tweedledee and Tweedledum appearing after the caucus race, followed by the garden of singing flowers. I was clearly expecting more than this, so it will actually look like as if it WAS a two book in one film, not an in-between sidekick.When it comes to settings, it always has to do with plots. Though not mentioned above, the start and the ending have a lot to this section. First of all, it was just a pleasant afternoon, resting by her sister when Alice started to dream and saw the white rabbit hurrying by, not during the history lesson. Then, there is the white rabbit that appears more frequently than it used to in the original, even during the mad tea-party. However, the most important thing in the whole plot, is that Alice thought of this amazing world before even she started to dream, and found out it was a dream at the end of the story, BEFORE she woke up. In the story, there was no such thinking of this events and it was a surprise for her to know she grew back to her own size, and have been sleeping.Overall, there are a lot of differences mentioned in this comparison review, and despite of director effort to create a lovely animation, I think it was kind of messed out. There are some reasons I wrote down already, but it is mostly for the others which have not been. However, I DO appreciate the animator's hard efforts to even think of turning this perfect piece of writing to a film, so I guess the \\"missed-outs\\" are expectable.This was my comparison review, and I hope you enjoyed it. If you have any spare seconds, please put a thumbs-up on my review & share your thoughts with me. Thanks!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"The theme of this book is basically a mystical wonderland where the unexpected happens. She starts off by falling into a hole, and then her journey in Wonderland begins. Carroll's descriptive language is incredible and he's always engaging your imagination.

There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \`Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!\\"This is what Alice, a curious young girl, experienced one sunny afternoon. Very bored, she decided to follow a rabbit down its hole. Expecting to see the rabbit's nest, Alice was stunned when she opened her eyes and saw a teeny tiny door surrounded by teeny tiny furniture. This is just the beginning of Alice's journey to Wonderland. She encounters a mischievous disappearing cat, a larger-than-life caterpillar, and an insane Mad Hatter. Alice's adventure becomes complicated when she crosses paths with Wonderland's evil queen. The queen, jealous of Alice's looks, gentle personality, and innocence, orders that she be captured and held prisoner. Alice, united with her unusual friends, must help restore order to chaotic Wonderland by dethroning the wicked queen and returning to her own world. Does Alice find her way back home? Or is she fated to navigate through the foreign world for eternity? There is only one way to find out!Lewis Carroll, Alice's creator, brings a world of madness mixed with logic to life. This particular edition has gorgeous watercolor illustrations by Helen Oxenbury that will help you visually explore Wonderland along with Alice. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a classic that is sure to earn a place as a favorite tale as well as a place on your bookshelf."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"What mainly sets Helen Oxenbury's version of Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventure in Wonderland apart is her appeal to the new generation. Gone everything complicated, in comes simplicity and cuteness! The characters have a modern look to them that surely will appeal to chidlren. The text is also noticeably bigger and makes the book easier for children to read. The text is unabridged. This edition will definitely delight young readers for generations to come!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"Written in 1865, this classic is a tale of a girl named Alice who falls down a rabbit hole into a fantasy world populated by creatures who assume human characteristics.'Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late, the Rabbit say to itself..and when he actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket and hurried on and popped down a large hole, curious Alice, went after it never considering how she was to get out again.Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end? She tried to curtsey as she spoke...Ma'am is this new Zealand or Australia?... \\"Curiouser and curiouser\\" cried Alice... Now I'm opening like a largest telescope...Good-bye, feeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet.... When suddenly thump, thump, the rabbit was still in sight as it turned the corner saying..Oh dear! Oh dear! How late it's getting... ( from the book)And it goes on and on...and on. Of course the plot and the narrative are totally nonsensical but if you let your imagination roam and let yourself fall into its spell you will be transported along with Alice to a magical world with its memorable characters such as Mad Hatter having tea parties, and the terrifying Queen of Hearts threatening to behead everyone. You will meet Cheshire the cat, the turtle, the Duchess, Bill the Lizard, the Mouse, the Dodo, the Lory and Caterpillar and many more weird characters all the while growing and shrinking from drinking lotions and potions saying \\"Drink me\\". Ultimately you will move around very fast and achieve nothing...till you wake up and realize this was all but a dream...This adventure has inspired numerous comic books, films, TV movies through countless adaptations and hundreds of editions of the book throughout the years. This story was one of the freebees on my e-reader so I decided to give it a go. Early in I missed the visual aspect I have always associated with Alice, but as my imagination kicked in and the characters came alive, it became easier to understand the humour and wits that played within the words and admit it was a refreshing experience. However my fondest memories take me back to the animated version created by the late Walter Disney and his Studios.

It was extremely weird, but weird in a good way. The storyline was indeed \\"curious\\" and if you can get past the weirdness then you can enjoy it. At times I could get past the strange aspects of these stories, but other times I thought it was a bit too ridiculous and confusing to say the least. A few times, I had to read a sentence more than once to fully grasp its meaning. There is not really any plot to this book, but I can see how it may be a fun book to read to kids.Definitely not my favorite books, but I did enjoy Alice's Adventures in Wonderland more than Through the Looking Glass. I'm not going to say don't read this because I know a great deal of people enjoy this classic...it's just that I didn't find it all that great.

The only reason I could follow any of it was because I have seen the various movie versions many many times. I not sure why I assumed that because it was a classic children's tale it would be good. The entire thing made no sense and on more than one occasion I believed that maybe because it was the Public Domain kindle edition perhaps I was missing a page or chapter. I know it was missing illustrations but it also felt like it was missing whole paragraphs. If this edition is complete than this truley is a horrible book."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"This is coming from someone who absolutely LOVES the Disney classic film; and maybe (as I'm sure some of you will point out to me) that is the problem, but I think there is a bigger factor to my lukewarm sentiments towards this Lewis Carroll classic.I read this on Kindle.Now I love my Kindle (app), and I love the bountiful \`free' books to choose from, but if I can muster any amount of warning it would be to steer clear of this particular book. The reason being is that \`Alice's Adventures in Wonderland' is a visionary piece of literature that very much requires visuals to make it work. Reading the prose in mere \`black and white' so-to-speak, without any illustrations, makes such a low impact. In fact, the story takes on a tiresome tone without the aid of John Tenniel's illustrations. The fact that the Kindle version of this story omits them is a tragedy because it takes so much away from the experience. Sadly, my first experience with this story was on the picture-less Kindle version and my expectations were not met and I was left with this sour taste in the back of my throat. Thankfully, my mother has an illustrated version of this she let me take a gander at. When you tie both Carroll's wildly imaginative themes and Tenniel's beautifully constructed pictures you have a far more captivating and memorable experience.So, I feel partially unqualified to review this book since I didn't actually read it the WAY it was meant to be read.I will say that I felt the book definitely got off to a rocky start, for the repetitive nature of Alice's constant growing and shrinking became somewhat tiring to read. I also think that Disney's decision to fuse both \`Alice's Adventures in Wonderland' and \`Through the Looking Glass' together in their classic 1951 film was a stroke of genius, for they both truly complement one another and elevate the other. That, and it also made for a more involving and better paced film, for the events in \`Alice's Adventures in Wonderland' become a tad redundant, especially the dialog driven parts. I mean, I'm never one to say \\"the movie was better than the book\\" because, well, how often is that true, but some stories are better told on the screen and this is one of them. Reading this banter is far different than hearing it, and it doesn't quite read as effortlessly as I'd wanted it to.So, in the end I recommend the story (it's one that everyone should read) but don't do as I did and simply read the \`free' Kindle version. You really need to get an illustrated copy, for it makes all the difference."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"And I have to say there is no contest.The kindle version delivers all the words, but it's just not the same things without the illustrations.The illustrated version is an absolute masterpiece for all ages, absolutely entertaining....Despite the terrible terrible movie......"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"I saw the recently released movie Alice in Wonderland and that prompted me to read this book.

When I first read it I was a bit disappointed. But the Alice story persists. It's imagery pops up time and time again in other media, films, TV, video games, art. The Alice story is a lterary classic. Legendary even. Even people who haven't read a book in their life know at least something about it. They know many of the characters. Criticism of it is shocking, possible heretical.Meh. To me Alice In Wonderland is simply a nonsense story aimed at children. Nothing less, nothing more. Now, today the word \\"nonsense\\" has a perjotative ring to it, but back in the 19th century \\"nonsense\\" was pretty much a viable genre. But it's a short story, with little plot, no particular likeable characters, and filled with some of the most annoying literary creations ever. As some have said the events in the book are mostly non sequiturs, just seemingly random encounters that Alice has. It's written in rather sedate prose too, with little description of what Wonderland is actually like. In fact more information on the nature of Wonderland can be gleaned from the atmospheric illustrations by John Tenniel.I think Alice in Wonderland has survived through the years precisely because of it's vagueness and ambiguousness. People will read into what they want. It has provoked philosophical, moral, social and mathematical speculation. But I don't think there are any real hidden meanings or metaphors behind it all. It's an almost blank canvas for people to project their theories and speculations on what Wonderland is supposed to be. Something like a Jackson Pollock painting for the Victorian Age.

It is so much fun to read.Mr. Carroll was well acquainted with three young sisters. The middle one (who was his favorite) was named Alice. Once, on a summer picnic, he told the girls a story he had made up about Alice. They loved it so much that he made a book out of it and got it published. The illustrator he worked with was very accommodative, and he made the pictures exactly to Mr. Carroll's liking. The real Alice had short, dark hair, unlike the original illustrations. (Robert Ingpen takes some liberties on his version, but I am IN LOVE with his dreamy illustrations). As is stated in the first chapter, \\"What is the use of a book...without pictures or conversations?\\"I love the attention to detail in this book, such as a little cup of orange juice on a bookshelf.Alice herself is a wonderful character; she is confident, but humble enough to admit that she makes mistakes. At one point she [SPOILER WARNING!] relates to another character how she enjoys playing croquet with herself, and when she cheats, she will scold herself most harshly so as to bring tears to her eyes! She is also amazingly smart, especially for being only about seven. (She states her age in \\"Through the Looking Glass\\".)I would recomend this book for ages twelve and up. It just won't be enjoyable for younger ages. I tried reading it to my 9-year-old sister (who has been complimented by many people on her amazing vocabulary) and she didn't get the humor.

Non only is his English accent comforting and accessible to American ears, he speaks with an ageless authority that instills both comfort and wonder. I can't imagine a better performance! There is something straightforward and comforting about the simple surrealism of Alice.Listeners of any age will revel in Lewis Caroll's book that defined the genre of children's science fiction. Forget the Disney knock offs - Caroll's original words are as entertaining as they were when first written, and his magical realism still delights beyond the wildest dreams of the most talented modern day writers."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"This is one of the best Alice books I've seen in recent years.

If you haven't read Alice for a very long time, read this, dream about the little girl, pretend you are along the trip with her. Forget you're an adult for 2 hours."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was originally written in 1865 and has since been translated into 125 languages. There have now been over a hundred editions of the book, as well as countless adaptations in other media, including theater and film. If you haven't already done so, isn't it time to introduce this masterpiece to your children?This edition is particularly enjoyable because it is presented like a large picture book, making it a great choice for a large range of ages. Sized at 9\\" x 12\\", beautiful illustrations by Oleg Lipchenko sprawl across every page, bringing the story to life. Broken up into twelve chapters, this is the perfect bedtime book. There is ample adventure and colorful characters afoot to keep children breathless and anxious for the next night's chapter.I think I was first introduced to Alice by the 1951 Disney cartoon. Like most book to movie adaptations, reading the story is so much better. Reading the book allows you to process Carroll's original text and allow your imagination to develop the characters, which makes the story uniquely yours. Here, Lipchenko's illustrations will act as a starting block, but they don't fully create the memory for you, like a movie will do.There is a reason Lewis Caroll's writing is considered a classic - it really does transcend the years. I'm so pleased that Tundra Books is offering this updated edition, so that I may introduce a whole new generation to Alice's adventures via a gorgeous book. I must point out that Oleg Lipchenko's illustrations plus Lewis Carroll's original text serves to make this a spectacular gift choice. Grab a copy and invite your own children to join the tea party and take their chances with the Mad Hatter, the March Hare and the demanding Queen of Hearts!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"AAW rating: 5Lewis Carroll rating: 5It appears that most of these reviews are reviewing the original book and raving about the illustrations and how wonderful the story is. However, this version does not have illustrations and its formatting is not good for the Kindle. On the plus side, this version has the text correct. I gave it a 1 to counter what I feel are misplaced 5s.

Go ahead and watch it. I'll wait :-)Awesome, right!? I'm a complete sucker for nice clothbound books, and I love contemporary art, so getting this really was a no-brainer.The illustrations are amazing and they compliment the story perfectly, transporting adults into an imaginary world that's rarely available to those over two feet tall. For a story that's been visually adapted time and again by Western illustrators and filmmakers, it's refreshing to have a completely re-imagined view of Alice's adventures by this wonderful Japanese artist. In fact, the one problem I had while reading the book was trying to forget the movie adaptations I'd seen (particularly the Disney one) and instead allow myself to imagine it with fresh eyes. It took a little while, but I love the new vision that Kusama took me on through that timeless rabbit hole.In regards to the story itself, I was so impressed with how cleaver and imaginative Carroll is. None of the movies really do the story justice. I'm pretty sure that Carroll must have at least been an amateur linguist because of all the ways he plays with the language. Actually, thanks to my former life as a linguistics major, I got so much more out of reading this than I probably would have otherwise. While this is undoubtedly a children's book, this is a story for all ages.Whether you're a kid or an adult, this is a fantastic edition of a classic story. Rarely does a book make me laugh out loud, but Alice's adventure in Wonderland did just that - page after page.

Out of the many editions of Alice in Wonderland, I would recommend Alice's Adventures in Wonderland illustrated by Helen Oxenbury. Helen Oxenbury is a talented illustrator who won England's Kate Greenaway Medal for illustrators. She draws Alice like a modern girl very different from Disney's Alice with neat hair, an apron, and the poofy dress. Some of the pictures are coloured and some are not. This is the unabridged story with a bigger font than the others which is good for reading because alot of other novels have very small writing which is hard to read.This book would be awesome for Christmas, Hannukah and Easter presents or just a present for your family and maybe for yourself because it is paperback. However, it has thicker paper than the fragile pages in other paperback novels.You might get anothe edition of Alice in Wonderland because you think you're not going to read it again after you finish, but if you get this version, then you will want to read it again and again after you finish.Written by Jenny"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"I am rereading this classic on my Kindle and was happily surprised to find that it included beautiful illustrations.

The word structure and usage even reads, and in some cases looks, like a dream.

I had an assignment in school to read the book of \\" Alice in Wonderland\\". At first I didn't wanted to read it cause i had seen the movie. Later on that day i read the first sentence of the book. It was different from the movie. For example, in chapter one it says Alice was in her sister's bookstore and in the movie it showed she was outside studying. The other example, in the book it seemed she was taking forever falling in the hole and the movie she fall and then landed. So I kept on reading it and in my mind, it wasn't picturing how it is in the movie. I got into more and more each day.There were some big words I won't say or understand.

I read part of it when I was younger but it confused me too much so when I saw it on Amazon, I decided to give it a second chance. Lewis Carroll does a great job of displaying curiosity and the unknown adventures in a child's dream world.

It is down-to-earth enough for younger kids to enjoy, but is also full of logical jokes and play-on-words that adults can crack a smile from. After lazing off during her lessons, Alice is distracted by the peculiar sight of a white rabbit with a waist coat. She follows him down his rabbit hole, and finds herself in Wonderland, a place full of strange characters and substantial anomalies. During her adventures in Wonderland, Alice encounters all sorts of talking animals and seemingly illogical scenarios. The rationalization in Wonderland is slightly skewed, and Alice often finds herself adhering to their strange rules after hearing their unexpected but relevant justification. For example, after getting wet swimming in a pool of her own tears, Alice suggests that she and the group she's with dry off. Her acquaintance, the mouse, proceeds to recite the 'driest' thing he knows.Among other things, Alice meets a hookah-smoking caterpillar, a duchess and her cook (who is perpetually peppering soup,) a mock turtle, a deck of cards, a Cheshire cat, and 'her majesty,' the Queen of Hearts, who is always threatening to behead her subjects but never following through. My favorite aspect of the book was Carroll's witty insights to the way we perceive reality. The story made me question the world we live in, and why things that are considered 'custom' are so widely accepted, How did we even come to decide what qualifies as normal or abnormal anyway?Alice's Adventure in Wonderland was such a breath of fresh air as a book from a child's perspective, and I give it five stars because it was not only thought provoking, but funny and entertaining as well."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"\\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" is one of the most beloved children's classics.

It inspired me and I used to play out the story with my dolls and dad's playing cards - such fun to be had and all because of Alice in Wonderland! Alice's character is an inspiration to young and old alike - a young girl who says what she thinks and challenges authority, precocious, open-minded, and possessed of an admirable courage in the face of strange and frightening events. It is a story that appealed to me as a child and at a deeper level as an adult appreciative of the wordplay and rich symbolism contained within.As an adult who has read the illustrated versions, the Kindle title is a bonus that I can store and read at my convenience. But I would definitely prefer the illustrated version when reading to my 5-year-old child.

Wonderful and satisfying rendering for children and adults."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"Almost everyone knows the classic tale of Alice in Wonderland. They've either read the book or seen the movies but none of the former publications quite bring Lewis Carroll's story to life like Camille Rose Garcia. The artwork in this story is fantastic! Every page pops and pertains to the scene being described in a nearly perfect fashion. After finishing this version I could not help wondering if I hadn't drifted off and visited wonderland myself.Now, obviously the art is one reason to purchase this book but let's not forget the story itself. Carroll pushes the boundaries of reality, leaving the reader as well as the characters themselves to wonder if what they have experienced is real.This is not your classic fairytale. There is a damsel in distress but she has to save herself. There are kings and queens but no princes to save the day. There is magic without spells and witches. There is life in everything from the animals to cards. There is chaos with a certain amount of order and a dose of fear.The story itself is imaginative and one of the reasons I enjoy books so much. Carroll reveals to us the magic of imagination. Garcia takes this imagination and brings it to life, making it perfect for people of all ages. You've seen Alice, but never quite like this.

I know 'Through the Looking Glass' did though. (Please comment if you know so I can edit review).The four star rating is for the actual story itself. It is timeless in a way, but it is short and somewhat bittersweet. I do believe that it is the better story than 'Through the Looking Glass'. In this fantastic story we follow Alice through some interesting adventures in Wonderland. We are introduced to an amazing cast of characters including the Knave of Hearts, the Queen of Hearts, the Duchess, the white rabbit, the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, the march hare, and several other wacky animals and other beings.I guess the bittersweet impression is because I enjoyed the characters, but they are typically brief. The Mad Hatter is a little more prominent in the story, as is the Duchess, the Knave, and the Queen; but I would have enjoyed more time with the Cheshire Cat and a few others. Also, Alice is quite petulant, and it does get a little old that she continually goes into her little asides and interrupts the stories. Still, some of her comments are quite funny.It's very good, a true and timeless classic. This is a great example of literary nonsense. It's not quite as silly as something like Candide, but more imaginative and fantastic in every way. The Kindle version is very good, and free.

I had only seen the movies of this tale, and thought there is no way this book could be better than all of these movies made over that last 100 years. This book exceeds every movie ever made form this book and will probably be better than every movie to come. The way Carroll portrays the characters in story you feel as if you are in the Wonderland as a bystander as it's all happening. It's a very vivid story that I will read to my kids one day.With this being the free kindle edition, it didn't come with the illustrations as other editions and that was fine with me.

It is always difficult to read a book when one dislikes the main character. I did finish it and it is a lovely ending.

Some books drag from the very beginning, but this children's story didn't. There were surprises from the start. This book is an all original example of using your imagination. Lewis Carrol was gifted enough to let his imagination go wild, and to write it down on paper. This book inspires me to write any sort of crazy thing that is worth writing. This book is about Alices adventures from the time she saw the peculiar White Rabbit with a waistcoat and watch. She meets thrilling but very arguementive creatures and charectors such as the caterpiller who smokes, the Duchess and her baby which turns into a pig, a Mock Turtle, a gryphon, and the most famous the Chesire cat and the Queen of Hearts.

Where Cheshire Cats are always grinning, and Hatter's have tea parties all the time.This is a wonderful, exciting, and magical adventure for all young readers, and don't think because you've seen the movie you know the whole story. The book is somewhat different than the movie, but just as enchanting."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"One of my favorites.

This is a wonderful book to share with our children. Just reading from her getting stuck in the Rabbit's house to the baby turning into a pig to the Mad Hatter and so on...it was remarkable.

Highly recommend it for anyone who has an imagination!!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"This is a must for \\"Alice\\" collectors of all ages.

My friend loved the book. Thanks."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"In the book Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll a young girl with the name of Alice travels to a distant land that seems altogether and quite possibly unreal to her. The book starts off with Alice in the park with her sister. She has nothing to do as her sister is reading so when Alice sees a talking white rabbit scampering by, she doesn't hesitate to follow it. Following the rabbit leads her to a world she could have never dreamed of. This book can take you to magical places you would have never dreamed of. Through the use of Carroll's thorough descriptions and dramatic elements this book is sure to take you on one wild ride. I thought that the book was very well written and very interesting. I could really imagine what the characters look like and feel how Alice would have felt. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes a good adventure and lots of twists along the way. This book is for children and adults alike. As long as you have an imagination and a great sense of adventure you are sure to love this great tale of a girl and how she found herself in an imaginary world."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"I collect Alice memorabilia and have massive sites on &lt;yahoo&gt; and &lt;photobox&gt;.And maybe I'm the only one who saw the uncanny resemblance between Alice In Wonderland and my favourite singer Virginia Astley. Even her middle name is ALICE.Her instrumental album &quot;FROM GARDENS WHERE WE FEEL SECURE&quot; is the perfect soundtrack to Alice and all the titles she used were appropriate:Summer Of Their Dreams,Out On The Lawn I lie in Bed,Its Too Hot To Sleep,Hiding In The Ha Ha,A Summer Long Since Past...the music is accompanied by Nature sounds and splashing oars. Her later songs had titles like Nothing Is What It Seems and Over The Edge Of The World,these especially fit into her version of Wonderland. Virginia Astley even LOOKS like the Rackham illustration of Alice and not only that but she lived with her family in the 70s at Moulsford,Oxfordshire,with the Thames outside the back door and only a few miles South of Alice Country.Virginia is,in fact,Alice in the Deanery garden,her latest song &quot;I Will Miss This Holy Garden&quot;"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"Most children these days are exposed to the magical adventures of Alice in Wonderland through cartoon movies, such as Disney's version, but very few are exposed to the exact literature, the book that made the cartoons, movies, and every other piece of merchandise on the market today happen. &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; is a complete children's classic. Unlike many children books of then and now, it makes you think, something we all, especially children, should do often if not done at least once a day. Not only is this book, which follows Alice through a magical world where the verdict comes after the sentence, tea parties are insane, and Mock Turtles sob continueously, a good fantasy story to keep young (and old) minds occupied, its also a good riddle and puzzle book. With constant interruption and riddles being said throughout the book by the 'mad' charactors, its a good book to read if you want something difficult to figure out or to wonder about. The author Lewis Carroll I've learned enjoyed complicated puzzles and intentionally included many in this piece of literature. &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; is definately a classic that must be read if not already read. It's a good book to settle down with and enjoy, for the young, and young at heart."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"Alice in Wonderland is a very exciting book.

Although a rather accurate depiction of Wonderland, it cannot compare to the book (plus it muddled things together, mixing Alice in Wonderland with things originally in Through the Looking Glass). I never really took much attention to this very strange movie, but one day decided to read the book.Enter Wonderland.Absolutely no plot, no direction, no point. Lot's of silly nonsense but in spite of, or maybe because of this, it is very enjoyable. You literally never know what's going to happen next. After reading this book, I realized just how much my own dreams... Unforgettable characters, who can ever forget the cheshire cat or the caterpillar, jokes, interesting supplementary drawings, and puns keep you on your toes.This is really not for kiddies. Sure they can read it and maybe even enjoy it, but cannot fully appreciate it. A masterpiece, a classic, but more importantly, an enjoyable experience.Don't forget to read Through the Looking Glass! Tweedle Dee &amp; Tweedle Dum, the Walrus and the Carpenter, and &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; don't pop up in Alice in Wonderland but Through the Looking Glass. Although &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; didn't appear in the movie, it's still a classic. Finally, an explanation of this ever-puzzling poem! And of course, &quot;I am the Walrus&quot; is one of my favorite all-time songs...One of those books that you can read over and over again and find something new each time. Definitely an essential. The most fun I have ever had with a book. If you've ever been cursed enough to watch the movie but never read the book, PLEASE READ THIS BOOK! (and for those of you who have read it, READ IT AGAIN! )"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"Charles Lutwidge Dodgson was born in 1832 and lectured Mathematics at Christ CHurch, Oxford, for 26 years. He was best known, however, as a author - writing under his pseudonym, Lewis Carroll. \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" - commonly referred to as \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" - was first published in 1865. Alice, of course, was based on a real person - Alice Liddell, whose father was the Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University and the Dean of Christ Church College.Sitting by a riverbank on a warm day with her sister - who has her nose buried in a book - Alice is bored beyond belief. So, when a fully-clothed, watch-carrying White Rabbit comes charging past, commenting how it's going to be late, she's obviously a little curious. Only a moment after the Rabbit had disappeared down a rabbit-hole, Alice herself jumped right in to find out what was happening. After a long trip down, she touches down in Wonderland...though, unfortunately, it doesn't take long for the Rabbit to get away. Still, she finds the key to a door leading off the hallway she's standing in...if only she were small enough to fit through it.I vaguely remember having read it as a kid, and I liked the Chesire Cat much more now than I did then. (I've always been a dog lover, but I may have felt honour-bound to dislike all *cats* as a kid. Still, Alice could have been a more discreet in bragging about her cat Dinah to a mouse and various birds...) My favourite characters, however, were the Mock Turtle and the Gryphon. A short and easily read book overall, and one that really doesn't take too long in getting through. (However, having read up a bit more about the book, there seems to have been a lot of parodies, in-jokes and hidden references written into the book - most of which were lost on me. It didn't stop me enjoying the book though)."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"I haven't yet bought this.

Also ever kids need to read it."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"Unfortunately, this free Kindle edition of \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" does not reproduce the original's stylistic usage of typography. A particularly glaring example is the Mouse's tale. In the original, this poem is rendered in a series of indented lines of dwindling point size, curling to and fro across the page in the shape of a mouse tail. In this free Kindle edition, the Mouse's tale is flattened into a single paragraph, not even indented like a poem. Furthermore, this edition leaves out the prefaratory poem entirely.Unpleasantly, this edition also uses ASCII typography throughout: \\"straight quotes\\" instead of curly quotes, em dashes rendered as a pair of hyphens (--), and so forth.Read this book in a better edition, like the far superiorThe Complete Alice in Wonderland (Kindle Master Editions), which unlike this edition, is complete, includes both Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass, illustrations (by Tenniel, Holliday, and Carroll), and annotations. (The Kindle Master Edition also does not reproduce the typographical tricks to render the Mouse's tale as a tail, though it does at least format it decently like a poem.)For a less portable version with full typographic fidelity, plus outstanding annotations explaining details of Victorian manners and culture parodied within the Alice books, I heartily recommendThe Annotated Alice: The Definitive Edition."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"While this is generally considered a &quot;children's book&quot;, Alice In Wonderland can only be fully appreciated by adults or teenagers. It contains so many private jokes, grammar puns, and other such stuff that a child would not understand it, really. I first read it when I was in first grade, a rather hard book really for first graders, and loved it incredibly. But rereading every year of my life since then (I am now fifteen) one finally can truly relish the great puns and imaginative ideas that Carroll (or Dodgson, his real name) placed within this extremely random book. Yes, there really isn't much of a single plot. It jumps from place to place. Just like a real dream. I don't understand why some people think that this is &quot;scary&quot; for little children though. C'mon, the Wizard of Oz and Mother Goose Nursery Rhymes (when the bough breaks, the cradle will fall- if little children aren't afraid of THAT, I don't what would scare them) is more frightening than this beautifully-crafted story. Note that the Queen of Hearts, though she has an insatiable urge to decapitate every person she sees, never really kills anyone- the Griffin says so. It's not frightening, rather, it's full of what little children like- randomness, smiling cats, violent-tempered queens, talking rabbits, and imaginary animals. If one is discovering this book for the first time, let it enchant you. If you are re-discovering this book, find in it the things you couldn't find before. If you are simply re-reading it for the fiftieth time (like me), then enjoy every single moment of it. It really is one of the best books I have read, right up there with- dare I say it- Colour Purple and Les Miserables. Yes, even Les Miserables."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is an unabridged audiobook production of Lewis Carroll's classic children's storybook of a young girl lost in a magical land of fantasy.

Highly recommended as a giftbook to listeners of all ages, as well as for public library audiobook collections. 3 CDs, 2 hours 57 minutes."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"The book is delightful, but I'm not talking about the story of Lewis Carrol itself. I'm talking, literally about the book -- its size, texture of pages, color of endpapers, texture of dustcover, that it has a built-in silky bookmark and so on. (This is one book in which it is the right thing to do to judge a book by its cover.) I'm also referring to the extra material, though. First are the illustrations which are really cool. Then there is plenty of commentary on the illustrations. There is also commentary on the Author, Illustrator, Foreward writer and even commentary on the typography of the book. Finally, the Foreward is amazing. I don't know if I agree with all that the Foreward writer says, but that Foreward sure helps to build your vocabulary. I've had six philosophy courses and I still had to look up dozens of words in the Foreward. Really advanced, arcane or even never-heard-of words -- why?, beats me. You would need a Ph.D. in literature to know all the words without a dictionary. So whether you're an adult wanting to increase your vocabulary or you want to buy a nice little book that is a delight itself in its physical being as a book, this is the Alice to buy."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"Young Alice has never been a patient child. Therefore, as she is sitting along the riverbank, listening to her sister drone on and on as she reads passages from a slightly boring book, Alice begins to find her mind wandering. After all, this particular book has no pictures to capture the eye. Alice begins thinking about doing something else, making a daisy chain, or climbing a tree, but she's too lazy to leave her comfortable spot. So, as she gazes about her, she finds herself drifting off to sleep, and soon she has spotted a White Rabbit dressed in fancy garb. She begins chasing the elusive rabbit, but quickly finds herself falling down a very deep rabbit hole that she had not seen previously. Alice is frightened as she tumbles down and down, but soon finds herself in a new world. A world not filled with dirt and daisies, but, rather filled with long hallways, and houses that are smaller than Alice herself. Soon, Alice begins encountering characters of all shapes and sizes. To the confusing Tweedle-Dee and Tweedle-Dum, to the riddle-loving, smiling kitty known as the Cheshire Cat; all the way to the delightfully zany Mad Hatter who loves throwing tea-parties, and the vicious Queen of Hearts. But, as Alice continues wandering through this wondrous world of magic, where animals talk and dance, and even dress in fancy clothes, she begins to wonder how on earth she will ever find a way out of this backwards environment, and back to her sister, sitting upon the riverbank. For even though lazing about on the riverbank can be incredibly boring, sometimes it is preferred when your life is in danger by an evil ruler.I do not have to tell you how much I adore the tale of ALICE IN WONDERLAND. Since I was a young child I have been enamored by Alice's adventures to Wonderland, where she met an array of lovable characters who made you question the sanity of this backwards place, and the people who reside there. From the film to the pop-up books, and everything in between - Alice has been something I have cherished. Therefore, when I stumbled upon Alison Jay's newest edition of ALICE IN WONDERLAND, I could not pass up the opportunity to call it my own. The perfect thing about this edition is that the font is quite large, which makes it easier for younger readers to enjoy the tales of Alice on their own. The second thing I adore about this edition, of course, are the illustrations. Alison Jay is a magnificent artist who has laced almost every page with full-color illustrations of Alice and the various people and things she encounters during her trip to Wonderland. From the intelligent Caterpillar, to the delicious pink-frosting covered cupcakes she shares with the Mad Hatter at his tea party; and the delightful, yet strange game of flamingo and hedgehog croquet played with the Queen of Hearts, to Alice's trial with the Gryphon and the Mock Turtle. Each and every illustration is enjoyable to look at, and truly brings Lewis Carroll's words to life. A colorful new ALICE IN WONDERLAND edition, that puts a new spin on the timeless tale.Erika Sorocco"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"This is my preferred copy of AAIW, and I have several. The quality of the illustrations is superior, because they were made from recently excavated printing blocks.

The free Kindle edition is a VERY POOR choice. I sampled many Alice in Wonderland and all the Through the Looking Glass books I could find available (at Amazon and Gutenberg org - though today I discover some I missed). I believe I found that the best available editions, if you want both, are:The BLTC at 1.79Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (BLTC Press Edition)- this edition is very well formatted with all the Tenniel illustrations that I recall and is the one I purchased myself.The Bompacrazy at .99Alice in Wonderland (Illustrated)orAlice's Adventures in Wonderland (Illustrated)(these two appear to be exactly the same from the samples as both have the 'blotted out' picture of the Drink Me tag): this is almost as good a choice, though not quite as well formatted. The sample has a Rackham illustration (and there may be more) as well as the many Tenniel, though, which is a plus.The free Gutenberg org versions - lacked the improved linking and formatting, but there are various illustrated editions; may be worth it to you if .99 is too much or you are looking for something other than Tenniel.I did see a kindle version of an 'Original First Edition' Alice which appears to be illustrated by Arthur Rackham - in case you are looking for that one instead of the better known John Tenniel version.Alice In Wonderland - Original First Edition Version Published For Kindle - Lewis CarrollThat edition has no Tenniel illustrations in the sample; also the text seems to be abridged (or just maybe an earlier version?) and the formatting is poor. Note that the picture of Alice looking at the Cheshire Cat in a tree that appears on this linked product page is not the cover that appears on the downloaded sample; the cover that does appear is of Alice walking with the Duchess and looks like this kindle book:Alice's Adventures in Wonderland & Through the Looking Glass- now for more typical Amazon mis-linked craziness, this latter edition has Tenniel illustrations, but beware that they are very small thumbnails and enlarge to very poor quality. I do not recommend either of these editions. The Rackham is available at Gutenberg for free.Today I discovered the Master EditionThe Complete Alice in Wonderland (Kindle Master Editions)which I missed before (likely because I was concentrating on Through the Looking Glass, which has far fewer editions, and then pursuing the 'matching' Alice in Wonderlands). Today the price is .89 and I am going to buy it. It is at least as well formatted as the BLTC (based on the sample) and has even more Alice writings (beyond Wonderland and Looking Glass) as well as essays and historical info and other 'add-ons'. He has all the illustrations from Tenniel and additional ones from Holliday and Carroll (I think he should add Rackham's, too).As many others have said, the basic Kindle edition is a very poor choice, and most others also lack the illustrations. Thank goodness for samples.Re Through the Looking Glass, it was the chess board appearing in the BLTC sample (and not in the BompaCrazy sample) that finalized my choice in their favor (before finding the Master). Here are the BLTC and BompaCrazy links:Through the Looking Glass- BLTCThrough the Looking Glass (Illustrated)- BompaCrazyI hope this review helps you find your best choice far more quickly than I did."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"While the tale is the same as all other volumes of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, the illustrations by Yayoi Kusama make it unusual and more beautiful than can be imagined.

The Kindle edition however is a different matter. There are NO ILLUSTRATIONS as in the hardcopy versions of this book.

First of all this classic is beautifully presented here. Good paper, good print always add to the pleasure of reading.

As a child for the wonder and adventure of it all. Later, for insight into human nature including our own. I suggest we read Alice every 5 years, not that I ever did, but I wish I had.As we age, or mature if we are lucky, we glean important insights we might have missed as children.

Or do we?This is definitely not Disney's Alice in Wonderland or Tim Burton's wickedly awesome version of the tale. This is it... the real deal.I've been meaning to read Alice's Adventures in Wonderland for a few years now (you'd think I would've read it as a child, but nope, back then I was into Stephen King haha) and I chose this edition in particular because I fell in love with Camille Rose Garcia's illustrations. With it's fun-shaped narratives and two-page, colorful layouts scattered throughout. Originally I thought it was a shorter version of the novel, but to my joy and delight, it was the full story, so this is definitely one that I'm showcasing in my bookshelf at the moment.As for the story, well, it's complete nonsense of course, but that's the great thing about it. There are talking cats who disappear all but their grin. There are sneezing babies that turn into pigs. There are mock turtles, dodobirds, gryphons and hookah-smoking caterpillars. There is painting the roses red, a queen who won't think twice before yelling \\"off with his/her head\\", there are dormouse's with sleeping disorders who hang with nutty hatters and crazy hares. Oh, and did I mention Alice's problem with height... yea, the poor girl.Jibberish I tell you. But that's the fun of it. I would call it an organized mess. There really is no rhyme or reason to it, and that's exactly what makes it such a delight to read. Very imaginative, colorful and amusing - and I personally could not help feeling \\"curiouser and curiouser\\". I read it rather quickly too, as it's not very long.All in all, this was a very peculiar read, one that I can say is fun, whimsical and a classic that should be read at least once in your life.And one last thing, does anyone actually know:Why IS a raven like a writing desk?!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"Lewis Carroll's story of the young girl Alice who chases a rabbit down a hole and discovers a completely new, beautiful, surreal, yet, dangerous world is a tale beloved by both children and adults. There are countless editions of the story available. This one is published by Templar Books and is illustrated by Rodney Matthews. The book comes in a wonderful hardcover slipcase. The illustrations that accompany the story are quite lavish and capture both the absurdity and fright that is an intricate part of Wonderland. The book includes at least one or two full-color, full-page illustrations for ever chapter as well as smaller, black-and-white illustrations of a quarter-page or less about every other page. Very young children (probably 4 and under) might not enjoy this particular edition of the story because there aren't enough \\"pictures\\". However, it is an ideal book for slightly older children as well as an edition to read to younger children. This isn't the best illustrated version of the Carroll's story, but it's not too shabby either."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"With the introduction of Tim Burton's new movie, there is brand new interest in Lewis Carroll's 140 year old dream trip down a rabbit hole. My first choice for an edition of the book (in print) is, most definitely, this volume. It is remarkably illustrated by Camille Rose Garcia. Her wonderful painted illustrations imagine a troubled, hurting universe of the noteworthy characters - the Red Queen, the Dodo Bird, the caterpillar with the hookah.... Her surreal approach to art is unforgettable...rather like the explosion of emotions in first glimpsing Picasso's \\"Les Demoiselles D'Avignon\\", the floating portraits of Chagall, or the folded clocks of Dali. Put in another way, the art in this volume of \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" stays in your mind for a very long time. And because of that, the writing of Lewis Carroll does too.My second choice is the edition illustrated by the unbelievably talented black and white photographer - Abelardo Morell.Many will recommend the \\"Annotated Alice\\" [or even the \\"Annotated Hunting of the Snark\\"] but I think that's not the first way to experience Lewis Carroll. Second time around...yes...but \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" should be heard or read without footnotes, so that each person can interpret it individually and creatively.As for an audiobook, there is a very fine reading by Jim Dale, famous for his versions of 'Harry Potter.' Personally, I prefer the splendidly wicked audio version by Joan Greenwood ...but, alas, this is only available in cassette tape.Those who have never read the unabridged \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" will find it mind-bending...like first hearing Einstein's theory of relativity. No cheating allowed. The masterpiece has never been successfully translated into film. So, if you fail to experience it in the original, \\"off with your head.\\""},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"I went though this book so fast I used it for a school protect for 6th grade I loved this book"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"I really love Alice in Wonderland - it's wonderful!

It's not just the original illustrations that are so wonderful, but even the original typeface, dustcovers, and embossed boards. The whole nine yards.

In \\"Wonderland\\", Lewis Carroll questions everything about life that is normal, and gives us a picture of a world where everything that we accept as normal is turned upside down. With Alice, you'll fall into a rabbit hole and enter an imaginary and wacky world where nothing is at it seems. Here's a small taste:\\"By-the-bye, what became of the baby?\\" said the Cat. \\"I'd nearly forgotten to ask.\\"\\"It turned into a pig,' Alice answered very quietly, just as if the Cat had come back in a natural way.\\"I thought it would,\\" said the Cat, and vanished again.And another quote:\\"...they drew all manner of things - everything that begins with an M -\\"\\"Why with an M?\\" said Alice.\\"Why not?\\" said the March Hare.If you find this kind of maddening surreal world even remotely attractive, then you're sure to love Alice's \\"Wonderland\\". You'll be amazed by the cat-less grin of the Cheshire-Cat, amused by the absurd logic of the mad Hatter, and in hysterics over the antics of the murderous Queen of Hearts with her constant refrain of \\"Off with his head.\\" \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" is full to the brim with wild humour, farcical fantasy, witty wisecracks, and slapstick comedy. What I especially enjoyed were the abundance of delightful puns, paradoxes, and parodies. Much of the deeper significance will escape young children, but they will enjoy it as a fantastic story, and rediscover it with even greater pleasure as adults. A \\"classic\\" is a book that appeals to people of all times and ages, and that's certainly the case with \\"Alice in Wonderland.\\"Is \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" all nonsense? I don't think so. Behind the outer layer of nonsense Carroll conveys a great deal of sense. He allows you to return to reality with a renewed appreciation for everything that is normal and accepted. Yet this fantasy world is at the same time so nonsensical and enjoyable, that you'll want to return there many a time.

Of course she was chasing the white rabbit in the waistcoat. The world she fell into was a wonderland of non-sense. I found no mention of the twin boys that have graced many of the other tales and movies about wonderland which I was sort of disappointed about. I did find one part that has largely been omitted from recent works. It was when Alice made her way to the Duchesses house. A frog in a uniform, which was an oddity to Alice in its self, guarded the home but she ventured further and found upon entry into the Duchesses house it was filled to the brim with pepper. The cook of the house was randomly throwing pots and pans at everything and everyone. Curiously the Duchess sat in the middle of the violent cook and the cloud of pepper nursing a baby that she thrust to Alice to care for. Funny part was when Alice gazed at the baby at first she could not decided if it was a human baby or a pig. She abruptly decided it was a pig and let it run off into the woods while she continued on her adventure.

Readers will truly enjoy the ridiculous solutions that Alice uses to some of the most trivial of problems, such as shrinking to get pass through a miniscule door.

At the bottom, she finds herself in a room with a tiny door and a bottle labeled \\"drink me.\\" She grows and shrinks depending on what she eats and drinks, and as a small version of herself, finds herself swimming in a pool of tears. Swimming to shore, Alice and some other creatures decide that \\"'the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race'\\" (26). Alice continues to chase the White Rabbit and the White Rabbit sends her into his house for his fan and gloves. Once in the house, Alice gets into more trouble with an unlabeled bottle, quickly growing too big to move. The White Rabbit and Bill the Lizard try to get her out, and Alice only escapes by eating some small cakes. She runs into the woods and meets a hookah-smoking Caterpillar, who gives her some advice on ways to grow bigger and smaller. Next, she stops at the house of the Duchess with a pig for a baby; the pig escapes, and Alice asks the Cheshire Cat for help. Directed on to the March Hare's house, Alice takes part in the Mad Tea Party, perhaps the most famous scene in the book. Alice moves on to the Queen's croquet ground, where she encounters the Queen of Hearts and tries to play croquet with a flamingo and a hedgehog. Next, Alice encounters a Mock Turtle and a Gryphon, who tell her the story of the lobster quadrille. The book closes with a trial on the case of the stolen tarts, as the Queen accuses the Knave of Hearts. Alice is accused also, and she scatters the attacking cards, only to find herself awake on the river bank where the book began."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"Alice in Wonderland is a great book that I truly enjoyed.

Then the remake or second part of the story with the extraordinary Jonny Depp. But nothing of these great pieces you can find in this book.The only good thing in this book is the crazy story, about a girl in her wonderland with the insane inhabitants.It was a dull writing. Sentences like \\"He said... Then she said... Then he said...\\" will make you lazy. There is no heart in the story... just a pure and clean describing of the chapters of this story. But what makes a book a good book? It's the describtion of all the surroundings, like how the weather was, what temper the figures have, all the nonrelevant things you want to know.

Lewis on cheap drugs. The events are complete non sequiturs and the changes in plot are worse.It appears to be a spoiled child wandering in a world she does not understand, nor is willing to learn about - unlike Lucy in The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe who seeks to understand the local customs and circumstances.The book is very easy to read but it leaves distaste in my literary mouth.

It's one of the most famous line from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and I think it pretty accurately sums up the entirety of the book. I traveled through wonderland and came out feeling a tad conflicted over this book. On the one hand, I fully acknowledge that Lewis Carroll developed a truly awesome story. I can't even imagine how shocking this book was when it was first published in 1865!! On the other hand, I spent much of the book feeling like I was missing out on some kind of drug-fueled inside joke.There were times when I literally had to read the same sentence 5 times because I just had no clue what he was talking about (and re-reading usually resulted in me being even more confused than after the first read through). To be fair, I know that after writing this book, Lewis Caroll spent countless hours with an artist trying to perfectly capture the essence of Wonderland. Unfortunately, the Kindle version didn't include these pictures, which I think would have clarified some of what Carroll was trying to convey through his mad mad words."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"Ordered for my kindle and it is an awesome book to have.

It was not for my daughter.

This book was not cut for her."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"Okay, I admit to reading this after playing Alice: Madness Returns. I was in the mood for some classic literature too!Having never read this, I didn't know what to expect. Rather than having a cohesive story with a beginning, middle and end, like the nature of the writing, things are a little bit...bizarre. We have a collection of scenes which Alive stumbles her way through with (let's face it) atrocious intro and conclusion tacked on. These are so brief (a few paragraphs) that do nothing. In fact, I know this is an older story, but the ending is awful. Maybe it hadn't been done to death in Carroll's day?Despite my contemporary complaints, I actually feel the story would be better off without the intro and conclusion, and be left as a collection of very strange conversations.Okay, there are dialogue heavy with some great images and everything is twisted and fired back and forth, but even this gets a bit...repetitive. It's easy to see why the tea party scene is so famous however, as the writing and humour here is superb. Though I have problems with this, I can recommend the book for this scene alone!In summary, it was good to read something a bit different and the language is approachable and it's all very, very silly. Good to dip into. Just ignore the after-thought ending."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"Having read it when I was four it is getting more boring as I get older!

No, I'm not talking about that 'new movie that just came out last year', I'm talking about the original book, which follows a completely different storyline. This book keeps you (and the main character, of course) in curiosity from Alice's fall 'down the rabbit hole', her meeting with the Duchess and Cheshire Cat, to the twisted crouquet game with the queen. Through this story, Alice struggled to keep her mind straight in the many places where reality curved. In the end, however, she learned that only constant fear can keep you a-maze, as she ecaped Wonderland."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"a wonderful classic must read for any fan of stories, one of the finest masterpieces to date. if you can challenge this please let me know"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"It shipped in just around the time I was expecting it to.

It was then that I opened my copy of \\"Alice's Adventures...\\" and dove once again down the rabbit hole. I even played Alice in a play when I was a young teen and it stands out as one of my most cherished memories.Alice is everything that I think a young girl wants to be - adventurous, clever, compassionate and even a bit funny. She is wonderful.Many editions of the book have been published over the years, and the Kindle one lacks the illustrations of some other versions. That was not a detriment to me, as I loved to imagine Alice and her adventures when I was a child. I know there are some gorgeous illustrations out there and perhaps the Kindle version can include them, but the lack of illustrations should not stop anyone from reading this book - for teh first time, or the thousandth."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"You cannot go by stars alone really on things like books. Especially books like Alice in Wonderland. There are people out there,(ahem see the three star reviewer) that have no imagination. This story is just a silly bit of imagined nonsense covering up deeper meanings. Anyone apposed to nonsense, or those who cannot read \\"between the lines\\" need not apply. :D cheers"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"Long time ago, I should have read this story as a child, but I don't remember how come I didn't, but I don't remember either how I came to know Alice so intimately, as if this was a legend that had leaked out to me and never to be forgotten. No doubt, this is one hell of a legend.The title itself belies it to be just a fantastical childhood tale but it is actually a book that will get adults curiouser and curiouser until all the puns that are intended to taunt the deluded adult world will boil down to giving you a crazy smile. I swear by a mouse's tail- this Alice book is charming, and so full of funny, far-out characters. I cant resist being crazy with the mad tea-party, and the wacky game-story of cards and chess, of the chesire cat, and of course, Alice who is smart, proud and always snappy. Although my favorite of all is the wise caterpillar who smokes a hookah and sits on a mushroom.Alice in Wonderland is actually a story of growing up, or more like a child's discovery of wisdom, or maybe an exploration of wisdom in a child's perspective. The setting of cards and chess is an allegory of the world of chance and determinism, and the pervasive foreshadowing of death seems silly but anyway childish. Sometimes I don't understand why the book is one of the most quoted. Perhaps because aside from being popular, I am sure this tale really brings out the child in anyone.Lewis Carroll might have only told this story to put a loquacious girl in silence but fortunately, he has not made a very simple fantasy. He has invented an Alice in a lot of us."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"I love this book so much,I couldn't wait to get Through The Looking Glass.I like this book,because of the adventures such as:Going down the rabbit-hole,using the key,being ordered by animals,meeting the Cheshire Cat,and meeting the Queen of Hearts.Buy it,now!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"Lewis Carroll tells us a fantatic tale of a little girl who is caught in a satircal world, filled with paridy and weirdness.

At first it may seem simple and non moralistic but after you read it over more than once you can see what Carrol was trying to say and how it reflects his life.

Because it's unsual, quirky and comical it's fun to read and hard to put down. I'd recommend it to people of all ages."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"My 16 year old son asked me to get this book for him from the local library; (I think he saw the cartoon).

But, sadly, the illustrations for &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; don't offer the same interesting take on classic characters. Her version of &quot;Alice&quot; gives us the most depressed looking Alice I've ever seen. She appears to be almost drugged, and not at all the curious and engaging little girl we know. While Lisbeth Zwerger is known for sparse illustrations, here they seem almost barren at times. Her version of the Caterpillar for instance takes an almost sacrilegious liberty of giving us a modern seeming caterpillar smoking a cigarette instead of the traditional, more exotic hookah. Her artistic vision here offers us a scene more mudane than surreal. Perhaps, the artist is illustrating too many books, since this effort doesn't seem to me to be a fully realised one. I recently purchased &quot;Aice in Wonderland&quot; illustrated by Angel Dominguez (Artisan, 1996) and that's far and away a much better version. I would say buy this book only if you're looking for another &quot;Alice&quot; book for your collection. I just don't feel it's a standout addition."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"I bought this book for my daughter. This quality of this book tells you that it is meant to be a keepsake. It is very well printed on high-quality paper, beautifully bound, and comes with a hard slipcover. The illustrations are amazing, but I found their style to be a bit dark for my 7-year old. The book is very text heavy, making it cumbersome to read aloud to a child, and a lot of the prose itself is on an adult level.

There are many full page illustrations that are simply amazing to look at. With a detailed style that occasionally reminds me of Graeme Base, he populates &quot;Wonderland&quot; with all sorts of exotic birds and animals, some of which aren't usually included in illustrated versions of Alice, such as anteaters, platypuses, hippos, etc. But they lend an air of strangeness to this imaginary world that nonetheless seems to be appropriate. The artist has included a number of unique touches to the world of Alice, and they all fit in wonderfully with the spirit of the book.

If you've never read it, it's a must-read!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is for most children pure pleasure. While adults try to decipher Lewis Carroll's codes in the text, or debate this or that, young readers simply dive with Alice through the rabbit hole, pursuing \\"The dream-child moving through a land / Of wonders wild and new.\\"There they encounter the White Rabbit, the Queen of Hearts, the Mock Turtle, and the Mad Hatter, among a multitude of other characters, my preferred is the Cat! - fantastical and totally normal creatures. Alice journeys through this Wonderland, trying to fathom the meaning of her strange experiences.For more than 130 years, children love the delightfully non-moralistic, non-sense, nopn-educational virtues of this classic. In fact, at every turn, Alice's new companions scoff at her traditional education.Carroll believed John Tenniel's illustrations were as important as his text. Naturally, Carroll's instincts were good; the masterful drawings are almost as important as the well-loved story.And for 0,00 Pounds, Dollars, Euros to pay - what can You lose?It is a whole win-win situation!Grab, people, grab!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"Point: Dreams can be life-like and life can be dream-like.Path: Originally told as a children's story while rowing on the Isis river, this story was eventually written down and published. Carroll follows an inquisitive Alice down rabbit burrows, through animal homes, flamingo croquet games, under disappearing cats, and back home again.Sources: Many have suggested ideas for possible illusions and references in this work. The most likely is that Carroll was imagining what a dream would be like in real life.Agreement: I enjoyed the musings following the book more than the book itself. While reading it everything seemed so disjointed and combobulated - which is exactly the point. After completing the book I found myself pondering reality through through the eyes of a dream.Personal App: In a dream, extraordinary happenings make sense. Perhaps reality would be a little more exciting if I were to slow down and really think about what I take for granted. There is magic all around.Favorite Quote: \\"Alice looked at the jury-box and saw that, in her haste, she had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move.\\" Moving its tail in a melancholy way! That is funny.Note: It is worth it to pick up an edition with the original sketches."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"I just couldn't get enough of this book. I loved this book so well I can't give it enough stars. This story and its characters was so pure and simple I could imagine myself with Alice. It was humorous...sometimes I was laughing so hard I was crying. I enjoyed this book more than words can express. This book, everything about it, was beautiful, simply beautiful. The setting was so vivid and expressionfilled. The funniest parts were when Alice met the Queen of Hearts. The were playing crochet with living animals. Then there was the time Alice was talking with the Gryphon and the Turtle. The Turtle was obviously extremely erroneous concerning education. He was describing his school to Alice, and he said \\"history\\" was \\"mystery\\" and a lot of other twisted up tales. Then there was the Rabbit, March Hare, Hatter, and the Dormouse, who alone made up a curious group. The Dormouse apparently had problems with a sleeping disorder, as he could fall asleep standing up. Then there was the Duchess, who had a baby who resembled a pig, and the silly cook who threw everything within reach at the Duchess. Another odd character (all of Lewis Carroll's characters are odd) was the Chesire Cat, who could disappear just like that. There were many others, including a courtroom full of poor fools who toppled over when Alice made a sudden move, which I did not mention. The extra bossy Queen seemed to have a problem beheading anyone for the slightest offense, while the weak King pardoned them all behind her back. As it turned out, this whole story was all a strange dream which Alice had while she was resting outside with her big sister. Anyway, this was a wonderful book, and you should read it for yourself...one of the best books I've ever read, and yes, up till now. This book had a really great impression on me, and I found myself saddened to see myself coming to the end of it. I highly recommend this book to readers of all ages."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"Jim Dale could read a cookbook and it would be awesome. This audio rendition of Alice in Wonderland is well, wonderful :-)"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"Lewis Carroll's nearly 150 year old story has never gone out of print. It has been translated into over 120 languages, and there are over 100 different editions. This classic fairy-tale is deeply imbedded in both children and adults of the Western world.The young blonde protagonist was inspired by 10-year-old Alice Pleasance Liddell, who so loved Carroll's candid story about her that she persuaded him to write it down. He provided her with a copy that he illustrated himself called Alice's Adventures Underground. Soon after, he expanded the story adding the scenes with the Cheshire cat and the Mad Hatter. And with help from an incredible illustrator, John Tenniel, he published the first edition called Alice's Adventures in Wonderland in 1865.The book is very short. I read it on my iPhone Kindle app all in one sitting (I was on the bus for TWO hours because of Red Sox traffic). It jumps right into the story: On the first page, Alice is already falling down the giant hole where the Rabbit disappeared. Alice is a strange child and you get the impression that she often plays by herself and mostly lives in her head (perhaps she's an INFP?). She has very entertaining conversations with herself that the narrator handles beautifully:She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.The story is very similar to the Disney version that I grew up with. There were only a few minor things that Disney omitted and with good reason. For example, I could do without the completely absurd scene where a Gryphon and a Mock-Turtle tell Alice about the Lobster Quadrille.On a road trip to Colorado from Arkansas a few years ago, a friend of mine read about half of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland out loud to the rest of us in the car. The illustrations were awesome and......................the words..................................made patterns...................................................on the screen....................................................................like this.That's the way I suggest you read/hear this story.

Actually, Lewis Carroll was a very smart man. He invented Wonderland to show people truths in their own world most people wouldn't even bother thinking about. In fact, I think the whole point of the book is that even though Wonderland seems so unreal and full of nonsence, it's really just the same as our own world!

I'd recomend it to anyone!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"\\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" is a scrumptious new large-format imaging of a favorite classic for children. The text of the story is familiar and vivid, but the paintings and illustrations are like a forgotten dream of the original intentions of the Alice editions' illustrations.

He captures the sarcasm and word-play that Lewis Carroll weaved into the stories. For those who have heard his reading of the Harry Potter series, some of the voices will sound very familiar. I am listening to this in preparation for the new film version of Alice that is being released.I enjoy audiobooks generally because I can listen to them on the road, or while confined to a sick bed, or waiting for a plane and so on. Easy to carry many of them on an MP3 player rather than carrying several books. Jim Dale is an excellent reader that really captures the characters and feeling of the stories.

Specifically, I was looking for a book that would draw her into reading it with exceptional artwork and craftmanship. This is exactly what I got in this edition. One possible drawback is its size. It's a bit large for little hands and portability, but that is a small trade-off for this work of art. Also, the pages are thick so watch out for paper cuts!!! This edition is nice enough to display as an unusual conversation piece on a coffee table, or pass down to the next generation.The booklist reveiwer mentioned that the print was at times distracting, but I think he misses the point. It's meant to enhance the story. For instance, as one character falls the print spirals and gets smaller. It wasn't difficult to read and my daughter \\"got it\\" and thought it was fun!Bottom line is that if you are looking for an edtion of a beloved story that can be kept for years to come for your treasured daughter or that special neice, this is without question the one you are looking for!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"This is the cleanest and best formatted version of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland on the Kindle market.

I sampled many Alice in Wonderland and all the Through the Looking Glass books I could find available (at Amazon and Gutenberg org - though today I discover some I missed). I believe I found that the best available editions, if you want both, are:The BLTC at 1.79Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (BLTC Press Edition)- this edition is very well formatted with all the Tenniel illustrations that I recall and is the one I purchased myself.The Bompacrazy at .99Alice in Wonderland (Illustrated)orAlice's Adventures in Wonderland (Illustrated)(these two appear to be exactly the same from the samples as both have the 'blotted out' picture of the Drink Me tag): this is almost as good a choice, though not quite as well formatted. The sample has a Rackham illustration (and there may be more) as well as the many Tenniel, though, which is a plus.The free Gutenberg org versions - lacked the improved linking and formatting, but there are various illustrated editions; may be worth it to you if .99 is too much or you are looking for something other than Tenniel.I did see a kindle version of an 'Original First Edition' Alice which appears to be illustrated by Arthur Rackham - in case you are looking for that one instead of the better known John Tenniel version.Alice In Wonderland - Original First Edition Version Published For Kindle - Lewis CarrollThat edition has no Tenniel illustrations in the sample; also the text seems to be abridged (or just maybe an earlier version?) and the formatting is poor. Note that the picture of Alice looking at the Cheshire Cat in a tree that appears on this linked product page is not the cover that appears on the downloaded sample; the cover that does appear is of Alice walking with the Duchess and looks like this kindle book:Alice's Adventures in Wonderland & Through the Looking Glass- now for more typical Amazon mis-linked craziness, this latter edition has Tenniel illustrations, but beware that they are very small thumbnails and enlarge to very poor quality. I do not recommend either of these editions. The Rackham is available at Gutenberg for free.Today I discovered the Master EditionThe Complete Alice in Wonderland (Kindle Master Editions)which I missed before (likely because I was concentrating on Through the Looking Glass, which has far fewer editions, and then pursuing the 'matching' Alice in Wonderlands). Today the price is .89 and I am going to buy it. It is at least as well formatted as the BLTC (based on the sample) and has even more Alice writings (beyond Wonderland and Looking Glass) as well as essays and historical info and other 'add-ons'. He has all the illustrations from Tenniel and additional ones from Holliday and Carroll (I think he should add Rackham's, too).As many others have said, the basic Kindle edition is a very poor choice, and most others also lack the illustrations. Thank goodness for samples.Re Through the Looking Glass, it was the chess board appearing in the BLTC sample (and not in the BompaCrazy sample) that finalized my choice in their favor (before finding the Master). Here are the BLTC and BompaCrazy links:Through the Looking Glass- BLTCThrough the Looking Glass (Illustrated)- BompaCrazyI hope this review helps you find your best choice far more quickly than I did."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"Unlike other versions for the Kindle, this one has the illustrations and properly formatted poems and songs.

It has been adapted into numerous cartoons, films and plays over the years, and it has become an important backdrop of the World culture. It is a brilliant and zany fairy tale that remains fresh and engaging well over a century after it had been written. This is in large part thanks to the unforgettable and unique characters that are as famous (if not more) as Alice herself: the White Rabbit, the Cheshire Cat, the \\"Mad\\" Hatter, the Queen of Hearts and many more. They are among the most idiosyncratic characters in all of literature. However, the aspects of the book that I found the most fascinating were the clever use of language, the numerous puns, and the plays on the difference between the literal and actual meanings of different expressions and saying. It was very amusing to read these, and realize how clever and verbal this book actually is. The book made me reflect again on so many aspects of the world that I take for granted, and it made me feel like a child exploring and learning about various objects, ideas and relations for the first time.

A great book!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"Lewis Carroll is a great author for kids and he represents a completely new phase in children's literature. Children are children and they only have grown-up age in front of them as a limited world and a perspective, the latter of which they may change when they are grown up by remembering what childhood was for them and the tales they entertained when they were children in order to tell them to a new generation of children. Lewis Carroll leads Alice into a world where everyday objects and animals, but also strange objects and animals, mix. Everything is right and wrong at the same time. Too small or too big. Everything speaks and tells stories or sings songs that remind Alice of songs she knows but that come out strange and distorted. This whole world of wonderland is a suddenly animated pack of cards in a doll's house and doll's garden. But at the same time Lewis Carroll invests the fears and the fantasms of the child into this world. We then can have and see a father figure and a mother figure that loom high in this world and represent a completely aborted sense of justice. Alice, the child, becomes the one who puts things together and back to straightness by just dreaming this disrupted world awake. She only nostalgically remembers the fascination that was hers and the strangeness that was that world's. Waking up brings her back to normality and clears this wonderland of the menaces it contained. Lewis Carroll is a genius when he thus depicts a world of fear and frustration and shows how this world can become marvellous in real life because it is the antipodes of everyday regular society.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"I ordered this book twice and both times received the wrong book.

It just wasn't as magical as I imagined it would be.

Reading this novel gave me the same feelings I had in my childhood years watching the movie. I could be wrong but it seems to me that everything in the book was exactly like the movie. Alice was reading her sister's book and fell asleep under a tree. Then she woke up, saw a rabbit in clothes with a clock talking. She then followed the rabbit into this hole. After that she was in a never ending tunnel, which lead her to a strange world. Alice encounters many obstacles in the story and showed how she dealt with them.I thought the book was just like the movie. I guess was I was reading the novel made me have a better understanding. I was mainly looking for any symbolism of some sort, but failed to do so. I was also shocked at what the things characters were doing in the book and made it into a Disney movie. For example the Caterpillar smoking a hookah. I didn't know what hookah was until last year. I was really confused in some parts of the novel. This book I thought was great for someone that hasn't even heard of Alice in Wonderland. It is a very thin book but it was like reading a children's book.

Some of the things they say - like the White Rabbit and the Mad Hatter - will make you laugh.Carroll was truly a master in combining logic with humor. From any angle that you look at this book, you will find it enjoyable. No book, I think, has ever been so shrewd and witty. No E. B.

It was a quick read, and thoroughly enjoyable. In fact, I wonder what I would have thought of this book if I HAD read it as a child? I probably would have hated it, as the language and sentence construction is purposefully confusing. But now, at 50, although it makes no sense, it makes a lot of sense because I can see Alice's world from a parent's perspective. I hope you enjoy rereading the classics like I am."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"I could just see the movie playing in my head as I read. every detail was visible it was amazing!

A classic - still modern today - but one better suited for children (as an adult, it made me curious to read an annotated version though, or an essay about different ways to interpret the text's metaphors ; if someone got a suggestion, let me know about it...)"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"This is a beautiful book and in great shape! My daughter loves this story."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"It all started when Alice was spending a lazy afternoon on a river bank. Suddenly, she looked up to find a White Rabbit in a waistcoat go hopping by. Curious, she got up to follow him into his hole. Suddenly, she found herself falling down, down, down. And when she landed, she was in Wonderland, a strange place full of even stranger creatures. Yes, the animals all talk. But Alice seems to find herself growing or shrinking whenever she eats something. There's a locked door she can't seem to get through. A Caterpillar demands she recite. She visits the strangest tea party she's ever attended. And she plays croquet with the Queen of Hearts where the penalty for winning is a rather harsh \\"Off with her head!\\" Will Alice ever find her way home?I haven't read this book since I was a child. I remember enjoying it then. And I did enjoy it as an adult as well. The story is just crazy enough to capture the imagination of anyone who reads it. There were a couple times when I felt the book got a tad too repetitive, but for the most part the craziness was always fresh and fun.Plus this was a great excuse for some none sense poetry. While this book doesn't have some of Lewis Carroll's more famous I did enjoy what was here, especially \\"How does the little crocodile improve his shining tale.\\"As an adult, I must admit I found it a bit weirder than I remembered. However, keeping in mind the revelation of the final chapter certainly does help keep it in perspective. Ultimately, this is a classic that kids will still enjoy."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"\\"... and go on till you come to the end: then stop.\\" Good advice for reading this book, from the Red King himself.To say that \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" is a classic would be to state the obvious. Published originally in 1865, it was taken from stories which the Reverend Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (a.k.a. Lewis Carroll) told to three girls, the daughters of Henry George Liddell, including Alice Liddell who is the basis for the heroine of the stories. The stories inside are wonderful and superb nonsense which appeal to readers of all ages, as long as you don't try to read too much into it. The stories are filled with all sorts of absurdities based on language, logic, math, and parody. If you obtain a copy which has notes that discuss what is being parodied, it will add to the fun, certainly, but it isn't necessary because even without the parody it is still great fun. Also, you can certainly find references online to help find the sources which are being parodied.Other than to say that the book is about Alice's adventures it would be difficult to say that there are any great lessons here, other than perhaps to not take things too seriously. At the same time there are certainly some running themes throughout the stories. Size is a key element at some times Alice is very tiny, and at other times incredibly large, and food and drink are the main triggers for these changes. Sense and nonsense is another running theme as there are those who try to make sense out of the nonsense, and others who just enjoy the ride.The book opens with Alice following the white rabbit down the hole, and plummeting deep into the Earth. She meets many characters in her adventures, like the White Rabbit, a mouse, a lizard named Bill, a Caterpiller smoking a hookah, the Duchess, the Mad Hatter, the March Hare the Cheshire Cat, the Mock Turtle, the Red Queen, and many others. The adventures include her descent into Wonderland, her loss of identity with her changes in size, her babysitting a baby which turns into a pig, the endless tea-party, a very unusual croquet game, listening to the Mock Turtle's story, and of course the trial at the end.The stories clearly have long lasting influence as well. In books, movies, music, and art, there are countless examples of works based on the Alice Adventures as well as references to them. One thing those works have done is led to some confusion with regards to the Alice stories. Characters like Tweedledum, Tweedledee, Humpty Dumpty, and the Red Queen are not in this book, but rather in the sequel \\"Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There\\"."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"i love ralph steadman. his pictorial spin with the classic tale adds a new dimension to the story. this is not your disney princess story book."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"Tomorrow you will enter a planet where animals talk; you may even feel a bit smaller than usual after drinking a modest drink. There is going to be a door that you may be anxious to go in but not so anxious to drink what's on the table. If you are eager to go inside that door, read Alices Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll.Alices Adventures in Wonderland, where do I originate? Let's start at the beginning, Alice walking around in the forest then she sees a cat in a tree and the next thing you know she is in a room with a miniature little door in it and a drink on the table. One sip will do it you are as small as a mouse. Now figuring out that she can now fit into that tinny tiny little door. What will Alice do in that peculiar world with talking animals and cardish people who talk? If you think this book is right for you than run down to the nearest book store and pick up Alices Adventures in Wonderland, but watch out for the queen, she may behead you!I actually have two ideal parts of this book. My first favorite part of the book is when Alice sips the potion which makes her very small. I like it because in the beginning she really wants to get in a very small door and she realizes that she can now fit in that little door. My second favorite part is when she is at the tea party with the Mad Hatter. I like this part because she is so bewildered with what is happening because it is always tea time.The part of the book that makes me chuckle is when Alice is observing the queen play croquet. I think it is amusing because she is playing with these card/people things and if they do anything wrong the queen would behead them. She thinks they are always doing something wrong so, she always is sending people out to behead them.I would recommend this to people who are gloomy or have a bizarre life because; it would probably comfort someone sad up. It would also relate to someone who has a bizarre life because this is a strange book. I think this is for people 10-14 years of age.

I've always loved the original illustrations, so it was with some trepidation that I got this book. But I love Mr. Steadman's other work, so I held out hope that this was just as good. And they are - they go great with the story - and manage to be both whimsical and creepy at the same time.

Though I show a book cover, I actually read this book using DailyLit, a website that sends excerpts of classic literature to my email once a day, which I wrote about in another blog post.I found the book to be an enjoyable romp through a world of nonsense and fantasy, though at times a bit dour as many of the characters did not seem all that happy. I understand that Alice is a child in the story, but I still find it difficult to understand how children can be as lacking in intelligence as she is throughout her adventures - I don't recall being quite so foolish as Alice is at this age. My favorite part of the book was actually after Alice exits Wonderland and sits with her sister, telling her all about her travels. I was able to appreciate the story more once I found an entry in Wikipedia on the novel that explained much of what I did not understand, such as the various poetry recitations and songs, the real people that the characters were parodied after, the mathematical concepts explored, and the elusive answer to the Hatter's riddle, \\"Why is a raven like a writing desk?\\" Answer: \\"Because it can produce a few notes, though... they are very flat; and it is never put with the wrong end in front!\\"Perhaps I have been disillusioned to the magic of this novel thanks to a combination of Disney's animated film and my daughter's obsession with her movie, but I would rate this book as a decently entertaining read, not one of my favorites.

I could hardly keep track of where Alice was from the top of one page to the bottom, or how she moved from one location to the next. It was just hard to keep up. The entire book was just nonsense, yes I realize that's the point, but I really felt like there was nothing or little to be gleaned from it. I liked Through the Looking Glass a lot more. It too is about Alice's adventures in Wonderland and is also an imaginative little book, however Through the Looking Glass had more structure and was more interesting. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was a lot closer to the Disney cartoon version than I would have thought. So I guess maybe if you liked the Disney movie this book is for you? Too much nonsense for me. It jumped around so much I just kept zoning out then I would have to reread to try and figure out what had just happened. It was definetly a struggle for me to finish. It was plotless so I never really got into the book or emotionally attached to any of the characters.

Since it is aimed at children the story is easy to read. But still recommended for adults! Once you start reading you quickly get enchanted by the exciting journey through a fantasy world full of curious creatures and places. Adults might love the dark and frightening side of the story. Indeed, Alice is totally alone and needs to survive. I really like the fantasy creatures in the book. Especially the Cheshire Cat which represents the crazy world in a very good way. One easily understands the strange feelings Alice must get while speaking to the cat.Unfortunately, the book on the kindle does not come with illustrations. I think they would help to inspire your imagination. But this doesn't take anything away from the story.If you compare the movie and the book, I think both are great. Since I have not finished the book yet I cannot make a final comment on this.

If it was enough to just know the story there would be no point in taking this book off the shelf. But it's not just about the plot but about the way that Carroll writes.

Like Tolkien, Lewis Carroll creates a very complete world that quickly draws you in & that you can return to at any time & feel like you've always been there. For me, I can't really remember what it was like to have not read Alice.

Indeed, while the movie makes a great (if terrifying) children's movie, the book makes for great entertainment for all ages.If you haven't ever read the book, and especially if all you know about the story is its many adaptions, you are selling yourself short.

I will suggest, however, that Lewis Carroll's original be read before listening to this. There are so many whimsical and strange things taking place one after the other, and Wonderland is such a place of pandemonium (captured perfectly in this recording) that someone listening who isn't familiar with the original would probably be quite confused as to what is going on.I highly recommend this for children, families, or anyone who simply enjoys excellent audio dramatization."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"Absolutely amazing.

I've been a fan of this story for 25+ years and have at least 15 different copies of this book. We all know the story and there's nothing new as far as that goes. What's so new and updated and original in this book are the illustrations! The pictures are so vibrant and beautiful.

This is a must read book for teenagers and adults expecialy, maybe a little difficult for children. It allows your mind to go on an adventure. I truely admire Lewis Carroll as he points out all the characters leaving the mind full of imagination. The peculiar white rabbit Alice follows in the tunnel leads her to meet all kinds of different characters.Alice gets bigger and smaller through out the whole book as she drinks and eats all kinds of things. The characters make you smile such as the Duchess, Caterpilar who smokes but is wise, Chesire the Cat , lobsters who love to dance, the Mad Hatter, The King and the Queen of Hearts. The end of the story just made me want to read it over again. Let your imagination go a little wild as you read this amazing, brilliant book."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"Truly a classic. This story had popped up in my childhood first as a Disney movie and later as an elementary school play. However, up until now I've never actually sat down and read the book. I wasn't disappointed.If you are looking for an illustrated version, keep looking. This version is only text. It allows for the readers imagination to \\"see\\" the story. Some of the imagery is convoluted and makes this a challenge, but in a good way.Nothing is better than enjoying a good book on a dreary afternoon. The remembrance of childhood was just an added bonus."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"Absolutely love this book.

I mean it fits in the palm of my hand. And being as jam packed as it is with wondrous things the print is quite small as well. So, simply, buyer beware of that fact that I over looked."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"The story is interesting, but I think from a childs point of view this Kindle edition would be most facinating if it contained the orginal illustrations.

It was nice to read the book again after many years. The kindle edition does not, however, do any justice to the book. Being a children's story, the lack of pictures and opening poem really take away the effects. Because of the lack of physical description, all I could picture while reading it was the movie starring Carol Channing and Sammy Davis Jr. This is one of two books where I can honestly say that the movie was better."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"The product arrived very quickly!

She can now visualize what she reads. from the wonderful pictures. Every night - we read - 2 - 3 pages and I explain many of the words and phrases she's hearing for the first time. Even if it is late and way past her bedtime - skipping bed-time reading results in tears and tantrums. That is how much she loves the material.

Enjoyed every word even though by the time I read it, I pretty much knew everything that would happen.."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"So, what's a 47 year old doing reviewing a classic children's book? Well, it occurred to me as I was looking through the available books on my Kindle, that many of the free ones (yes I'm quite open to free as an option) that there were many books that I assumed I knew because I had seen movies, seen summarized in some other form or simply because they were cultural icons and \\"everybody\\" knows these books.Many I have indeed read and did read as I was younger. However, now with a Kindle and a commute, it seemed a perfect opportunity to address some of those elements lacking in my basic reading. It was in this spirit that I down loaded Alice's adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll and read through it is a remarkably short period of time. Many of these free books on the Kindle, are in the public domain and have been available in text or PDF files for quite some time. A simple conversion in format is all that is required to make it available. The question I asked as I read the book, is does the experience of reading it in this format take away anything from the experience. Children's Literature in particular is often about more than just the words on a page. Of course there are often illustrations, the physical book itself takes on dimensions that are bigger than usual. This adds to the experience of a child reading the book by themselves but in particular it adds to the experience of a child being read to who can then sit in a lap or look as the book as presented and share in the experience by learning to read or reinforcing reading skills.So, for a aging kid who needs something to read to round out his cultural iconic missing links this worked just fine. However, for those seeking to have an experience with their kids in reading a classic piece of literature, I'd not recommend it in that venue.As to the story itself, there's little I can say. In some ways, it's like reading a familiar story but in others it's amazing how much can be lost or glossed over in the pop-cultural offerings that sprang from it. Reading this piece of classic literature gives you some insight not only into the time it came from, but also into the heart of childhood that is timeless and can be recaptured at least in part, if we'll pause and exercise our imagination.4 stars. Absolutely 5 stars as far as the story goes. Because this specifically addresses the Kindle edition, a drop of a star so that any considering reading this to their children from a kindle, consider what might be lost by not obtaining a more traditional copy complete with illustrations and the opportunity to share at a level one notch above what the Kindle offers in this context.Perhaps something like thisAlice's Adventures in Wonderland. Take some time and look for what will work best for you and your intended audience.bart breen"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"\\"What is the use of a book without pictures or conversations?\\" Someone might have thought to ask that of the compilers of this Kindle edition, which lacks any of the famed Tenniel illustrations, even though they're all in the public domain and have been made available in many on-line versions. Worse, the compilers also omit Carroll's opening poem, \\"All in the golden afternoon,\\" even though it's an integral part of the book. One gets the feeling that the goal was to not make the free version truly complete, so that one would have to wind up purchasing one of the non-free editions for one's Kindle -- which is probably a better solution from the outset."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"I forgot how wonderful a tale this is. It is written so well that the images almost jump off the page. Even as an adult I couldn't help but to fall under Carroll's spell."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"Do you remember the first time you saw a painting by Marc Chagall? His fantastic creatures wearing hats and trousers, people kissing while floating in mid air, layers of events happening at once, and conversations between animals and flowers? If Chagall was alive and asked to illustrate Alice's Adventures, it may have looked very similar to this.Only this is better.Simple and yet very rich illustrations bounce you from page to page. They are vibrant but not overwhelming, you are curious about where the images will take you next, it makes you hungry for more. And you get more! There is a printed illustration on almost every other page of the book! There seem to be as many small images, lending themselves as nuances to Carroll's text, as there are full-page illustrations. In a word, it's fantastic.I disagree with the editorial review of the School Library Journal. While I see this book as sophisticated, I also see very young children relating to the artwork. The dream is at times spooky and frustrating like the real world can be, just as at other moments it can be a playful party. Although Alice in Wonderland may not have been originally intended for child as young as three or four years old to read, they will be enticed into trying. A child as young as four will relate to this Alice, she is a small girl with flowing hair and dresses in an easy style. Deloss McGraw has illustrated a modern and truly dreamlike interpretation of Carroll's classic. Finally we have a total departure from the formal British and more grown up Alice that John Tenniel portrayed all those years ago and has been an influence upon artists attempting it since.Albeit a short, but important side note: the size 14 - 16 font is very readable for both old and young eyes, and comes in very handy for those readers-out-loud at late bedtimes in a dimly lit room.Of all the illustrated versions there are of this classic story, this will be the version your child would first pick up from the shelf."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"The story of Alice in Wonderland is repeated in a very readable text and is as delightful as ever. This is not, however, a childrens' book. Barry Moser's illustrations tell the story of Alice in a different, dark and somewhat menacing way. Is the rabbit hole just the means to reach an amusing world of people and animals with strange names and stranger habits, or is it the path to a nether region where the normal rules of social conduct and the shape and size of &quot;people&quot; don't apply? If his illustrations mean anything, Moser thinks perhaps it is the latter. For example, the Queen of Hearts appears not as the crazy, but ultimately harmless, creature of a Disney movie. Moser shows her as a dark and foreboding character and by his illustartion suggests that &quot;off with her head&quot; is a real threat. The text of the book is standard Alice, but the real reason to buy it is to get Moser's illustrations. This is definitely not a book for 10 year olds. But those of us who grew up on Alice as half comedy, half light hearted spoof will enjoy this twist on a traditional tale. Moser's other illustrations of classical works such as Moby Dick and The Devine Comedy are also well worth acquiring."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"I have this book. It is beautifully illustrated. I do not understand the comment of a previous reviewer who complained about the number of illustrations. Nearly every page is beautifully illustrated.

I'm an adult who fell in love with this story when I saw Disney's Alice in Wonderland. This is a worthy addition to my collection of things Carroll. I recommend \\"The Wasp in a Wig\\" if you can find it. The end of this Alice... has a nice and concise description of Carroll's writing of the book, photographs of the cover and first page of Carroll's handwritten first version, and a wonderful tribute to John Tenniel, the illustrator of the first published edition who provided the classic drawings nearly all of us recognize.

Strict traditionalists may find Garcia's gothlike depictions of their favourite Wonderland characters a bit off-putting, while fans of Alice looking for something distinctly different won't be disappointed. The text is Carroll's original classic, nicely set, with a whimsical unjustified right edge and pleasing gradient toned pages. This volume does not include Carroll's Through the Looking-Glass, which is a pity -- it would have been interesting to see Garcia's depiction of the Jabberwocky.

I buy the Kindle editions in order to easily search for particular quotes and passages. These passages I commonly paste into writings I do on the Bible, and Lewis Carroll's works are some of my favorites, behind Shakespeare and Plato.I mention all this because unlike many other books, this edition is actually better for reading than it is for the purpose I just mentioned, because it does not have the pagination which would enable one to refer back to the original copy. In most Kindle books, you can locate the printed page number by doing a query on a word on that page. That's a bit hokey, but that's what you have to do. That trick does not work on this edition. Rules for scholarly source citations have not yet caught up with editions which are formatted especially for the Kindle.But for reading, the Kindle converters got two things very right. First, the edition has all of Sir John Tenniel's drawings. They didn't even spoil them by having them colorized, even thoughh the thumbnail picture in the Amazon header is colored. Second, formatting for poetry loses absolutely nothing as the size of the page or font is changed. This is especially important for that unique example of \\"concrete poetry\\", \\"A Mouse's Tale\\" which appears in chapter III."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"I thought for sure the BBC would get Alice in Wonderland right and to some degree they have. The actors all do their parts very well and overall this CD is enjoyable. It will be maddening though to Alice fans who expect the script to follow the book. I don't understand why it was thought necessary to change the plot line almost at whim and then insert \\"The Walrus and the Carpenter\\" (from Through the Looking Glass). What's wrong with the way Carroll wrote the book? His logic is far superior to this adaption. I felt frustrated throughout when incidents or characters were skipped, but then turned up later in the story.

Everyone knows the story of Alice in Wonderland, made even more popular by Disney years ago. All I knew of Alice was the Disney cartoon and the artwork of Tenniel and Rackham. What I didn't know was the brilliant writing style of Lewis Carroll, the author who created Alice and her Wonderland.Carroll is one of the most clever writers I have read. I kept thinking to myself as I read this book, \\"how the hell did he come up with this?\\" The dialogue is pure genius. I loved every minute of the Mad Hatter and his tea party.The story is very short and without much of a plot, but that is what can be expected of a dream. It's sort of just a walk down the rabbit hole and through wonderland. But in that walk, we meet fascinating creatures; creatures and objects present in the real world, but with a fantastical twist.What I loved more than anything was the book itself. I got a beautiful edition of this book through Dreamhaven, published by Firefly. It was a $30 on sale for $7.95. It's hardcover, clothbound, with thick, high quality paper and illustrations that I've never seen before for Alice.The illustrations are done by Ralph Steadman. His work looked familiar and I found out that he is the artist from Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. I didn't know what to think of the images at first, but I liked them by the end. They are definitely geared towards a more adult audience, but then again, I forget what it's like to be a kid. He adds a certain edge to the characters. The characters become menacing and bizarre. He gives a great introduction in the book and explains why he drew each one of the images the way he did."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"I've been looking for these editions since a certain bookstore stopped carrying them a couple tears ago.

Alice in Wonderland is no more children's book than, \\"The Lord of the Rings\\".The reason this five star book gets less stars occasionally is not because of its contents or purpose; it is because of either being mistaken for a kids book, in which case one wonders why it is forced on kids, or it is so dated that even the reader thinks it is gobbledygook.You will find the book full of references to items of the time and play on words of the time.If you fall into either of these categories then you need to first purchase \\"The Annotated Alice: The Definitive Edition\\"; this will clear this understandable confusion. Be aware that every sentience is a play on words for a jab at the culture of that time.I will not go through the story, as that is why you are buying this book.

The quality book binding incorporates a built-in bookmark on a ribbon that says \\"Read Me\\", in a delightful complement to this widely beloved story.

Some books drag from the very beginning, but this children's story didn't. There were surprises from the start. This book is an all original example of using your imagination. Lewis Carrol was gifted enough to let his imagination go wild, and to write it down on paper. This book inspires me to write any sort of crazy thing that is worth writing. This book is about Alices adventures from the time she saw the peculiar White Rabbit with a waistcoat and watch. She meets thrilling but very arguementive creatures and charectors such as the caterpiller who smokes, the Duchess and her baby which turns into a pig, a Mock Turtle, a gryphon, and the most famous the Chesire cat and the Queen of Hearts.

Having been down a rabbit hole or two myself, I greatly enjoyed this nonsensical, imaginative tale. Although pinned as a children's book, the story is equally as enjoyable for the young at heart. Camille Rose Garcia's vibrant, haunting style perfectly compliments the dark whimsical story by Carroll.

The book is enjoyed by most, but fantasy lovers and mature young adults seem to really love it. Once you read Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, you get hooked and you have to read more. Carroll paints a vivid picture of Wonderland and all of it's crazy inhabitants you find around every corner.

Well, I enjoyed it to an extent, mainly when Alice was speaking with herself or exploring. But when characters began speaking or interacting with Alice, I was left scratching my head (probably much like Alice.) I'm sorry to the fans of Lewis Carrol, but I did not like Alice Adventure's in Wonderland. Why? Because while there was a protagonist, there really wasn't an antagonist. There was no hardly any plot, no theme, no conflict, and no resolution. There really was no point in Alice's dream. It did not make her a better person. And the characters in the book while amusing, literally had no point. Sorry, but no matter how many cents I have, it will never make enough sense for me.

A classic that everyone should read."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"Alice in Wonderland is a wonderful piece of literature. The characters described by Lewis Carroll make the reader feel part of another world. Alice is a young naive girl who encounters some unfortunate events during her time in Wonderland. I do not agree with responders who say they did not like the book because, I honestly loved this book. All of the characters have their own unique personalities. Even if some of those personalities are strange, they are different none-the-less. This version of the book was more than helpful to me while I was reading it for a school project. The fantastic illustrations kept my imagination alive as I read along.One of my personal favorite characters is the Mock Turtle. When Alice first encounters him, he is singing about Mock Turtle Soup, which is strange because he is singing about a soup made out of his own flesh! The Mock Turtle is one of the characters that the readers will wonder how Carroll could have ever imagined. I enjoy this character because of his strange personality and even stranger way of thinking. Another character that I believe is extremely funny is the Duchess. She is mad; her baby is truly a pig; her servants are insane and her Cheshire Cat has a mocking smile! These are only two of the characters that make this story exciting and compel readers to finish the novel.I was in the musical production of Alice in Wonderland, and I loved the story so much I couldn't keep myself from reading the book! The book had many similarities and differences from the musical, but the general storyline was the same. The main difference from the book to the musical was the elimination of the minor characters. The musical did not include the lizards or the dozen animals that were washed away in Alice's pool of tears. (Just the three birds and the French Mouse!)I would definitely recommend this book to all readers! Young children will not understand all of the adult themes, but the unusual characters and great illustrations will certainly capture their interests. Furthermore, hearing one classic can get them to become more interested in other classics in the future."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"Review of \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\"\\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" by Lewis Carroll is a classic fantasy that is wonderful for Middle School students who love to read.This fascinating book is about an adventurous and curious girl named Alice who follows a \\"White Rabbit\\" and mistakenly falls into a long, long hole.

Alice meets many new characters such as, The Mad Hatter, The Dormouse, The March Hare, The Queen of Hearts, a Duchess, a Gryphon, a footman that is actually a fish, and The Cheshire Cat, as she tries new adventures to get herself back home.

Out of the many editions I would recommend the Alice's Adventures in Wonderland illustrated by Helen Oxenbury. Helen Oxenbury is a talented illustrator who won England's Kate Greenaway medal for illustrators. She draws Alice like a modern girl very different from Disney's Alice whith her neat hair, apron, and the poofy dress. Some of the pictures are coloured and some are not. This is the unabridged story with a bigger font than the others. It is better for readers because novels usually have small fonts which are very hard to read.This book would be awsome for Christmas, Hannukah and Easter presents or just a present for your family and maybe for yourself because it it paper back. However, it has thicker paper than the fragile pages in other paperback novels. I would not recommend this for traveling because it weighs more then the other paper back novels.You might get another version of Alice in Wonderland because you think that you are not going to read it again after you finish, but if you get this book, you will want to read it again and again after you finish."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"I really enjoyed this book because it was funny.

I own a print copy but wanted one for my Kindle, especially as access to free classics was a big reason I bought one in the first place. With writing like Caroll's I am not disappointed."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"I read \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" (hereafter \\"Alice\\") in college during the 1980s. Reading an annotated edition was probably indispensable because without it, I probably would have concluded, like many others, that \\"Alice\\" was an unrestrained, loony, dream-like fantasy - a literal pipe dream. But being in a collegiate, analytical situation, I was expected to plumb \\"Alice\\"'s metaphysical situation for some profound truths. As even the foreward to my \\"Alice\\" version warned, it would be relatively easy to construct a psychological, social, or historical dissertation from the characters and situations 7-year old Alice encounters. In other words, one could read practically any literary theme into the work. Fun as this scavenger hunt might be, I think there's really only one significant theme \\"Alice\\" reinforces - stay young and childlike and innocent as long as you can, because adulthood is harsh and inconsistent and insane.Consider the evidence. Almost every character Alice meets in Wonderland is a pedantic, supercilious, self-important adult that treats her with impatient disdain. Almost every character gives Alice contradictory, unfathomable advice and rules, symbolically underscored by the changes in bodily size and proportions Alice undergoes. We have the declaration from the Cheshire Cat (a relatively innocuous but still didactic adult figure) that everyone in Wonderland is mad to some degree. The authoritative nature of Wonderland's adults culminates in the ultimate authority figure - the utterly but irrationally and impotently tyrannical Queen of Hearts - who screams for beheadings but never accomplishes any. The most humorous denunciation of adult rules and customs arises during the \\"climactic\\" silly trial about some stolen tarts, where legal protocol undergoes zany pretzel contortions. Throughout, the \\"immature\\" Alice sees through the pontifications and does not take Wonderland's sneering condescension lightly, especially during the trial ending when the cards exasperatedly indundate her and cause her to wake from her dream, glad to lying in the grass next to a peaceful summer stream.To be more precise, Carroll championed a prolonged childhood for little girls, since he considered young boys unmannered churls and had a barely respectful fondness for Alice Liddell, to whom he dedicated \\"Alice\\". According to the annotation's foreward, as a minister who toiled in religious privacy, he would often look from his rectory and envy Alice's and her siblings' frolicks outside. With that knowledge, \\"Alice\\" as a Peter Pan-like paean to eternal youth becomes more understandable. What also makes \\"Alice\\" memorable is the bold assertion that a child can weather the eccentricities of an \\"adult\\" world better than most adults can."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"this book was very entertaing and is a reallygood classic. its price is awesome so i dont think you can go wrong with this."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"A long fall down a deep rabbit hole lined with book selves and small bottles should cause angst in anyone.

The plight of modern man is that he is condemned to be free-Sartre. Are the aging condemned to be too objective as well?Children have \\"beginners mind\\" as Buddhism tells us.

I never found these layers of riddles or saw the ones I found as particularly important.Carroll, the clergyman left us with an Easter message at the end of the book, but none of the Bible symbolism of C.S. Lewis' Narnia. Wonderland is a place with a hidden God- a land observed by a cryptic reticent caterpillar who may be the persona of the shy Carroll.As the caterpillar asks the befuddled Alice \\"who are you?\\" We are forced to reflect on who we are and what we have become as the oversized Alice did when she looked through the little door towards the hidden garden beyond."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"A wonderful tale with exquisite artwork from the original masters.

But I very recently watched the movie (with Johnny Depp) and was curious about the Jabberwocky monster that Alice defeats in the end. I couldn't remember it from the book. It turns out there's no such monster in the book (or in the sequel, \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" - as far as wiki tells me).What's marvelous though is everything else that *is* in the book. What other book has created so many characters that live on in our world? The Mad Hatter, the Queen of Hearts, the White Rabbit, the Cheshire Cat, the Duchess, the Mock Turtle, Alice herself (and this isn't counting all the myriad characters from \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" like Tweedle Dee, Tweedle Dum, Humpty Dumpty, the Walrus and the Carpenter... I must read this second book now). \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" comes close, but as a child of British colonial rule, it's Alice's story, not Dorothy's that I remember best.\\"Why is a raven like a writing desk?\\"Why indeed. I loved all the mad things that happen so casually: the caterpillar smoking, Alice growing and shrinking, the never ending tea party, the \\"Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.\\" And I especially loved how there's no moral, no lessons learned, no neat resolution.

However, I would caution you that, while the story is similar (excepting one poem as far as I can tell) note that this edition is lacking in the illustrations that make this work especially fitting for children. In that respect, if you are using this Kindle ebook as a means to read the story to your children, I would recommend either a pdf version with pictures or purchasing an illustrated version (they aren't expensive at all at this point). Otherwise, if you are reading this simply to sate your own curiosity as to the actual story or to reread the tale now that you are an adult, then this version is fine and you should be able to get along without the pictures.Don't get me wrong, the pictures are a definite added bonus and classic, but I find it hard to argue against downloading this classic anyway, as, well, its free. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"I don't know what took me so long to read Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. I think it's because I'm not a big fan of Disney's animated Alice, and that kind of put me off from reading the actual story. I also have to admit the unsavory rumors about Lewis Carroll also steered me away from reading this one.I put that aside and decided to finally read this classic. I found Alice's Adventures in Wonderland a delight. As soon as Alice falls down the rabbit hole, I found myself swept into Carroll's lyrical and strange storytelling and didn't stop reading until the end.Alice herself is the one who captivates the reader.\\"For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.\\"After falling down the rabbit hole, Alice encounters some strange characters, the Chesire Cat, the Queen of Hearts and the Mad Hatter among them. The encounters Alice has with these characters are funny and strange and I enjoyed the silliness of the story. Interestingly enough, this genre is referred to as literary nonsense.Lewis Carroll was a mathematician and that is evident as you read this story.\\"Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is - oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate! \\"My favorite chapter was 5, Advice from a Caterpillar.I found it amusing that Alice comes upon a caterpillar sitting on a mushroom, smoking a hookah no less.\\"The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.'Who are you?' said the Caterpillar.\\"I enjoyed this fairy tale and will be reading Through the Looking Glass next."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"I bought the book strictly for the artwork of Camille Rose Garcia.

The imaginative phrases and descriptions are enough to keep you going strong until the very end. The numerous descriptions of the different areas of wonderland is pretty cool. I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"From the very beginning, the book showed its weirdness. Alice is bored on the riverbank in the company of her sister, and sees a talking White Rabbit walking by. However, she's not amazed by this, but rather by it pulling a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket. Driven by boredom, she follows the rabbit down a rabbit hole, where she falls and falls near endlessly whilst having conversations with herself. Apparently one can pick up cups and pots and place them on shelves while falling at a terminal velocity.The entire motivation for Alice's adventures is the beautiful garden past the small locked door she wishes to enter. Throughout her seemingly random changing of sizes to try and enter the garden, she meets mice, turtles, a caterpillar, a Cheshire Cat, and many other weird creatures. All of them seem to have a quite annoying wit about them that bases itself upon word puns and spellings. Accordingly, Alice's painfully simple logic and way about doing things exposes these puns just about every page. Tale to tail, Tea to the letter \\"T,\\" and other similar things. To brighten things, the Cheshire Cat's demeanor is a little different, but not by much. He, like many other characters, is quite literal and has a cloudy and recondite service to the overall story.And to top it all off, when Alice finally does enter the lush garden, she meets the Queen of Hearts who has a record of both ordered executions and empty words. When she isn't screaming \\"Off with his/her head!\\", she's playing a rather silly, disorganized game of croquet. I would attempt to identify an allegorical message about foreign countries' governing systems in this scenario, but the ridiculous nature of that chapter was just too much.There really was no clear climax, and the resolution didn't suffice--for me at least. What was the main conflict? Not being able to enter the garden? The unfair trial about stolen tarts? If the latter is indeed, then it was never resolved. Personally I believe it was identified at the very start--her boredom.Overall, the adventures weren't that adventurous, and the wit not that witty. Perhaps if you enjoy ambiguity, you will appreciate this book. It's very hard to understand cultural references from a book written over a hundred years ago. Don't read this too critically; take it with a grain of salt--or you'll dislike it like me."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"I really wanted to like this edition of Alice In Wonderland, as I happen to admire Lisbeth Zwerger's art. Unfortunately, there were inconsistencies between the illustrations and the text which marred my appreciation.An example:In the scene where Alice encounters the rather severe and pedantic caterpillar, Zwerger takes a top-down perspective, forcing us to see the creature from above, as we would in everyday life. Zwerger ignores the fact that Alice is the same size as the caterpillar (6 inches) and viewing him from a lower position (he sits on a mushroom, thereby gaining height over Alice). The text even specifies that Alice has to stand on tiptoe to see what is on top of the mushroom. I have always thought it obvious that readers (especially young children) are meant to identify with Alice and see things from her perspective. Instead, we tower over the caterpillar, taking away the unusual perspective that Dodgson would have wished us to have. Tenniel's illustration is faithful to the the text and the child's perpsective; Zwerger's, unfortunately, is not.What is more, with Zwerger's perspective, it is difficult to imagine the caterpillar as a stern, brusque, off-putting character-- much like some adults who have little tolerance for children(\\"Who are _you_?\\"; \\"What do you mean by that?\\"; \\"Explain yourself.\\") The text mentions, among other things, that Alice is rather shy of him. From Alice's (and thus the reader's) perpective, the caterpillar is an intimidating figure. Not so in Zwerger's interpretation, where the caterpillar is not only a diminutive thing, but also a self-conscious-looking thing, puffing nervously on a cigarette.Which brings me to the most glaring and incomprehensible departure from the text: the cigarette. The story clearly indicates that the caterpillar is smoking a \\"hookah\\". Zwerger perversely ignores the details of the story and substitutes hookah for ...a ciggy! Is this artistic license, or sloppiness? Either way, a child reading \\"hookah\\" for the first time will be betrayed by Zwerger's illustration; older readers who like to think the artist should be faithful to the text will find the changes disconcerting and annoying.Together, these inconsistencies dampen the pleasure I might have gained from Zwerger's lovely pictures and Carroll's story.And this was just one picture, from the Alice book only, mind you. I haven't yet looked at those of Oz, but I am too disappointed with the first to try.For the meanwhile, the books remain in their slipcase, in a remote part of the bookshelf, while I enjoy the original and delightful illustrations by Tenniel."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"I really liked Alice's adventures in Wonderland because it is so original!

So ou may be looking for the Ingpen edition but unable to find an Ingpen review.I fell in love with the Ingpen edition when I saw it in the store. Every page turn features an outstanding color illustration by one of the of the world's leading illustrators.In Alice she says:'what good are stories without pictures?' We can read a story without a picture, yet when we have a picture it really helps us in imagining the story, and Ingpen has a great imagination when it comes to the picture story.This is the kind of book you will leave on the coffee table just so you can show it off to your friends. Whether you are a parent or just reading it your own pleasure, I found reading it this way much better. I do own a pictureless version which I never got around to reading.Sterling publishers have published other stories with Ingpen such as the Wizard of Oz. So if you wish to enjoy a classic story and to fire your visual imagination at the same time this is a great way to do it.

But one too many references to \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" made me finally decide I need to know, first hand, what all the fuss was about.Reading a text that has long become embedded into our culture, turns things upside down. I had so long heard of the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, the Rabbit Hole, that I feel like I know these reference when in fact, I don't. Now I do and that is what I got most of the book. Alice's plucky, no nonsense tone is a bracing counterpoint to the ridiculousness going on around her. The Queen cracked me up and I now see where Baron Sasha Cohen's Dictator comes from. As a work of literature, perhaps its charms would have been more intoxicating at age 7 but alas, I cannot turn back time.So I'm glad I read the thing but there was no transport, no insight and my general dislike for children's books and fantasy remains as fortress-like as before I began down the rabbit hole."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"awesome part one is amazing but, i have the original unbigided version in hard cover from Barns & Noble which was CHEAP!!! looking forard for the complete tales of Edgar Alan Poe i shall say nevermorep.s. i'm nine"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Aladdin Classics)","review":"Have never read this classic before.

This is a timeless story that can be appreciated by all generations, and this is a beautiful gift edition that people of all ages will enjoy.Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is one of my favorite stories from childhood. As an adult, I hadn't read the story again, until this book touched my hands. It is even better reading it as an adult because I found so much more in the story than when I was a kid. I appreciate literature more now and Lewis Carroll is one of the best. If I had kids, I'd read this to them before bed or naptime.The illustrator for this special edition of the book does a truly amazing job with the artwork for the story. Camille Rose Garcia is exceptionally talented, and I really hope that she illustrates more books like this in the future. Her artwork is edgy and gothic, which gives this children's tale a more grownup or current vibe than when it was written.I absolutely loved this edition of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and highly recommend this as a book for everyone to get.

Once the rabbit went down a well-like hole, she soon followed, falling down and down for what seemed like forever. At her landing, she appeared in a whole new world, with talking caterpillars, floating/disappearing cats, and food that makes you grow and shrink. Another major aspect of the rising action is when Alice ate a special cake that made her grow extremely large in the rabbit's house. It made her realize how weird this Wonderland was.I enjoyed the beginning of this book because it was very interesting how random organisms were talking, for example, a smoking caterpillar. Another interesting factor was the bottle that read \\"Drink Me\\" and the cake that read \\"Eat Me\\"; the liquid made her shrink while the cake made her grow. Once it got towards the middle of the novel, I got progressively confused. I think this book is a little too random: especially when it goes from the Mad-Hatters tea party to the Queen's croquet match. The transitions from each scene made it confusing to read because it went too fast. Another reason this book is confusing is because it was written in 1865 and some of the language is outdated. The style of Lewis Carroll's writing is creative, but extremely odd.

Richard White tells the story of his Mother's family in Ireland and Chicago, draws on the family stories that he was told, and then relates them to the historical facts and records. The result is a book that is better than it would have been had he relied on a single methodology, and the story is more engrossing than it would be otherwise. While other reviewers would have critisized this methodology, I find that his ability to show where and why discrepancies arise between memory and fact is extraordinarily illuminating."},{"Title":"Remembering Ahanagran: Storytelling in a Family's Past","review":"In tracing the &quot;representative&quot; story of his mother's life, the author provides an insight into the motivation and experience of the Irish immigrant.

Both of these items are of particular interest to the genealogist."},{"Title":"Remembering Ahanagran: Storytelling in a Family's Past","review":"An excellent, in-depth exploration of his mother's Irish past and of her coming to America as a young girl. He takes family stories and investigates them through his historian's training. Of course, many times he finds the facts don't support the story, as family stories change over time and blend different events or are shaped by changing perspectives. So then he explores the power of the story, regardless of its veracity, and then explores the facts to more fully understand the world that shaped the people from whom he is descended.The book is a history lesson in how family's work and don't work. And it is a history lesson in the politics, morals, and folkore of rural Ireland and Chicago's South Side.A rich, well-written book. You do not need to be Irish to enjoy it."},{"Title":"Remembering Ahanagran: Storytelling in a Family's Past","review":"This is a fascinating memoir, alternating between memory and historical records. The remembrances of the author's mother of her early life in western Ireland and her later immigration to the United States are set against his searches for the actual historical documents and records of these events.This is not a sentimental or saccharine biography, but an unflinching look at the lives of the respected-historian author's relatives and neighbors, both in Ireland and in America.I read it over several days, and would have finished it sooner had I not found myself lost in thought so many times over what records might support-- or contradict--the stories of my own mother and grandmother. I am telling all my friends about this book."},{"Title":"Remembering Ahanagran: Storytelling in a Family's Past","review":"I did not find White's actual content all that engrossing. His historian's determination to separate fact from his mother's \\"storytelling\\" embellishments or lacunae follow the usual patterns of such explorations into the clash of contrasts. The Irish mom-meets-Jewish American dad that gave birth to White appealed to me, but reading the pages of life in Chicago in the 30s vs. his father's military stint made this book little different than a self-penned history of one's family by the designated genealogist in the clan. White does write considerably better than such amateurs, but what he writes about does not rise above the mundane or the all-too-familiar tales of peasant agitation, the old IRA, and the leaving of the village for the big city.His eye occasionally gleans the telling detail, regardless. A petition for citizenship reveals that the husband does not know his wife's birthday, and his guess is off three years. His mother is asked as a 16-year-old at entrance to the country if she was a polygamist. The legend of St Rita, patron of the Chicago parish his family lived in tells in its own moral that God shapes you up only then to kill you off. Jack Benny and Father Coughlan were the radio shows one never missed on Sunday.One detail shows an error on White's part: on pg. 23 he claims that his relatives had their baptismal names \\"Gaelicized\\" by the priest as Helen-Hellena and William-Guilielmo, but surely this is the customary Latinization found on many Catholic documents rather than a return to the Irish which would make Eileen and Liam?This book reminds me of a few others that have recently delved into the Irish-meets-American immigrant encounter. Thomas Lynch's \\"Booking Passage,\\" also looking at North Kerry, would complement White's book. His style in its spareness yet its eloquence reminds me of Henry Glassie, the folklorist who compiled \\"Irish Folktales\\" and chronicled a Fermanagh community in \\"Passing the Time at Ballymenone.\\" Finally, books like David Monagan's \\"Jaywalking with the Irish\\" and Steve Fallon's \\"Home with Alice\\" similarly compare Irish American memories with extended Irish residences."},{"Title":"Remembering Ahanagran: Storytelling in a Family's Past","review":"The writing is adequate, but this story is not very interesting to anyone other than the writer, and his family.The character, the writer's mother, left Ireland at age 16, a 4th grade drop out, who matures, in her new-found home town of Chicago, goes to work at a variety of jobs, and eventually meets and marries her husband during the years of WWII. I was hoping that this would be a &quot;Michner&quot; like story, integrating the lives of the &quot;characters&quot; with real historical events taking place in a real time line.

Technology and Change is a masterpiece. When I first read the book I noticed its date of publish is older than me but I was amazed how beautifully it explains the contemporary real situation in Innovation. Uncertainty, instability and unpredictability which is at the heart of every innovation is a dilemma which scholars in recent decades has wrestled with to capture its dynamics. With notable exceptions such as Latour I think Schon brilliantly shows how Reduction of Uncertainty to Risk, converson of Language of Invention to Language of Investment, too much information to handle, Propose-Dispose ping pong between boss and subordinate and above all Myth of Rationality are underlying platforms of Innovation Projects. With a frank departure from conventional wisdom he pursue change and innovation all the way to an ethics of change.To sum up, it's a live, notable, and pioneering work which deserves more attention by students of innovation which these days are overwhelmed by more information than they can handle specially at the time of litrature review."},{"Title":"Technology and change;: The new Heraclitus","review":"Donald A. Sch&ouml;n worked as a consultant to industry and at the National Bureau of Standards - NBS (now the National Institute of Standards and Technology - NIST).

He founded OSTI (Organization for Social and Technological Innovation) in Cambridge and headed the Planning Department at MIT before his passing. His insights recorded in Technology and Change about the innovation process and the fate of innovations in the marketplace are still of great value to those in the building community and beyond. The resistance to change in the building industry of 50 years ago has not receded much today."},{"Title":"Mounce's Complete Expository Dictionary of Old and New Testament Words","review":"The hardcover edition is very good and usefull but the Kindle edition needs a lot of work.

I have been flabbergasted at the words he chooses to leave out in the expository section. And the explanations are not always that enlightening. I love the ESV!

Of course, the correct quote should have been the exact opposite, \\"speaking in tongues is a sign, not for believers, but for unbelievers\\".I think such carelessness puts the integrity of the entire book in question."},{"Title":"Mounce's Complete Expository Dictionary of Old and New Testament Words","review":"This is hardly a complete review. Simply an observation that when I was looking up citations for the Greek basis for 'plank', Mounce's had nothing, while Vine's had a cross-reference to See 'board'. The reference to 'board' had an important reference to Acts 27:44 where some Bibles do translate the Greek by 'plank'. I went back to Mounce's and under 'board', I found less information than in Vines and no citation of the passage from 'Acts'. If you have both, keep both. If you have Vines, Mounce may not be an improvement. Mounce is good, but not 'Complete'."},{"Title":"Mounce's Complete Expository Dictionary of Old and New Testament Words","review":"Mounce's work is an excellent update and modernization of an expository. \\"Vine's for the 21 century\\" accurately describes this work, which clearly shows the use of each word in its different contexts.

Although this tome touts itself to be more \\"complete\\" and based on more recent discoveries of everyday usage of the koine Greek, yet, it is not as comprehensive nor as well explanatory as Vine's. Subtle instances of the author's bias defining certain terms relating to doctrinal issues are apparent rather than giving an objective, forthright description. It is useful in a limited way but does leave something to be desired."},{"Title":"Mounce's Complete Expository Dictionary of Old and New Testament Words","review":"I like this book and I use it as an extra layer of research for my seminary papers. However, there are some words I noticed were omitted, words that might not be considered politically expedient to have in such a book. This disappointed me, because it lowers the integrity of this work. There also were some interpretations in the book that are not universally accepted to be fact by Biblical and language scholars. But overall, this is a great tool, one that I'll use alongside my other resources.For someone just getting into the languages or someone who has no understanding of the languages at all, this can be a good tool, although it should not be used as the last word on some translational matters. It's best used alongside other tools, and I wouldn't want for anyone to be constructing personal theologies from a book such as this, as good as the book is. We must still look to our more accurate translations, and use a book such as this one as a tool for understanding."},{"Title":"Mounce's Complete Expository Dictionary of Old and New Testament Words","review":"This book turned out to be better than what I had hoped for.

It self-proclaims that it is MORE \\"accurate, up-to-date, complete numbering system, and user-friendly\\" than Vine's Complete Expository Dictionary. My review is mixed, even though overall I do like the book.PROS:1. Indeed, some of the entries are more up-to-date than Vine's. But you cannot really tell the difference. A simple lay person has to believe that it is up-to-date.2. I do find OT entries more complete than the Vine's, but shorter in definition. It simply has more entries for OT words than Vine's book. And I find it useful.3. Dictionaries at the back really helps. These dictionaries are not concordance dictionaries where you find them at the back of concordance. These dictionaries provide short but clear definitions for the word at hand. Truly handy.4. Hardcover book is clean and tight. Pages are thin (like the pages of the Bible)... this could be either pro or con depends on your preference.CONS:1. Some NT entries are not necessarily better than Vine's in my opinion. Such terms as \\"envy\\" \\"godly, godliness\\" and OT entry \\"wisdom\\" are better explained in Vine's. Hence, some entries are better than Vine's but other entries, the Vine is clearly better.2. Personally, I do not like the format of the book (but this is subjective judgment). Under the English entry, both Hebrew and Greek corresponding words are discussed. To me this is a bit inconvenient. I like the Vine's format better: having separate entries for Hebrew words and Greek words.Overall, I do like the book and recommend it. But I suggest that you use the book with good old Vine's Expository Dictionary. For my studies, Vine is hard beat."},{"Title":"Mounce's Complete Expository Dictionary of Old and New Testament Words","review":"The title says the dictionary is \\"Complete,\\" and the cover blurbs call it \\"Vine's for the 21st Century,\\" and say that compared to Vine's, Mounce's work is \\"More accurate,\\" \\"More user-friendly,\\" has \\"More up-to-date definitions\\" and a \\"More complete numbering system.\\"Undoubtedly these things are all true. It also features, in my opinion, a more readable layout, more contemporary and reader-friendly wording, and the fact that OT and NT words are not divided into entirely separate sections of the book is logical and convenient.Finally, the inclusion of concise, \\"Strong's-like\\" lexicons at the end of the book is a nice touch.The complaints:Despite its claims of being \\"complete,\\" it is most certainly not so. Only when closely examining the Introduction does one understand the curious inability to locate certain words: \\"It includes all Greek words occurring TEN times or more, all Hebrew words occurring FIFTY times or more, and other words occurring less if they are exegetically or theologically significant.\\" (Emphasis added by reviewer.)This makes sense if and only if concision is the overriding goal. After a bit of consideration, it is easy to realize that it is often those words LEAST used that are MOST in need of careful definition and exposition. This is a significant drawback, and in my opinion makes the title of the book misleading if not outrightly untruthful.Involved in a debate about the Biblical teaching about homosexuality? Sorry, except for the very brief entry in the Strong's-type lexicon in the back of the book, you won't find any mention of \\"arsenokoites\\" in this tome.In contrast to Vine, Mounce also seems to provide \\"exposition\\" that avoids some of the ongoing controversies in Christianity.Trying to suss out whether Heaven and Hell really are \\"everlasting\\" or merely \\"age-long\\" as various \\"eonian\\" proponents claim? Vine frames parts of his definitions in such a way that they seem intended to directly address claims posited by some eonians and Universalists; Mounce's definitions are clear and adequate, but less \\"direct\\" in terms of addressing controversies."},{"Title":"Mounce's Complete Expository Dictionary of Old and New Testament Words","review":"I agree with the previous reviewers. There are several weaknesses in the layout and the dictionary itself. Example: on page 783, the author discusses the Greek word for weep (Klaio) and his explanation and examples totally ignores one of the most well known times when Jesus wept (John 11:35) which is the verb dakryo. This verb is listed on page 1115 - in the Greek! Not much good for those who haven't studied Greek before. There are several times this happens. The word 'contend' (e.g. used in Jude 3) and receives only one reference in Mounce (Diakrino); in Vine's it receives 3 references (athleo, diakrino & epagonizomai - the actual Greek word used in Jude!) My advice as a language teacher - Vine's should be your first stop - then Mounce's."},{"Title":"Mounce's Complete Expository Dictionary of Old and New Testament Words","review":"Widely billed as the new Vine's for the 21st century, this book does have several advantages, perhaps the most prominent of which is that it is simply different.My own opinion is that anyone interested in seriously needing any dictionary of the Old and New Testament words needs both books. Neither of them is very expensive, and if you're looking at a particularily difficult translation, you just might want to look at both. Often two wordings of essentially the same definition of a word just might explain things a bit differently. (If they weren't different, there would be no need for a second dictionary.)One claim being made is that Mounce is more user friendly than Vine. Probably true if you are not already familiar with Vine's system. But if you've been using Vine's for years, you know it and how to use it, while you have to learn Mounce's.All in all, I find it impossible to say one is better than the other. Sometimes I like Vines, sometimes Mounce's. Get Both."},{"Title":"Mounce's Complete Expository Dictionary of Old and New Testament Words","review":"Mounce advertises his dictionary as an updated replacement for Vines. My big respect for Mounce comes from using his learn NT greek course. Before that (and still) I relied heavily on Vines for definitions of greek NT words and found him more than excellent. The idea of Mounce updating Vines led me to buy 4 copies as gifts for friends.Mounce's dictionary is like an abridged version of multi-volume International Dictionary of NT, handy for those people with no or middling greek knowledge.Having used it for a few months my conclusions are:- I'd recommend it- It is a good dictionary- It is tied to a modern numbering system- Useful scripture index- Modern multi-scholar content- It is not as good as Vines - He was the sole author, you became familar with him - his character and godliness, he was very thorough almost exhaustive, he had 'spiritual' insight. Mounce lacks being exhaustive and seems bland in its definitions, almost afraid to be definite or lacking insight. The multiple authors of Mounce leaves me unable to get a feel for their belief and character.I like having both dictionaries on my shelf. One makes up for the shortcomings of the other. I wouldn't be without both."},{"Title":"Mounce's Complete Expository Dictionary of Old and New Testament Words","review":"Late to arrive was Mounce's Complete Expository Dictionary of Old and New Testament Words (Zondervan, though copyrighted 2006). This is very similar to a recently produced (2005), Vine-replacement dictionary from Hendrickson, Stephen Renn, ed.,Expository Dictionary of Bible Words: Word Studies for Key English Bible Words Based on the Hebrew And Greek Texts. Both dictionaries do different things. For instance, Mounce has a Hebrew-English and Greek-English Dictionary in the back that gives a more substantive definition (with scriptural references) than Renn, who simply indexes each Strong's entry (original language) with its English counterpart. Thus, words not covered in Vine's (Renn) get some coverage in Mounce.In the body proper, however, Renn is more substantive: first, in that many entries have an \\"Additional notes\\" section that describes the transition of word meaning from the OT to the NT; second, Renn is more comprehensive in words covered. For instance, under \\"Sacrifice,\\" the noun &#7717;ag is also covered under OT words (though its primary referent is \\"feast\\"), while the adjective eidlothyton is covered under NT words. However, Mounce has the advantage of deriving from the NIV rather than KJV. Sometimes this advantage becomes apparent, as when one reviewer of Renn decries a lack of entry for apostasia when, in fact, it could be found under \\"Forsake\\" when checking the index. However, in Mounce, apostasia (2x) is only found in the Greek-English dictionary in the back."},{"Title":"Mounce's Complete Expository Dictionary of Old and New Testament Words","review":"I do concur with the previous evaluation. This volume is good, but it is not necessarily a complete replacement of your old Vine's. The improvements on Vine's are laudable, but that is all. Keep your Vine's.In fact, there are still places where you will find a better discussion in Vine's.Mounce's, however, has a better OT treatment overall.

If I need to look up a word starting with the letter w, I literally have to press the page button about 800 times to finally get to the word I am looking for. I'm sure the actual physical book is great, but the fact that the kindle edition has no index makes this book completely useless; how am I supposed to navigate it? There is no way to select the word I'm looking up with no index. I was excited to buy it, but but with the lack of an index I cannot use this book. It just doesn't make any sense.

Everyone wants their say about who the next generation of poets is . . . and everyone will have a gripe with at least a couple of the people included here. Fact is, though, this is a very carefully put together selection of solid -- sometimes terrific -- poems by many of the most talented poets writing today. It's discerningly edited with a good ear for both the sense and the music of the poems.Of course, if you want a truly democratic anthology, you'll have to go elsewhere. But why the hell should an anthology be democratic? Good anthologies have editors who enforce their own aesthetic values and tastes on the book--who select poems THEY like. In a way, good anthologies are anti-democratic. They go for range, of course, but ultimately have one person in making the decisions. Bad anthologies are often democratic, though. It takes no skill, after all, to include everyone . . . to merely survey the field.I recommend this effort wholeheartedly. It'll inspire you or make you mad -- but there's a mind at work putting it together and lots of talent in the poems."},{"Title":"The New Young American Poets: An Anthology","review":"Most of the poets in this collection are good.

Schools around the country regularly held \\"duck and cover\\" drills, where the students were taught to get down on get down on their knees and cover the back of their neck with their hands. As if that would do a great deal to protect you against a nuclear blast.This story is set at the height of the nuclear arms race where the race is not in numbers but in the power of the blasts. Each side sets off the most powerful nuclear blast yet and there on one casualty of each blast, a humanoid with wings. Neither side really knows how to deal with a dead angel; there are discussions about how much to reveal and some studying of the bodies in an attempt to learn the truth. However, circumstances dictate that neither side is able to learn any details about the mysterious visitors and each one leaves behind a book.This book is a metaphor for the semi-controlled insanity that permeated the Cold War and points out that the paranoia was so great that it is likely that even semi-divine intervention could not have stopped it. The latest generation will have no idea what this book is about unless they have studied history in depth, those that lived through it will relive a part of their lives."},{"Title":"A Basic Guide to Wrestling (Official U.S. Olympic Committee Sports Series)","review":"This book covers alot of territory: wrestling hisotry, types of wrestling, basic skills, match rules, governing bodies and associations, and tips for participants, parents, coaches, and spectators.As a broadbrush introduction, the book is very good. If, however, you were looking for detail in any one of those areas, with the possible exception of match rules and etiquette, you'll need supplementary books.

Thanks AMAZON for carrying this great book."},{"Title":"License Invoked","review":"Having been a fan of Robert Asprin for a number of years, and having been impressed with prior collaborations of Jody Lynn Nye, I found &quot;License Invoked&quot; a disappointment. Little about this book has the ring of truth necessary for a good fantasy. The characters have an unpleasant, one-dimensional feel to them: a perpetually annoyed, insecure, English government agent; an upper-class Englishwoman masquerading as an Irish 'acid-folk' singer; a French Quarter denizen on the government payroll. Combined with goverment agencies specialising in the paranormal (X-Files anyone), a Satanic version of tele-evangelism, and you are left with a mixture that doesn't jell. There is a certain disconnected air to the story, as if neither Asprin or Nye had any real interest in the tale."},{"Title":"License Invoked","review":"I'll usually buy anything by Robert Asprin - his &quot;Cold Cash War&quot; makes my top ten sci-fi books ever. This book read like a poor attempt to create another Thieves World franchise. The characters aren't engaging, the events fairly ho-hum. Save your time. Read his Myth series instead."},{"Title":"License Invoked","review":"I'm glad to see Asprin back to writing on a regular schedule.These two authors 'invoke' a good story with personable chemistry between the protagonists. So why only two stars?The beginning, so important to hooking a reader, is a jumble of mixed messages, and doesn't do justice to the plot or characters assembled.Never confuse a reader as to whether you are going to \\"romp\\" or deliver careful characters. When the material starts out slyly poking fun with odd government agencies like \\"O.O.P.S.I.E.\\", you expect you are going to read \\"screwball comedy\\", which is a place the authors have creative gifts.But this is actually a murder and black magic story -- a pretty good one.If you can roll past the first thirty pages of mixed signals, you might find a nice story here."},{"Title":"License Invoked","review":"Fionna Kenmare, lead singer of the Irish acid-folk rock band, Green Fire, is sure someone is trying to kill her. But the only person who sees or hears the attacks is Fiona herself, which convinces her that they are magical in nature so when the band gets ready to tour the United States, her father calls in some favors to get her a bodyguard. Liz Mayfield, with the British Government Office of Occult and Paranormal Sightings Investigation, is assigned to protect her. Liz is probably the only person in her department who actually believes in good and evil, for the rest it is just a cushy job. And with that idea Robert Asprin and Jody Lynn Nye set the stage for a hilarious romp through New Orleans in their latest, License Invoked. With help of her American counterpart from the FBI, Boo-Boo, who appears to know everyone in New Orleans, Liz must battle the most fearsome magical onslaught of her life, all the while trying to convince everyone that it is real but at the same time, keep the press from finding out so that both governments are embarrassed. With the help and hindrance of a whole cast of odd and off-beat characters, Liz must work to defeat not only the minions of Satan, who wish to kill Fionna because she is a good influence on our children, but the non-believers who would try to assign a rational explanation to the events around them. Definitely a great twist on the good v evil theme. Not as good as Asprin's Thieves World series, but still a good read."},{"Title":"License Invoked","review":"I read about the first 30 pages and could go no further. The Myth series and the Phule series are both excellent, and hopefully Mr. Asprin's next book will be equal to his past works. Unfortunately &quot;License Invoked&quot; falls far short of expectations."},{"Title":"The promise of all ages,","review":"All religions prophesized the Second Coming and around 1840 there was a strong belief among those who had studied the Bible and writings of other religions that the return was imminent somewhere in the Middle East. Some were so sure that they projected the exact date during 1844, while others were so sure that they purchased property and established themselves in Haifa, Israel. However, just as Jesus did not appear in the way learned scholars predicted, the awaited one of the modern age did not appear as these people had expected. The date was about right; the location was wrong for that particular event but was right for later events. The savior did not appear riding a chariot out of the sky but in the form of a fairly ordinary person. George Townshend, a Canon of St. Patrick's' Cathedral, Dublin in Ireland, investigated the evidence very carefully and became convinced that this person was the new savior. But just as the established church could not accept Jesus as the Messiah, so the new savior, Baha'u'llah was persecuted, imprisoned and exiled by the religious leaders of his time. The fact that learned people have repeatedly failed to understand the prophecies in the Bible sows confusion in the minds of ordinary people. It is only those prepared to question the truths handed to them by the church establishment and those prepared to conduct their own independent investigation of the truth, who are able to break out of the shackles with which religious leaders bind us. George Townshend was one of those willing to conduct his own investigation and was convinced that Baha'u'llah was the long-awaited Second Coming. If Townshend is right, this is the most exciting development on our planet for centuries.Taken from the foreword, this passage tells exactly what this book is about:&quot;This volume contains not only an argument but a story, a story of immediate interest and concern to everyone in the West; a story of the first systematic effort to reconstruct the social order on a world-wide basis and to lift mankind to the level of a new social responsibility. The central figure of this story is a Great Seer, who in prophetic tones forecast the character and magnitude of the Day of God then at its dawning, and by word and by example, in his Epistles to the Kings and in other writings, called on his own and other nations to reduce their armaments, to seek union and peace and to prepare for that long promised civilization in which righteousness and justice would prevail throughout the earth. Because he was ahead of his age he was misunderstood; and with all his followers was proscribed, anathematized, and cruelly persecuted. But a truth whose time has come cannot be suppressed by priests and tyrants. A strong fire smothered at the surface will be driven deep, will spread far and wide underground and will reappear later at a distance from its source. The spiritual ideals and noble peace-aims that now increasingly find utterance in western lands are as uprushes from a hidden fire, glimpses of that ordered and balanced scheme for world reform which was wrought out and promulgated by Baha'u'llah in prison, some 70 years ago. The challenge of this story, of the enthusiasm of its heroes, their restless energy, their radiant faith, will bring delight and uplift to every spiritual mind For it is not the challenge of the cynic or the skeptic, but that of fellow believers in God who with joy sacrificed all they had and all they were in an effort to establish World Peace on an imperishable foundation.&quot;There are some things in life that we should not delegate to someone else and this matter is one of those. Ultimately we are responsible for how we live our lives and what we believe. We can seek help and guidance from others but the final choice is ours. George Townshend has prepared convincing evidence that the long-awaited second coming of Christ has occurred in the figure of Baha'u'llah and that the new religion - the Bahai Faith - that he created is alive and growing rapidly in supporters. We should at least read this book and decide for ourselves whether there is a basis of truth in what Townshend tells us."},{"Title":"The promise of all ages,","review":"This volume contains not only an argument but a story, a story of immediate interest and concern to everyone in the west; a story of men of vision and of action, the pioneers of a new era; a story of the first systematic effort to reconstruct the social order on a world basis and to lift mankind to the level of a new social responsibility.The central figure of this story is a great seer, who in prophetic tones forecast the character and magnitude of the day of god then at its dawning, and by word and by example, in his epistles to the kings and in other writings, called on his and other nations o reduce their armaments, to seek union and peace and to prepare for that long promised civilisation in which righteousness and justice should prevail throughout the earth.Because he was ahead of his age he was misunderstood; and with all his followers was proscribed, anathematised, and cruelly persecuted. But a truth whose time has come cannot be suppressed by priests and tyrants. A strong fire smothered at the surface will be driven deep, will spread far and wide under ground and will reappear later at a distance from its source. The spiritual ideals and noble peace aims that now increasingly find utterance in western lands are as uprushes from a hidden fire, glimpses of what ordered and balanced scheme for world reform which was wrought out and promulgated by Baha'ullah in prison some twenty years ago.The challenge of this story, of the enthusiasm of its heroes, their restless energy, their radiant faith, will bring delight and uplift to every spiritual mind. For it is not the challenge of the cynic or the sceptic, but that of fellow believers in God who with joy sacrificed all they had all they were in an effort to establish world peace on an imperishable foundation.Table of contents:I.

Law abiding folks find themselves backed into a corner, forced into breaking laws that are not designed to help, but to hinder the pursuit of happiness, or simple survival even. Politicians call for less government out of one side of their mouth while creating more with the other. Most of us are too busy trying to put food on the table to be able to follow the machinations of politicians, even when the laws passed make it more difficult to do the former. Government Creep give examples of what can happen when Big Brother becomes the oppressive and overprotective parent. Loompanics does it again with an insightful book about the way it is.

Strip searches, confiscated homes, stolen children, denial of due process, war without end. Sounds like life in a Third World country, doesn't it? But this is our own federal government \\"for, of, and by the people,\\" invading our personal lives, supposedly for our own good.Government Creep: What the Government Is Doing That You Don't Know About shows how Uncle Sam has now become a dysfunctional parent - standing guard in our bedrooms to \\"protect\\" consenting adults from each other, peering at what we read to see if we're \\"corrupting\\" ourselves or someone else, making it impossible to run a small business, incarcerating our children and confiscating our homes under laws that make freedom lovers shudder.It has been a long time since such an explosive and well-written title has been released. Some of the most respectable civil libertarians in the nation - including ACLU President Nadine Strossen - have come out and stated that this is the THE book to read if your concerned about your freedoms.\\"Government Creep will give you the creeps about the increasingly invasive role of government in every aspect of our lives - our homes, our workplaces and even our bodies and minds.\\"~ Nadine Strossen, President of The American Civil Liberties Union\\"A clear and concise look into the inner workings of a modern day persecution...

The thing that immediately jumped out was the appearance of the letter 'Q' in Turkmen words. No such letter in their alphabet.Having said that, though - It is, indeed, a very useful tool for people learning the language, or in search of a dictionary that facilitates translation of materials written in modern Turkmen (instead of transliterating in your head as you search for words in the old Cyrillic dictionary).I hope the authors take no offense at my first remark, it is meant to be constructive!"},{"Title":"Turkmen Dictionary & Phrasebook: Turkmen-English/English-Turkmen (Hippocrene Dictionary & Phrasebooks)","review":"\\"Very good dictionary, good for foreigners, and the turkmens.

I have owned a copy since it first came out, and keep having to buy new ones because my student's also love it. I am a 4th grade teacher, and when a student leaves my class, I allow the child to pick a favorite book - any book I own - to take as my gift. The kid's usually choose either China's Bravest Girl, or El Chino by Allen Say. That says a lot for a book! The story and illustrations engage the students strongly - they love the images, the poetry, the Chinese character. The story gives them hope that they too can be heroes and change the world. Please get yourself and your children a copy - in fact get two - you will end up giving one away."},{"Title":"China's Bravest Girl: The Legend of Hua Mu Lan","review":"The Chinese language text seems to be &quot;politically correct&quot; hack retelling from the People's Republic, filled with jingoistic sentiments. I would not want to read the Chinese version to my kids. The English language version softens and rephrases some of the more irritating parts of the Chinese text, the artwork is OK, and young children actually seem to LIKE the simplistic rhyming, so I'm assigning three stars. If you want a close translation of the original poem with wonderful illustrations, buy Jeanne Lee's book. If you want a good prose retelling of the story with lots of details added (the original poem is somewhat elliptical in phrasing and short in detail) then buy Robert San Souci's book."},{"Title":"China's Bravest Girl: The Legend of Hua Mu Lan","review":"This story is told in the format of a song. The song is the re-telling of the legend of Mulan. The story is close to disneys version of Mulan, but has several differences. One difference is that Mulan and her family decide together that Mulan shall go in her fathers place. Mulan fights in many battles intead of just one. No mention of her being hurt and then her gender being discovered. She is discovered when she returned home and another soldier who was traveling with her finds out her true gender.Prior to reading this to my 5 yo, we discussed how this was the original story. It sparked a discussion on how sometimes a book and a movie can be very different. It was a hit with my child. One that I expect to read again and again. A nice addition to any Mulan fans library."},{"Title":"China's Bravest Girl: The Legend of Hua Mu Lan","review":"Since Disney has appropriated another folk tale, I think that it's important to expose your kids to preDisney tellings. This version of the story is really well done. It has some of the qunt, old fashioned feel of the original chinese (so I am told), only toned down for a young audience. It is well illustrated, and is far more historically accurate than the movie. My 6 year old son has requested it for a bedtime story every night since we bought it."}]`),S={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:W},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},L={class:"card-container"},M=["disabled"],H={key:0},j={key:1};function E(n,e,s,u,r,o){const m=g("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=i("div",{class:"top-banner"},[i("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[i("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),i("div",L,[(t(!0),a(w,null,y(o.visiblePoems,(l,f)=>(t(),b(m,{key:f,poem:l},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),o.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...l)=>o.loadMore&&o.loadMore(...l))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",j,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",H,"See more"))],8,M)):p("",!0)])}const q=c(S,[["render",E],["__scopeId","data-v-7fb73951"]]),R=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/35.md","filePath":"glossary/35.md"}'),B={name:"glossary/35.md"},N=Object.assign(B,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(q)]))}});export{R as __pageData,N as default};
