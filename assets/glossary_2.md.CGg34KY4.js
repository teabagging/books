It's not a lack of money, too many students per teacher, too many societal problems, or any of the other ideas that have been blamed for the state of schooling. Holt shows, rather than tells, that schools can't be fixed because they are not a good idea gone bad. They were a bad idea to begin with.Full of first hand accounts, this book shows the difference between learning and schooling; why schools are bad for children mentally, physically, and emotionally; why teachers talk too much and prevent students from real socialization; why tests are not only useless, but harmful; why schools turn previously well mannered children into &quot;behaviour problems&quot;; and so much more...An excerpt from The Underachieving School highlights the problem:&quot;In school certain things are &quot;spozed&quot; to happen; the kids are &quot;spozed&quot; to sit still, be quiet, read the texts, do the workbooks, pass the exams. If none of these things happens, if the kids learn nothing, riot in the halls, drop out, that's OK, as long as you tried to make happen what was &quot;spozed&quot; to happen. But if you tried to make something else happen, even if, like Herndon's, your kind of order worked and your kids found things worth doing and actually did them, you're a threat to the system, and out you go. &quot;Many of us think that bad schools and student underachievement are a modern problem. They are not. Everett Reimer wrote about achievement problems in the 70s. John Taylor Gatto wrote about the 80s and 90s. Flesch, of &quot;Why Johnny Can't Read&quot; fame, wrote in the mid-50s. John Holt writes in the early 60s.Read this book. Read Holt's others books. Read the authors above who came before and after Holt. Then you will have a broad picture, and will be able to truly understand, The Underachieving School."},{"Title":"The underachieving school","review":"John Holt was a leading pioneer in re-examining public education, public educator's assumptions and theories. He began calling attention to where exactly the American compulsory school system came from and what students were really learning. They are learning but not what most people, right, left, or center think. Holt was also the major force behind the modern Homeschool movement. Today, John Taylor Gatto is more relevant & further along. But Gatto and the few others who insist compulsory and college schooling are not about education & probably never were owe much to John Holt. Holt began as a reformer but finally had to conclude the entire system must be shut down and education re-made anew from the ground up. I think both men go a little too extreme in their criticisms and their proposed solutions. Their extreme conclusions are not well supported. American education since 1870 has not been totally useless to a free people.I recommend Holt to those few truly interested in education matters and issues. First, you may want to read the late philosopher Mortimer J. Adler's conclusions about education and schooling. They are not the same thing and probably never were. Fortunately, America's has its supply of people like Mark Twain who admitted: \\"I never let my schooling interfere with my education\\"Holt knew that Socrates, Plato, & Aristotle despised professional teachers. Socrates observed that they soon turned schools into being about them, into fulcrums for serving up their interests. The three thinkers also concluded that people confuse education, schooling, & vocational training. Aristotle wrote \\"a vocational education is for slaves. higher learning is for free men.\\"John Dewey in his earlier and only truly major work, \\"Democracy and Education\\", echoed Aristotle. His elitist authoritarian education dogma that is echoed & aped today in our Schools of Education came after he became an ideological Fellow Traveler & basked in the Sunlight of \\"Papa Joe\\" Stalin whom he glowingly promoted in lectures presented to admiring professors of education. He got on so well with Stalin that Stalin strongly recommended Dewey to young Mao, China's new communist dictator. Dewey was extremely impressed with Mao too, after many months in China as Mao's personal guest. Perhaps education professors should compile a book about Dewey's hand in Mao's making of the Chinese working class.I also recommend E.P. Thompson's classic, \\"The Making of the English Working Class\\" & what John Taylor Gatto has to say about the authoritarian, elite origins of the compulsory American school system. Aspiring teachers will not get introduction to these enlightening analyses in any Teacher's Education course.Holt (and Gatto even more so) want you to know that our public schools are doing an efficient, fine job, depending on what you understand their assigned mission to be and on who actually determines that mission. It clearly isn't you and me."},{"Title":"The underachieving school","review":"The Underachieving School by John Holt contains inspirational and informative ideas on how to children should be properly educated, while retaining the respect and attention to how children actually do learn. Holt's interpretation displays to readers the difference between learning and schooling. Through author John Holt's original thinking, The Underachieving School is well written with clear and thoughtful style as result of Holt's firsthand experience with such issues. Highly recommended to all school administrations nation-wide, as well as parents, teachers, and educational government organizations."},{"Title":"The underachieving school","review":"This book is very valuable along with \\"How Children Learn\\" by the same authoer. The author had deep insights into how a thoughtful and dedicated teacher can help students develop their own minds (as opposed to what most teachers do which is condition students not to think for themselves, and mechanically follow processes. One of my favorite essays is \\"Teachers talk too much.\\" This essay emphisizes the need for teachers to get students to say things that are meaningful and are not in any sense planted by the teacher. Of course, students are usually conditioned to want to avoid the effort of having any original thoughts of their own, but they are still better severed by the willingness of a teacher to extract their thoughts. This is one example of the books insights, and the reader will find many more. The reader will also find that most teachers do not have the insights in the book.Recomended for all professors, and all k-12 teachers, including homeschool parents."},{"Title":"The underachieving school","review":"The book arrived in good condition.

You can use the questions in several ways: to amuse yourself; to stimulate even more intriguing questions; to grow closer to those you care about; and to ask others you know less well the same questions as a way to become acquainted. As a result, you should find your dinner table conversation much enlivened! As the authors say, &quot; . . . This book was designed to make your conversations more creative, interesting and exciting.&quot;The questions are in no particular order, and you can browse or go through from 1-320 in numerical order.Here are a few of my favorites (with their numerical order noted in parentheses):(320) &quot;If you could add any question to this book, what would it be?&quot;(70) &quot;If you could change the custom of shaking hands, what would you replace it with?&quot;(131) &quot;If you had to choose your own epitaph of seven words or less (besides name and dates), what would it be?&quot;(181) &quot;What bit of knowledge/advice do you have that you wish you could pass on to everyone else?&quot;(184) &quot;What fear do you most want to be rid of forever?&quot;(213) &quot;What is something that you enjoy that is a chore for most other people?&quot;(215) &quot;What world record would you most want to establish?&quot;(273) &quot;What is one of the simple pleasures of life you truly enjoy?&quot;In a group setting (perhaps like in a parlor game), you are encouraged to give everyone 60 seconds to answer before going on to the next person, unless the people involved want more or less time. The authors suggest that if you don't know what the answer is, you should imagine what the answer might be if you knew and be as creative as possible. If you get onto a subject you love, you can just stay on it. You don't have to go on to another question.I think these are great stallbusting questions because they can make you aware of your complacency. If there are things you love, and you are not doing them, what's wrong? The epitaph question is a good start on considering your life's purpose. Are you living it? If you have a terrible fear you want to get rid of, what are you doing about it? As I went through the questions, I saw direct or indirect attacks on over 35 stalls that drain joy and accomplishment from life.I suspect that you will get more good out of this book if you do the more stimulating questions with someone you love. That can be a great way to draw you closer together. In a way, this can be like some of the exercises in Relationship Rescue. In that book, you are encouraged to answer the questions first for yourself, then as you think the other person will answer them. Then you compare actual results, and discuss what it all means.Enjoy getting to know yourself and others much better! BE SURE TO ACT ON WHAT YOU LEARN!"},{"Title":"Conversation Piece","review":"I recommend this book to anyone who wants ideas for conversation with friends, family, lovers, co-workers.

But honestly, this is a GREAT introduction to human anatomy for this age group-- by far the best one I've seen."},{"Title":"Hidden World: Human Body (A First Discovery Book)","review":"This is clever little book that uses transparencies and a paper flashlight to add a little fun to an tremendously interesting topic: what the human body is all about.In this book you remove the paper flashlight from the back page and then slide it between the black pages and the transparencies to \`illuminate' (actually just draw attention too) parts of the pictures.Topics include:The Diversity Of The Human FormHow A Baby Grows In It's Mommy's TummyParts Of DigestionBonesTeethThe Five SensesDreams And SleepSmaller Parts Of The Body As One Might See Them Under A Microscope...at the end there are pictures and the question: \\"Did you find these hidden pictures...\\"If you are interested in detail here's a little more about the topics:The diversity of the human form - actually this is only two pages that show different kids and you will probably have to point out to them that people come in all kinds of shapes and sizes. The text is: \\"Each human body is a wonderful world! Turn the page to find out how human life begins.How a baby grows in it's mommy's tummy - One page shows a mom and babe with the development of the mommy's belly and the relative size of the baby in silhouette.

A blue circle indicates where the food is in the process.The accompanying transparency depicts the parts of the body: such as esophagus, liver, pancreas, etc. The digestive processes, as well, is briefly discussed: teeth, saliva, etc. They do not mention stomach acid, but only say that in the stomach food is broken down even further. They then say that it passes into the small intestine where nutrients are absorbed. Then through the large intestine and out the rectum.Bones -- there is an xray type picture. They touch on the structural aspects of bones as well.Teeth -The transparency shows an \`xray' type picture of a boy's skull with bones, nasal cavities and teeth showing. Sure to be of interest is the fact that baby teeth are \`pushed out' by the adult teeth.Dreams and Sleep - a really useless transparency of no real merit accompanies text that reminds us that while we sleep, our brains stay active.Smaller parts of the body as one might see them under a microscope - these include what a slide with a skin bisection with a hair might look like. In addition: white blood cells; red blood cells, muscle, bone, brain; egg and sperm cells.Four Stars.

Tolstoy is of course a great and complicated figure whose two masterpieces ' War and Peace' and 'Anna Karenina ' stand at the summit of world - fiction. Gifford tells the story of the landowner, patriarch Tolstoy whose vision of a better world was somehow rooted in the social thought of the eighteenth century. He tells of how Tolstoy made at the center of his vision of community, the ideal of the family. He reads 'War and Peace' in his brief chapter on the subject as a work in which personal connections and relations are always made in terms of family connections. He underlines the uniqueness of Tolstoy's social vision, and his great loneliness in pursuing it. He does not however really begin to explain the miracle of Tolstoy's powerful presentation of reality, his incomparable capacity to make the physical and social worlds come to life. This book provides much information to add to our understanding of Tolstoy , but not in regard to what is most important in him, the miracle of his creative art."},{"Title":"Runaway toys","review":"The copy of Runaway Toys that my 3-year-old has grown to love was also read repeatedly to me as a child, but it was originally a book from my father's boyhood. Tattered, colored-in, and a bit faded, this book has been well-loved and read hundreds of times.It tells of three seemingly ordinary toys: a car, a boat, and an airplane, all of whom belong to a boy named Joe. The toys are content to be confined to the floor, the bathtub, and the airspace under the ceiling, until a window, left open after Joe falls asleep one evening, proves to be too tempting. A teddy bear, sailor rag doll, and rabbit threaten to wake Joe and his other toys if the vehicles don't let them come along for the adventure. So the six set out in the dark, seeking a river and bridge so they can all race. Just as they find what they are looking for, dawn breaks and rush-hour traffic soon accumulates on land, water, and in air. The clever rhyming text takes on an accelerated pace and a frantic tone when the small toys meet buses, ocean liners, and blimps head-on. The toys' urgency in just wanting to get out of the way make the floor and bathtub desirable like never before.This book is a little-known treasure that combines edge-of-your-seat suspense with the fantastic notion that your toys venture out when least expected. In my humble opinion (as well as my son's), it leaves many of the well-known children's classics feeling a bit worn-out and dull. Hogans's Runaway Toys is an enthralling story that any preschooler or early elementary-aged child would love."},{"Title":"The Inimitable Jeeves","review":"One of the earlier Jeeves and Wooster collections, this is a series of very loosely linked short stories generally following the same template: young, wealthy airhead Wooster or his pal Bingo Little gets in some sticky situation, and it is up to his genius butler Jeeves to devise an ingenious solution to the quandary. Here, the somewhat repetitious misguided amorous ramblings of Bingo make for the lion's share of troubles, although the high spirits of Bertie's cousins Claude and Eustace also make plenty of work for Jeeves. The stories can fairly be compared to contemporary TV sitcoms, as they to reply on recurring (often over the top) characters, a rarefied setting, a single type of humor, and recurring situations. Simply put, if you like one Wooster story (and don't get sick of them), you're going to like them all. Much of this can be explained by Wodehouse's mastery of the language and constant deft turns of phrase, period slang, and comic timing. Those who deride the shallow subject matter and milieu of the Jeeves and Wooster series need to recall the context in which these stories appeared. Only a few years removed from the horrors of World War I-an event barely alluded to in the series, despite the loss of an entire generation of British young men-the stories can be viewed as a bandage of sorts, an attempt to transport the reader to a world far removed from the traumatic recovery from the Great War. Not to mention Wodehouse's clear depiction of the upper classes as wastrels and idiots of the highest order when compared to the street savvy of the servants (as exemplified by Jeeves). Of course, one doesn't read Wodehouse for social commentary or as a salve these days, but for his dry wit and keen command of the written word."},{"Title":"The Inimitable Jeeves","review":"Were you to read only one Wodehouse book (God forbid) which one might it be? I would suggest this one, although there are numerous contenders from the Jeeves, Drones, golf, Mr. Mulliner and Blandings stories, not to mention the one-offs and great unknowns.Although this book has what might be called an overarching narrative, being that all the tales are told in the first person by one Bertie Wooster, the chapters nevertheless neatly fall out as short stories even if with somewhat \\"cliffhanger\\" endings, which is to say they don't resolve.That almost perfect format will delight both short story fans and afficianados of the novel, and also spun off some of the best TV yarns in the Jeeves and Wooster and World of Wodehouse TV series.My British edition (for copyright reasons not for sale in the U.S.) shows a cover photo op of Ian Carmichael as Wooster in the BBC series \\"The World of Wooster\\". As PGW noted, this was one of many instances where Bertie was overly mature and greyed; there seems a deliberate attempt to make Carmichael seem older-- whereas most readers, Wodehouse included, see him as somewhat youngish.In Wodehouse Playhouse, which includes brief vignettes of PGW, he gives his imprimatur to the series for at least casting Bertie somewhat younger. Even better was the stellar performance in Jeeves and Wooster, in which \\"Pearls Mean Tears\\" \\"Comrade Bingo\\" and a number of these other chapters, expanded into episodes, appear. No wonder such a wonderful series was inspired by such a delightful read."},{"Title":"The Inimitable Jeeves","review":"This is the first Jeeves &amp; Wooster story Plum ever wrote. The main characters in this novel are Bertie and his valet Jeeves, a complete gentleman and the first to admit Bertie is a bit of a chump. There's also a wide collection of terrifying aunts, miserly uncles, love-sick friends and unwanted fiances that make the plot really witty. Bertie gets into a bit of a trouble when one of his pals, Bingo Little starts to fall in love with every second girl he lays his eyes on. But the soup gets really thick when Bingo decides to marry one of them and enlists Bertie's help. Luckily, he has the inimitable Jeeves to pull him out of it. Excellent entertainment and a good insight into life in England in the 1920s."},{"Title":"The Inimitable Jeeves","review":"Published in 1923, this first volume in the Jeeves series is a collection of short stories, all loosely tied together. Most of the stories in this collection center on Bertie's old school chum Bingo Little and his extraordinary propensity for falling in love with \`every second woman he meets.' Notable in this book is Jeeves's constant displeasure at some ill-chosen article of clothing belonging to the young master, and his haughty way of expressing his disapproval - and, of course, Bertie's constant giving in to Jeeves's wishes. Although not the funniest or wittiest of Wodehouse's books, it is a wonderful introduction to the characters and the unique humor and style of Wodehouse. The story that stands out to me in this collection, on the strength of its purely ingenious premise, is The Great Sermon Handicap, followed by The Purity of the Turf.See next: Carry On, Jeeves"},{"Title":"The Inimitable Jeeves","review":"This was my first Wodehouse book, and it remains my favorite.

The Inimitable Jeeves is just another cut out classic.Bingo, Bertie's \\"old pal\\" from school just can't stop falling in love. After all, there are tons of pretty waitresses out there. Bingo keeps falling in love and then devising plans to get his crotchety old uncle to let him marry. He gets so close to marrying, and then each time falls in love with a new girl right before the vows are said.Meanwhile, Aunt Agatha (Bertie's aunt) is out to get Bertie. She keeps on trying to get him married, something Bertie is quite happy not to do. Unfortunately, Aunt Agatha's pestering is nearly unbearable.The humorous twins Claude and Eustace are up to their usual trouble. The twins (whom George and Fred from Harry Potter are probably based after) keep borrowing money and asking favors from Bertie. They are traveling around the country, and getting on people's nerves.Finally there is Jeeves and Bertie, one of the most famous comic pairs of all time. Bertie Wooster, the not so smart schlep, and his brilliant butler, Jeeves make the perfect laugh out loud couple. Bertie is always getting himself tied up, and Jeeves always manages to get him untied. Bertie can't help running to Jeeves whenever he finds himself in a muddle. Unless, of course, Jeeves is worked up in a snit about Bertie's purple socks or other apparel. When it comes to changing into different clothes so that Jeeves will like the attire, Bertie puts his foot down....sometimes.Whichever character you like most, and whichever episode strikes your intrest, you are sure to be tickled pink with this witty and humorous novel."},{"Title":"The Inimitable Jeeves","review":"This is a pretty early Jeeves &amp; Wooster (not, I think, the very first, as somebody says below) and it suffers a bit from being a rambling collection of episodes tied up with the absolute slimmest of attempts at an overall theme. Broadly speaking, it deals with the repeated encounters between Bertie and the irrepressible Bingo Little, whose amorous misadventures make up most of the book. There's a slight uncertainty about Bertie's diction; Wodehouse is too keen to emphasise Bertie's stupidity, which leads to a certain repetitiveness, and the book lacks the inspired lunatic poetry of later stories. Still, it does contain the classic line about &quot;aunt calling to aunt like mastodons bellowing across the primeval swamp&quot;, and it's clearly a test-bed for many later ideas.But if you're a Wodehouse beginner, I'd direct you first to &quot;Joy in the Morning&quot; or the all-time classic &quot;The Code of the Woosters&quot;. Wodehouse's genius wasn't just his sense of humour, it's his benignity; you can be a raging left-wing anarchist like me and still find his books a delight, because he has so few prejudices and is capable of being so funny about almost nothing at all. He is amazingly lacking in malice. His books are absolutely not a useful guide to Britain in the 20s, or for that matter Britain at any time - they obey their own internal laws, and you either get it or you don't. That his career lasted from before Henry James' death to a time when Don DeLillo had already published three novels is something I find slightly appalling - but I'm still glad the books are there."},{"Title":"The Inimitable Jeeves","review":"Although \\"The Inimitable Jeeves\\" is not the first appearance of the famous double act, Jeeves and Wooster, it is the first book to be 'completely' dedicated to them. It was first published in 1923, and was originally known in America as, simply, \\"Jeeves\\".The book is set in the 1920s England and features Wodehouse's best known creations : Bertie Wooster and his valet, Jeeves. Bertie is the book's wealthy, good-natured and rather dim narrator. He's a member of the \\"idle rich\\" and, rather than having to work for a living, lives off an allowance provided by his uncle. He spends much of his time in the bar-room of the Drones Club, is fond of the occasional wager and has an appalling dress sense. Luckily, Bertie has Jeeves to look after him. Without Jeeves, Bertie's life would be a mess : he makes an excellent hangover cure, his bets usually win and he's intelligent enough to rescue Bertie from nearly any situation. He disapproves of Bertie's more garish items of clothing, and will - occasionally - take it upon himself to deal with the offending item.All of the short stories are connected and most of them involve Bertie's friend Bingo Little, who is always falling in love - occasionally while still 'officially' in love with another. It's Bingo who most consistently drops Bertie into trouble : Bingo's schemes generally aim for an increase in his allowance from his Uncle, with the intention of marrying his latest girlfriend. Generally, Bingo's intended is a girl his uncle wouldn't approve of - so he ropes Bertie and Jeeves into helping him out. There are also appearances for Bertie's troublesome cousins, Claude and Eustace, a devious bookmaker called Steggles and Bertie's fearsome Aunt Agatha. Bertie is held in very low esteem by Agatha, but she is determined that Bertie should marry - Bertie's opinion, as far as she is concerned, is irrelevant.A very easy and enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Inimitable Jeeves","review":"Bertie Wooster, a well-heeled but \\"mentally negligible\\" London bachelor, is the enjoyable narrator of this comic novel from Edwardian era England. The book is really more of a collection of stories, pulled loosely together by the impulsive romances of Bingo Little, Bertie's old school chum and \\"friend for more than 15 years,\\" who mooches meals and cigarettes and falls in and out of love with the most inappropriate people. Lack of intelligence is no affront to Bertie's self respect, since -- as a member of the \\"upper classes\\" -- he is \\"so sunk in callous self-indulgence\\" that he restricts his life primarily to drinking, eating, gambling and occasionally being terrorized by his aunts. However, when Bertie faces imminent matrimony with Honoraria Glossip, the amazonian daughter of the \\"eminent loony-doctor\\" -- when Bertie is swindled into putting a deposit on stolen pearls -- when Bertie's life is disrupted by his two \\"excreascenceses, \\" nephews Claude and Eustace, who suffer from an excess of the \\"sporting spirit\\" -- when Bingo becomes a street-preaching socialist in order to win the woman of his heart -- -- when Bertie is persuaded to pose as the romance writer Rosie M Banks, in order to appeal to Bingo's father on his behalf . . . when Bertie, as he so frequently does, lands in the soup -- he always turns to literature's most famous valet, his perfect manservant Jeeves. With cool and intellectual precision, Jeeves invariably solves the problem with a few deft strokes, and sometimes a little Shakespeare thrown in. Although Bertie almost always ends up a the butt of the joke, his good humor and benign temperament ensure a happy ending with no hard feelings. Jeeves and Bertie are one of Wodehouse's most successful creations, and following them through their adventures is a pleasure that no reader should miss.--Auralgo"},{"Title":"The Inimitable Jeeves","review":"The Twenties produced several notable works of fiction, and right there in with the best of them is this, the most delightful of all the Jeeves and Wooster entries.Composed of a running series of short stories originally published in the Strand and Cosmopolitan magazines, \\"The Initimable Jeeves\\" achieves its distinction through the remarkable quality level of the stories combined with the full blossoming of two of the more notable and best-loved characters in all of fiction, Bertie Wooster and Jeeves. They would be paired again many times, but here they are given probably the best pure story material they would ever enjoy.This was one of the most popular books of the twenties; first published in 1923, in a decade and a half it sold over 3 million copies. To put that figure in perspective, \\"Gone With the Wind\\" , the best-seller to end all best-sellers, needed a full decade to surpass 3 million in sales. (Though admittedly Margaret Mitchell's tome came at a much steeper price!)If you like Wodehouse you'll love \\"The Inimitable Jeeves\\".Fans of the Hugh Laurie Television series will discover more episodes were adapted from this book than any two of the rest!"},{"Title":"The Inimitable Jeeves","review":"Bertie Wooster has a good heart--and it constantly gets him into trouble. To help pal Bingo Little's romantic fortunes, Bertie impersonates a female novelist, has tea with a band of revolutionaries and accidently becomes engaged to a girl he doesn't really like. To placate his aunt Agatha, Bertie must prevent a Broadway debut, ride herd on his rambunctious cousin and submit to an examination by an eminent nerve specialist. Thank goodness faithful valet Jeeves is always standing in the wings with a brilliant plan to extricate Bertie from even the stickiest of wickets.P. G. Wodehouse had an amazing ability to craft witty, wacky and thoroughly wonderfully stories. While The Inimitable Jeeves lacks some of the polish found in later works, it is nonetheless sparkling gem of a volume that is sure to tickle your funny bone. A must-have for any Wodehouse devotee, this book is also accessible to first-time readers.Highly recommended for everyone who needs a little laughter in their lives."},{"Title":"The Inimitable Jeeves","review":"This is the first collection of short stories with Bertie Wooster and Jeeves. The stories are loosely linked with fun references in later stories to earlier events; for example, to the time Bertie had a bedroom full of cats leading to a looney doctor thinking him crazy.I love it. A must for any Jeeves fan."},{"Title":"The Inimitable Jeeves","review":"This funny volume by English comic writer P. G. Wodehouse is really a series of loosely connected short stories. Most of them (though not all) deals with dim witted bachelor Bertie Wooster, with the help of his inimitable and intelligent butler Jeeves, trying to help his friend Bingo Little, who can't fail to fall in love with the first woman in his sight. Bingo fears that if his uncle doesn't like the current woman he is wooing, he will cut the rent he depends on for living. By the time Bertie and Jeeves has the problem kind of sorted out, Bingo has lose interest in the woman. The other stories deal with Bertie trying to get himself out of his own problems, and with his aunt Agatha, who is always looking for a woman to marry him. Very funny sort of frivolous comedy."},{"Title":"The Inimitable Jeeves","review":"Delightful listening especially on a long car trip. Reader is excellent.

One might say that all of Wodehouse's books are similar, or almost formulaic, but to that I say, \\"If it ain't broke, then why try to fix it?\\"This book is a collection of stories about Bertie's efforts to get his friend Bingo Little out of the trouble that is caused by Bingo's romantic entanglements. All the stories tie in together, but in typical Wodehouse fashion, they all have a little something different to offer the reader.I would place this at the middle of the pack in the Jeeves series, but still worth a read."},{"Title":"The Inimitable Jeeves","review":"Write this on my tombstone \\"He read and reread every word that P. G. Wodehouse ever wrote.\\" I am in the process of reading Wodehouse books. On a second reading of this book, it pains me to write that this (same goes for Thank you, Jeeves) is not best in the Jeeves series. Inimitable Jeeves is pretty good till chapter 13 but then it seems the great PG just phoned the rest in - all the betting on sermons, village fair races, oye ve!By wodehousian standards, I gave only two stars but if the author was someone else, say Tom Sharp, I would have given 3 or 4 stars."},{"Title":"The Inimitable Jeeves","review":"I read this book many years ago and it's still refreshing and highly enternaining."},{"Title":"The Inimitable Jeeves","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. This book does no justice to the Jeeves line of stories. It is disjointed, and not in the least bit funny. If you really want to see Wodehouse at his best, I would recommend &quot;Thank You Jeeves&quot;. Anybody who reads this book will be off Wodehouse for life, that's for sure."},{"Title":"The Inimitable Jeeves","review":"This book isn't quite a novel, but rather a series of related short stories that approximate one. Each works quite well in this context and contains the usual Wodehouse verbal charm, but with the added bonus of allowing you to absorb the whole scene without need to reference much of the rest.What you miss out on is the author's (unique, at least in the past century) ability to weave an intricate and unblemished plot over two hundred and fifty pages, but it can be fun to examine a thread in detail from time to time."},{"Title":"The Inimitable Jeeves","review":"Jonathan Cecil has the genius to bring Jeeves and Wooster to life. If you've not experienced the absolute brilliance of Wodehouse, then this is the one to begin with. I've listened to these tapes at least 100 times while driving or doing some domestic chore. They remain as fresh and delightful as ever..an inspiration to be good humored and innocent throughout our lives."},{"Title":"The Inimitable Jeeves","review":"The Inimitable Jeeves was my introduction to Wodehouse and the colorful world of Bertie Wooster; I loved it! As a matter of fact, I'm now a die-hard fan of Wodehouse. When Bertie becomes engaged to Honoria Glossop, quite by accident and due entirely to Bingo Little, Honoria's father, Sir Roderick Glossop, becomes concerned. Sir Roderick deals with people who are mentally unstable, or, as Bertie phrases it, 'looney.' Unfortunately or, if you know anything of Honoria Glossop, fortunately, Bertie's dead Uncle Henry was 'looney'; Henry kept eleven pet rabbits in his bedroom! Well, due to old Uncle Henry, Sir Roderick wants to meet with Bertie so that he may ascertain whether Bertie is or is not 'looney.' Fortunately for Bertie, Claude and Eustace, Bertie's younger cousins, come to London. Unbeknownst to Bertie, they are in London to steal items so that they may become members of a club at Oxford. When Sir Roderick comes to Bertie's home for luncheon and, of course, to ascertain Bertie's mental stability, or lack thereof, the items stolen by Claude and Eustace cause quite a ruckus! I won't ruin the hilarity of that chapter by describing anymore of the events. Suffice it to say that chapter 8 is HILARIOUS!! All in all, I couldn't have been more pleasantly surprised by this enjoyable book."},{"Title":"The Inimitable Jeeves","review":"First the \\"Publishers Weekly\\" Starred Review says \\"Martin Jarvis brings the madcap world of Bertie Wooster and his brilliant valet Jeeves to life...\\" that may well be so, but not in THIS edition; the reader is Simon Callow, NOT Martin Jarvis.Second, while there are some authors whose works should be abridged to the point of non-existence, Wodehouse is certainly not among them -- an abridgement of any Wodehouse work is tantamount to slicing off pieces of the Mona Lisa so it fits your frame better."},{"Title":"The Inimitable Jeeves","review":"Dash it all - a chap has to read Wodehouse from time to time, what? Just the sort of pep a fellow needs when he's feeling rummy. This Bertie Wooster, he's a perfectly harmless bird, but Jeeves now - well, he's a most amazing cove. Anyhow, it's just a dashed fine book. What ho!"},{"Title":"The Inimitable Jeeves","review":"I can't recall reading a more consistently comical book in my whole life. I wasn't sure at the start if I was going to enjoy this. For one thing, what do most of us have in common with the idle rich of 1920's England? These blokes spend most of their days carefree and content, engaging in such benign activities as hanging out at the local bar all day and gambling on everything from the ponies to what was dubbed \\"the great Sermon Handicap\\". The latter is essentially a bet about which of the parsons in the area (there are about a dozen total) end up performing the longest sermon on Sunday. What a life huh?Bertie Wooster, our main protagonist, is a couple of IQ points above being labeled a true simpleton. He is however, despite all of his shortcomings, an extremely likeable chap all the same. Bertie would be lost in this world if it weren't for his valet, his right-hand man - Mr. Jeeves. Although Jeeves may be a man of few words, there is no doubt of his wisdom every time he does open his mouth to speak. He consistently saves the day, and keeps Bertie's chaotic life from becoming an absolute catastrophe. The refined, conservative Jeeves also does his best in preventing Bertie from dressing like a total nerd (their constant battles over Bertie's eccentric style of clothing is priceless!). On top of that, Bertie's best friend Bingo keeps falling in love with every female he sees with a pulse (which of course calls for Jeeves assistance as well). And lastly, to add even more flavor to this already colorful crew is Bertie's Aunt Agatha. This rich, pretentious, highfalutin' dame is something else to say the least. She reminds me a bit of a more refined Hyacinth Bucket from that classic British sitcom \\"Keeping up Appearances\\". Bottom line, the whole bloody bunch is absolutely hilarious!There is nothing in this light-hearted book that is going to broaden your intellect and make you any more enlightened or wiser. However, if you are looking to have some fun, not have to think too hard, and also want to laugh, than this book is ideal for you. I am greatly looking forward to reading quite a bit more of these Jeeves & Wooster books. If they are anything like this one, I am going to be one happy man (there are thirteen more!). It took me a while, but I am glad I finally got around to reading Wodehouse. The chap definitely had a unique sense of humor and I enjoy his facile, sunny style of writing.I give it a solid 4.5 stars. A whole lot of fun!"},{"Title":"The Inimitable Jeeves","review":"The Inimitable Jeeves by P.G. Wodehouse can best be described in one simple word: FUN. Fortunatley, by surfing Amazon and its denizens fine reviews, I was able to stumble on this fine author. My interest was piqued by the reviews I read, so I decided to give the Jeeves and Wooster series a try. I began with season one of the televised Wooster and Jeeves and was thoroughly impressed. I then read this delightful book, after reading some short stories. This book is great fun and features the warm, sometimes competetive, relationship between Bertie Wooster and his \\"inimitable\\" valet Jeeves. With much help from supporting players. Especially the goofball Bingo, this book features a variety of light stories all brought together. Do yourself a favor, like I did, join the many fans of this great author and these fun characters. 5 Stars!"},{"Title":"The Inimitable Jeeves","review":"I remember reading Wodehouse so many years ago when I was a child, and somehow I am not too impressed with the subject matter this time; perhaps I should have selected a different book from Wodehouse.

Wish it was in the standard format.Gave away."},{"Title":"The Inimitable Jeeves","review":"I will say, first and foremost, that P.G. Wodehouse is an excellent author, and his stories of Jeeves & Wooster are some of the best British comedy I've read. \\"The Inimitable Jeeves\\" is worth reading, but don't get this edition. I have no criticisms for the stories themselves.The book is printed in a graceless monospace font that tends to blur together while reading. There are numerous typographical errors, such as line breaks in the middle of a line, random indentation, missing characters (i.e. blank 'boxes' where a letter or punctuation mark should be) and spelling errors. The number of errors per page increases in the latter half of the book, as if the copy editor gave up halfway through. (The random line breaks are prevalent throughout.) This, as you can imagine, makes a jarring reading experience that detracts from the joy of Wodehouse's stories and characters.Not to judge a book by its cover, but I really must bring it up: The covers are HORRIBLE. These grainy, low-resolution photographs are even rather creepy. The covers add to the overall feeling that this was a half-assed attempt at cashing in on Wodehouse's name."},{"Title":"The Inimitable Jeeves","review":"P.G. Wodehouse was a master satirist of the British upper class and his series of Jeeves novels are his most popular and well known works. This particular edition is one of the earliest Jeeves novels as I understand it and it is very funny. Bertie Wooster and his valet Jeeves find themselves in numerous sticky situations surrounding Berties friends and relatives. Usually just as there seems no way out the reader learns that Jeeves somehow has done something behind the scenes to manipulate circumstances to a positive outcome. A collection of characters including a cranky old Aunt, two incorrigible cousins and a few young ladies who are the love interests of Bertie's friend round out the cast. All in all a light hearted and amusing novel."},{"Title":"The Inimitable Jeeves","review":"Witty and funny. A must for anyone who appreciates British authors with an acute sense of humor.

Turn off the news and read how Jeeves figures everything out."},{"Title":"The Inimitable Jeeves","review":"My mother loved Wodehouse, and I picked up a Jeeves book when I was a teenager. I now have the complete collection and return to it often. Deeply funny, face-paced, well-written."},{"Title":"The Inimitable Jeeves","review":"The Jeeves audio books are terrific fun!

If you can't buy one, at least pick it up at a local library."},{"Title":"The Inimitable Jeeves","review":"P. G. Wodehouse, one of Britain's most well known comic writers, wrote these short stories in 1924 featuring the memorable Bertie Wooster and his valet Jeeves. The character Jeeves has been the basis for many fictional valets and butlers, both on the page and on the screen. As such, Jeeves immediately seems familiar. In addition to creating these colorful characters, Wodehouse also delights with his playful use of language."},{"Title":"The Inimitable Jeeves","review":"Every reader needs comfort: something to retreat to when things aren't going as planned, a calm oasis of perfection while the storm rages outside. For me, the books of P.G. Wodehouse perfectly fit that bill. Even better, he wrote over a hundred of them in his long life, so I'm still able to read new books when I need them.And so I turned to The Inimitable Jeeves after one nice novel that wasn't what I had thought it would be, an aborted reading of a tedious science fiction \\"satire,\\" and a few false starts.Inimitable is from 1923, and was the first novel-length appearance of Jeeves (and his employer -- \\"master\\" would be entirely the wrong word -- Bertram Wilberforce Wooster, one of the idlest of the idle rich and dullest of the Drones), though it was actually a fix-up of eleven previously published stories. Its stop-and-start pacing betrays that origin, but Wodehouse has turned the stories into a continuous plot, so it all feels like one book, even if it isn't quite a novel.As always, Bertie is dim and continually getting into scrapes -- the ones in this book mostly concern the lovelife of his friend Bingo Little, who keeps falling into love with unlikely females and calling for Bertie's help to win them. Bertie, of course, is very little help, but Jeeves's plots are cunning and true...though they're not always designed to do what Bingo or Bertie would like.Inimitable is not quite top-drawer Wodehouse; it sees him still tuning the instrument of the Jeeves-Wooster stories, and organizing the elements that he would later turn into the most exquisite of farces. But \\"not quite as good as Wodehouse later got\\" is still vastly better than most modern humorists, and the world of Jeeves and Wooster is so timeless -- one part Gay Nineties, one part Roaring Twenties, one part pre-war gaiety, and several parts pure Wodehousian invention -- that it never feels dated.And, as always, I have to give high praise to The Overlook Press, which has been publishing Wodehouse's books, four or six of them a year, in these wonderful small editions, for about a decade now. They make Wodehouse's work not just a joy to read, but a joy to have on the shelf."},{"Title":"The Inimitable Jeeves","review":"What amazes me more than anything else about Wodehouse's fiction is how timeless it is. I remember reading this, being surprised it was written towards the start of the century, because it read like it could have been written just this year. Nothing I or anyone else could say could do justice to this book or Wodehouse in general. It's simply some of the best comedy ever written, but at the same time with sophisticated writing. I don't see how anyone wouldn't enjoy this. Even my little sister, who hates reading, loves these books. This is one of the best of his books and an excellent place to start. Highly recommended to anyone who wants a good laugh."},{"Title":"The Inimitable Jeeves","review":"A wonderful book by the master of wit!

Related is a disappearance of a school girl (Margaret Sosi) will lead Jim from the New Mexico landscape to the Los Angeles area. There with Hillerman's gift for description we also get a contrasting look of the different worlds. Will He find the girl and what does the puzzle spell out, or will it ever become clear?This is a close continuation of \\"People of Darkness\\" so many of the descriptions and people were previously defined in that book. The reason people read Hillerman is mostly for the descriptions of the places and people his characters encounter. As seen in previous books, in the description of Margaret and other characters, he incorporates his real life experience with World War II and its aftermath."},{"Title":"Art Marketing Handbook: Marketing Art in the Nineties","review":"I have read (and own) several art marketing books and this is by far the best one yet. It is very complete in every aspect of art marketing. The table of contents alone it 7 pages long!!Goodman starts out discussing the psychology of art collectors and how to get to understand them. This alone is worth the price of the book! Imagine knowing how to think like a buyer!! From there is covers how to promote the art, creating a marketing plan, how to design a gallery, pricing, ethics, contracts hiring and training gallery employees etc.The only problem- if you want to call it that- is that it reads like a text book an takes a little time going through, but the reading is easy, unlike most text books.This is a must have for gallery owners, artists, art reps and anyone interested in making a living in the arts."},{"Title":"And So It Goes","review":"Linda Ellerbee is the Queen of Hard Knocks, but she always comes up wiser -- and funnier. &quot;And So It Goes&quot; is a sharp and brutally honest look at the world of TV news. Ellerbee shares behind-the-scenes tales that will leave you shaking your head in disbelief, and catching your breath in uproarious laughter. Ellerbee is engaging, lively, provocative and above all else, frightening. NBC fired her months after the book was originally published, probably in no small part to the toes that Ellerbee stepped on in this book. Read it to see why.I teach journalism, and to this day, I still recommend this to my friends. I can also honestly say that this is probably my favorite book of all time. It's that good."},{"Title":"And So It Goes","review":"Direct, honest, and brilliantly written, Ellerbee's masterwork gives the reader an inside look into the world of broadcast journalism. Her 80's program NBC News Overnight was a unique vehicle for intelligent reporting and videography. It was the last show of its kind on network news TV which, if anything, has gotten worse since the writing of this book. When Ellerbee's Nickelodeon children's programs are more intelligently written than most of the so called &quot;adult&quot; news programs on TV, that's scary. It is unfortunately the case."},{"Title":"And So It Goes","review":"There are some books that should never be resigned to the dustbin and this is one of them. The message is timeless and, despite the humor, frightening. Ms. Ellerbee's wisdom is needed more today than it was back in 1988."},{"Title":"And So It Goes","review":"This book is great therapy for all of us who realize that the world is insane, not us."},{"Title":"And So It Goes","review":"I've probably read this book a dozen times from cover to dog-eared cover; my paperback copy is literally falling apart! I still open it sometimes just to read a couple of pages from the middle, and I'm always entertained by Ellerbee's wit.Wit: a combination of rational intelligence and humour. Ellerbee displays both in abundance, and her writing style is pitch-perfect. She's worked in network news long enough to have seen all of it's strength and weaknesses, and long enough to have lived through one-too-many comical misadventures. Some of her anectodal experiences are downright hilarious:Stealing Reagan's golf cart for a joyride. Spying on a button manufacturer from a rooftop across the street (to learn before the competing networks who'll be chosen vice president for a presidential campaign). Getting unintentionally stuck in the middle of a homecoming parade for the Iran hostages. Using dinner trays to &quot;surf&quot; down the aisle of a flying airplane. A rubber duck on the set. A &quot;thing and a thing.&quot; And so it goes...There are also some suprising revelations, such as Ellerbee's confession to a back-alley abortion, and her discovery that Ohio didn't become a state until 1954!Read this book and be entertained... and simoultaneously enlightened about the field of broadcast journalism."},{"Title":"And So It Goes","review":"There can be few things more enriching, entertaining, and inspiring than merrily wending one's way through the fascinating memoirs of this legendary journalist. Ms. Ellerbee can now be seen on her marvelous news program for children on Nickelodeon, which is one of the greatest programs in the history of television. Ms. Ellerbee's thrilling story is sure to deeply touch all who read it, evoking both tears and laughter, often simultaneously. This is one of the greatest books in the history of the world, and should be on every required reading list in every institution of learning in the world."},{"Title":"And So It Goes","review":"It was a pleasure to read about another journalist's battle in succeeding in one of the most competitive field.

(I'm only using the book as reference not collection.) Still, the book reeks of cigarette smoke."},{"Title":"Life is Too Short","review":"Mickey Rooney is a force to be reckoned with. He began his career on the stage; both of his parents were performers. As a toddler, he looked more like a midget than a baby, so he was cast in various roles as such. Hal Roach's Little Rascals series' popularity gave reason for Rooney to star in his own series as a kid as Mickey McGuire. Later, he moved his way into the \\"in\\" crowd, rubbing elbows with some of the most famous names in classic Hollywood. A B-picture that took America by storm, however, cemented his fame as the mischievious son of a judge with a heart of gold. Mickey Rooney became Andy Hardy in the hearts and minds of millions and also began his long companionship with Judy Garland. When WWII came, Rooney joined up to entertain the troops. Afterward, he juggled his way through eight wives and a downward spiral that left him struggling to revive his career.This book has certain elements that make it seem like a tell-all biography, but it is also good at covering the areas that most readers are interested in. Rooney's vibrant personality shines through the entire book and really helps it flow. The chapters are short too.It is obvious that Rooney is a conflicted person, but also that he truly loves performing and the people he was associated with through his life. His love for Garland shines brightly and makes one wonder if she was the love of his life only he didn't notice until it was too late. Rooney is not bitter about his many wives; he never says anything to tarnish their names and he accepts blame for the failure of the relationships.Overall, this is an honest, entertaining, and enjoyable book."},{"Title":"Life is Too Short","review":"I always admired Mickey Rooney as a performer. He had tremendous talent. What a shame he lived his personal life the way he did. Even though I wasn't born until 1947, I grew up watching his movies on TV. I obtained a copy of the book recently and it is a quick and easy read. Yet I was astounded to read about his sexual exploits written in such a way that they belonged more in in a porn manner than in a book about his life. Obviously, Mickey isn't a gentleman and yet this book was supposedly written *after* he found God. About halfway through the book, when he related another startling episode about his life, I said to myself, \\"He's making that up.\\" While most of the book is probably based on truth, I think Mickey also created some events out of his wise-cracking mind and then came to believe them himself, especially since those who could call him on them are now dead. While disappointed in him I will still watch his movies whenever I get the chance."},{"Title":"Life is Too Short","review":"I'm a big fan of Mickey Rooney and have been meaning to give this book a try for some time. It is a nice, entertaining read. Interesting to see things behind the scenes from Mickey's view; he tells his story well. I sat down to check out a chapter or two before bed and ended up halfway through the book before having to force myself to put it down.There are a lot of comments about the language chosen in come parts of the books. From the reviews, I was expecting something shocking; almost afraid to read because it would damage my opinion of him. And although he uses some words that I personally don't care for at times, it's far from being vulgar or offensive. I'm 26 years old, so I guess that may have something to do with my pov on this. Older generations of Rooney fans may find this language off putting, but I personally didn't see the big deal. He's a guy. A guy that grew up fast in a world of constant temptation. Heck, if I was a girl back in those days, I'd want a kiss or two from him! I like the fact that he wasn't prim and proper; you get to see inside his head and I actually like and respect him more after reading this book.His marriage to Ava Gardner was an interesting read. It had a big impact on him. He was a young man on the top of the world at that time and although he made mistakes, she did too. They were both a bit selfish, but they were so young and in an industry where you had to look out for #1 to make it. It seems that she used him a lot, but it also seems that he didn't appreciate his young wife like he should have. I can definitely see things from both sides of the argument; if my husband had played golf the first day of our honeymoon and told me to come WATCH him, it wouldn't have ended very well for him lets just put it that way. But the part where she ended things by telling him she was tired of being with a midget, I thought that was a little harsh from her end, especially if you truly love someone. But, I guess that's what you get trying to build a marriage on sex and looks alone.In all his marriages, he does take responsibility for their failing. In all honesty, it just sounded like he wasn't ready to be married for a long time; he was too selfish. And a life in the Hollywood scene seems like it would take its toll on any marriage.I like how he told of his personal life and the effect it had on his movies. I wanted to pop a few DVDs in to see if I could see the impact from everything that was going on from behind the scenes. It breaks my heart how Hollywood chews up some of its most talented of stars. It's definitely a cold industry and a way of life most will never know about. I'm glad Mickey pushed his way through the hard times and is still kickin today.All in all, I really enjoyed this book and it furthered my love and appreciation for him. It would be awesome to see a movie made of his life, it is an incredible journey. But who other than the great Mickey Rooney could play Mickey Rooney? Talent like his is non-existent in Hollywood these days. Pick up this book; if you're a Rooney fan, you'll love it as much as I have."},{"Title":"Life is Too Short","review":"Mickey Rooney's 1993 autobiography is equally divided between his show biz memories and tales of his romantic exploits. He love of performing began when he first performed in vaudeville at the age of two. On to Hollywood, where he found steady work in silent pictures and became a box-office hit with theAndy Hardymovies and his musicals with Judy Garland. In the fifties, his star dimmed, but he has kept working and says he'll never retire.Rooney writes with surprisingly little hubris and is honest about his addictions to drugs, gambling, and women. He married eight times but also romanced just about every beautiful woman he met. The book is chatty and energetic and I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. There are many movie and personal photos. Fans of Mickey and those interested in the golden age of Hollywood will enjoy this upbeat memoir."},{"Title":"Life is Too Short","review":"yes, i read mickey rooney's \\"life is too short\\", and i thought it to be an excellent read. his experiences and accomplishments are so vast and well told that there is a definite vicarious feeling one gets even in the comfort of one's recliner.too, i identify with him because our ages are the same, eighty eight this year, 2008. i missed him as mickey mcguire, but picked up on him with the judy garland-mickey rooney tour de forces and many other movies which followed.he is a natural. not a regular high school nor college graduate but a graduate of the \\"school of hard knocks.\\" and let me tell you he absorbed all the wisdom that this school had to offer. true he might have gotten a \\"d or an f\\" in some of that school's curricula, but for the most part he learned how to live and especially, \\" how to pick yourself up when knocked on your a--.it is a pity how the world forgets, your only as good as yesterday's triumph. but here is a talent that transcends all of the yesterdays. here is a phenomenon, a guy with talent galore."},{"Title":"Life is Too Short","review":"For any fan of Hollywood's Golden Age, Mickey Rooney's LIFE IS TOO SHORT is a good read. As expected, Mickey covers in detail his relationships with Judy Garland, Louis B. Mayer and his eight wives. Every so often though, Rooney goes a bit too far. His detailed description of first wife Ava Gardner's privates and how she used them in bed were tasteless, as are the stories of teenaged Mick's first trip to a Hollywood bordello in the company of Milton Berle and his chance encounter with a naked Tallulah Bankhead doing something to her girlfriend. Also unnecessary was a mention of Judy Garland's brief affair with another woman.Less-prurient tabloid-type info concerns the agent who bilked Rooney out of a few million dollars, the woefully underpaid actor's battles with MGM for equitable compensation (a struggle he never did win), his abuse of alcohol and pills, and the murder of Mickey's fifth wife at the hands of an illicit lover.Put together, all of the above tantalizing tidbits wouldn't fill a single chapter in this 340 page* story of a most remarkable life. The general tone is upbeat-- one of perseverence and personal triumph. Rooney's advice to one and all in this book's last few paragraphs is both simple yet sage and is clearly gained from a long, eventful and occasionally painful life.TheFOREVER YOUNG: Mickey Rooney 4 Movie Packoffers up an Andy Hardy film, a western, a crime drama and a racecar film, all starring this cinematic giant.*hardcover"},{"Title":"Life is Too Short","review":"I am 5'4\\" and Mickey is one inch shorter so I was curious about how he dealt with this obvious aspect of his life. He didn't let it worry him really. He just plows through life at full speed. He has a great writing style and should write more books. I enjoyed this book very much as my family was invovled in the Hollywood movie industry. One aspect of his life is dealt with vivid detail.....his sex life. A subtitle of this autobiography could have been...\\"Horny Boy Makes the Big Time In Hollywood\\". Being a guy, I can certainly understand and have some empathy with him. Been there and done that myself. Highly recommended, a fun and fast read."},{"Title":"Life is Too Short","review":"..IN his autobio. LIFE IS TOO SHORT. Certainly a winning volume in the Bright and Shadowy side of Vaudeville and Hollywood, and he details heavily his struggles as the \\"Grown Up\\" \\"Andy Hardy\\". The ONLY place I warn readers about it, be prepared to read unsavory details about many Great, Classic Hollywood Stars. Mr Rooney's remembrances are, of course, one opinion, so take it with a grain of salt , but if your illusions over Great Names like Spencer Tracy, Fred Astaire, Clark Gable and etc matter, then let this one go.(Drunken orgies are Not much fun to read about or imagine, esp when QUALITY mattered in Hollywood. Imagining Rooney, Tracy, Mr AStaire and Gable all passed out on a bed, is NOT my idea of entertainment, and I seriously doubt his voracity here. Also intimate details of his bedroom dalliances are not needed either..There is NO DOUBT Mickey Rooney is a LEGEND, also according to himself, in the bedroom too (Face it the man has had 8 marriages); his \\"Love Affair\\"/Deep Friendship with his beloved Judy Garland is touching to read of here..but I can't see picking this volume up to read a second time."},{"Title":"Life is Too Short","review":"I loved the book read it over several times as well as some other bios on him. Mickey has lived through quite a lot, some good times & some very hard times that could break a lesser man. He is probably one of the most under rated, Greatest talents ever to step into Hollywood.Sure he might of been a little graphic in some of his sexual experiences but he was telling it like it was. Hollywood back then was really no different from the way it is now. A famous kid with lots of dough in his pockets & girls throwing themselves at him, The older stars showing him the ropes its quite a temptation not to be part of the crowd. When a young man is brought up in an atmosphere such as he was, for instance being seduced by Norma Shearer a woman almost twice his age, He learned about sex early on of course it would have had some impact on his life as he grew older.Mickey talked a lot about his very close relationship with Judy, How they would goof around all the time on the sets trying to trip each other up. They would often hang out & talk of doing their own show together, He even hinted that maybe he let right one get away by saying what might of been if they would have gotten together. How he respected Judy in a way he didn't most other women & that respect might have kept him on the straight and narrow when everything around him might have tempted him to stray. Even to go as far as to say what there kids would be like.He told of his rise to the top and how MGM made them a star, but also made millions off them in the process leaving Judy & Mickey with minimal salaries.Mickey first met Sam Stiefel while he was on tour with Judy promoting Girl Crazy a nice guy with a great line. Sam impressed Mickey so much that they became good friends the kind of friend that would lend you money with no question. Sam would talk him into becoming his manager and eventually into leaving MGM altogether and starting his own production company. He could get him pictures making twice what he was making for MGM. Mick himself would be President and Sam would be his secretary/treasurer taking care of his finances & his mom while he was away in the army, only to end up robbing him blind & all but ruin his career with MGM.Mickey did have a very addictive behavior pills, gambling, & beautiful women would become his downfall. There would be many more setbacks in his life personally, Financially, as well as physically before he found his faith that would eventually pick him back up & lead him in the right direction. Mickey lives for an audience that's where he feels truly needed & loved I believe he will never stop working, for that's what keeps him going. Now 89 yrs old Mickey Is a True Survivor!!!!!"},{"Title":"Life is Too Short","review":"Coming as it does from one of Hollywood's finest, this is one of the best classic Hollywood books ever written. What I like especially is that Mickey doesn't feel it necessary to trash anyone. Mickey truly believes that his life has been a blessing & is still enormously grateful for his opportunities & the fabulous people he's worked with.A great read. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Life is Too Short","review":"This is the only book I've ever read about Mickey Rooney and it was very interesting. He doesn't hold much back. Good read if you are interested in stars of that era."},{"Title":"Life is Too Short","review":"I'm such a huge fan of this man. I think he is a comedy genius. He is always sooo fun to watch in his movies, especially his old ones from the MGM era. Of course my favorites are the ones he did with my idol Judy Garland. His life is so interesting and so ...fun too read simply becuase he went thru too much and he really knows how to tell a story whether you believe all his stories or not, is fun and interesting. Of course I love how wonderfully he speaks about his best friend Judy Garland. It even made me cry towards the end when he had to say goodbye to Judy. Great book for sure, that I finished it in less than 24hrs."},{"Title":"Life is Too Short","review":"Very interesting book.

And one of the greatest workhorses of the 20th century!He certainly isn't a writer and, surely, most of this book was dictated into a machine and then shaped by a ghostwriter. Here are some pleasant surprises...- There's virtually no lecturing or \\"life lessons\\"- He's willing to take shots at the Hollywood system and the agents that screwed him while acknowledging that he was very happy with most of his years at MGM- He's got a potty mouth- He devotes several sentences to describing exactly what Ava Gardner's [...] was like to, uh, \\"interact\\" with- He isn't the rambling, erratic, bizarre character he appeared to be in his public appearances in the 1990's and 2000's- He absolutely \\"gets\\" Judy Garland- He utterly owns his obsessive, manic, spend-thrift, addictive personality- The book putters along at a pleasant clipAnd there are some stories that sound totally false, but, hey, this is a great entertainer and spinner of tales.- Walt Disney named Mickey Mouse after him?- One evening he dated the daughter and then did her mother in a car?- Etc., etc.Read it!"},{"Title":"Life is Too Short","review":"I enjoy this book on Mickey ROoney's life.

If you like old Hollywood, you'll like this book."},{"Title":"Life is Too Short","review":"I've always liked Mickey Rooney. In this book, Mickey pulls no punches and tells it like it was. This was an excellent read and he gives tidbits of info that outside of Hollywierd Circles, you would not know about. Like Marlyn Monroe was known through out Hollywood as having a certain talent she liked to do/was known for as \\"the best in Hollywood.\\"The book was very informative and he talks about the way it was back then... no holds bared. I respect Mickey for that. He is a real man, a great talent, not afraid to disclose when he got hurt, and the fun times he had. Thanks Mickey!Your a Man's Man."},{"Title":"Life is Too Short","review":"All one needs to do to get a sense of Mickey Rooney's personal style is watch his cloying personal interviews for the THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT! movies -- he is self-appointed keeper of the flame for Hollywood's golden age. That being said, he lets loose in his book, allowing some of the less admirable qualities of the era to shine through. As much as one may like his films, it's difficult to like Rooney. Whether it's listing his wives in numerical order, or describing the genitalia of his leading ladies in gratuitous, nauseating detail, there's a tastelessness to the man that permeates the pages of his autobiography. There are also the expected Rooney exaggerations and invented conversations (e.g., quoting lyrics from a 1947 song in a 1938 interaction... When will actors ever realize that their fans are the ultimate gatekeepers of information and fact-check their own lives?). There's also something undeniably eerie about the book -- we are always painfully aware that it's the kind of autobiography that can only be published when a man has outlived all of the people he's writing about. If his contemporaries were alive, he wouldn't have dared. But it's not revealing as much as insensitive. Still, Rooney comes clean in certain ways, like admitting Ava Gardner only married him to further her career, and that is more than one usually expects from him. Mick has been around a long time -- the 'dirty old man' stories about him are legend at this point, and LIFE IS TOO SHORT really explains how he got that way."},{"Title":"Life is Too Short","review":"This book is awesome...if you read a bad review...IGNORE IT!!!!It's TOTALLY TRUE...ALL OF IT!What a LIFE, WHAT A LEGEND!5 STARS FOR MICKEY, my idol!I LOVE YOU MICkEY!"},{"Title":"Life is Too Short","review":"*RING!....*RING!McCARTHY : Uh....hullo?INTERVIEWER : Hello! We are here today with Internet reviewer, Stephen T. McCarthy, who is going to give us his impression of 'Life Is Too Short', the autobiography of Mickey Rooney.McCARTHY : Do you have any idea what time it is?INTERVIEWER : It's 3 A.M., but I'll ask the questions, Stephen, if you don't mind. We understand that unbeknownst to you, your Mother had an autographed copy of this book in her bookshelf for 13 years, which you just recently discovered and read.McCARTHY : Mmmm....yeah.INTERVIEWER : Tell us about it. In your Amazon review of 'The Black Stallion,' you raved about Rooney's performance, calling it one of filmdom's finest. Did you also enjoy his book?McCARTHY : Uh...not really. It relates a lot of interesting stories about Tinsel Town in the 1930s and 40s. And it will appeal to people who wish to learn more about the Stars and the Hollywood Studio System of those times. It also delivers the inside scoop on Mickey's eight marriages, and his relationship to Judy Garland.INTERVIEWER : What were some of the more surprising things you learned?McCARTHY : ZZZzzzzz....INTERVIEWER : Stephen?McCARTHY : Huh?...Oh! Uhm, well, according to Mickey, his discovery as a performer came as a result of a timely sneeze, and his life was narrowly spared a couple of times under odd circumstances. He seems to think it's every kid's dream to own an English sheepdog. The owner of Seabiscuit once spontaneously gave him an unsolicited opportunity to ride the famous racehorse hard for five-eighths of a mile. Mickey claims that during a chance encounter with a youthful Walt Disney, the artist decided to name his cartoon Mouse after him.INTERVIEWER : You sound skeptical.McCARTHY : Well...I dunno.INTERVIEWER : Stephen, we know that you consider laughter to be the liquor of life. Was there any humor in this autobiography?McCARTHY : Yeah, quite a bit. Of course, Mickey pokes fun at his well known lack of stature frequently. He once fought rival suitor, Howard Hughes over Ava Gardner : \\"Soon we were wrestling on Ava's front lawn, a gangling genius and a Hollywood gnome.\\" He jokes that he lost sixteen dollars at his first horse race and then spent the rest of his life and millions of dollars trying to win that sixteen dollars back. He tells of a stupendous night of hard drinking with Astaire, Cagney and Powell. Waking the next morning with stupendous hangovers, Rooney said, \\"I'm afraid I'm going to die.\\" To which Cagney replied, \\"I'm afraid I'm NOT going to die.\\" And Mickey declares, \\"There WAS a time when I wasn't married. I forget when. Fifteen or twenty minutes, I think, in 1968.\\" There's also a hilarious fan (?) letter from a Mrs. Ellie Jones of Idaho reprinted.INTERVIEWER : Well then, Stephen, why only the 3-Star rating?McCARTHY : ZZZzzzzz...INTERVIEWER : Stephen!McCARTHY : What? Oh...well...Just what is it about these gauche celebrities that compels them to publicly boast of their bedroom conquests? I hardly think we needed to know who Rooney got horizontal with, and when, where, and how many times. The guy seems to think he was writing for some skin magazine half the time. Describing in detail his wife's private parts was entirely uncalled for! He revels in telling us how he did this blonde and how he did that brunette, and how he did the sixteen Japanese gals in a Tokyo lovefest. Frankly, a good deal of this book is embarrassing, disappointing, classless, and too self-promotional. I dunno who \\"loved\\" Mickey the most, his rabid fans or his randy tarts.INTERVIEWER : Would you agree then that 'Life Is Too Short' could be summed up in the following verse? : It's true that the author is a man of renown / But his 'Life Is Too Short' may be partly tall tale / In which Mickey Rooney, the bad boy of 'Boys Town' / Bets the horse's nose and beds the Hollywood tail.*CLICK!INTERVIEWER : Hello?....Hello, Stephen?....Hmmm.

He said something though, that really stuck with me. He said, \\"I hope that none of you ever have to go through some of the things I did.\\" What a sweet way to describe that time, but also you get the sense that there is a lot of wisdom there too. Like he has more to share, more advice to give.He seems so happy now and the WAY he looks at his beautiful and talented wife (have you heard her sing?!)...I want to be that way with my hubby when we reach that age...true sitting in the rocking chair, front porch kind of love.I was looking for a new book by Mickey...already have this one (and it's great!), but a lot has happened since 1991...time stops for no man and certainly not Mickey!

He had great commercial and critical success in two different series - \\"Mickey McGuire\\" (60+ shorts from 1927-34) and \\"Andy Hardy\\" (16 films from 1937-58) - which is a feat rarely equaled in Hollywood history. Of all the child stars who ever appeared on screen, his career was the most lasting and one of very few that continued into adulthood. Apart from his phenomenal success with his series, Mickey had a third career as a song and dance man, often paired with his good friend Judy Garland (1922-69) in films like \\"Thoroughbreds Don't Cry\\" (1937) and Oscar nominated \\"Babes in Arms\\" (1939). Rooney was such a popular star in Hollywood's halcyon years from 1938 to 1940 his films made more money and he got more fan mail than Clark Gable, Errol Flynn, James Cagney, Bette Davis, Katherine Hepburn, and virtually every other actor in the business.Rooney's success as a child and then a juvenile star and then a song and dance man were only three aspects of his great talent. He showed his dramatic talent in films like \\"Boys Town\\" (1938), \\"Requiem for a Heavyweight\\" (1962) and \\"The Black Stallion\\" (1979). He was nominated for an Oscar 4 times over a period of 40 years, a feat rarely equaled by anyone in the industry. He was nominated for an Emmy 4 times and won for \\"Bill\\" (1981), for which he also won the Golden Globe.So what a treat it is for his fans to read \\"Life is Short\\", his 1991 autobiography. There's plenty of material about his childhood, his many wives and children, his sexual exploits, and his career. Here are some examples of his observations -* Spencer Tracy - \\"wasn't the God-like figure I'd imagined him to be...and he drank quite a bit.\\"* Victor Fleming - \\"a fabulous character...and so competent.\\"* Lionel Barrymore - \\"a class act. Not only was he a great actor, he wrote music and poetry. He painted. He sketched in charcoal.\\"* Wallace Beery - \\"a lovable shambling kind of guy...always knew when a little kid actor needed a smile and a wink or word of encouragement.\\"* Clark Gable - \\"had such terrible halitosis\\"* William Saroyan - \\"a good novelist, wasn't a good screenwriter; he didn't make his ideas come alive in a dramatic way.\\"* Charlie Chaplin - \\"one of the greatest film comedians of all time, maybe the greatest\\"* Donna Reed - \\"sweet and demure. Inside she was a tough dame.\\"* Anthony Quinn - \\"the actor's actor and one of the most consummate gentlemen in Hollywood.\\"* Jackie Gleason - \\"he was too busy being fat, eating too much, and drinking too much to be a complete human being.\\"* Jonathan Winters - \\"one of the first guys to do really good improvisational stuff.\\"* Francis Coppola - \\"one of the finest filmmakers in the land\\"This is an interesting book, reads well, and is full of material film fans will enjoy. If you don't know how really talented this guy is/was, you need to read this book. If you already know, you'll enjoy it even better."},{"Title":"The Real Witches' Coven: The Definitive Guide to Forming Your Own Wiccan Group","review":"I purchased this book as someone studying the craft as a solitary. The books I've read up until this one have been written for solitaries. I purchased this one because the books I'd read only briefly referenced covens or said that traditionally you had to be in a coven to be a witch. Since Covens were obviously a vital part of beleifs, history, and traditions, I saught out a book that would set the record strait on what covens really do.This book delivers. It's written primarily as a guide for a High Priestess. It describes in detail the life cycle of a coven, what kind of rules a coven should have, how dicipline works, how advancement in the circle works, and which rituals typically require people to be naked.She describes and suggests some common sabbat rituals, as well as an initiation ritual and a few other coven rituals. She talks a lot about the level of secrecy that should be kept about you coven. If you want to start a coven this is probably THE BOOK for you to read. It's also very informative if you want to join a coven. As far as information on the craft in general, there's some good stuff on the sabbats, but this isn't really a good book to read if you're &quot;just curious about witchcraft&quot;As a pleasant surprise, I found that Kate West is quite probably the most practical author on Witchcraft you could find. She deals with the effects of real life on the Craft on how these two parts of your life can effect each other.

Unfortunately, the second volume was never completed. The present publication is, therefore, the first volume of Kenney's original project. It covers primarily ecclesiastical sources dating to the period before the Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland (1169), although one of the chapters is concerned with references to Ireland found in the writings of ancient authors.The book is divided into eight chapters: I. History in Ireland; II. Ireland in the Ancient World (to about A.D. 700); III. The Irish Church in the \`Celtic' Period; IV. The Monastic Churches, Their Founders and Traditions: The Primitive Foundations; V. The Monastic Churches: Churches of the Sixth to Ninth Centuries; VI. The Expansion of Irish Christianity (seventh to twelfth century); VII. Religious Literature and Ecclesiastical Culture (seventh to twelfth century); VIII. The Reform Movement of the Twelfth Century. Particular documents, or groups of related documents, are listed in entries giving their title, date, bibliographic information (manuscripts, editions, and critical works), and a short discussion of their character and significance. The 659 sources thus listed comprise such texts as saints' lives, letters, administrative documents, poems, monastic rules and penitentials, and many more.Kenney's guide continues to be an essential reference work for historians and literary scholars alike, despite the fact that Irish studies have advanced considerably since its first appearance. The age of Kenney's work shows mainly in his dating of texts, and, obviously, in the bibliographic sections, which do not include publications less than forty years old. On the other hand, the meticulous scholarship and comprehensiveness of this work, as well as a very convenient layout - particular entries are numbered throughout for easy reference - make it impossible for a student of mediaeval Ireland to pursue their research without quoting Kenney at least once."},{"Title":"The Sources for the Early History of Ireland: Ecclesiastical (An Introduction and Guide)","review":"It's such an old book - it's first ediotion is from 1922, but it's still so useful for all the history students and scholars dealing with early Irish history. There are two reasons for that. Firstly - Kenney gathered and made comments on a huge amount of ecclesiastical sources from the earliest times till 12 th century in one book. Without this book, dealing with Irish history would be extremely hard job. Thanks to this book, we know, what we are looking for in the archives. Secondly - Kenney's comments are extremely well written and still valid because they are based on these sources, not on the wild fantasies, as usually when you are dealing with early Irish history. I stronly recommend this book to all the people who seriously think about the subject and want to know everything about the sources. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Deadly Truth: A Novel Based Upon Actual Events in South Africa Under Apartheid","review":"I probably would never have found this book had Amazon.com not recommended it - and I would have missed a hidden treasure. \\"Deadly Truth\\" is a gripping, \\"can't put it down,\\" novel based in apartheid-era South Africa. David Bellon, the main character, is a liberal CEO of a food conglomerate in the Cape Province who tries, in his own way, to ameliorate the inequities of his society. Through a series of events which I won't describe here (I don't want to spoil the plot!), Bellon is forced to do more, and thus runs afoul of Police Captain Eichstadt, whose unique interrogation methods are described in gruesome detail.What makes this book so compelling is its honesty -- it is clearly based on a true story. \\"Ceresdal,\\" the fictitious town in which events take place, sounds like the real town of Stellenbosch, and one of the authors was the CEO of an agribusiness in South Africa. What goes on in the Ceresdal police station is in accord with non-fiction reports about the South African Bureau of State Security (BOSS). Thus, there is more than a ring of truth here - you get the feeling that these events actually occurred, and only the names have been changed to protect the innocent (and guilty.)I have strong interests in South African history and in Jewish history, and hence was drawn to a story featuring Jews in South Africa. Those who share these interests, or those who just want a picture of apartheid-era South Africa, will enjoy this book. But you needn't care one way or the other about South Africa to enjoy \\"Deadly Truth.\\" The book stands on its own as a compelling, fast-paced novel of danger and escape."},{"Title":"Deadly Truth: A Novel Based Upon Actual Events in South Africa Under Apartheid","review":"Kudos to the Hellers and Ms.Blumberg. A fast paced suspense novel based on a true incident, it kept me on the edge of my chair. It was also an education on apartheid South Africa which I couldn't help but compare to Nazi Germany. The authors' attention to detail about the physical beauty of the land provided a hypocritical contrast to the ugliness of the society it produced. A must read for those with a social conscience, and for those without,an opportunity to create one."},{"Title":"Deadly Truth: A Novel Based Upon Actual Events in South Africa Under Apartheid","review":"Deadly Truth keeps the reader engrossed right from the beginning.

Polly Kent is a smart young woman determined to make it west for the gold rush. On her own, she heads out with her pony-pulled buckboard and joins a wagon train. During the historically accurate trip, she encounters the challenges of life on the trail as she befriends a small family and meets the dashing Bill Murillo. As Polly is faced with death, Indians (written before the days of political-correctness) and the loss of loved ones, she struggles to decide if the light-hearted Bill is a man she could marry, or if a certain tall, somber and handsome is a better choice.Five stars! Great book.[...]"},{"Title":"God Just Needed Another Angel","review":"I ordered this book to help explain death and dying to my young children.

However, the value of this book is not in how fun it is to read, but in the amazing depth and breadth of network security material.Starting from interesting and original security tool taxonomy - attack, active recon, passive recon and defense -, the book takes the steep road uphill towards the descriptions of several popular security libraries (two written by the book author himself). Libnet (packet injection), libpcap (packet capture), libnids (network IDS development), libsf (OS fingerprinting), libdnet (network parameters manipulation) and openssl (crypto) are covered in the excruciating level of detail. Code and API walkthrough, all functions, variables and primitives are covered complete with usage notes for various platforms. Each chapter is topped off by a complete security tool example, designed and developed using the library. Many pages of superbly commented tool source code are included in the chapter end.Complete code is also provided at the publisher download site. Experimenting with the code is a good part of the fun brought by the book, so download is highly suggested.The book is most useful for those wishing to gain truly in-depth understanding of network security tools and for aspiring tool builders. After all, the book is much easier to read and understand then just plain source, even if well commented.Another bonus is a comprehensive description of buffer overflow and format string exploits, provided in the chapter on attacks and vulnerabilities.The book ends with painfully detailed \\"firewalk\\" recon tool description, created by Mike Schiffman. It starts with design (with flowcharts and diagrams) and goes onwards to implementation and code walkthrough. 2200 lines of tool source code conclude this mighty volume.Anton Chuvakin, Ph.D., GCIA is a Senior Security Analyst with a major information security company.

I had no previous experience with the libnet library and was extremely impressed with how easy it was to build the tcp/udp/icmp/igmp/ip packets that I needed. The sample programs were short enough (and commented well enough) that I was able to hit the ground running."},{"Title":"Building Open Source Network Security Tools: Components and Techniques","review":"There are many security books on the shelves today. Most of them describe the same hacker tools and methods. They don't get very technical and once you've read one, you've read them all. Building Open Source Network Security Tools is a different breed of security book.Building Open Source Network Security Tools , just as the name suggests, is about how to build network security tools. This is a technical book, so you are going to have a little knowledge of C and your networking principles. This is definitely not a managers book.First the book describes some basic principles in developing security software. This is a quick primer in case you have never been involved in software development. Next the book goes on to describe several commonly used libraries like libnet and libpcap. For each library, the structures and functions are explained, then there is sample code. I have written programs using libpcap and libnet before and I still learned something. There is even a section on OpenSSL programming. OpenSSL is a rather large and cryptic, no pun intended, library (in my experience anyways). This book sheds some light on it! These chapters are a great reference to have when making a new security tool.The author then goes on to explain the several techniques like attack and penetration and active reconnaissance. Not only does the author tell you how they would in a technical sense, he provides code that does it, and explains each piece. This is very useful since most tools in the wild aren't very well commented ;) There is also a chapter on buffer overflows and format string vulnerabilities. These chapters are very well done and do a good job in explaining how they work and how to write code to use them. It may sound like this is an offensive hacker book, but it also gives examples on how to write defensive programs, like a port scan detection tool. At the end of the book the author ties it all together with a large program that utilizes many of the techniques mention in the book.I found this book to be very refreshing. I had been waiting for a good security programming reference, and this is it. As a part of the Honeynet Project, I have seen a large number of compromises and tools, and one thing I've found is that in order to truly know who your enemy is, and how they operate, you need to know how their tools work. I wish this book had been released years ago when I first became interested in network security. It would have saved me from stumbling around old web pages and dead links. If you're an information security professional, this book is a must have for your library."},{"Title":"Building Open Source Network Security Tools: Components and Techniques","review":"I found this book to be extrodinarily helpful.

This will become a standard book for all security professionals."},{"Title":"Building Open Source Network Security Tools: Components and Techniques","review":"Books on hacking, cracking, exploiting, and breaking software seem to get all of the attention in the security world. However, we need more works like Mike Schiffman's 'Building Open Source Network Security Tools' (BOSNST). I regret having waited so long to read BOSNST, but I'm glad I did. Schiffman's book is for people who want to build, not break, software, and the way he describes how to create tools is enlightening.The major theme I captured from BOSNST was the importance of creating useful code libraries. Six of the book's 12 chapters focus on libraries which provide functions for application programmers. While not all have gained the same amount of fame or use, the author's approach remains sound. Libraries are the building blocks around which numerous tools can and should be built.This theme helped me understand the evolution of RFP's Whisker CGI scanner, released in Oct 1999 and deprecated in May 2003. Whisker lives on as a library, Libwhisker, in the Nikto Web server scanner. Similarly, Schiffman's chapter on Libsf mentions the utility of creating a library offering the functionality of the popular Nmap scanning tool. (Unfortunately, I haven't seen progress on this. Nmap author Fyodor last mentioned 'Libnmap' in his 2003 Nmap features survey, and it's not apparent in the tool's latest version.)I found the six library chapters to be helpful. Some of the code has stagnated since 2002 (Libnids, Libsf), while some has continued to evolve (Libpcap, Libdnet, OpenSSL). Schiffman provides good explanations of buffer overflow and format string attacks in ch 10, and I thought his state machine-based port scan detector (Descry) in ch 11 was innovative.One of the strongest sections of BOSNST is ch 12, where the author provides a 25-page code walkthrough of his Firewalk tool. This chapter is the model for anyone seeking to explain tool internals. Schiffman offers flowcharts, context charts, and explanations of code snippets. He doesn't simply dump page after page of C code in front of the reader. (Most chapters of BOSNST do conclude with the full source code for sample tools, however.)I have no real complaints with BOSNST. I found minor errors in two diagrams (p 220, 223 should show the SYN/ACK or RST reply coming from the target, not to the target). Schiffman's writing style is clear and engaging, which makes a difference when explaining functions in code.Those who want to learn how to assemble their security expertise in the form code libraries should read BOSNST. Those who wish to use the libraries found in the book, or those with similar functionality, should also read BOSNST. I look forward to Schiffman's next book, where hopefully he will finally update his biography to say 'AFIWC' (for 'Air Force Information Warfare Center') instead of 'AFWIC' (aka the UN's 'AFrican Women In Crisis' program)."},{"Title":"Building Open Source Network Security Tools: Components and Techniques","review":"This book was the perfect reference manual for the busy network administrator that needs to quickly create powerful tools to enforce and monitor network security.

I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Building Open Source Network Security Tools: Components and Techniques","review":"Even if your focus isn't security, any coder that writes networking code would find this book interesting and hard to put down. In addition to the security information, the book provides in-depth information on low level networking that any coder would find useful. The examples presented shows the reader how to, in a quick and concise way, build almost any network security tool they could imagine. This means that Security professionals no longer need to rely on companies like eEye for their tools. Chapter 10, Attack and Penetration Techniques, is worth the price of the book alone. Anybody that is responsible for securing a large network is familiar with vulnerability scanning, this chapter helps the reader understand how these tools work, and how to write there own. This type of information is extremely useful to people who find themselves in the position of quickly searching a network for something that other scanners may not detect yet. An example of this would be a new rootkit that listens on port 80. A simple port scan of a network would make finding compromised machines hard because 80 is also a legitimate port for web servers. Applying the information Schiffman gives you, a person could construct a scanner in almost no time that can issuse a HTTP query to every open port and make note of those with a HTTP reply. There are a dozen more examples why this book is elite, but rapid development and extensibility of tools that are developed throughout the book makes it a must have for any security professional."},{"Title":"Building Open Source Network Security Tools: Components and Techniques","review":"Very well structured book with clear examples.

Mike Schiffman posted a request for positiveAmazon reviews to his Libnet mailing list on 10/19/02, andsome people may have been far too accommodating!

Itdoesn't even compile on my FreeBSD or Solaris machines.One bright spot is the coverage of Libnet, a packet buildinglibrary written by Schiffman. If you make heavy use ofLibnet, the extra insights may prove useful. But the manpage is quite sufficient and more convenient for casual use.In addition, many (most?) people are moving to DugSong's Libdnet API instead, which is poorly covered inchapter 6.

I can't begin to count the number of them that I've read in the past. Some are fantastic, a lot are really good, and still more are pretty darn bad.

They don't know about each other because they all live in fear simply trying to survive each night while the vampires stalk for food. Anyelet is the queen vampire who decided not too long ago to create more of her kind in order to not have to hide her existence. Unfortunately, this quickly grew out of hand, and now the vampires must scrounge for a food source. Navarro gives us a story telling us what happens when these few humans and these powerful vampires clash, and the struggle the humans face to free themselves from the plague.This was such an entertaining and creepy novel to read. There were a few passages that actually had me checking over my shoulder to see if anyone was there (I dare you to read the first several pages detailing the doctor's search and discovery mission without shivering). It's no wonder that this novel gained enough attention to warrant a special hardcover release. The story has adventure, vampires, guns, medical experiments, human slaves used as food, and an apocalyptic vision. Afterage is relatively original, well-written, and fun.

The book is a chronological account of Stalin's life starting from his birth to his serf parents, through his revolutionary youth, his rise to the higher ranks of the Soviet leadership, his conniving power grab from the hands of Trotsky and other contemporaries, his draconian, dictatorial governance, his impact on WW-2, and his last days of governance primarily influened by intimidation and inspired by his own fears.During Stalin's childhood and formative years in school, Deutscher provides us with a feel of the oppression of the poor under the Czars and limited freedom of speech. The motivation for the formation of the revolutionary underground press is so well presented. It is only ironic that having struggled against the dictatorship of the Czar, Stalin should grow into a much more powerful and draconian dictator, who limited freedom of expression and speech as much as he fought for it in his youth. I could not help but recall the cynicism of Orwell in 1984, where he presents his thesis that society is made of three layers -- the ones at the top who are in power, the ones below them who are fighting against those in power, and the ones at the bottom who couldn't care less who is in power. At some point, a revolution occurs, and middle layer becomes the top layer, a new middle layer forms and the whole cycle repeats itself. I couldn't help thinking about the relevance of this power structure in so many countries in this day and age.The most instructive part of this book is the description of the intellectual arguments of socialism, and the formation of Bolsheviks and Mensheviks. Here, Deutscher's own socialist inspirations shows us his admiration of Lenin's arguments and, for example, the Mensheviks' counter-arguments. The description of the revolutionary struggle from 1905 to early 1920s is presented beautifully. We see the rise of all the bigwigs of the socialistic underground and their intellectual arguments against imperialism and against the other camp in socialism. Deutscher points out how Stalin was an outsider in this debate. He often toed the line held by Lenin, almost to the extent of sycophancy, and Deutscher perceives Stalin's publications in the underground press as drab and full of Leninist rhetoric, hardly enunciating any original idea of his own.Stalin's strength, however, was his practicality. He worked with the people in the press, could rally the workers in large numbers and could get things done remarkably efficiently. This was the sole strength of Stalin that helped him rise the ranks amongst his more intellectual peers. Lenin needed a handy-man to get his job done. Once Stalin had his foot in the Soviet leadership, things changed. After Lenin's death, Stalin used all his chicanery to wrest power from the most obvious successor of Lenin -- Leon Trotsky. The story from here on is depressing and repetitive. Stalin joins hands with a few leaders to fight against his rivals. Interestingly, Stalin's allies in these political games do not consider him to be worth any weight, and assume that after their political victory, power would come naturally to them, and Stalin could be their crony. How wrong they were. After winning over his rivals, Stalin turns on his allies, wresting power from them by making them his rivals with the help of new allies. The birth of the Soviet propaganda machine and the abusive purges are born in the process. By the time WW-2 begins, Stalin has made so many enemies amongst the Soviets, that he feels forced to purge (i.e. execute) all his rivals in the face of the foreign enemy, Hitler. Sure enough, none of the leaders instrumental in the 1917 revolution survive by the time the war begins.We also learn about Stalin's governance, and his policies on collectivism. We learn about the bloodshed inflicted upon the Russian peasentry, the very people socialism is supposed to protect. We learn about the exiles to Siberia, a practice that started in the time of the Czars (Stalin himself was exiled during this time). In short, we see the bastardization of socialism. From then on, the world would view Stalinism and communism as one and the same thing, perhaps influencing other communist and anti-communist leaders around the globe. The tragedy of Marxism is that it was raped by its own pioneer crusaders. Also interesting is how Deutscher compares Stalin's arrogance with the abuse of power of other revolutions of the past, specifically Robespierre and the guillotine from the French revolution of the 18th century. By this point, Orwell's cynicism seems to only be re-inforced.The next phase of the book shifts to the world war and the emergence of Hitler. Here, Deutscher points out again the slyness of Stalin. He starts of building a truce with Hitler, but that quickly falls apart, and he finds himself on enemy lines, while negotiating his coalition with Roosevelt and Churchill. The behind-the-scene political dealings in high places during the war is described with amazing detail. It is interesting how the spoils at the end of the war was shared between the three big powers. Stalin's abhorrence of the west pushed him to take over eastern Europe, and we see how the iron curtain was created. Interestingly, there was some comraderie between the three big men despite their distrust of each other, and they seem to be in some agreement with how they divide the spoils amongst them. At this point, one might innocently think that a balance of peace may be in the making, but as Churchill points out, although the three of them may be in agreement, there is no guarantee as to what might happen after they are replaced by new leaders in their own countries in the future. How true this statement was in retrospect.The post-war Stalin years are even more depressing --- it is governance inspired by paranoia. By this point, there is nobody that Stalin can trust any more after decades of purging. Everyone in the Soviet politburo including those closest to Stalin are fearful of him. In fact, those closest to him face the highest probability of being purged. Stabbing and back-stabbing was the order of the day. This ambience of paranoiac leadership was to continue through the next four decades through the cold-war Soviet republic.Interestingly, Stalin was never interested in spreading communism across the globe as had been perceived as the biggest threat from communism by the western world. Trotsky, on the other hand, was the firm believer that communism would one day sprout across the globe -- to him, it was a natural economic evolution after capitalism. However, he believed that it must occur bottom-up through revolutions from the bottom-most ranks of the peasentry and industrial workers. Given my bias to Orwell's cynicism, I can only see how wrong he was. However, the spread of communism to eastern Europe was exactly the opposite -- it was a top-down power grab by Stalin.What is most striking about this biography is the extent the author goes to create as objective an analysis of Stalin's life and politics as possible. Personally, I believe that objectivism is a chimera as much as global peace or utopianism is a chimera. However, I must admit, that Deutscher comes close. Every event in Stalin's life is deconstructed to the minutest detail, and a few pages are dedicated to provide arguments and counter-arguments on the same event. The result is a thick volume of the series of historical events that defined communism as we know it today (not as conceptualized by Marx, or propagated by Lenin or Trotsky or many of the other great intellectuals of the Russian revolution era). But, the heavy read is never a drab, the arguments are stated so intricately, that the debate seems to have been resuscitated with every turn of the page. A truly remarkable accomplishment with a complete bibliography of citations and cross-references."},{"Title":"Catullus: Student Text","review":"Having just taken AP Catullus-Ovid, I must say that while this text seemed relatively well-done and useful at first, I soon found I simply couldn't ignore its large number of faults. Yes, it's nice that the poems have most of the vocab on the facing pages--but the author seems to insist on defining excruciatingly common words (like &quot;amo&quot; and &quot;dico&quot;) multiple times while leaving more obscure words for the back of the book or ignoring them entirely. Bender's text must therefore be used with a Latin-English dictionary--not the end of the world, I know, but something that shouldn't be necessary for something like this billed as a &quot;student text.&quot;Another problem is that the author bases much of his commentary on his own crass assumptions. Bender seems to like pointing out poetic devices (notably chiasmus) that simply *aren't there.* The sparse commentary on each poem, too, is nearly useless from a scholarly standpoint; it's well and good to tell us that one poem &quot;provides a window into the poet's tortured soul,&quot; but does it actually help students to appreciate the poem in any meaningful form? And some actual background information on the people and places Catullus mentions so frequently would really have been nice.I do realize that this is merely an AP text, and certainly not one designed for the serious study of Catullus and his poetry. And it does have some positive aspects: much of each poem's (more common) vocab *is* defined on the facing pages, and the margins provide plenty of space to write the translation or one's own notes. I can't help but think that Bender and Forsyth could have tried just a *little* harder with the commentary and the vocab, however. For any AP student with more than a passing interest in Catullus, I'd recommend Garrison's text in conjunction with (or just instead of) Bender's."},{"Title":"Catullus: Student Text","review":"I am currently enrolled in AP Latin Literature and my class has been using this book because it contains the new poems for the AP exam. We've all found the book's notes to be to sparse to be of any real help in translating and the glossary in the back to be seriously lacking. If you are planning on using this text, however, please translate with a good Latin-English dictionary nearby and with plenty of patience. Also note that the Latin text in this book does not have macrons."},{"Title":"Catullus: Student Text","review":"I know from personal experience that this Catullus Student Text is an excellent preparation for the \\"A.P. Latin: Literature\\" test, and that students of all types in my class enjoyed using it. Like most AP texts, each poem is accompanied by vocabulary and grammar notes. However, the vocabulary notes offer more than just definition; some help to explain Catullus' word choice. For example, in Poem 1, Catullus appeals to \\"patrona virgo,\\" his patron muse which the note explains is a reference to Homer's invocation of the muse. The collaboration of two editors, one a Ph.D high-school teacher and the other a Ph.D college professor, creates a student-friendly text that still encourages deeper exploration of the author's work. Moreover, brief introductions to each poem offer possible interpretations or help set the background for the poem. The editors make it clear, though, that these are only possibilities, leaving it to the students to come up with their own interpretation, aided by facts and concrete dates. These introductions also point the reader to other poems, which give more insight on the topic that Catullus is addressing. Every introduction states the meter of the poem, allowing students to practice scansion on their own.It is the extra material, though, that truly makes the book superior. A map shows all the places described in Catullus' poems in relation to each other. The back of the book provides the metrical pattern for every meter used, the literary implications of each meter, and in which poems they are used. An Introduction describes not only Catullus' life and writing style, but gives the political background of that time period, placing all the poems in context. Moreover, the Introduction helps students get a better concept of Catullus' entire work by offering some scholarly arguments as to what order the poems were originally in, and why the editors chose to order them as they are in the text.The accompanying Teacher's Manual, available separately, includes the poems in large type without notes, perfect for quick review in class as an overhead or worksheet. The manual also aids teachers with literal translations of the poems, practice tests, and understanding of the poems.I highly recommend this AP Catullus text, in part because of the aid it provides for reading the poems, but more because it encourages students to develop their own informed understandings. The editors offer facts and dates, along with some possible explanations, but it is largely up to the student to explore the meanings of individual poems, as well as their connection with other poems. The desired result is to point to the significance of Catullus' work as a whole. Thus, this Catullus text is uniquely well suited for both the student who wishes to excel on the AP exam and the student who simply wishes to explore the beauty and passion in the work of Catullus."},{"Title":"Catullus: Student Text","review":"Amazingly helpful to prepare students for the AP test. Includes a biography about the author, commentaries, notes, and a glossary of words used in the poems."},{"Title":"A History of Twentieth-Century Russia","review":"There's no question that the Soviet regime was an indiscriminately ruthless entity. What is often overlooked is the fact that throughout it's existence it had the support of a large percentage of the population. This is often a bit shocking to Americans like myself who've spent time in Russia (even today many of the older generation still praise Krushchev for providing housing and dachas to the general populace).In \\"A History of Twentieth Century Russia\\" Robert Service brings a well written general history that in many ways addresses this. Service identifies the origins of the great terror in the Bolshevik regimes early years and the ascension of Stalin to power. He also identifies many of the educational, medical and other services much of the population recieved. This doesn't mean that Service ignores the genocide that occurred under the Bolsheviks. Not at all. Service, as a historian, merely attempts a general history- the good, the bad and the ugly. Service correctly attempts to show why some elements of the population where willing to put up with certain measures beyond just the terror they were exposed to.This is a good general history, more balanced and lacking the political bent that many American scholars often approach modern Russian history with. Service shows the brutality of the regime up front and as well as the constuctive changes that took place. And, as Service shows, these changes came at a very high price.Very readable and highly recommended."},{"Title":"A History of Twentieth-Century Russia","review":"Robert Service does an excellent job his history of 20th Century Russia. His book is extremely detailed, yet it is so well written that the reader absorbs almost everything. Service ties in agriculture, economics, Russians, and most importantly Soviet leadership, to create a vivid story about why the Soviet Union became such a major power, and how it lasted seven decades on such a precarious pedestal. Everyone who wants to learn about Russia should have the History of Twentieth-Century Russia on their bookshelf."},{"Title":"A History of Twentieth-Century Russia","review":"Russia is the ultimate story, a story of grandeur of false hopes and shattered dreams. Churchill gave Russia that interesting title of the enigma inside the mystery inside the riddle. However this book does better by truly telling us the grand story of Russia, without the weakness of similar books on the subject. Many important subjects are covered, from the traditional tale of revolution, Stalin, stagnation, collapse.Here the reader is treated to nuanced stories, such as Krushchevs suppression of the church which left only 7500 Churches ion Russia, whereas 12000 Mosques were left standing. Also evident is the population upheavals of the 1920s and 1930s. Equally important is a very good rendition of the complications of the Civil war and the creation of War communism. All the characters are given a fair portrait from Derzinsky, to Sverlov, to the obvious, such as Zinoviev and Stalin.The successive chapters on the \`mystery years' of Brezhnev is enlightening, to view a nation in stagnation. Although not as insightful as Volkoganov's expose on soviet leadership this book brings to light many tales and is a fascinating, easy digestion, that brings the reader up to date, with Vladimir Putin.Seth J. Frantzman"},{"Title":"A History of Twentieth-Century Russia","review":"An extraordinary depiction of Russian history from the end of the Czarist periods through Communism and to the current market capitalism. The \\"secret society\\" of Soviet Russia has always fascinated me, and I have searched for a book that would detail why the Russian people moved toward Communism, how they got there and what went wrong that this type of government only lasted about seventy years. Mr. Service thoroughly answers my questions by examining Russian attitudes, cultures, history and practice. One of the qualities I look for in a historian is a sense of fairness. The author does a fairly good job staying neutral during the discussion, but does occasionally unfavorably (and in my opinion unfairly) compare Communist Russian to western democracy."},{"Title":"A History of Twentieth-Century Russia","review":"I tend to agree with the LA Times review of this book. Also Service's writing style for this book was not fluid, it was too disjointed. Let me try and give an example (from the book). On second thought, it would be too wordy. The best I can say is that the prose just doesn't flow for me. This is not good in a narrative historical book like this. Writing style would not matter if it was an &quot;encyclopedia&quot;, like Oxford puts out, as in a &quot;Who's Who in the USSR&quot;, etc.On the other hand, there are a lot of facts crammed in lots of pages, and the index is not bad. Further, Service does hit a few home runs with opinionated paragraphs that are quite funny (e.g. &quot;flying coffins&quot;, how Stalin's Air Minister was executed for making a bad joke; &quot;chemically treated corpses&quot;, how Stalin's body lying in state caused a stampede that killed people, which the author attributes satirically to Stalin ruling from the grave; Brezhnev being plopped into his grave uncerimoniously to indicate he has fallen out of favor (literally) with the Kremlin. Also the author seems to rely too much on secondary sources it seems (then again, I suspect with the Soviets often destroying evidence, this is not unexpected in the field)."},{"Title":"Santa's Book of Names","review":"This is one of the books that I hope will become a Christmas classic.

The timing for us was just right as the character in the story was just like our little guy. What is so nice too is that at this age children are still so enchanted with the magic of Christmas, but are also intellectually developing and maturing so quickly. This story really captures the unique nature of a child at this age; growing up fast but still a small child with big emotions. I think it does a wonderful job of making children like this feel confident and okay about who they are. I decided to give this book to him the night before his last day of school before Christmas break and sent it into school with him the next day.

A must have and a must read to survive in the jungles of personal relationships."},{"Title":"High-maintenance Relationships","review":"This book is about maintaining relationships with abusive, destructive, untrustworthy, and downright dangerous people, who are euphemistically referred to as \\"high-maintenance\\". The victim of such an abuser is encouraged to keep the relationship together at all costs and given suggestions for adapting to and living with the abuse, including becoming more sympathic to his abuser by recognizing the exact same abusive tendency in himself-which may be true for some characteristics but is quite a stretch if you are going to assume EVERYONE has EVERY offensive trait to some degree.The author makes the victim solely responsible for staying in an abusive relationship without ever confronting the abuser or understanding that the time may come when it is necessary to leave the relationship for one's own sanity or mental, emotional, spiritual, and even physical health. The abusive person is absolved of all responsibility for his own behavior.The book never addresses the extreme damage long-term exposure to abusers does to a victim, nor does it address the responsiblity of others to stand up to evil and protect weaker people , such as children in the family, from it.The author quotes Scripture as a rationale and justification for his premise of tolerating ongoing abuse; however, Scripture does not support this thinking. In the Bible, we are held responsible for our behavior. The Bible tells us to forgive AS GOD FORGAVE US (Ephesians 4:32, Colossians 3:13).God forgives us when we come to him, confess our sin, ask for forgiveness (apologize) and REPENT (turn from our sinful ways).(see Ezekiel 33:10-19, Isaiah 55:6, Jeremiah 6:16 & 26:3, Luke 13:3 & 5, Acts 3:19). He does NOT forgive those who are 'stiff-necked', continue doing evil, or refuse to repent. The Lord does not expect more of us than he himself is willing to do! God requires repentance, and so should we.TAKE HEED TO YOURSELVES: IF THY BROTHER TRESPASS AGAINST THEE, REBUKE HIM; AND IF HE REPENT, FORGIVE HIM.....Luke 17:3Luke 17:3 is the scripture often misquoted, usually by an abuser or his enabler, when he tells you that the Bible says 'Forgive and Forget', or that you must forgive him because you are a Christian. However, Jesus is very specific when He tells us to REBUKE the sinner, and IF HE REPENTS, to forgive him.In Matthew 18:15-17, Jesus gives us a model for rebuking one who sins against us, and ends by telling us to \\"treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector\\" (shun him) if he refuses to listen. God does not want us to continue to be abused, in fact, we are told a number of times to shun evildoers (Psalm 37:9, Psalm 119:115, Matthew 18:17, Titus 3:10-11, 1 Corinthians 5:11).Additionally, a distinction must be made between forgiveness and reconciliation, or remaining in a relationship. We CAN forgive and still choose not to remain in relationship with one who has betrayed or abused us. We are not required to expose ourselves or our loved ones to harmful, destructive, or dangerous people. \\"Warn a divisive person once, then warn him a second time. After that, HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM. You may be sure that such a man is warped and sinful; he is self-condemned\\"....Titus 3:10-11Furthermore, we are very clearly instructed in the Scriptures to rebuke wicked people. \\"Those who sin are to be rebuked publicly, so that the others may take warning\\".....1 Timothy 5:20NIV\\"When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand. Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul\\"....Ezekiel 33: 8-9 KJV. Doing our best to STOP evil is required for us to save our own souls.A much more helpful book about handling abusive relationships from a Biblical perspective is \\"Boundaries\\" by Drs. Henry Cloud and John Townsend, who are well-known Christian psychologists. This book will truly teach victims of abuse how to deal with abusive people, and it also includes Scriptural teachings.I was very disappointed in High- Maintenance Relationships and do not recommend it to anyone dealing with such people. Victims of Back-stabbers, Control- Freaks, Green-Eyed Monsters, Steamrollers, Critics, Volcanoes, and the other \\"characters\\" in this book have enough problems without being made to feel as if the sole responsibility for making a success out of a relationship with a toxic person, who merrily continues on harming others, is on their shoulders, and if the relationship fails, it is their fault because they could have done more to salvage it.As the director of Luke 17:3 Miinistries for Adult Daughters of Abusive or Controlling Birth-families, I feel that this book may do more harm than good. It victimizes a person who is the target of abuse a second time- by making him feel guilty for not improving and continuing his relationship with someone the book itself refers to as \\"impossible.\\" If you really need help and are looking for a book with constructive actions you can take, this is not it.God wants us to be FREE from wicked people, and HE will free us if we obey his word and follow HIS instructions for dealing with them. \\"They have greatly oppressed me from my youth, but they have not gained the victory over me.

While he does a bit of stereotyping with his various labels, he effectively communicates his message of identifying the more challenging aspects of relating to numerous people around us.He wisely advises each of us to look within ourselves to identify each of the flaws that tend to annoy us in others. Usually, we can find the same quirks within us that are so bothersome around us. He then offers particular remarks on how to better handle each type of high-maintenance relationship covered.I only gave this book three stars because it was more entertaining than enlightening. In other words, I could relate to the characteristics he was describing, but there wasn't a substantial amount of solid advice on how to respond to them. This title is a quick, easy read, but for in-depth advice on any high-maintenance relationship, I would look elsewhere. Parrott simply tries to cover too much ground here in too little pages."},{"Title":"High-maintenance Relationships","review":"This is one of the best books I have read on relationships. I think Parrott covered many common personalities. He writes with a humorous style. Besides learning how to handle difficult people, the book made me ask myself, \\"do I act that way? I saw a little bit of me in several of the personalities. I came to the conclusion that a person is only hard to live with if he has these characteristics to an extreme. It was interesting when a person would come to mind that I thought fit the shoe exactly. I recommend this book for anyone who is serious about learning how to get along with people they face everyday in family, friends, or co-workers."},{"Title":"High-maintenance Relationships","review":"I read this book when I had just graduated from college and was entering the professional workplace for the first time. This book gave a great overview of problem personalities and some suggestions for dealing with them. I found the book to be helpful."},{"Title":"Smile When You Are Hurting","review":"This book was very easy and light reading, in keeping with the title, and despite a fairly serious subject. It is the story of a young mother and how she manages to raise her children alone despite her lack of job skills and money. The author's writing has a certain rough charm that kept me going to the end, although it would have benefitted from some careful editing. While she writes of her travails quite cheerfully, there are darker undertones to the story such as their grinding poverty (one egg shared among six people?), young children having to work, and her own careless and failed search for love. When your date asks you for money it is usually not a good sign. Still, there is honesty when she writes about her relationships with men that seems to be lacking when she writes about her relationships with her children, maybe because she reiterates once too often how well they got along and how much she is their \\"friend.\\" I am not sure about the abrupt and overly dramatic ending of the book, however. It seemed somewhat pointless unless you believe in signs and portents in dreams."},{"Title":"Smile When You Are Hurting","review":"I loved this book!!! Yes, It is by an amateur author but it is a compelling story of a young woman who falls in love and gets married at a tender age, moves to a foreign country and begins her family. Then tragedy hits when her husband co pilots a flight flying over Cuba and is never seen again. Corinthia is forced to raise her 5 children by herself and barely gets by each day. Thank God that she has a creative mind, positive outlook and is very ambitious. It is a very good example of getting kicked while you are down but brushing your knees off and trying again.I would love to see a follow up on this book."},{"Title":"Guerilla days in Ireland","review":"The incredible career of Tom Barry and that of the West Cork Flying Column is an inspirational example of what virtually untrained volunteers fighting for their families and their country can achieve, even in the face of overwhelming odds. The British had over 12,500 men in West Cork chasing after about 310 IRA Volunteers...and never defeated them. Barry discusses many military topics and personal thoughts which the student of Irish warrior traditions will find extremely helpful. Members of many guerrilla movements around the world have read and profited from the lessons in this book including Che Guevera (whose last name was &quot;Lynch&quot; thanks to his Irish grandfather) and the early Jewish guerrillas in the Irgun and Lehi. Anyone interested in understanding the mindset of Irishmen bent on taking a stance and fighting for what they believe in, will be well rewarded for reading this book."},{"Title":"Guerilla days in Ireland","review":"This on the scene writer grimly reveals the unbelieavable atrocities the English purpetrated on the Irish people in this century. This book is a beginning to the understanding of the relations between the English and the Irish. The actions taken by armed mercenaries, English military, and English puppet police against the Irish people in their own country is appalling and brings to mind Hitler's treatment of the Jews in Europe twenty years later. A must read for all who seek an understanding to the Anglo/Irish situation."},{"Title":"Guerilla days in Ireland","review":"For the third reviewer : you don't need to be English , Russian , German or American to understand and condemn nazi or stalinist atrocities ; similarly , you don't need to be an Irishman to realize Britain's unfair , oppressive and intolerant rule of Ireland , not yet finished by the way . There's ample historical evidence of all kinds of wrong doing by the British during their centuries-long illegal occupation of Ireland , denial of elementary basic rights to the Irish (catholics obviously)and the establishment of an unnatural separation of the North from the South that it is still unresolved .Like any other country in the world , Britain has had brilliant pages in history and also dark , shameful ones , with their handling of the Irish case probably being the worst - to day .As for the book , I'll only say this : don't miss the opportunity to learn how a small group of determined men (basically peasants)were led with brilliance to defeat a much bigger , stronger and modern army . Probably much to the dismay of some , still today ."},{"Title":"Guerilla days in Ireland","review":"Tom Barry fought with the British Army during the First World War, the Irish Republican Army during the war with England (1919-1921), and the anti-Treaty forces of the IRA during the Irish Civil War (1922-1923). Imprisoned by the Free State government in Dublin for his role in that civil war, he nevertheless returned to the ranks of the IRA and served as its Chief of Staff in the 1930s. He published these memoirs in 1949, at a time when Ireland was, at last, a Republic that until recently had been under the leadership of Eamon DeValera, Barry's longtime leader in these conflicts.In an interesting historical moment of irony, the author heard the news of the 1916 Easter Rising the following May, as he served with the British Army expedition in Mesopotamia (now Iraq) as that army attempted but ultimately failed to relieve a British Army besieged in the city of Kut by Ottoman Turkish forces. By the summer of 1919, having returned to his native Cork from the war, Barry was inspired by that 1916 Rising to first learn more of his own country's history and its struggles with England, and then to join the Irish Republican Army just as the volunteers were re-arming and resuming their drilling to defend the Irish Republic created in the wake of the 1918 general election.The IRA in this period found a number of its most important leaders and its most effective fighters from \\"rebel\\" Cork, and the fighting pursued in the fields, lanes, and city streets of County Cork made it the most important arena in the contest between Irish Republicans and the \\"forces of the crown.\\" Prominent names were also to be found among the British commanders that Tom Barry and others would face in Cork. Future Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery served there as Brigade Major of the 17th Brigade and future Lieutenant-General Arthur Percival, who would surrender to the Japanese at Singapore, served as an intelligence officer and was decorated for that service. Both were considered to have done well in Cork by their Army superiors.His earliest duties with the IRA were as an Intelligence Officer focused upon learning as much as possible about the British troops then garrisoning County Cork. However, by early 1920 the British reportedly begin to suspect his real loyalties and Barry quickly joined the fighting arm of the IRA as training officer for the Cork Brigade. It is at this point that Tom Barry begins his real story which is the account of the Cork Brigade, and especially the West Cork Flying Column, and their war with the much larger British Force occupying Cork. This became a major if not the principal arena of the Anglo-Irish War.The narrative backbone of the book is Tom Barry's rise to command the West Cork Flying Column, the Cork Brigade's principal weapon for attacking British forces rather than just fending them off. This conflict was very much a modern guerilla war as the IRA frequently started out with weapons taken from their enemies and were frequently aided, abetted, and encouraged by the population. The IRA generally struck where their enemy was weakest and evaded combat when their enemy was clearly stronger.The author describes this unequal war in detail, including the evolution of their tactics, military organization, recruitment, intelligence war, relations with and treatment of civilians, and the targeted use of violence against key individuals. Such details and related discussions lift this rather simple military memoir to the level of textbook on guerilla war from the viewpoint of the guerilla, and in this instance a very successful guerilla leader. This is a must read for anyone interested in Ireland in the 20th Century and its struggle for independence, or for anyone wanting to better understand guerilla warfare and how such a war is waged on the part of the insurgent or guerilla."},{"Title":"Guerilla days in Ireland","review":"Wow, what a book. I am an American of Irish German ancestry, and I devour books of all kinds that involve history, military and otherwise of England, France, the US etc. Because I am a Anglophile and Francophile, I have for some reason avoided books about the Irish conflicts. This book was my first, and the only book to bring tears to my eyes. The British did in fact wage war and rape, rob, torture, and brutalize their Celtic brothers and sisters for centuries, and its hard to believe what they were capable of, as recently as the 20th century. This book will show you howa small group of men with nothing more than rifles and a handful of bullets were able to hold off 40,000 British soldiers for years, and to come out on top, at least for awhile. Bottom line here is the Brits were just plain evil, and what they have done to the people of Ireland is shocking. The author does make it clear that support in England for the never ending occupation was not always there, which is a credit to some. Read this book, it will blow your mind."},{"Title":"Guerilla days in Ireland","review":"Tom Barry's name will always be a part of Irish history. Despite his prickly personality, his fight against the British and his psychological strength enabled him to hold out against a far better trained, equipped, and more numerous enemy.This book begins with Barry's new-found consciousness of his Irish patriotism, which leads him to join the IRA in Cork in order to fight the British. A detailed explaination of recruitment for a guerilla army and its training follows, with particular attention paid to the greivances of the Irish population against the occupying British. This leads to Barry's account of the Third Brigade's actions against the British in west County Cork, which were always spellbinding, if not also possibly partisan in nature and controversial in execution. This is understandable for a partisan guerilla commander, who was always under pressure, not just from the British, but also from their Irish syncophants and his own enemies within the Irish nationalist movement as well. Anyone who ever rooted for an underdog will be heartened by this story.Barry's fascinating life did not end at Crossbarry. His account of his journey to Dublin to meet with the leaders of the nationalist movement reads as good a spy thriller as anything Michael Collins did, which is to say, the best. And his account of his VERY short imprisonment during the post-independence days is not only thrilling, but funny as well.One receives a huge insight into the workings of the Irish personality by reading this book. As a historical document, it is first class, if one reads carefully past Barry's biases. As a guerilla war manual, it also is valuable, if somewhat dated (one wonders what would have happened if the British had had radios at Crossbarry).The book belongs on the shelves of anyone interested in Ireland, guerilla warfare, or just plain thrilling military reading. Tops!"},{"Title":"Guerilla days in Ireland","review":"Tom Barry comes over as a very down to earth man doing his best to bring freedom to his country against the oppression of the English occupation. The book is a detailed telling of the activities of the West Cork brigade and flying column during the Irish war of independance. He details at the local level the atrocities and reign of terror used by the English forces to try and wipe out the IRA and how they were able to successfully counter the English in West Cork and even achieve a measure of success against vastly superior forces in both numbers and equipment."},{"Title":"Guerilla days in Ireland","review":"This book provides a candid personal history of the Irish struggle for independence from Great Britain during the period 1916-22. The author was leader of the I.R.A.'s most successful 'Flying Column', which consisted of a small group of guerrillas who through constant movement and opportunism successfully harried an overwhelming force of British troops in County Cork. The tactics used by these flying columns were in due course emulated in conflicts around the globe.This book is strongly recommended for students of Irish history and guerrilla warfare. Furthermore, it provides valuable insights to all who are both fascinated and frustrated by the 'Troubles'. Essential reading for all Irish persons."},{"Title":"Guerilla days in Ireland","review":"I would love to write a review, however, I ordered this book in January, it is now March and I still have not received it.

Alternating between the time of the genocide and a time about five years after it, the story follows a young Hutu teenager named Deogratias. Prior to the massacre, we see he is a normal boy trying to get into the pants of two pretty Tutsi sisters. However, in the aftermath of the genocide, he has been reduced to a homeless, ragtag lunatic with only moments of lucidity, who tries to keep horrible memories at bay with the aid of the local banana beer (urwagwa). Those familiar with the kinds of atrocities perpetrated in genocides or civil wars won't be particularly surprised at the final revelation as to what rendered him insane -- nonetheless, it's grim and powerful stuff. There's also a subplot involving a French tourist who served in the French army in Rwanda during the genocide. This exists mainly to highlight the French complicity in allowing the genocide to unfold -- albeit guilt that is only marginally greater than that of other Western powers. What happened in Rwanda serves to point out the emptiness of slogans such as \\"Never Forget\\", and while it has been covered by many excellent non-fiction books and films, Stassen is to be commended for bringing the horrific story to another medium. This is rough material, definitely not for kids, although the translator's introduction does a nice job of providing enough background for one to use it in a high school history or ethics class."},{"Title":"Deogratias, A Tale of Rwanda","review":"Deogratias is an emotionally harrowing tale of the Rwandan genocide in the mid-90s, told from the perspective of the titular Hutu, and is about as far from a children's book as you can get.*Leading off with a brief but informative essay about the horrific genocide of nearly one million Tutsi, Rwanda's minority ethnic group, by the Hutus, the majority, while the superpowers of the world stood by and effectively did nothing, translator Alexis Siegel puts the events into historical context and provides a sturdy foundation for J.P. Stassen's gut-wrenching tale. Deogratias is a teenage boy with a teenaged boy's interests, amongst them a fondness for Tutsi girls and Urwagwa (a local banana beer), but when we first meet him, he's a disheveled drifter who's been pushed to the edge of madness by what he's seen and experienced. Stassen takes a risk with the unusual structure of his story, eschewing a linear narrative in favor of switching back-and-forth in time, before and after the massacres, with the only visual cue being the condition of Deogratias' white clothing. As a result, it's not immediately clear where the story is going or what's actually happened that changed him from a happy-go-lucky teen to a delusional drifter who thirsts for Urwagwa and sometimes imagines he's a dog. While the non-linear structure is confusing at times (a second reading is almost mandatory to fully appreciate it), when it all starts to come together towards the end, it offers the kind of slow reveal gut-punch that sticks with you for days.Stassen's visual storytelling is especially strong throughout, and while he avoids focusing on the actual massacres themselves, the couple of key graphic moments he does show will be seared into your brain and effectively punctuate Deogratias' madness. Beyond those two moments, though, it is his expressive faces and coloring that brings each of his characters to life, from the innocence and determination of Apollinaria and Benina, the Tutsi sisters whose lives are central to Deogratias' fate, to the culpability of fellow missionaries, Brothers Stanislas and Philip, whose hands are as covered in blood as those of the leaders of the countries who ignored what was happening in Rwanda.Deogratias proves that graphic novels do not have to simply be escapist entertainment, joining the likes of Maus, Palestine and Persepolis as representatives of more than just great graphic novels, but also as powerful, thought-provoking literature.* Presumably because Deogratias' publisher, First Second, is an imprint of Henry Holt's Roaring Brook Press children's division, Amazon has it improperly categorized, IMO, in two different sub-sections of their Children's Books section. This is heavy material for anyone under the age of 13."},{"Title":"Deogratias, A Tale of Rwanda","review":"Over the years when I've had to defend the medium of comics to my less illuminated friends and co-workers I've been able to point to many examples of works that rise above the mire of the usual. Things like \\"The Watchmen\\", \\"Bone\\", \\"Love and Rockets\\" and others. I will now add \\"Deogratias\\" to this distinguished group. The book is the product of Belgium writer/artist J.P. Stassen. The book is told against the backdrop of the brutal ethnic cleansing that took place in Rwanda in the early 90's as the majority Hutu savagely butchered some 800,000 of the minority Tutsi ethnic group as the world looked on and did nothing.Stassen first provides a brief, but very necessary history lesson about the events that led up the genocide and what has happened after. Stassen now resides in Rwanda with his family. The book if required reading if only for Stassen's opening monologue and history lesson. The story itself moves back and forth in time with the lead title character Deogratias. These shifts in time come with no warning or captions and at first are a little dizzying but you'll soon have it figured out. Deogratias in present time is a pathetic creature, wearing ratty clothing, and addicted to Urwagwa or banana beer. He also seems to be quite mad as other villagers ask him if he is \\"still a dog?\\" This will become significant later in the story. We first seem him interacting with a French tourist who was in the military back during the genocide. This character is meant as a representative of the French government who if they didn't actually back the horrors that took place, they turned their back as they went on.As we move back in time we learn about the past of Deogratias, a Hutu, and others of his village. We see him in school as even the teachers spew hate against the Tutsi. Deogratias is in love with A Tutsi girl named Benina but her mother wants Benina to have nothing to do with him. The radio broadcasts are filled with hateful tirades against the Tutsi who they refer to as cockroaches. Deogratias is expected to take up arms with his Hutu brothers but all he can do is think of saving Benina and her family. Ultimately he will pay for this with his very sanity.Deogratias is a powerful, tragic, horrifying story. Made all that much more terrible because of the real-life events and even worse by the world's complete lack of action to stop the violence. Was it because this was black on black racism? Was it because there were no strategic locations or oil fields as stake? Whatever the case, This is a story that will haunt the reader for a long time.Reviewed by Tim Janson"},{"Title":"Deogratias, A Tale of Rwanda","review":"First published in Belgium in 2000, this translation of Deogratius: A Tale of Rwanda by Alexis Siegel may appear to be like a comic--but it does not have any humorous content.The setting is 1994 in Rwanda, in Eastern Africa. A bit of history is required. Everyone carried ID cards to designate whether they were Hutu, the majority ethnic group, or Tutsi. Extremists from the Hutu group planned to exterminate the Tutsi minority and kill moderate Hutu who opposed their goal. The ID cards made it easy for the murderers to know who to kill.The story, told through flashbacks of the days before and after the horrific genocide, is told from the viewpoint of Deogratius, a Hutu boy and Benina, a Tutsi girl.In the genocide, 800,000 humans are murdered while the world did nothing. The United Nations estimated that 3 million people were murdered as the war spilled over in the neighboring countries to find the refugees from Rwanda.The graphic author's storytelling is powerful and eloquent. The history lesson is told from the eye of a young boy and an older man--both native and white immigrants, soldiers and others.Armchair Interviews says: Not an easy read, Deogratias: A Tale of Rwanda is an important history lesson told in this manner by the author who now resides in Rwanda with his family."},{"Title":"Deogratias, A Tale of Rwanda","review":"Stassen, Deogratias: A Tale of Rwanda (First Second, 2006)Stassen's Deogratias is a perfect example of the raw power to be found in the image and the image alone. There can be little doubt that the climax of this book is as powerful as they come. It's just that what leads up to it has some big problems.Deogratias is a survivor of the Tutsi massacre in 1994 in Rwanda, a madman who tries to use prodigious amounts of alcohol to drive the dogs out of his mind. The townsfolk consider him amusing but harmless; his friends from before that time just want to help him. We alternate between scenes of a present-day Deogratias searching endlessly for urwagwa, a cheap Rwandan banana beer, and scenes of Deogratias in early 1994, going along living his life as the Tutsi-Hutu race war was about to boil over.It becomes obvious that something during the massacre drove Deogratias insane, and the book's big mystery is what that was. There is another mystery going on at the same time, as a serial killer in the present day is eliminating people close to Deogratias, making his remaining friends fear that he's in even greater danger from outside forces than he is from the dogs in his head.There's so much to like about this book-- Deogratias' character is engaging, both before and after his mental damage. Stassen chose a wonderful vehicle for showing the transition of time. The rendering of the dogs in Deogratas' head, and the ways in which Stassen chooses to reveal them, are great. And, of course, the twin revelations of the mysteries are powerful scenes as they stand. However, while all this attention has been (rightly) paid to the nuances of Deogratias' character, the plot suffers considerably. By the time we get to those two revelations, we've seen barely enough of the plot to know there's a mystery going on. If you're not paying attention, you could miss both of them entirely. It would be a mistake to ask for the book to be more linear-- the inventive time sequencing is one of its strongest points-- but it might have worked a good deal better if it were a bit more linear in each of its separate linearities.This is a book that shows Stassen has a great deal of potential, and one that has an important set of ideas to get across. It is not entirely successful in getting those ideas across, but it's easy for the reader to see where Stassen was going and fill in the blanks himself. **"},{"Title":"Deogratias, A Tale of Rwanda","review":"Interesting perspective of the Rwandan genocide. Gives a personal touch to the aftermath of the conflict. Enjoyed the sequence of the panels as well going between present and past."},{"Title":"Deogratias, A Tale of Rwanda","review":"This is a graphic novel about the genocide in Rwanda. I liked the informational introduction. It was well done and very informative. That said, I did not like the book itself. The artwork didn't touch me, the story was confusing and unappealing, and I did not get anything out of it."},{"Title":"Deogratias, A Tale of Rwanda","review":"Stassen documents the 1994 Tutsi genocide in Rwanda through the eyes of the title character, Deogratias, a member of the Hutu ethnicity. The story begins with the massacre's aftermath: Deogratias, traumatized by the recent past, wanders from place to place like a disturbed animal, even imagining at times that he's a dog. As the narrative progresses, the reader pieces together fragments to reveal the horrifying truth. While Stassen doesn't show the violence as it happens, his depiction of a murdered woman towards the end of the book proves to be disturbing enough. With its vibrant colors and its gutwrenching content, Stassen's work will leave the reader feeling unsettled long after the story is finished. Originally published in France, Deogratias won YALSA's Great Graphic Novel Award, and was named one of ALA's Best Book for Young Adults. A helpful introduction provides readers with a brief history of Rwanda, its colonization by the French, and the political factors that paved the road to genocide.

The history lesson is told from the eye of a young boy and an older man-both native-and white immigrants, soldiers and others. This is a great book because it deals with the issue of genocide, and also because this is an issue many countries in Africa are facing. This helps you better understand the story from the eyes of the people affected by it. Deogratias is very powerful, touching, and real story of survival. I recommend this book for history classes to educate them about issues surrounding the world."},{"Title":"Deogratias, A Tale of Rwanda","review":"Deogratias is the name of a young man from Rwanda. The story dances back and forth between pre- and post-1994 massacre Rwanda. Pre-massacre Deogratias is a likeable young man. Post-massacre Deogratias is insane. As one reads this graphic novel one finds out what drove him insane - in a climax that is not all that surprising or shocking (just sad), especially if one knows any of the detail of the Rwanda massacre.Great works take the story of one person or group of people in a tragic situation and somehow make their story universal. For example, the Civil War movie \\"Glory\\" is the story of the first all-Black Federal regiment in the Civil War - it is also the story of every soldier - black or white, Union or Confederate. In \\"Saving Private Ryan\\", the Tom Hanks character epitomizes the average man stuck in a terrible situation doing the best he can and dying in the process.\\"Deogratias\\" fails to do this. It is too personal. The story is too small. Not to say it isn't important, but rather to say that it fails to become a universal story of the Rwanda tragedy.My copy of the book has an introduction from Alexis Seigel, the translator. He does an exceptional job of explaining the Rwanda tragedy and its aftermath. I would give his introduction 5 stars.However, the grade has to go to the graphic novel, not its introduction. So, I give this one a grade of C+."},{"Title":"The Sickness unto Death: A Christian Psychological Exposition of Edification & Awakening by Anti-Climacus (Penguin Classics)","review":"In perhaps his most relentless probing of the human condition, Kierkegaard's &quot;The Sickness Unto Death&quot; rediscovers the very notion of &quot;sin.&quot; Having been tossed around by anyone and everyone in the Danish Christendom of his day, the word &quot;sin&quot; has lost much of it's original meaning; hence he chooses the term &quot;despair.&quot; By doing this, Kierekgaard rediscovers &quot;original sin,&quot; or that notion of sin which has been lost through misuse. For Kierkegaard, &quot;despair&quot; or &quot;sin&quot; is not simply an individual act, but it is a state of existence. Only when an individual acknowledges the inherent human situation, one that is &quot;in despair,&quot; can one then &quot;actively despair&quot; and move out of the aesthetic mire of common existence. It should be noted that it is an ill advised version of Christianity which is &quot;in despair,&quot; such a Christian wanting a simple solution without having to face the terrifying problem of our being. Kierkegaard not only documents the different levels of &quot;despair&quot; (no one type is exclusive of others), but he looks into why it is that we often refuse to accept our condition, such denial forcing us to remain &quot;in despair.&quot; As he himself makes clear, &quot;The very nature of despair is that it is unaware of being despair.&quot; There are endless implications from such an important work, not least of which is the idea that words can hold as well as lose their meaning, depending on how they are used and who is using them. But over and above a theory of semiotics is Kierkegaard's belief that authentic Christianity can only arise for the one who faces his/her desperate situation; and upon doing so, sees no other way out than total submission to &quot;the Power that posited it.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Sickness unto Death: A Christian Psychological Exposition of Edification & Awakening by Anti-Climacus (Penguin Classics)","review":"Please indulge me only a brief autobiographical reflection on this singularly impressive work of the great Dane.I was assigned this book in the spring of 1976 for a History of Modern Philosophy course at the University of Northern Colorado. Having cut my philosophical teeth on Nietzsche, Marx, and Freud, and being in the heady environment of the state university (albeit not a distingushed one), I had, in a protracted fit of post-adolescent pseudo-intellectualism, thrown of the light religion of my youth and was endeavoring to embrace atheism. Thank God, I would eventually fail in this.I wrote a short essay against SK for my class, but had not taken on this formidable volume, relying only on secondary sources. But then one night, after a bizarre dream that covertyly indicated my alienation from God, I picked up the book and began reading--not at the beginning, but at a random place. Then the book began to read me. It explained my \\"despair\\" as form of rebellion against God. \\"Defiant despair\\" is what SK called it: despair that finds its meaning in being miserable in its rebellion against God. He called it the most \\"potentiated\\" (or full-bloodied) form of despair.I saw myself in the dense and psychologically thick description. SK read my soul in Christian terms, and it disarmed and alarmed me. This marked a turning point; about a month later, I gave up this despair and instead embraced the Christian message. A few years later I taught through this demanding and rewarding book in a class at the University of Oregon--the only time I have done so in all my years of teaching.I part company with SK's rejection of rational apologetics (natural theology and historical evidences for Christianity); however, his divination of the soul, his art of uncovering the soul's escape mechanisms, his ability to bring one before God through this writing...is uncanny. Call it subjective apologetics. Call it brilliant."},{"Title":"The Sickness unto Death: A Christian Psychological Exposition of Edification & Awakening by Anti-Climacus (Penguin Classics)","review":"Herein lies many of Kierkegaard's most vehement attacks on his utter disgust as what he sees as the shallow and hypocritical Christians of his time. In fact, the rantings rank up there with Nietzsche's tirades against what he liked to call the \\"rabble.\\"As you may have guessed by the title, this is not to be an uplifting book. Kierkegaard will never be mistaken for Robert Schuller - that much is for certain. In it, the Danish philosopher (generally considered the father of existentialism) grapples with guilt. Not just anyone's guilt, either, but Soren Kierkegaard's guilt. In page after page he discerns how man's sinful nature is corruptive to his relationship to God. What is worse, no matter how hard he tries, he can't stop sinning any more than he can consciously stop breathing.Kierkegaard then looks up from his desk and wonders why all those so-called Christians out there aren't doing the same thing that he is. The Dane is introspective, to say the least, and the nucleus of his thought emanates from Socrates' words at his trial, as recorded in Plato's APOLOGY:...I say again that the greatest good of man is daily to converse about virtue, and all that concerning which you hear me examining myself and others, and that the life which is unexamined is not worth living- Plato, APOLOGY, Trans: B JowettHere is a great man's attempt to follow the dictum of Socrates, and examine his own life. In this sense, THE SICKNESS UNTO DEATH is comparable to St. Augustine's CONFESSIONS, albeit a bit on the morbid side.One of the Dane's favorite metaphors was of driver falling asleep at the reigns of his wagon.

It costs 2 1/2 times the price of the other Kindle edition, which is only modest as most Kindle editions go, but by comparing it with a hard copy from Princeton, I am assured that it has the complete text. This edition seems at the very least to have radically broken pagination. The Preface (written by Kierkegaard) is missing, and it seems as if much of the Introduction is missing.

It is a fascinating read for those who are agnostic or atheist as well, although I understand that a lot of atheists do not like to read it. If you are Christian, it will help you gain more insight and a more intellectual approach to your faith and applications for daily life/dealing with situations. If you are atheist, perhaps it can help you resolve some of your issues with religion or to help you see a more intellectual approach to religion other than the bible-verse screamers or other hard-core (and offensive) religious folk out there (just so you can get an understanding of people with religious/faith-based beliefs). I think there are lessons to be learned from it whether you are Christian or not.

This book will bring about inter contemplation and seeking which will strengthen ones ability to help find ones true self. In doing so it will help you shread any vestiage of the modern faith which is devoid of seeking truth.If you want an affirmation of your true inter-self to surface then I highly recomend this book."},{"Title":"The Sickness unto Death: A Christian Psychological Exposition of Edification & Awakening by Anti-Climacus (Penguin Classics)","review":"The Sickness Unto Death:A Christian Psychological Expositionfor Edification and Awakeningby Anti-Climacus; 'edited' by S.

Christianity has undergone a mass exodus of nearly all intellectual beings. Coming from that standpoint, one gets to the final chapter of this book and feels a few chapters are missing...(Kierkegaard quotes a passage of the bible which has the pharisees accusing Jesus of being sent by the devil: &#34;He doth not cast out demons except by the prince of demons, Beezlebub!&#34; Kierkegaard's carefully built house of faith risks crumbling, and there the book ends. Two hundred pages of telling us how necessary pain and doubt are for becoming a more existential and authentic person, and then he leaves us at a place where the bottom falls out of the religious universe. &#34;What now?&#34; Asks the non-religious reader.If you plan on reading a lot of Kierkegaard, read Fear and Trembling, which stands the test of time and suits both Theologians and Philosophers equally. I found its meditation on faith and the story of Abraham to be very moving, even for an atheist or nihilist such as myself. In fact, Kierkegaard seems to me the first person to thoroughly understand the story of Abraham and Isaac...in the book he tells the story 5 times and using 5 different alternate motives, each one more frightening and severe than the previous, such that by the end of it, we once more account Abraham a hero and a saint of the very highest order (i.e. an aesthetic lunatic!)Considering Kierkegaard's other work, Diary of a seducer is aggravating and &#34;The Pure of Heart will one thing&#34; is too obsessed with Plato's &#34;Good&#34; to be inspiring."},{"Title":"The Sickness unto Death: A Christian Psychological Exposition of Edification & Awakening by Anti-Climacus (Penguin Classics)","review":"which, in response to Kierkegaard's brilliance Allen succintly noted, &quot;and I have trouble writing two sentences on My Trip to the Zoo.&quot;"},{"Title":"Conversations with Stoppard","review":"Tom Stoppard is one of, if not the, most important living playwrights.

In *The Antelope Wife*, however, she has returned to an approach that is reminiscent of her first and most triumphant novel, *Love Medicine*. She writes in a style that may be difficult for some readers to accept--no,it's not &quot;obscure&quot; in the sense of a James Joyce novel, but she changes voices, time frames, and situations constantly. The result is a tapestry-like narrative that is uniquely effective, in my view. Erdrich has a way with words that is rare in today's literary world, despite the countless novels that are published annually. Moreover, because of her own Native American heritage, she is able to convey with incredible effectiveness the realities of past and present life and consciousness within those Indian cultures with which she is familiar.This is a fine work, one that makes me look forward all the more to Louise Erdrich's next book."},{"Title":"THE ANTELOPE WIFE","review":"With each book, my admiration grows for this writer. Her attention to detail, characterizations, interweaving of mysticism and reality -- and with all, an original dash of humor laced with sadness. As with Burning Tales of Love, she weaves many disparate threads together, creating a narrative blanket that you never want to unwrap from. I've read everything she's written, and in this day when prizes such as the National Book Award mean so much in sales and recognition, it amazes me that her work isn't at least among the finalists."},{"Title":"THE ANTELOPE WIFE","review":"I must say that I was somewhat dissapointed with this book. I expected more depth from the characters than what they could give. I miss characters like Lipsha, as complex as the stories of which they were a part. As usual, all the characters are tied to one another in a knot which has no beginning or end. Unfortunately, the depth which they lack makes this, as another person commented &quot;hard to follow&quot;. Erdrich ties them together for the sake of having them tied; many of the connections among them are forced at best. The big, loose, loopish, way in which the story is written makes this the most authentic piece of Native American Fiction Erdrich has ever written. Had the characters been more developed, it would have been one of her best."},{"Title":"THE ANTELOPE WIFE","review":"This book is beautiful and sad -- intelligent and thoughtful. The author has great empathy for all of her characters -- the good and the bad -- the stable and the disturbed. The twin-ness of the stories and the characters is what achieves this empathy -- it is an exploration, not an apology for the complexities of people. The narrative voices throughout the novel are fraught with a touching and genuine emotion that refrains from becoming sappy. It is difficult to read the woes and ponderings of these characters and to avoid an empathy -- a reading between the lines -- that relate to the author's personal woes. If you wondered, as I did, what effect her personal trials would have on her fiction, this book answers that question better than any interview could. I look forward to her next effort."},{"Title":"THE ANTELOPE WIFE","review":"I have admired Erdrich's writing in the past---\\"Tracks\\" and \\"The Beet Queen\\"--so I was looking forward to reading another of her novels. I must say I was disappointed here. Though Erdrich, like N. Scott Momaday, has a highly poetical style and her pages are filled with beautiful images (which is certainly a positive characteristic), a novel after all needs to have a strong story line or a point. Beautiful sentences and poetic expressions do not make a story, even if spiced with magical realism, sex, recipes, and colorful beads. As a literary testimony to a section of Native American experience, THE ANTELOPE WIFE has great merit. But as a novel, in the company of all the novels of the world, I felt that in this case, Erdrich tried to stretch out her career and write the next book though her heart was not in it. Perhaps it was a bad time in her life. The novel felt to me as one written by a person \\"trying to be literary\\". She writes of the mixed and intertwined fates of all those people of the Anishinabe world---Indians, whites, men, women, strong and weak---like beads on a string. The Indians come out holding the short stick. Within this framework, individuals play out their fates, violence and love intermingling with mystery and mundane existence. The characters somehow do not rise above their initial characterizations. The women are stronger than the men for the most part: they endure while the men often fall into alcohol and despair. The author writes in graceful style, but not much depth. I felt---at the risk of sounding snotty---that THE ANTELOPE WIFE belongs more in the category of \`chick-lit' than in \`American literature'. I once read part of a novel by Amy Tan, but could not finish for similar reasons. I did read THE ANTELOPE WIFE in its entirety, because Erdrich's writing differs favorably from most other authors', but I grew tired of the soap opera quality of this story."},{"Title":"THE ANTELOPE WIFE","review":"(First of all, it is a NOVEL, not a collection of short stories as is advertised in Amazon.Com.) The Antelope Wife is Louise Erdrich's best novel since Love Medicine. She uses language like paint, creating pictures and moments. Unfortunately, the plot is still hard to follow, and the characters are so similar that you find yourself having to scan backwards to try to remember who's who. Her symbolism in this book include: Men nursing infants, women nursing dogs, beadwork, twins, baked goods (playing the same role that meat played in Beet Queen), plains Indians, urban Indians, and dogs, some eaten. In her non-fiction book The Blue Jay's Dance, Erdrich writes: &quot;I do not like cats, so I am fascinated by their silken ways.&quot; As a reader, I do not like Erdrich, so I am fascinated by the words she chooses to put on the page."},{"Title":"THE ANTELOPE WIFE","review":"I am a true fan of Louise Erdrich but I must say this particular book is not my favorite, save it for the last and read ALL of her other books!"},{"Title":"THE ANTELOPE WIFE","review":"The theme of this Erdrich novel is beaded tapestry and how our lives are smilarly woven into a pattern. She also shows the interweaving of past and present, the animal world with the human world, and myth with reality.Common wisdom says that narrative should almost always be in one voice and that stories should move in a linear progression. Erdrich, as do many of the best Native American writers, shows that this is not necessarily so. Though I did find myself frustrated sometimes trying to follow the connections of past and present, and how different people were related, it became clear in the end that the tale was told in a circle, and eventually it all made sense. Erdrich does not tie up all of the loose ends, however. There remains some mystery, for example, in the characters of the two grandmothers, which is what gives the story a lasting value and keeps you thinking long after you've finished reading.The one flaw, for me, though, was that the weavi!ng still had some loose threads. Like the telling of a family history, everything is included, even the parts that are not necessary to the plot. Perhaps I missed something in my reading or interpretation, but I felt that the story of Sweet Heart Calico (the true antelope wife) and Klaus could have stood alone. While it was fascinating and well handled in and of itself, it really was not necessary to the main story. Also the story of the German soldier was a bit superfluous.Of course, Erdrich was not really writing a family history. She was writing a novel about family histories, and as such, she could have done a little more weeding and honing. In spite of its small flaws, however, this is still a beautiful and well-written work."},{"Title":"THE ANTELOPE WIFE","review":"Great read. I really enjoy Louise Erdrich's work.

As I miss my turn and screech through another yellow light sweet crumbs melt in my mouth and slide into my gut. I constantly slide in and out of this story.

I often thought I was reading a native American version of Ulysses without the Doomsday book to explain it. I assume some parts were intended to be comical, but,overall, I found the book to be boring and depressing."},{"Title":"THE ANTELOPE WIFE","review":"Lousie Erdrich's writing wraps the reader in intricate strands of symbolism, characters and shifting time and place. Stories are woven, questions are raised and as time passes answered. The strands begin to straighten out and make sense. Re-reading the book to get it all straight is a treat and a gift. I will gladly settle into Erdrich's writing over authors who leave no question marks or connections to ponder any day.The power, danger and wonder of intense love is but one of the journeys the reader will take in this book."},{"Title":"THE ANTELOPE WIFE","review":"I loved how the plot and characters in this book were so intricately woven together.

For me, this book came off as very bizarre (a man breastfeeding a baby) and depressing (betrayal, loneliness and death). But the thin line between love and hate running through the book is compelling. And I enjoy how Louise writes in the POV or about particular characters. She did it in Crown of Columbus and she does it here. I find myself \\"becoming\\" her characters as I read each chapter. And the use of the Okijbwa language peaks my curiosity into the culture and lifestyle of these people. I can't rave about the novel because it was so unsettling. But I did enjoy it. She is a talented writer and I can't wait to read her other books."},{"Title":"THE ANTELOPE WIFE","review":"The tale was too esoteric. It was very difficult to follow. I could only last one chapter then I was off to sleep!"},{"Title":"THE ANTELOPE WIFE","review":"This is definitely one of her best works yet. It is a spellbinding and powerful book."},{"Title":"THE ANTELOPE WIFE","review":"The couples, who are likely to become the parents of a little baby, first find a name for that sojourner even before he/she is born. This name usually has to carry positive meanings beneath it, such as the ones from religious, legendary themes which remind people of force ,power, durability etc... The reason is obvious: People all around the world -no matter where they are from or what religion they have etc... - name their children with names associated with strength, stability as they believe -at least want to believe- that those names bring the attribution of the meaning to their children.Naturally, in literature the influence of this belief can be seen. In the novel of Louise Erdrich The Antelope Wife, the protagonists (as there are multiple points of view, I mention here Protagonists) believe that there is a strong relationship between the names they possess and their destiny. The Antelope Wife's impact mostly stems from its different way of narrating. In most of the ordinary novels there is usually one protagonist. In this novel there are many important characters all of whom contribute to the plot. Yet the most vital character can be perceived as the Antelope Wife. Klaus Shawano at first sight, falls in love with her, feels himself compelled to be with her, and begins to follow her secretly. Stubbornly, Klaus keeps on following her, and he manages to catch her; yet she rejects to be with him, and he, not knowing how to make her stay \\"tie[s] her up\\" with sweetheart calico. (30). Here, he metaphorically ties her up to himself with sweetheart calico. At the end, Klaus unties her, that is to say, ends his obsessive love affair with her. Richard Whiteheart Beads' story is a bit tragic as his life was performed just the same way as the beadwork's. Richard's last name depends on a naming story,by which the scattered life of him is revealed. According to this story his family name - Whiteheart Beads -derives from the beadworks. In the course of time, the beadwork was scattered, similarly the life of Richard was scattered: \\"... Whiteheart Bead. That name went until Richard ended up with it\\" (240) . First, her wife Rozin leaves Richard for Frank Shawano. In the stupefaction of the shocking desertion of his wife, he accidentally causes his daughter Deanna to die. The two distress which come in a series profoundly deplores him. That is to say, his life was ruined just like the beadwork had been ruined, scattered... Thus, apparently, the Indian belief comes true: The name completely influenced the entire life of Richard Whiteheart Beads. The Ojibwa society in the novel also name the animals just like they name their children. The Windigo dog who represent intelligence in the book, manages to escape before they cook him in the stew pot to make soup, by using his ability of intelligence. As he manages to escape the stew pot, the owners of him name him as Almost Soup. The witty dog criticizes human beings: \\"In Ojibwa language, that is my name and I refuse to give it up for human mistakes or human triumphs\\" (81). The attempt to emphasize the significance of naming again strikes here, which determines Erdrich's Indian society.The names of some characters have been changed throughout the novel and these alterations of names have a great deal of contribution to the novel. As the novel is mostly based on dialectical adjustments, the alteration of names have a profound impact on the climax of the events. The one whose name have been subject to these alterations most frequently is the Blue Prairie Woman. Although the name changes, the characters' name still take place in further parts at the story, which means that the new name does not replace the former name. The old name remains active. In my opinion, Erdrich tries to conduct the sense of her concept of dialectical adjustments; the old concept remains even if new one comes out. Erdrich, throughout the novel, uses a lot of Indian words. The usage of these words give the sense of beadwork which also takes part in the novel; as one critic claims the bead-sewing twins are \\"create[ing] the patterns of the world\\" (Martin) . The Indian words among the English sentences seem to match thoroughly the beads among the patterns. That is, as the twins create the patterns of the world, the Indian words such as \\"nibi\\", \\"Daashkikaa\\" etc... create the pattern of the novel -or in other words- maintain the completeness of the novel. When examined attentively, Louise Erdrich implies a figurative meaning using the Indian name of Minneapolis: Gakahbekong. She ,consciously using the Indian name, tends to contrast the permanency of the Indian culture and temporality of Minneapolis, the name which belongs to Newly adopted culture. For, in Erdrich's literature, Gakahbekong represents the old, permanent generation whereas Minneapolis represents the new, the changing and the temporary. Although time changes everything in the world it can do nothing to the real, permanent,special ones such as Gakahbekong. No matter how much the appearance of Gakahbekong has transformed, it still contains the spiritual values inside itself. As I stated above, in Louise Erdrich's magical novel The Antelope Wife, the people believe that there is a strong relation between the names they possess and their destiny. Finally, it is clear that they are right about their belief in names as throughout the story, the names have influenced their lives. Almost for all the characters, their names have an important influence on their lives. In the beginning I mentioned that every society pays attention to names, nevertheless in the Ojibwa society it is a little more emphasized. The names have a great contribution to the rendering of the meaning. Specifically, the place, Gakahbekong, plays a significant role since its meaning serves as a symbolical explanation to the general meaning. With a lot of motives beneath the mysterious characters, two complex family relations, a time which consists of lives of three generations and the important characters like Zosie Roy, Antelope Wife, Richard Whiteheart Beads etc... the novel serves as a guide for the social importance of the names in the Indian society. Finally, as the paper dealt with the naming of characters and the influence of both naming and the alteration of the names to the plot, it helped to reveal the underlying motives in the novel of Erdrich, The Antelope Wife."},{"Title":"THE ANTELOPE WIFE","review":"This was a fairly good book, but the characters were lacking in whatever it is that makes them almost a personal friend . ..Still a good read. If you want to read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties.

From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift!

Whether people believe this porphyria account or not, just the fact that the term &quot;porphyria&quot; is the key focus, makes relatively unknown word more known. And it is important to note that Tammy's form of porphyria is only one form and type. There are at least eight, and even within these eight forms there are wide variances among the symptoms and the severity that patients experience. The only way for people to come to realize porphyria exists is if someone who has firsthand experience has the guts and fortitude to share it with others. I have AIP which is the hepatic acute type without the skin manifestations for which I thank God that I do not have. Yet I can appreciate the rest of the symptoms Tammy has endured. People including emergency room doctors look at you like you are a nut case or something when you tell them you have severe abdominal pain, muscle weakness, nausea, and yet standard lab tests do not show anything...which is very standard for the porphyrias. Some patients have had their appendix, or gallblader, or both out needlesly because doctors thought that was the source of pain. And for it being so rare, I don't think so. Some medical tests say one in 100,000 population, but I live in a community of 50,000 and there happen to be 14 in my support group which includes a 50 mile surrounding area. And none of us are related. If we look at other of our family members not in the group, we know of five more that could be diagnosed and have not at this point, including parents from which the patients have inherited this disease.

When I was first diagnosed I went to the library (small town Nebraska) and the only book I found with any information at all was the Tammy Evans Vampire Disease book. I read the book, I cried, I thought my feet were going to fall off, I thought, &quot;I can still go outside though!&quot; I felt very deceived by this book. I was mad! I was REALLY mad. my heart broke for this &quot;poor woman&quot; and all her suffering. Then I got some education... I have since discovered that YES, Porphyrics are an ignored species. We are not holders of a glamour disease. There are no celebrities with Porphryia. And my daughter more than likely (although testing latent ) has Variegate Porphyria too. For these reasons ONLY, I would recommend the book, just so the disease itself gets some press time! But when a newly diagnosed person asks me for a recommendation about available information, I send them to the webpages of other Porphyrics, not this book. They will eventually find iton their own. I don't want them to think their feet are going to fall off, or maybe their mothers were actually hiding in the attic in a coffin all their young years, or there backs will ooze scrud out all over them for no particular reason. And I certainly wouldn't recommend going for a 3 day walk OUTSIDE, I wouldn't even recommend a 3 minute walk outside!The disease itself manifests in strange ways...Not the exact same way for any Porphyric, Similarities exist, but we are all diferent!

The people must have read the wrong book! Reader, don't be scared. If you are a devotee to the subject, this is the book for you. It is easy, straightforward reading, no math required. As for shaky philosophy, the author is faithfully reproducing Ernst Mach's propositions - and even a certain Einstein found his inspiration in Mach's lectures. Personally I have no bones to pick with what I read, but if I ever had the inclination of writing such a book, I certainly would leave out a few things.Van Flanders has a lot to talk about: &quot;Faster than light motion in time is possible / Gravitation progresses faster than light / the physical universe has five and only five dimensions / it is infinite in extent in all five dimensions / there was no Big bang to start the universe / the universe is not expanding / the universal microwave radiation is of nearby origin / there are no black holes in the universe / quasars are associated with our own and nearby galaxies / galaxies are arranged in waves in an immense medium /gravitational shielding is possible / the classical description of quantum entities is incorrect / the Bell inequality in quantum physics should be violated / There is no &quot;Oort Cloud&quot; of comets / comets and asteroids are quite similar in nature / comets and asteroids are accompanied by satellites / a former major planet exploded between Mars and Jupiter / this explosion occurred just 3 million years ago / this explosion was the origin of comets and asteroids / this explosion may be connected with the origin of man / the great pyramids in Egypt are perhaps 9000 years old / artificial structures may exist on the surface of Mars / tidal forces on the sun and giant planets are significant / there may be a sunspot-planet link / solar eclipses are best viewed away from the centre line / Mercury was originally a moon of Venus / our Moon originated from the Pacific basin of the Earth / the Moon no longer shows us the same face it used to / the Martian moons are the survivors of a great many moons/ a great rift on Mars is the impact site of a former moon / Jupiter's Red Spot is a floating impact remnanat / Saturn's rings are only a few million years old / Solar system bodies have received black carbon deposits / the moons of Neptune were violently disrupted / Pluto and Charon are escaped moons of Neptune / Another undiscovered planet probably exists beyond Pluto&quot;Not that I or anybody has to agree to all this, but Van Flanders propositions his hypothesis as a true scientist, he is not preaching gospel. He deserves a fair hearing. If I try to imagine how his own peers may view this rich enchilada - oh well, at present the author must be living in the remotest Siberia. It's not about being right or wrong, and the author may very well be more often right than wrong, but it doesn't add much credibility where it counts most for a man of his qualifications. One has to hand it to him, Van Flandern has courage!But for us lay people and lesser mortals, this book is a fun ride, this much I can promise you."},{"Title":"Dark Matter, Missing Planets and New Comets: Paradoxes Resolved, Origins Illuminated","review":"From the back cover:&quot;Tom Van Flandern is both an insider and an outsider. A professional astronomer for twenty-five years, he is well versed in the customs of mainstream science. On the other hand, after a long review of the assumptions underlying a large portion of received truth in astronomy and cosmology, he has come to a radical conclusion: much currently accepted theory is wrong...&quot;This is a hard book to read for the layman with little background in science, whether you have a good vocabulary or not; whether you are bright-normal, or not. It is difficult to read because it requires of you that you think while you are reading. It requires of you that you read the same passage over more than once, and then try to visualize what the author is saying. It requires of you that you use all of your intelligence, and then perhaps decide after struggling with the concept that you will go on and see what else he has to say, without fully grasping what he has just said.The author is a very bright gentleman, that much is obvious. And, as far as I could follow him, I found his reasoning to be impeccable. And his results, his conclusions, I found to be exciting.I hope he is right.He questions Einstein, and uses Einstein's own theory to prove him in error, and he does it without depending upon arcane mathematical formulae. He uses plain language and diagrams that any bright layman, who reads carefully, can follow. But, I warn you, the territory into which you will be drawn is not for sissies.He is saying that the Big Bang theory of the origin of the universe is nonsense.He is saying that the speed of light is not the fastest thing around: That gravity makes it look like a slowpoke. That lightspeed is not the limiting speed.He is saying that the universe is both infinitely old, and infinite in size. There is no end to it in space, and it had no beginning in time. It is neither expanding, nor is it due to collapse. Space and time are infinite, and there are only five dimensions with which we may measure: Three of space, one of time, and one of scale.He is saying that there was once a planet, &quot;Planet X,&quot; between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, which exploded and is now the source of the asteroid belt and of the comets that, from time to time, invade our solar system.He is saying that space is filled, not only with a light carrying medium (shades of Ether!) but also with a smaller, faster, universal gravity medium (C-gravitons) which push the planets and their moons and stars together by bombarding them, rather than their being drawn together by some mysterious force, and he demonstrates it with deductive reasoning which is, to say the least, very persuasive.If you have any curiosity about these things, this is the book for you. You will find it exciting and challenging. If, on the other hand, you are content to leave such esoteric matters up to those who are smarter and better qualified, and would rather play computer games with your spare time, join the multitude!"},{"Title":"Dark Matter, Missing Planets and New Comets: Paradoxes Resolved, Origins Illuminated","review":"If you have any interest in pondering matters scientific, I can't recommend this book too highly. This is the most interesting new book on any subject that I've read in years, and the most interesting of its type -- exciting, even -- I've ever read. Yet it's a quite \`easy' read, containing hardly any explicit mathematics. Van Flandern is an astronomer with such impeccably well established credentials that his peers can't completely dismiss his \`maverick' theories. From a simple, sensible starting point he carries the reader, by purely deductive reasoning, to a new view of the basic nature of things: from electrons to galaxies, from the nature of a photon to the cause of gravity to the origin of the solar system. Along the way, several paradoxes of existing theories (relativity, quantum mechanics, etc.) are explained and then resolved (or their resolutions indicated) in the most simple and easily understandable expositions I've ever seen. Those acquainted in some detail with existing theories will appreciate the creative brilliance of Van Flandern's insights, the kind that seem to turn on a mental switch that blasts away every shadow in your field of vision at once, and the kind with which his book literally teems (the unpretentious simplicity of the author's conversational style may disguise its radical significance from the casual reader). Challenging much of existing scientific orthodoxy, Van Flandern's new theory is able to cover the ground of several current theories at once, but more simply and directly than any, with fewer inconsistencies, and without requiring the abandonment of a \`common sense' view of the world. (It has now been reported that the newly operational Hubble telescope's inability to find so-called \`dark matter' has thrown scientists into turmoil because currently accepted cosmological theory requires that the universe be about 90% filled with it. This is precisely one of Van Flandern's predictions [amongst many more]: that no dark matter would be found by the Hubble scope, because there is no dark matter; that there was no need for scientists to infer its existence in the first place; that the phenomena which led them to infer it were already predicted and fully explained by Van Flandern's own simple view of gravitation [and by the way, there are no \`black holes' either, according to Van Flandern]). My guess is that many more of Van Flandern's predictions are destined to be verified, and I believe this book may eventually find a place at the base of future scientific inquiry in many fields, not the least of which may be the philosophy of science (specifically its epistemology). If you are curious about such things as the nature of matter and the origin of the solar system, but feel inadequately equipped to grasp what modern science has to say about such things, read this book. You will not get the all-too-common condescending attempt to water-down the \`mysteries' of modern science into a form intelligible to little-non-scientist you, but rather a straightforward new theory, logically derived in front of your eyes, which challenges the roots of many of today's complex accepted paradigms, yet whose essence is simple enough to be thoroughly communicated to the intelligent layman without \`losing in the translation'.

VF points out numerous ways in which VF's theories can be disproven, and states his openness to being proved wrong if by doing so, more truth is uncovered. One of his recurring themes is that we should always be willing to re-examine, re-evaluate and rescind theories which do not accord with observations rather than the more typical approach of the mainstream which is to either throw out the aberrant observations or devise ever more twisted additions to the status quo to accomodate the data which doesn't fit.Not just in Astronomy but in all things we should be open to new and challenging information, and willing to change our cherished beliefs if they are obviously at odds with reality.The mainstream probably considers VF a wacko, but then again, that's what they thought of Galileo."},{"Title":"Dark Matter, Missing Planets and New Comets: Paradoxes Resolved, Origins Illuminated","review":"__________________Van Flandern was a consultant to the government regarding the Global Positioning System. Doubts had been expressed that the GPS could remain accurate due to a relativistic effect known as &quot;frame dragging&quot;, but TVF concluded that, through a slightly too convenient coincidence, &quot;frame dragging&quot; didn't apply to this particular narrow case. It's clear that he understands conventional theories very well, and that's what made it possible for him to develop his Meta Model, the discussion of which comprises the first half of this book.I can see how the Meta Model discussion would not get high marks, as it clearly didn't in at least one of the earlier reviews here. I read most of it, finally got bored, and skipped into the second half of the book (first edition ISBN 1556431554) which pertains to TVF's Exploding Planet Hypothesis.When he wrote the first edition, the Alvarez theory was gaining momentum elsewhere in the sciences, as the position of the impact crater that ended the Cretaceous had been located at Chicxulub (the crater had been located circa 1960, but the Alvarez theory didn't come around until 1980 -- see &quot;Night Comes to the Cretaceous&quot; by James Lawrence Powell, ppback 0156007037 hardcover 0716731177).TVF didn't mention any of that, spending time instead on the &quot;Face on Mars&quot;. At that time (early 1990s) the newest surface photos from Martian orbit were still those of Viking from the 1970s. The &quot;Face&quot; did exist, and it was an artifact -- but it existed only in those photos, and was only an artifact of the lower resolution of the Viking cameras, as opposed to that of the recent (late 1990s) orbiter. I don't see how any reasonable person can look at the higher res photos (as opposed to both the Viking photos and the low res photos from the new orbiter, which can mimic the resolution of Viking) and conclude that the &quot;Face&quot; is artificial. This devotion to a completely discredited idea is not to TVF's credit, and as someone who respects his intellect and many of his ideas, I wish he'd knock it off.The best part of either edition is the discussion of TVF's Exploding Planet Hypothesis (EPH). He uses the model to explain things like the tipped axis of Uranus, disturbed moon system of Neptune, retrograde rotation of Venus, Earth-crossing objects, and various other things which have made thoughtful people wonder for a very long time. In the original edition the EPH was about 3.2 million years ago.This new edition extends the EPH by adding an earlier exploding planet dated to 65 million years ago, in order to provide a source for the object which crashed into the Earth and ended the dominion of the dinosaurs. TVF's extension seems a bit ad hoc, but once a single unexplained planetary explosion has been posited, additional ones shouldn't be considered surprising or forbidden. On the other hand, TVF had already questioned the (also ad hoc) Oort Cloud idea, and that's the leading competitor (and dominant paradigm) for a source of the Chicxulub object. Since TVF is devoted to building a single comprehensive model to explain oddball characteristics of various solar system objects to replace the dozens of (also ad hoc) unique explanations.[see &quot;Shoemaker by Levy&quot; ISBN 0691002258 for some brief comments quoted from Shoemaker regarding the role played by Jupiter in sweeping the Solar System of transitory debris -- TVF needs multiple exploding planets because such debris would either be kicked out of the system or bent into untroubling orbits within ten million years, mostly due to the presence of Jupiter]TVF's discussion of the origin of Earth's own Moon is a great reason to buy this book, and a great place to begin reading it for those who are like me, and enjoy picking at a book here and there. It's also a discussion I'd like to criticize a little. TVF discusses the four basic models of lunar formation, then picks them off one by one, as he offers his own model (fission from Earth due to overspin). The problem with his critique of the capture model is that his arguments apply also to his overspin model, and there's nothing he can do about it. Furthermore, the early presence of water on the Earth (a discovery that I think antedates this new edition of &quot;Dark Matter&quot;) reduces the likelihood that the Moon was born of fission from Earth, either due to TVF's model or the more conventional impact model which is the dominant one of the five presented.Despite the catastrophic character of an exploding planet, TVF's model is really quite uniformitarian, and for those who object to catastrophism on a priori grounds, this book and his EPH should provide a great introduction to the topic that fascinates one's friends and neighbors without letting on to anyone that you're secretly hoping to join the winning side. :^)"},{"Title":"Dark Matter, Missing Planets and New Comets: Paradoxes Resolved, Origins Illuminated","review":"I have read this book twice already! For those of you interested in cosmology (the way the solar system and universe work) then this book is great. Tom Van Flandern cleary and succinctly puts forward his meta-model of the universe in a way that puts mainstream astronomy to shame. I have always believed that things can be logically explained and make sense in the cosmos around us. This book does just that. He makes a killer argument about an infinite universe in both time and scale, pointing out many reasons as to why the big-bang is a failure. Van Flandern discusses the speed of gravity by using the sun-earth-moon system to show that gravity must be travelling far quicker than the speed of light. I like how this book embraces many aspects of astronomy all in one. Best of all is his discussion regarding the basis of science, in that we should think of new models based on the existing evidence as opposed to fitting evidence to an old model. This book is a very worthwhile read and will open your eyes to what mainstream astronomy has been keeping from you."},{"Title":"Dark Matter, Missing Planets and New Comets: Paradoxes Resolved, Origins Illuminated","review":"I read the first edition of Tom Van Flandern's book and it's excellent--a well written and absorbing work! While you may not agree with everything the author proposes (at least for now), you'll realize just how much intensive research and mathematical wizardy went into the author's exploration of current cosmology! Van Flandern is probably 100 years ahead of his time in the field of astronomy, especially in the re-examination of ideas like planetary breakups, the birth of the Earth-Moon system, and the origin of tektites. The author is a neo Kepler for the New Millennium, notably when it comes to rethinking science's blind faith in our present paradigm of the universe and solar system. (Especially fascinating is Van Flandern's discussion about the origins of asteroids and comets. How is it the majority of scientists have come to accept a concept like that of the so-called &quot;Oort Cloud&quot; based on little evidence?) If you don't mind having your scientific be! ! lief system rattled a bit, then get this book and read it!"},{"Title":"Dark Matter, Missing Planets and New Comets: Paradoxes Resolved, Origins Illuminated","review":"Tom Van Flandern's book adds a new dimension to cosmology--not only does it present a novel approach to timeless issues, it stands up to the closest scientific scrutiny. The author has a proven track record and top notch credentials, so when he begins his hard-hitting critique of the status quo it's a breathtaking read, for laymen and scientists alike. Let's be honest about the Big Bang Theory--even the most respected scientists today will readily admit it is full of holes. But it takes a new look, like Tom Van Flandern's book, to explain not only why the theory is wrong but what to substitute in its place. This is a significant book and if you read it you will get a thrill just as those who read Copernicus and Galileo must have gotten a thrill to realize they were reading about the future of science. Read it--you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Dark Matter, Missing Planets and New Comets: Paradoxes Resolved, Origins Illuminated","review":"I was extremely impressed by the amount of thinking that went into this book. Whether you agree with Van Flandern or not, he goes deep, challenging fundamental assumptions at every turn. His writing is also first rate. Van Flandern is very good at communicating difficult ideas -- not an easy thing to do.I started out skeptical about exploding planets. By the end the author had almost convinced me. In the process I learned a great deal about celestial mechanics. I found especially appealing his idea that gravity has limited range of 2 parsecs. That would explain so many things. Like Van Flandern, I regard the Big Bang as a lot of nonsense. I also suspect that he is probably correct about the origin of the Valles Marineris on Mars -- the deepest canyon in the solar system. What an ingenious idea. And I admire Van Flandern for discussing controversial subjects, such as the monuments of Mars. His updated synthesis is the best I have seen yet. Clearly R.C. Hoagland benefitted greatly from Van Flanern's ideas. What a story.I disagree with the author in several areas. Van Flandern could be correct that most comets originated from a disintegrated planet. That is plausible, though whether this happened via an explosion or a collision, I still have my doubts. I suspect there have always been rogue objects of unknown origin moving through the solar system. His explanation why these objects could not come from interstellar space was not entirely clear to me. Hale Bopp was much too large to be derived from a moon sized body.The book was published before the discoveries of Hyakutake's ephemeral tail and cometary x-rays, which in my view are diagnostic for an electrical cometary connection. I wonder if Van Flandern is aware that several years ago a physicist in New Mexico demonstrated that terrestrial lightning causes x-rays, a discovery that's been confirmed many times, since. I believe that cometary x-rays and those caused by lightning are one and the same phenomenon.I subscribe to the solar capacitor model. In my view the astronomer Bessel was correct long ago when he argued for an electrical connection between sun and comet. Van Flandern's discussion of comets touches on but neglects to discuss in full a most telling point: That comets are wildly variable in their brightness. Why, for example, was Halleys' comet 200X as bright after perihelion as before, at the same distance from the sun? Fred Hoyle described its display as a series of explosions. This sort of show could not be due to reflected light, alone, even if Van Flandern is correct that some of the material in the coma is debris from the original break up. I believe the extreme variability of X-ray generation and brightness is caused by solar flares and coronal mass ejections. In other words, there is a direct connection between sun and comet. Nor can a break up model account for the preponderance of smoke sized particles in the coma. The same is true for the vast cloud of hydrogen surrounding comets. All of this suggests electrical phenomena -- which NASA and mainstream science continue to ignore and dismiss.I believe that comets draw in ionized material from the rear via the tail. And free hydrogen is attracted to the negatively charged nucleus from all directions. This is not my model. I don't take credit for it, though I won't mention the originator's name because I promised him I would not. (His initials are J M)A few other points: I doubt very much if the rings of Saturn are as old as Van Flandern thinks. Back when the fine detail in the rings first became known, the astronomers Victor Clube and Bill Napier argued that the rings could not be older than 10-20,000 years. After which the fine detail would gradually wash out and be lost. I suspect that physicist Paul LaViolette is correct that the rings are the signature of a recent event (see his book Earth Under Fire). In LaViolette's view this was caused by a galactic superwave. LaViolette thinks the cosmic wave pushed the sun's nebular cloud of dust back into our solar system, wreaking all manner of havoc, causing the ice ages etc. The same explanation would account for the zodiacal disk, a remnant that apparently is tipped 3 degrees away from the plane of the solar system, i.e., in the direction of the galactic center. Again, this is Paul's argument.My other point of disagreement concerns Venus. Van Flandern's link with Mercury implies that Venus is a very old planet. How, then do we account for its tremendous heat? Venus should have cooled down long ago. The Magellan Mission showed that the planet is 85% volcanic -- though I suspect even this high number understates the reality. Could a greenhouse cause this? Of course not. The heat is coming from the planetary core. But why? Simple. Venus is very young, perhaps only a few thousand years old. I've studied the so called Venusian impact craters and can discern no difference between them and the planet's volcanic craters. Some of the \\"impact\\" craters actually have large associated lava extrusions. In my view most or all of them are volcanic in origin. Venus has many volcanic features unique in the solar system -- why? Simple. It is the youngest planet, by far.I believe Venus was originally a giant comet that was captured by the sun. I know celestial mechanics can't explain the how of this -- but if it's shown that large comets do attract ionized material from the rear they can actually add enormous amounts of mass, which would slow them down, shortening their period and making capture a realistic possibility. I suspect that some of the other planets (and some of the moons) had a similar origin.In short, I largely agree with Van Flandern. But I also hold for an altogether different capture mechanism (originated by J M) governed by electromagnetism. In an unpublished draft of his Principia Isaac Newton wrote:\\"He who investigates the laws and effects of electrical forces with the same success and certainty [by which I have investigated celestial mechanics] will greatly promote philosophy [i.e., natural philosophy], even if perhaps he does not know the cause of these forces. First the phenomenon should be observed, then their proximate causes, and afterward the causes of the causes, should be investigated, and finally it will be possible to come down to the causes of the causes (established by phenomena) to their effects, by arguing a priori...\\""},{"Title":"Dark Matter, Missing Planets and New Comets: Paradoxes Resolved, Origins Illuminated","review":"I watched a recent episode of the popular series \\"The Universe\\" after reading this book and had a very different impression than I would have prior to reading it. Listenting to a respected astronomer \\"pontificating\\" about how \\"we have not yet detected Dark Matter, but it has to be there, because the Big Bang Theory says it has to be there, and the Big Bang Theory is an article of faith...\\" seemed almost foolish, in the context of Van Flandern's theories.Van Flandern covers a lot of ground in his excellent book and I confess that I skimmed through the chapters explaining celestial mechanics. The book covers many topics and it is unlikely that everyone will want to read every chapter (pick and choose).Among many other interesting things, Van Flandern asserts that gravity waves (or particles)propagate at a speed that is 20 billion times the speed of light! To put that into perspective, it means that a graviton would traverse the entire span of the known universe (plus or minus ten billion light years)in 1.5 years!To me, Van Flandern's key take away message is that scientists today have gone astray of the \\"tried and true\\" Scientific Method and rely more and more on inductive reasoning to attempt to prove their theories, rather than observations and the use of deductive reasoning. Van Flandern cites as one example the increasingly complicated, convoluted and hard-to-fathom \\"fixes\\" offered to maintain support for the Big Bang Theory, when new observations do not fit the model.Van Flandern also asserts that scientists today are behaving more-or-less the way the Church behaved 400 years when it banned Galileo's writings. To put it another way, we are \\"back-sliding\\" into personal attacks and bullying when a scientist's theories differ from those that are commonly accepted - especially anything that treads on the \\"sacred ground\\" of The Big Bang Theory and Special Relativity. Van Flandern predicts that historians will one day look at the last hundred years of certain aspects of scientific research (notably astrophysics)with a degree of distress and humor.Van Flandern also admonishes scientists for refusing to acknowledge acumulated credible observations over the last 20 or so years that collectively support \\"artificiality\\" as the explanation for the geometric structures and \\"Face\\", on Cydonia on the planet Mars.

(I think it is best read by starting with Chapter 6, and then returning to the earlier chapters later.) Dr. Van Flandern describes a little known aspect of gravity called the sphere of influence. Even though Newton's Laws predicts it precisely, this effect was not realized until the first manned space flights. The author also develops an outstanding and original explanation for the origin of comets in our solar system, effectively debunking the \\"Oort cloud\\" model cherished by mainstream cosmologists. In this book, he develops the Exploding Planet Hypothesis (EPH) to account for the asteroid belt. This is supported by all of the known experimental evidence to date, including the recent 2005 results of the comet impact probe.When you read this book, you realize just how far off the mark mainstream astronomy has strayed with their Big Bang Theory.

Clarke in one way: Someone once said about Clarke that &quot;if he had stuck to any one hypothesis, he would have been a dangerous man.&quot; Like Clarke, Van Flandern works many hypotheses. And if it is permissible to have a favorite Clarke book or theme, it is certainly also permissible to extol the virtures of DM,MP&amp;NC on the basis of the MP&amp;NC material alone.Science will advance at four times the current pace when they stop ejecting people like Halton Arp and TVF from their ranks."},{"Title":"Dark Matter, Missing Planets and New Comets: Paradoxes Resolved, Origins Illuminated","review":"This book sure has some wild hypotheses! But I think they tend to show not imagination and courage but poor intuition.Let's start with Van Flandern's idea that gravity propagates much faster than c, the speed of light. That is, does the Sun pull you towards where it is, or to where it was 8 minutes ago? I think Newton might well have agreed with Van Flandern's argument that were gravity to propagate at c, planetary orbits around the Sun would be gravitationally damped and unstable, and the Solar System would not exist.But this argument is false. It is the same for electromagnetism. A charge moving at constant speed pulls you towards where it will be when the field reaches you. A charge moving with constant velocity does not radiate: the lowest order radiation term is the dipole term, corresponding to an accelerating charge. And gravitational radiation depends not on the dipole term, but the typically much smaller quadrupole term, which can become significant for a body with a changing acceleration.Examinations of binary pulsars have indicated that a quadrupole moment does indeed lead to a gravitational damping and orbit decay. Not only that, the decay is consistent to within 1% of the speed of gravity equaling c. I find that convincing. Moreover, near-occultation observations of quasars may support this conclusion as well. And on top of that, a speed of gravity greater than c would transmit a signal backwards in time.Van Flandern argues that there is nothing special about c, given that we use electromagnetic waves to measure time and length. He's wrong. As Swiatecki and others have illustrated, the constancy of c is a consequence of the local spacetime manifold. Imagine a number of very thin boards with identical rectilinear grids and identical synchronized stopwatches fixed at all gridpoints on all boards. Now let the boards slide around at varying speeds and directions. Then smash one of the watches on the top board so hard that it stops all the watches directly beneath it. Later, smash another one the same way. You'll quickly discover the differential interval between spacetime events, and that will give you the value of c. And we've found c without any reference to light or to Maxwell's equations.Van Flandern supports the \\"fission\\" theory for the origin of the Moon, rather than the \\"giant impact\\" theory. While that's still possible, evidence is leaning heavily away from his idea.Now, what about a recently exploding planet creating the asteroid belt? Well, sure, there are many asteroid orbits that are unstable over really long times. But there's plenty of evidence that some asteroids have been around since the beginning of the solar system, and that what we're seeing is simply lots of collisions, not explosions. Moreover, a recent explosion, without a clear mechanism no less, is a little provincial as a theory.The funny part is that there are some wild phenomena, such as planetary migrations, especially in other stellar systems, which do bear plenty of investigation. We don't need to start by indulging in arbitrary and dubious speculations: explaining what's right in front of us is exciting enough!I think Van Flandern's comments about the \\"face on Mars\\" once again showed poor intuition. That \\"face\\" looked awfully strongly like something with a natural origin.Van Flandern does not like the Copenhagen interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, which he feels disregards the need for an underlying reality behind all the concepts. I think this actually may be a fair criticism, but there are alternative formulations of Quantum Mechanics which avoid such problems.Finally, Van Flandern goes after the Big Bang theory of the origin of our Universe. I think that's a mistake. The evidence is overwhelming that the Universe was once much denser and much, much hotter. We see that from the Hubble expansion, from the 2.7 K blackbody radiation, and most important, from the helium percentages in the visible universe corresponding to Big Bang nucleosynthesis. Complaining about the beryllium percentage is very poor intuition indeed: we'd still have that dense, hot universe just as the Big Bang says. He'd have been better off attacking the Inflationary models of the early universe: these are still fair game.Um, it could be that the accelerating expansion of the universe is heading towards a singularity (called the \\"Big Rip\\") in a finite time. Perhaps in a few billion years, spacetime will reach this. In the final million years, the galaxies would disperse, including our Milky Way. In the final months, our solar system would fly apart. In the final hours, the Earth would disintegrate, as gravity would no longer bind it together. At the end, all particles would explode as well. If you like wild ideas, this one is far more realistic than most of what Van Flandern proposes."},{"Title":"Dark Matter, Missing Planets and New Comets: Paradoxes Resolved, Origins Illuminated","review":"10-Point Rating: (7.0)In the first chapter, the author makes several mistakes that render most of his philosophical conclusions without base. His entire Meta-Model framework, though admirable in its scope and approach, is dependent upon nebulous understandings of &quot;nothing&quot; and (more importantly) &quot;substance&quot;. What this prima materia actually is is never addressed, leaving the foundation off the subsequent house he manages to build. Furthermore, the author seems to waver between treating his &quot;primary unit(s) of substance&quot; as divisible or not: at one point he says they are sizeless (i.e. have zero size), at another point he says all matter is divisible. Since his &quot;substance&quot; can be none other than matter, the author engenders a contradiction. The more empirically based discussion which dominates the bulk of the book is much more enjoyable, although the Meta-Model is always lurking in the background. All in all, a nice alternative read in cosmology/astronomy."},{"Title":"Dark Matter, Missing Planets and New Comets: Paradoxes Resolved, Origins Illuminated","review":"This book sounded so interesting I couldn't wait to order a copy. I am not a scientist or mathematician but I truly enjoy reading scientific books, articles and watching science programs on the television. This book started loosing me in the self-ingratiating preface and by the first chapter I hadn't a clue what the author was droning on about. A PhD writes this book for people with PhD's. The author needs to come down off his high intellectual horse and put his fascinating and intriguing ideas in layman's terms that the common man can understand. The illustrations are unremarkable and uninformative. I can pick my way with great interest through a book like Stephen Hawking's A Brief History Of Time. I toughly enjoyed Issac Asimov's The Collapsing Universe and Walter Alvarez's T.rex And The Crater of Doom. They were written with the common man in mind. I cannot challenge Van Flandern,s ideas but I can take issue with his writting style. This book is just tedious techno-babble an impossible read. Save it for the university classroom. Give it a pass, wait for the Readers Digest condensed version, buy it if you need a sleep aid or better yet wait for the movie."},{"Title":"Birding in Venezuela","review":"This is the only national bird finding guide for Venezuela and has long been carried by visiting birders along with handful of supplementary trip reports. It is a book you need if you're planning a birding trip to Venezuela.

With great care to document his sources, he lays out many of the origins of our current church practices. Although I thought this was going to be a \\"where did the Christmas tree come from\\" kind of book, instead I found it took on some of the most accepted parts of my religious tradition (carefully chosen word here, not \\"faith\\"). Mr. Viola tells of the administrative and cultural origins of church ceremony, structure of belief systems, clergy, worship practices, and trappings. If you just looked at the subjects, it would look like a classic Protestant \\"exposition\\" of the tired trappings of Catholicism until you realize it is really about the tired trappings of Protestant church.The book forced me to think through a lot of what I do and think in my worship and belief practices (again, not around what I actually believe), for that it is absolutely outstanding. But then Mr. Viola attempts to lay out some \\"new\\" form of small-group, home-church movement which he falls miserably short on. There are no answers here and that part of the book (the last chapter especially) should almost be ignored.Read this book to learn about the origins of what you do in church.

It had reviews that were negative and positive. It seemed controversial. As I read the book it reminded me of some of the early writings of the Restoration Movement. The book denounced extra-biblical practices in the religious world. The book highlighted the cultural practices that have become a norm in the Christian world. Many of these practices were originated from pagan practices. The book's plea was to go back to the early church. It was a primitive message to the core. Much of the book, the churches of Christ would amen. The plea of the book was the same as our plea. It was interesting to see how the church has mixed first century practices with accepted cultural practices in Christianity. There are some elements that people will disagree with, but the overall message of the book is restoration thought in its purity."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Pagan Christianity by Frank Viola is probably the most nauseating book I've ever read. It's not the fact that I disagree with much of what the author says but it's the way he says it that is such a turn off. From the very beginning of the book and throughout there is this arrogant, self-congratulatory tone from the author that is hard to stomach. He is clearly impressed with himself and his historical research and you feel like he is thumbing his nose at you the whole time you're reading. The tone of the book is such a turn off that it really didn't matter how convincing of an argument he made, you just want to just tell him to shut up.As far as the content of what he says, it is a very weak and biased argument. The author needs to learn the difference between what the Bible describes and what the Bible prescribes. Much of the Biblical references he uses to support his stance against such things as modern day sermons, the use of buildings, the use of pews, pulpits and even the way we sing, are descriptions of the early church. Description is not prescription.The Bible describes that the early church met in homes. No where does it prescribe it. The Bible describes the way the Apostles preached, no where does it prescribe that method. If you want to get technical about it, the early church is described as being communal where they sold all their possessions to support one another. I seriously doubt the author and the house church movement he advocates ad nauseum throughout the book are communal and share all possession.The author is clearly against anything that resembles a hierarchy of church government, which using the \\"description equaling prescription\\" model would leave the author being the one who is unbiblical. At the Jerusalem Council in Acts 15 there clearly is a hierarchy of church leaders firmly established. The author is against paid clergy, which is also unbiblical as the Apostle Paul advocates for the compensation of those who are involved in the ministry of preaching and teaching (I Timothy 5:17-18)The summation of the author's argument is that anything that is not original to the early church is pagan and therefore an abomination. That's fanciful ideology not grounded in reality. The reality is that as the church grew the needs and nuances of the church changed with time as it still does today. Any church that refuses to change, clinging to the past and the way things were done in \\"the olden day\\" usually dies. The church MUST adapt to its culture - not adopt its culture - but adapt to the culture it is in. If that means using Socrates' three point homily(which the author is against) then so be it. If that means erecting a church building for maximum outreach potential, then so be it. Jesus related to the culture in which he was in...a parable is not an original invention of Jesus. Paul related to the culture he was in...he quoted from a Greek poet. Using the tools and innovations of secular culture is not a bad thing. Much of what our secular culture produces proves to be incredibly effective tools for advancing the Gospel.Finally, the reality is that the church is full of broken people. As long as the church is full of broken people she will never be perfect. Contrary to what the author believes, there is no perfect way of doing church. God knows that and Frank Viola needs to come to grips with it."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"We associate George Barna with sociological studies about Christian faith and culture, intended to help pastors and churches be more effective. This book is something very, very different. In Pagan Christianity Barna and Frank Viola analyze contemporary worship and practice in an attempt to show how much paganism it has absorbed in 2000 years. Not everything here will be new to you; we have long known that Christianity, particularly our worship, picked up quite a few cultural artifacts along the way. But are those fatal to the faith? One can't help but think of Hisslop'sThe Two Babylons, and the highly doubtful thesis that every smidgen of extra-Christian, extra-Protestant influence adheres to the church and hopelessly contaminates current Christian practice. Pagan Christianity comes across as negative and slightly scolding, which is especially sad because it is under the byline of someone who has been the champion of innovative church leadership. The authors' point seems to be that the only legitimate Biblical expression of our faith will be Acts-style pastorless house churches. The rest of us are going about it all wrong. I'm not sure Pagan Christianity contributes much toward helping us to get it right."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"It's not a book that I could recommend. I've read quite a few books on the subject, but this one is the worst, which I have personally read. With some books, the reader can appreciate the analysis, while disagreeing with the conclusions. With this work, I couldn't even do this, because the analysis was deeply flawed. Please, if you want to explore this topic, buy a different book. Don't support such poor scholarship!"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"The basic thesis of this book is that traditional Christianity has adopted a number of practices that are not in the New Testament, and that these practices should be eliminated. When the authors refer to \\"traditional\\" Christianity, they mean both Protestant and Catholic churches - the critiques in this book are mainly directed to American evangelical churches. Sometimes Viola and Barna talk about the \\"institutional church\\", which they contrast to \\"organic\\" churches, or \\"house\\" churches, which are evidently preferable.So what are these pagan practices? The authors focus on church buildings, paid clergy and sermons.Perhaps the third one causes the most surprise - isn't there a lot of preaching in the Bible? There certainly is - but Viola and Barna argue that Old Testament prophets \\"spoke extemporaneously and out of a present burden, rather than from a set script\\" (p. 87), while what the New Testament apostles did is not normative for the Christian church. They planted churches and then moved on - and so the sermon is only appropriate for a church in its infancy. The biblical model for the church, our authors aver, is the full congregational participation as described in 1 Corinthians. In the same way, Viola and Barna argue that pastors simply get in the way of this every-member-ministry.The book has a lot to say about how, particularly under Constantine, the church picked up ideas from the Graeco-Roman world. They also argue that the church carried over unhelpful things from its Jewish background. Thus, the church building is modelled on both the pagan shrine and the Jewish temple. The payment of clergy comes from both the paid Greek rhetoricians and the Levitical tithe. Clerical garments come from both Roman officials and Old Testament priestly garb. All these things, Viola and Barna argue, are not in the New Testament, and therefore do not belong in the church today.There are two points, then - firstly, that these things are not in the New Testament, and secondly that it is wrong to practice them.It is easy to think of New Testament verses about preaching. There is 2 Timothy 4:2 - \\"Preach the word; be ready in season and out of season...\\" But Viola and Barna say that this doesn't apply, because \\"Timothy was an apostolic worker\\" (p. 102). There is 1 Corinthians 9:14 - \\"In the same way, the Lord commanded that those who proclaim the gospel should get their living by the gospel.\\" The authors don't deal with this verse - instead there is an annoying footnote on p. 178 that a \\"response to those biblical passages that some have used to defend clergy (pastor) salaries\\" can be found in Viola's bookReimagining Church.Actually, the authors reject the whole idea of \\"verses\\", and devote a whole chapter to critiquing the idea of prooftexts. They reject the idea that Acts 14:23 means that every church should have elders, since it \\"is referring to an event in south Galatia during the first century\\" (p. 235). They reject the idea that 1 Corinthians 16:2 supports a weekly offering since it's \\"dealing with a onetime request\\" (p. 236). Strangely, however, they do view 1 Corinthians 14:26 (\\"every one of you has a psalm\\") as normative (p. 166).The second point, then, is that it is wrong to do these things if they are not supported by the New Testament. Most Christians would agree that church buildings are not in the New Testament, but would think there is nothing wrong with them. Viola and Barna, however, argue that they \\"limit the involvement of and fellowship between members\\" (p. 44).This is a radically biblical approach to ecclesiology. It was strange, then, reading this as a Presbyterian. For theWestminster Confession of Faithaffirms that God is not to be worshipped in any way \\"not prescribed in the Holy Scripture\\" (XXI.1). In this way, Viola and Barna are simply following the Regulative Principle of Worship, albeit with different emphases. For example, many proponents of the Regulative Principle use it to forbid musical instruments in worship. Viola and Barna note that \\"there is no evidence of musical instruments in the Christian church service until the Middle Ages\\" (p. 162) but they don't seem to view it as one of those evil, pagan practices. Now, the Confession distinguishes \\"elements\\" of worship, which always must be found in Scripture, and \\"circumstances\\" which \\"are to be ordered by the light of nature, and Christian prudence\\" (I.6). I have always thought instrumentation was one of those elements, as, indeed, church buildings would be. So I think we need to reject the argument that unbiblical practices are necessarily wrong.Viola and Barna insist that we need to worship as they did in the first century, while at the same time reject the idea that the Book of Acts is a model for us. This strikes me as rather inconsistent. They emphasise the distinction between prescriptive and descriptive passages, but seem to privilege 1 Corinthians over Acts, seemingly without considering that the worship in 1 Corinthians (which has everyone sharing words of exhortation) may be merely descriptive as well. The great emphasis on preaching in Acts is simply discarded.Finally, the rejection of pastors goes hand in hand with an anti-hierarchical approach. Viola and Barna appeal to Kevin Giles to back up their ideas. Giles has argued that the Son is not eternally subordinate to the Father. Yet the authors appeal to him and assert that historic orthodoxy rejects the eternal subordination of the Son (p. 264), without apparently realising thecontroversialnature of Giles' position, or the arguments against it."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"I once attended an awakening where a teacher shared a series of visions she had experienced. The first part of the vision took her to a hospital room with an extremely sick Woman lying in a bed. Jesus was standing over the Woman with his hands inside her chest, massaging her heart. The teacher looked gravely at the Woman because it didn't look like she would survive - but Jesus smiled at the teacher and said, \\"If you think she looks bad now, you should have seen her before!\\" The woman lying in the bed was the Church and Jesus was slowly massaging her heart and making her new again.I believe we are in that season now. Jesus is not just *restoring* the Body to the book of Acts, he is making His Bride *new* - without spot, wrinkle or blemish.Pagan Christianity is meant to be read as a series with Frank's other books.

I read this book recently, long after that decision and it confirmed (and explained) a lot of the things we experienced in Church and why we felt so stifled in our growth. Now, we live abroad in a culture where family is everything. The way we have learned to express Jesus in the West is not effective here (and in reality, it isn't back home either). Everyone has something to contribute and it's all necessary. There is a big picture being painted and you're not the central focus! The Body is one with many members with Jesus being the head. It's a beautiful thing.You can work a twelve hour day on three hours of sleep, but you'd probably be more effective if you got at least eight. Some tolerate curable sicknesses all their life, while others want a healthier lifestyle. This book makes the same distinction. The question is not, \\"If it's working, why is that so wrong?\\" The question is: \\"Is what we're doing as healthy as it could be and is it even in line with the Word?\\"Thanks Frank and George for the countless hours of research you guys put into this book.

They raise issues and questions that I believe are on the hearts and minds of many churchgoing Christians. PAGAN CHRISTIANITY gives language to those who feel dissatisfied with institutionalized churches and offers solutions consistent with the spirit of the new covenant of grace. Get a copy for yourself. Trust me, you'll never look at \\"church\\" the same again."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"I grew up in the institutional church and spent the first 40 years of my life accepting the status quo, even though there were things in the back of my mind that bothered me. Questions that haunted me that no one seemed to have answers to. Reading Pagan Christianity was a HUGE eye-opener for me especially regarding so many of the teachings and traditions in the church. It is amazing how many things we honor as being \\"in the Bible\\" or \\"from God\\" are really just a mix of men's opinions and pagan traditions. If you are one who is straddling the fence and you are tired of pat answers, read this book. Frank Viola and George Barna don't pull any punches. It will bring much-needed clarity and perhaps give you the courage to make a decision you've needed to make for a long time. Just be warned... it's like The Matrix. Once you drink the Kool-aid it's hard to ever go back to the way things were. And I wouldn't want to."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"I do not agree with all of the author's conclusions, but this heavily-researched book is hard to dismiss easily.The book's main premises is that many of the activities of our modern-day church are not taken from the Bible, but instead from pagan societies, and over the centuries have become tradition.The authors question many well entrenched church traditions and so the book is bound to be controversial and will probably get you riled up at some point!Nevertheless, we should not be in ignorance as to why we do the things we do.I think this is a must-read for any Christian!"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"I highly recommend reading \\"Pagan Christianity\\". I thank the authors for writing this book because much of it's content has been on my heart for years. So much so... I was feeling lead to write a similar book, prior to finding this book. This is a confirmation in my spirit about the truth of God's vision for His church."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"As a Christian of 30+ years, being active in Church and leadership, Pagan Christianity has had more impact upon my life than any other book I've read.To say that the authors opened my eyes to the power of religion and tradition would be an understatement.Reading this book is akin to finding a loose thread in a sweater, when one pulls on this thread....the whole darn thing comes unravelled!Life is so much simpler for me now.Jesus said \\"You shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free\\"Thank you Frank and George for sharing this book with the world...Blessings!!"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"My hesitation with reading this book was a concern that it would be mostly made up of opinions. I was pleasantly surprised to find out a tremendous amount of history with many footnotes to research further. It was a very balanced book that provided the history and leaves you to decide what to do with the information presented. Every Christian should add this book to the their library."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"This book I like although it did not give me an earth shattering conviction to leave the institutional church. Many historical perspectives are presented that helped me to understand the reason \\"why\\" we do things the way we do them in the institutional church. For example the history behind why we have the one pastor model was presented well.The solution presented to the institutional church seems to be a bit mystical to me. That is, having home church with Jesus alone as the leader in charge seems to be quite a difficult thing to experience. The examples of the successes of home church seem to be hand picked success stories and I wonder whether or not the services are \\"that good\\" consistently."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"I've come across a lot of people that like to argue against this book, but haven't really read it. They're just basing their argument on what someone else has said... that probably hasn't read it! Explaining the principles of this book to fellow believers, even to those who are friendly to gathering outside a traditional setting, is never usually embraced with open arms. The truth of this book is so sharp, it will divide the soul and spirit (not a painless process). As humans, we are programmed to fight or flight when our lives are in danger, but as Christians, we are called to be living sacrifices. Something has to die, and for our lives in Christ to be fruitful, it always has to be our picture. I think one of the main reasons people nearly get offended by this book is because they prefer their picture to God's reality.Bottom line: If you don't agree with this book, you haven't really read it.If you did read it, and feel like your \\"picture\\" is threatened, it did it's job."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Elke zichzelf respecterende kerk of gemeente beweert zich te baseren op Gods Woord, de Bijbel. Leer en praktijk worden met een beroep op de Heilige Schrift onderbouwd, verklaard en verdedigd. Kerkverlating omdat de gewoontes niet (meer) aanspreken, het haast slaafs volgen van tradities of het versterken van de eigen identiteit ten koste van omliggende gelovigen en denominaties zijn zo wat effecten. Zelf zoek ik al jarenlang naar de momenten en oorzaken in de kerkgeschiedenis die het prille begin van het christendom in het bijbelboek Handelingen hebben gemaakt tot de instellingen die we nu kerk en gemeente noemen, kortom het 'christelijke wereldje' uitleggen. Viola & Barna hebben met Pagan Christianity? de ongestelde vragen gesteld en zijn op zoek gegaan naar antwoorden. Niet om God en geloof af te vallen, integendeel, juist om te zoeken naar de bijbelse wijze van samenkomen van christelijke gelovigen. In hun analyse van de kerkgeschiedenis heeft het schrijversduo zich vooral gericht op de Protestante Kerk als instituut. Uiteraard zijn de Rooms-Katholieke Kerk in de eerste 15 eeuwen nodig voor het verhaal. En, waar menig evangelische gemeente of charismatische gemeenschap, Pinkstergemeente of andere denominatie zich nogal eens afzet tegen de 'gevestigde kerken', zijn ook deze instellingen niet schoon van menselijke instellingen en regels.Genadeloos wordt afgerekend met de vele heidense invloeden die allerlei 'christelijke' instituties hebben gevormd tot wat ze nu zijn: kerkgebouw, verdeling tussen leek & kader, liturgie, preek, de dominee/voorganger, zondagse kleding, muziek in de samenkomst, tienden, betaalde kerkelijk werkers, doop en eucharistie, opleidingen theologie en bijbelscholen en de manier waarop de Bijbel wordt gelezen, uitgelegd en benaderd. Hoewel met 1100 voetnoten en een enorme schat aan achtergrondinformatie, willen de auteurs niet zozeer kennis overbrengen, informeren, maar harten aanraken. Nadrukkelijk staan ze aan het eind stil bij de 'En toen?' vraag. Een dergelijke reeks gewetensvragen aan de lezer vraagt om een reactie. Bewustwording wat door mensen ingesteld of ingebracht is, en wat werkelijk terug te voeren op de Bijbel, is een eerste begin. Het vervolg moet zitten in de manier waarop je met medegelovigen wilt, mag c.q. zou moeten samenkomen om God te aanbidden, geestelijk te groeien, elkaar te dienen en het evangelie bekend te maken in je omgeving.Frank Viola zelf heeft goede ervaringen opgedaan met zogenaamde organic churches, gemeentes die wel lijken op het beeld, dat het Nieuwe Testament oproept van een christelijke gemeenschap. De profetie in Ezechil 37 over het dal met dorre beenderen in gedachten hebbend, is het zaak een gemeente te laten geboren worden, niet zelf te maken. Immers, je zou heel makkelijk conclusies kunnen trekken uit het boek en vooral voor jezelf kunnen beginnen. Je huisgroep of wijkkring is z&oacute; tot nieuwe kerk gebombardeerd met jijzelf als hoofd. Dat is begrijpelijk, maar het is niet in lijn met de Bijbel.Het boek zelf heeft al bij elk hoofdstuk een Q&A; sectie, meer kun je vinden op www.paganchristianity.org. Ook behulpzaam is het vorige boek van Viola,The Untold Story of the New Testament Church: An Extraordinary Guide to Understanding the New Testament, een chronologische herschikking van de verhalen uit de nieuwtestamentische boeken en brieven om je te helpen het grotere geheel te zien. Pagan Christianity is wat Viola en Barna betreft slechts &eacute;&eacute;n deel van de conversatie. Het vervolg uit september 2008 heetReimagining Church: Pursuing the Dream of Organic Christianity. Een reconstructie van Gods oorspronkelijke bedoeling met de gemeente, het lichaam van Christus, een organisch, levend, ademhalend organisme. Een gemeente vrij van conventies, gevormd door een geestelijke intimiteit en niet opgesloten tussen 4 muren."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"I read The Untold Story of the New Testament and now I am reading Pagan Christianity. If you really want to know the truth of our origins as Christians, this book will give you what you need to journey towards it. I believe the revelation Frank Viola has obtained is phenomenal. Pagan Christianity has unfolded so much for me and answered questions I have asked for years. His view is unbias and he is not in any way attacking Christianity. What he is doing is informing his readers wisely and responsibly. If you want a deeper relationship with God, this is a book I suggest you read."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"That's the conclusion I've come to after reading \\"Pagan Christianity?\\" by Frank Viola and George Barna. I'm sure there's a place in the world for theologians in their halls of christian academia, but Viola/Barna make a sound case that the institutional church has become too smart for its own good, relying more upon its own cleverness rather than God's spirit to change the world. To quote the book: \\"Pragmatism is unspiritual, not just because it encourages ethical considerations to be secondary, but because it depends on techniques rather than God to produce the desired effects...Pragmatism is harmful because it teaches 'the end justifies the means'...\\"In reading the book, it doesn't take long to realize that the contemporary, Western church wouldn't be recognizable to a first century believer. They might even be skeptical of it by recognizable parallels to pagan practices. Church buildings, steeples, seating arrangements, pulpits, clothing, etc. all have pagan influence and origins. And Viola/Barna takes no prisoners among pastors, preachers, priests, youth leaders, worship leaders or even church secretaries. Name any person of responsibility in an institutional church and there's no biblical reason for their office. Consider this book a complete deconstruction of every familiar church convention. Better to forget everything you know about church and start from Biblical scratch.The read is easy, but the footnotes are extensive enough to slow things down considerably. It takes time to follow scriptural support of a point made but it's worth it. It's almost mind boggling how thoroughly they make and support their contentions. Though I don't agree with every argument made, the thrust of their position on the modern church experience is one all Christians should consider.George Barna's \\"Revolution\\" makes a good prequel to Pagan as it reveals church trends which seem to underscore Viola's church concept. The curious thing is that each book was written without the other in mind. A reader of \\"Pagan Christianity?\\" will benefit greatly from Barna's findings in \\"Revolution\\". I recommend both."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"This book gets a lot right so I highly recommend it but with caution. The historical homework is excellent but the application requires caution. The weeknesses seem to be: rigid rejection of most church leadership and the means to selectively support them. There also seems to be a lack of appreciation of the creeds. While one may be uncomfortable with the wooden use of creeds they can provide a useful distillation of the corporate understanding of the Church.Amen to the premise that the church needs ecclisiological reformation."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"This book reveals what has happened to the church organization of today. The following quote offers a solution to the problem.\\"If I had my way, I would declare a moratorium on public preaching of'the plan of salvation' in America for one to two years.Then I would call on everyone who has the use of the airwaves and thepulpits to preach the holiness of God, the righteousness of God and thelaw of God, until sinners would cry out, 'What must we do to be saved?'Then I would take them off in a corner and whisper the Gospel to them.Such drastic action is needed because we have gospel-hardened ageneration of sinners by telling them how to be saved before they haveany understanding why they need to be saved.\\"--Paris Reidhead, Finding the Reality of God, pg. 54."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Character In Transition: A Guide to Not Burning the BridgeReview by: Nicholas Andrew DepewAuthor: \\"Character in Transition - A Guide to Not Burning the Bridge\\"\\"Pagan Christianity?\\" is a must read for anyone who is sincere about seeking truth and who is willing to ask difficult questions regarding matters of the practice of faith.Having personally authored a book that examines both the right and wrong ways to handle personal and professional transitions, I can attest that within \\"Pagan Christianity?\\", the authors are not trying to advocate the onset of a mass civil war as some reviewers would lead you believe. Instead, they are simply presenting the substantiated facts to validate those who have chosen a route that leads beyond the typical confines of tradition. They are attempting to open up a dialogue for greater freedom, purpose, and participation. As the authors assert on page five in reference to people reading their Bibles through conditioned lenses and never challenging denominations or what they teach, \\"At this moment, all the rebellious hearts are applauding and are plotting to wield the above paragraphs to wreak havoc in their churches. If that is you, dear rebellious heart, you have missed our point by a considerable distance. We do not stand with you. Our advice: Either leave your church quietly, refusing to cause division, or be at peace with it. There is a vast gulf between rebellion and taking a stand for what is true.\\" It is also worthy to note what author George Barna writes in his introduction on page xxx, \\"If you are skeptical - and we encourage healthy skepticism that leads to fact-finding and truth - then commit yourself to identifying exactly what did happen over the course of time. This matters!\\"Is this book for everyone? The answer is, \\"No.\\" To continue \\"The Matrix\\" analogy (only slightly modified for proper context), \\"Most people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inert, so hopelessly dependent on the system that they will fight to protect it.\\" Nevertheless, if you are someone who has questioned why churches are the way they are, why nothing ever seems to change, or why the hype of their varying prospects and programs is often short lived with things rarely coming to fruition, this book can definitely point you in the right direction for finding some of those long-time, elusive answers. For those who may be just a little curious about \\"Pagan Christianity?\\", but who are not certain about taking the plunge, I would kindly and benignly offer the following as food for thought: Insanity has often been defined as doing the same thing over and over again, yet expecting different results."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Reimagining Church: Pursuing the Dream of Organic ChristianityCraig AmmerallAuthor of:BreathWish - A Scriptural Guide to Smoking Cessation and Understanding COPDWhether you agree or disagree, one can't help but appreciate Viola's and Barna's thorough research and meekness in laying out the history of our modern church service. It is easy for a book like this to let emotion overshadow the message. I myself had to sit back to take a few big breaths to keep in check. That being said, I felt no disrespect to our modern church service, only sincere love, and a fire to revive the authentic first century ekklesia. I am anxiously awaiting for Frank's follow up called, \\"Reimagining Church\\"."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Pagan Christianity is a re-write of a book Frank Viola wrote a number of years ago. He's now teamed up with George Barna and has published a new revised version and I believe the teaming has been successful. Never having read the original, I can't say what changes have been made. In my opinion, however, this version is very well written with lots of documentation. Frank Viola, who did the research, has done a very thorough job investigating this topic. Since I enjoy reading history, I found the data that was presented to be very fascinating. Also, I believe that if we don't understand the past, more than likely we'll repeat the same errors and suffer the same consequences.I was aware that many of the practices of the modern church system were introduced after the deaths of the original apostles but I wasn't aware of the magnitude of the corruption. I believe it's critical that we understand the sources of these extra-biblical practices. Although I don't agree with all of the conclusions drawn by the authors, I believe this is a book that every serious believer needs to read. I believe the facts presented will rock your world and cause you to re-evaluate much that you've accepted and perhaps challenge you to make changes in how you live out you life as a follower of Christ."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Every single page in Viola's \\"Pagan Christianity\\" is immersed in a very obvious tone of anger - not just dissent or disappointment or resentment, it's clearly a voice of anger. Accusations of heresy pointed to the \\"church\\" are abundant. However, it is amusingly fact-packed, accompanied with voluminous footnotes written in really tiny letters.The book could've been written with a positive and warm approach, instead of revolutionary and combative approach. Nevertheless, every discerning Christian would still be blessed by reading this book, seeing how God has been leading and providing for his Church through the ages, across many cultures, to bring the Good News of salvation to all ethnics without bulldozing the uniqueness of each culture."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"The book's theme is that today's church government, forms of worship and practice have been taken from the pagan world rather than from the church as it is portrayed in the New Testament. When New Nestament Christians worshipped in the informal setting of a house and without professional clergy each person had an opportunity to use his or her spiritual gifts. The book has left me dissatisfied with current church practice, but I am wondering how today's church can recapture the New Testament church."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Rips apart the idea of church of constantine and its reformers to expose them as pagan psuedo-christian.

Church Practices","review":"I picked up this book because i am a christian and i want it to confirm what i already knew for several years:the incredible amount of paganism that exists in a lot of churches.I was not dissapointed.The authors expose with precision and research how many religions adopted pagan beliefs and systems.The chapters that talk about bishops clothing and about the set up of the altars were iluminating.However, as i kept reading i realized several things.Number one, some of the most important pagan festivities and belief such as Christmas,Easter,Trinity,Hell and St Valentine's day are not even mentioned.It is widely known that these celebrations and beliefs are pagan in nature and are very important to most christians.The second thing that dissapointed me was that it appeared to me that the authors were placing too much emphasis on the work that as christians they do and that they were trying to lead me to believe that their religion was just better.Altough i commend them for the for this work and for making a lot of people think harder about paganism in Christianity, they fell short in presenting the scope of the problem.For example, in the question 1 on page 218, the authors implied that the christians need \\"on the job training\\" to be better christians.Altough in dont dispute the benefits of practicing what you learned,the authors does not bother to even mention the Bible as the primary tool for christians.Paul said in 2 Timothy 3:16,17 that \\"ALL SCRIPTURE is...beneficial for teaching..for reproving, for setting things straight..that the man of God may be FULLY COMPETENT\\".The authors are right in saying that seminaries are worthless, but they leave completly out the most important part:The Bible.Jesus himself said that \\"your word is truth\\" (John 17:17)We all know that the Bible is God's word.The second thing i disagree with the authors is about the organization in the \\"ecclessia\\".The authors argue in page 87 that \\"interruptions by the audience were common\\".Again, i agree with what they say in the \\"sit and listen\\" atmosphere in main stream churches.Paul clearly stated in 1 Corinthians 14:27 that everyone \\"should take turns\\".Something the authors leave out in their commentaries about 1 Corinthians 14.Also in that same book,Paul lets us see that christians did not had a free for all participation when he says \\"God is a God NOT OF DISORDER but of peace (1 Cor 14:33) and \\"let all things take place \\"DECENTLY AND BY ARRANGEMENT\\" (1 Cor 14:40) It is clear that christian meetings were active but it wasnt a free for all either.Everything was made in an organized form.The third thing i disagree with the authors is about the sense of urgency of the christians in the fisrt century.The authors argue that \\"christians did not appear to be pressured into trying to get the entire world\\".Nothing could be further from the truth.Altough i recognize that they have to start with the people of Jerusalem, Jesus conveyed in them a great sense of urgency for the work ahead.In Matthew 9:37,38 Jesus said \\"the harvest is great the workers few, beg the Master to send out workers\\".Also in Matthew 24:14 Jesus said \\"good news will be preached....and then the end will come\\".Paul said to Timothy \\"preach the word, be at it URGENTLY...\\"(2 Timothy 4:2) If that is not urgency, i dont know what it is.Finally, something that i complete disagree with the authors is about how much attention they pay to Jesus Christ.They imply that Jesus should be the whole focus of meetings and services for christians.Again i agree with the fact that Jesus is our way to God and the mediator, but the Biblie teaches us clearly that God ( and by the way his name is Jehovah, something that you will not learn in this book since the authors dont even mention it) is the one who should be worshipped,praised and be dedicated to.Not to Jesus.To do Gods work ,Christians have to be in sync with Gods purpose.And the Bible tells us that his name ( or reputation) was tarnished in Eden and his purpose is to clean his name forever.Thats God's purpose and he is going to do it with or without us.In 1 Corinthians 15:24, Paul says \\" when he(Jesus) hands over the KIngdom to his God and Father, verse 28 \\"the Son will also subject himself to the One (God), that GOD (not Jesus) may be all things to everyone\\".Again, this book is a very good start for people who want to think about their beliefs.The authors do some amazing researching but they fell short in many areas including doctrines that are a integral part of a christian."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Pagan Christianity is one of the most provocative and courageous books written about the church in recent years. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it and cannot wait to see Frank Viola's next book, Reimaging the Church. As a pastor who ministers like a missionary in the inner-city with at-risk youth, bikers, the homeless, ex-felons, AIDS patients, and other people not always warmly welcomed in the mainstream, I have found I have to be \\"non-traditional\\" in my approach to church. What I learned as I read this book is that many of the methods and practices we do out of necessity in our church and ministries actually reflect with accuracy the practices of the first century and early church. And they really work -- at least, for us!For sure, this book has the potential to make many pastors uncomfortable because it challenges some longstanding and widely accepted church traditions. But from beginning to end, the information is well-documented and presented with a true spirit of love. I put this book on the \\"must read\\" list for many of the younger ministers that work beside us. Whether you like the conclusions or not, Pagan Christianity is worth reading because it requires reflection on what the church is doing, how we \\"do church,\\" and what your own personal approach to ministry is all about. And did we say, Pagan Christianity does all this and still brings honor and glory to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ!"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"The book is extremely interesting. There is a huge shift in Christiandom for \\"something more\\" and I think Viola and Barna did a great job explaining why so many of us are feeling this way.The majority of institutionalized churches today absolutely miss the first century concepts of authentic community, familial love and devotion, centrality of Jesus, gathering without ritual, priesthood of the saints, and every-member functioning. The authors give explanations of how this happened and why it shouldn't have happened.I hightly recommend it for anyone who knows something is missing from their corporate worship and who is longing for something more."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"This is a fantastic book, but as the reviews show, it is controversial. Pastors who don't wish to see the church change and committed Roman Catholics will hate the book because it challenges their traditions. People who are interested to know where our traditions came from will love the book as well as people who feel we need big changes in the church. I thought it was fascinating to learn all the history behind what we do. Going to church will never be the same for me now. While I think this is a great book, the sequel is even better. \\"Reimagining Church\\" helped me to understand what church can really be like and how it is related to God's nature and desire for community."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"I just finished reading my copy of Pagan Christianity? I was hard to do. I spent 11 years of my life as an Evangelical Pastor(professional clergy). If you are a pastor, please read Chapter 5 in the book! You need to, just do it! I was a member of a leading Evangelical denomination for 34 years. I was raised in that denomination so I was immersed in it's approach to faith in God for a total of 52 years. I left the Pastorate and my membership in that organization 2 years ago. I just read the book. So you see the book came after I discovered the truths laid out in the book! The response of the elders and \\"Senior Pastor\\" of the congregation from which I left was to avoid me like I have a dread disease. After they told me I was insubordinate or not doing my job, they still wanted me to come back to be a \\"layman\\" and serve the Lord with them! They tried for a while to get me to come back but only on \\"their terms\\" which would mean I would have to submit to men's traditions and not the words of Jesus. When I offered friendship but would not 'dance their dance' they quit calling and some walk the other way in the store or on the street. Barna wrote Revolution and it nailed what I am seeing happen in the USA and here in Michigan. There is a huge exodus of folks from the \\"institutional church\\" and yet these people are not leaving their faith in Jesus. They are not disbelieving the Bible, but rather they are finding true community with others who share their sketicism about the \\"church\\" and the leaders who dominate/subjegate the people. They are seeking \\"every-member-participatory\\" life together as the Body of Christ. Furthermore, they want Jesus to be the true Head of the Body and they are not willing to be pushed around anymore by men with seminary degrees! God is quite capable of leading His Church gathered, the ekklesia or assembly, without the power-trips and control-freakish behavior of the so-called clergy. This is why this book, Pagan Christianity?, is so timely. It analyzes the problem. It delineates the source of the problem. It shows a way out of the problem. And finally, it affirms what so many believers in Jesus are sensing is in fact a serious problem! This can only serve to help the Body of Christ get back to the pattern of keeping in step with the Spirit and living life together by the words of Jesus and the Apostles, and still do it effectively in the 21st Century context. The naysayers will no doubt attack this book. Just read the other reviews to see some attacks. But Frank and George have given the Missional Church, the Bride of Christ, a real treasure here in Pagan Christianity? It will stand the test of time. When we stop spending Billions of US dollars on buildings and the personal empires of \\"holy men\\", and redirect those resources into the life of the Body of Christ as HE leads (so far God is still able to lead without help from \\"clergy\\"), we will see radical change that really brings justice and hope and financial help to the poor and dying and sorrowing of this world. When we have gatherings of His Body where HE leads and the presence of God is so wonderful, people wil be drawn to know Christ! Men's hearts will be laid bare and they will cry out to God for salvation! If She does what Frank Viola advocates in this book, the Church will regain Her bearings to live in true freedom. We can be set free from the lies that the \\"institutional church\\" has passed down over the centuries. We do not need James Dobson, Robert Schuller, Rick Warren, Joel Osteen, Joyce Meyers, nor Paula White nor any other of a host of TV/Celebrity Evangelicals to tell us how to hear from God! God is in us and will guide us if we have received the new birth through Jesus' finished work on the Cross! We must not go solo, however! We are born again into community and we need each other to grow and flourish. Do not be led by the nose anymore Church! Be the Church, do not \\"go to church\\" to be deceived any more! Enjoy the book and the sequel! Brother Gregg"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Be careful, it will shake your religious habits.

I already had chosen not to return to a traditional church, now I just don't think I can.

The author states that it is not a work for scholars. Well that is for sure! The presumption we are asked to accept is his experience with 'organic churches' because they are New Testament thriving believers that are Spirit-led, in open participatory meetings and are non-hierarchical in leadership. I found this premise very interesting and fully intriguing. But the author does very little to persuade me that the NT teaches this 'methodology' from his Rule of Faith, which is clearly Solo Scripture. Neither do I remain convinced that the issue with spiritual growth is attributed to the many traditions that are broad brushed as 'pagan.' In my view some are, some are not. Ignoring ancient Jewish norms of praying for the dead as recorded in I & II Maccabbees should not be presumed as 'pagan' so freely. There are fundamental assumptions not historically accounted for. I say this only to say some Jewish beliefs in 'praying for the dead' exist to this day and New Testament concepts of those who have physically died and receive the prayers of those on earth (Revelation). Although many of the listed traditions have factual accounts and even clearly articulate early church leadership structures there appears significant misrepresentation of doctrinal truths and the absence of any notion early church accounts might be doctrinally sound or may actually reflect an authority handed down to the Church by Christ Himself. For example, the early church never taught and never did teach that the Eucharist was the re-sacrificing of Christ at each Mass. But the author states this twice, at least twice. It seems apparent there is little understanding of sacramental theology. If one would not agree with a sacramental theology I would hope it at least be properly understood. The proper teaching of Christ's \\"Real Presence in the Eucharist is never mentioned and apparently misunderstood. The attributing cultural influences of pagan cultures to worship is the modus operandi for attributing a lack of spiritual growth in contemporary believers. Starting out with the Church NOT BEING a building is quite dramatic and overly emphasized. It is mentioned that Church building were never started until AFTER CONSTANTINE \\"ordered\\" them to be built and this casts CONSTANTINE as the premier pagan influence that riddled the church forever. Perhaps widespread persecution of Christians may attribute to church buildings not being built. Clearly the baby is being thrown out and the bath water has not been changed. I am left with a worship 'service' that must be a non-traditional tradition purported to be Scriptural. When one is left with Scripture as the Sole Authority who has the final authority on what the Authority really says? Certainly not our author/s..The author/s makes many great points about the passive church and the roots of many 'christian' practices. An inordinate emphasis of pagan cultures pervades and somewhat with blinders in regard to what constitutes 'pagan.' Mysticism may be seen by this author as a belief in magic. Very little legitimacy placed on Jewish roots and a clear understanding of the universal priesthood of believers, the ceremonial priesthood and the high priestly functions given to Israel in the OLD TESTAMENT is not mentioned in context. The Passover Meal and Christ's sacrifice are not really appreciated for what Ignatius of Antioch taught about the Eucharist. Yet Ignatius is given much criticism for his influence in formalizing the authority (leadership) of the Early Church and clarifying the Authority role of Bishops to the various church bodies (100 AD) before his being Martyred in Rome. Why skirt such early teaching that clearly reflect the practices and doctrines of the early church, especially WHEN IT DOES NOT CONTRADICT ANY TEACHING OF SCRIPTURE.After reading this book Christianity becomes a free for all if we are to agree with the proposed solution to the author's challenge about 'human/pagan' and/or 'sacred' tradition. He never discusses any 'sacred' tradition so tradition seems to be categorically forbidden. Since tradition means to be 'handed down' I would not hand this book down to anyone weak in the faith as it will become the source of confusion and a stumbling block and offers very little scriptural nourishment. Very disappointing conclusion on issues that deserve more genuine understanding to the early church doctrines and issues of Christian growth in our day. Anyone can find fault but love covers a multitude sins. There are no legitimate solutions offered other than genuine repentance in our ways.

Most Christians will not find this a pleasant read at first. When I read Viola's first book in the set \\"Rethinking the Wineskin: The Practice of the N.T. Church\\" I thought Viola was going too far with his claims. I discovered through further reading and study that Viola is right on!There is just no way to dispute \\"Pagan Christianity.\\" Unless of course you think that historical facts do not matter much to you. I want to challenge every Christian that has grown up in the \\"institutional church\\" to rethink the ekklesia. It's simple really... revivals will not fix our problems... reform will not fix our problems... only REVOLUTION. Viola proposes that we return to authentic Christianity and let Jesus truly be the HEAD of the church.I gew up in the \\"institutional church\\" and was in \\"full-time\\" ministry for 6 years. I can say that after much study and prayer... the \\"institutional church\\" is not God's idea, but man's. If you are tired of trying to resuscitate a dead pagan system with a new \\"staff member\\" or a \\"revival\\"... do what I have done... return to authentic Christianity. It's the only Christ-exalting way to see again what we read in the book of Acts! I pray that as you read... you will remember a Yiddish proverb that has been very encouraging to me: \\"Truth never dies, but it lives a wretched life.\\"ATTENTION: I now recommend reading Viola's revised and expanded version with co-author George Barna!Pagan Christianity: Exploring the Roots of Our Church Practices"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"I own/read Viola's originalPagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practicesbefore this toned-down revised/expanded/reworked, kinder-gentler version was released. I am wanting to now read this one too but need to say, even a toned-down version of this work is an ESSENTIAL read.I have been in on & off Baptist ministry [paid church staff and volunteer] since the mid-70s and have seen the good bad & ugly of churchianity. In the early 80s I discovered \\"house church\\" and have never been the same since. I drifted out of that scene due to elder-wars and the typical \\"we need a program mentality\\" ruining the mystical outworking of the Spirit among & w/in the People of God gathered simply. Sadly, an expression of the ekklesia in full swing was never again so full. Over 25 years and ~ 100 lbs heavier ;D ~ I am seeing the truths of Viola's book all the more proven over and over.I knew even as a very young Christian that something was very \\"off\\" about the whole church thing but never could pin it down. After reading many works by Watchman Nee, T. Austin Sparks, meeting Stephen Kaung and reading works by Chip Brogden as well -- it is WITHOUT ARGUMENT that the Spirit of God is moving w/in His people to wake them up out of millennia of churched slumber. Why is Viola's book essential? He has taken the trouble to document clearly the history of how the ekklesia slipped into a Judaism/pagan/social government organization of coming together. It was a \\"comfortable, broken-in pair of sandals\\" that the early church tried on and said \\"Ooh, this is nice.\\" Of course, when following Christ starts getting easy, usually it is NOT what being an \\"overcoming\\" church is meant to walk in (or sit in if you dig the pillowed pew scene).The really tough thing is ACCEPTING what your heart/soul/spirit is asking of you, when it means things like resigning, leaving, standing outside the gate, so to speak. Several minister friends of mine DID THIS years back after realizing the truth of \\"deep ecclesiology\\" never being possible in present-day churchianity. They had to step outside the box. They are happier for it these days. And now after reading Viola -- my olde convictions and beliefs are being fanned back into life. In God's perfect time, I will lay aside my current Baptist church as well and seek to find or perhaps be part of bringing about a new local expression of the ekklesia.

I agree that the church needs to be more open and go back to its roots, but I wonder if this book falls short by overlooking the pink elephant in the room.After listening to these authors talking online, I agree with Douglas Park's review. I was surprised that the historical research for this book primarily focuses on the early Christian church since Paul. However, let us not forget that Christianity developed as a sect of Judaism, called the \\"Way.\\" If we truly want to understand the Biblical foundations of the modern-day church, then we need to go back further than \\"Ecclesia\\" and understand the \\"Synagogue\\". The Synagogue is really the foundation of the modern church.Take a look at Luke 4:15-16 \\"[Jesus] taught in their SYNAGOGUES [gatherings], and everyone praised him. He went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and on the Sabbath day he went into the synagogue, as was his custom. And he stood up to read.\\"The synagogue, which literally means \\"gathering together\\" in Greek (syna + gogue), arose most likely during the Babylonian Captivity. Because the Hebrews would have to travel long distances to the tabernacle sanctuary (if it was not destroyed), the synagogue was a local alternative. The importance of the synagogue was that it was a central place for prayer and studying the Torah and the Prophets. Typical services included reading scripture and a sermon. The synagogue might be located in an ordinary building or at a rabbi's house.In fact, JESUS himself attended synagogue services on a weekly basis, on the Jewish seventh-day Sabbath (see Luke 4 quoted above). Another reviewer pointed out that Jesus was rejected at a weekly synagogue service (Luke 4:14-30), but despite this rejection, Jesus was found back at another synagogue in Capernaum the next Sabbath healing a demoniac (v. 31-37). Rather than abandoning the synagogue, Jesus showed a high level of commitment to the Sabbath gatherings despite rejection and risking his life.In the 2nd and 3rd century, some Christians began worshipping on a day that pagans worshipped the sun in order to distance themselves from their Jewish roots at a time when there was widespread hatred toward Jews. (Interestingly, many different languages still refer to the seventh day as Sabbath, while refering to the first as the day of the sun.) Unfortunately, this is one pagan practice in violation of God's explicit commandments that is not as popular to discuss. (Talk about selective.) And we wonder why many churches have difficulty changing and growing?How can this book or ANY of its reviewers claim that we need to go back to the simple Jesus Christ of Nazareth when they are unwilling to follow those implications? I find it completely hypocritical.Sadly, Christians forget that Jesus was a Jew! Jesus was even asked to preach the Sabbath sermons, and in Luke 4, we see him reading from the scroll of Isaiah and then commenting on it, though his sermon is not recorded in detail. As was custom, Jesus would have sat down to preach! How's that for a radical departure from our weekly sermons?\\"Well, why should we go back to Jewish tradition when their practices were also based on tradition?\\"First of all, Jesus worshipped in synagogues (gatherings), so why shouldn't we? The modern-day church is comparable to the synagogue. Secondly, early Christ-followers who worshipped in the same synagogues may have decided to meet in homes for practical reasons: to avoid the persecution from authorities. Does that mean we all need to start house churches? Absolutely not.Nevertheless, the early Christian house \\"synagogues\\" as well as the origins of the Jewish synagogue can teach us something about the role of the church today. Sometimes we put so much emphasis on church buildings when what really defines a church? These authors would probably agree that a church is \\"coming together\\" to study the Bible and pray and maintain their fellowship with each other."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"This book challenged what I believe, which is good. It did not challenge my belief in Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. Rather, it challenged my understanding of how we conduct \\"church\\" in our American culture. I have just finished this book and I am praying about it to decide what, if anything, I should do about it. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who likes to read things that stimulate their thinking. If you want something safe and you do not want to have your way of thinking and your religious practices challenged, then you should read something else."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"First of all, I want to say that I very much enjoyed this book. I have known for some time that many of today's mainline Protestant traditions were not present in the first century. Even so, to be able to read a single book which details the history of many of these practices was absolutely breathtaking. This is the kind of book that basically prevents you from sitting on the fence and not falling on one side or the other by the time you're done reading it. Most of the reviewers of the book either love it or hate it, which is not really that surprising. The main reason for this is because the authors are not recommending that we make a few superficial changes--something with which everyone could agree and about which they could feel relatively warm and fuzzy. On the contrary, the authors dispense with the false notion that glitz and marketing can produce actual and lasting change. They declare correctly that if the ekklesia is going to move onward and upward, it must return wholeheartedly to its roots and to its founder. That is a controversial stance and is a slap in the face for those who believe that they have been living \\"by the book\\" their entire Christian life.As I read through the various comments made by people for and against this book, it seems that for the most part the opinions circle not so much around the facts presented therein, but upon the conclusions of the authors that are based upon those facts. But really, to what other conclusion could they come after detailing the fascinating history of today's church traditions and how we have strayed from the experience of the first century body of Christ? After making a thorough \\"before and after\\" inspection of the ekklesia in the first century compared with today's Protestant model, can anyone honestly say that we have improved upon what Christ and the apostles built? Were the apostles merely inept beginners who deserve our sympathy for not really knowing what they were doing? Has Jesus been \\"working out the bugs\\" in the church over the centuries, perfecting it as he goes along? Or is the history of the church more reflective of man's constant battle of the flesh versus the spirit, in which the carnal man builds his own house upon the sand rather than allowing Christ to make him into a spiritual stone in a spiritual building?There is an observation I would like to make which occurred to me after reading this book, even though it is not an issue that it actually addresses. I had always wondered about the passages in the New Testament in which Paul speaks of handing someone over to Satan by kicking him out of the fellowship. In today's mainline Protestant world, this sort of punishment would mean next to nothing, since the person being kicked out could simply begin attending the next church down the street. Sure, he'd have to start over from scratch and get to know new people, but this hardly qualifies as punishment. Then it hit me like a ton of bricks: the organized Christian establishment has been handed over to Satan.This is an extreme statement to make, but allow me to qualify it. The punishment was originally intended as a way to remove a person from fellowship. In the first century, Believers gathered in close-knit small groups where everyone knew each other and uplifted each other. There was no separate class of clergy that was expected to do the ministering of God's gifts. Everyone participated, and everyone was blessed. There was a sense of family for the people in these fellowships, and they took care of their own. To be removed from such an environment was catastrophic, because it meant that you would be losing the security provided by that fellowship. You were essentially open to attack from the enemy and without help from your fellow Believers.Now fast forward to the state of affairs of many of today's churches: the pews are full of people who are disconnected from one another and not experiencing the full life of the body of Christ. They are neither ministering nor being ministered to (apart from the limited abilities of the man behind the pulpit). The very practice of going to hear a sermon is something that could easily be replicated by oneself with a CD player and no one else around. This is hardly the type of fellowship that Christ and the apostles envisioned. When you look at today's traditional church, what you are looking at is a wasteland of man-made organizations that are filled with people who have been handed over to Satan. The mega-churches are over-flowing with massive amounts of people, yet those same people have no inkling of the corporate nature which they are missing. The word \\"corporate\\" is thrown around carelessly in today's churches, yet it does not describe the wholly individualistic experience of the average Christian. These Believers sit among large groups of people, entirely alone.This situation must be remedied if we are ever to recover the true ekklesia and the heart of Jesus for his people. I urge people to read this book and know that the challenges to the validity of today's church practices are a relief more than a burden. Keep in mind what things were like when Jesus first came. The religious establishment of the day was steeped in traditions that were far removed from what God had originally revealed to His people so long before. Uninformed Christians believe that Jesus came to destroy the Law, but most of the controversial statements and actions made by Jesus were directed at the traditional understanding of the Law, not the Law itself. These man-made opinions of the Law were held not just in equal regard to the Law but at times above it. And if the traditional understanding contradicted the Law and made it null and void, that was entirely acceptable.Folks, history has repeated itself, and man-made traditions have overturned the organic concept of the body of Christ established in the first century. Jesus IS coming back, and when he does his ekklesia will NOT look like the organized religious establishment you see around you. This book is for all of those faithful Christians who have gone to church most of their life and have done all the things they were \\"supposed\\" to do and yet still wonder in the deep recesses of their subconscious mind, \\"Is this all there is? Is this as good as it gets?\\" The answer, thankfully, is a resounding NO!"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"This book brings forth the reality that most of what we never gave thought to while we attended \\"church\\" is flat bogus, and is all part of \\"The Sunday Show\\".

Point: most people look at a building with a Christian sounding name and think \\"There's a church\\". False, false.

Yet we were trained to serve, work, and sacrifice to these idols of stone and wood and their priests, with our tithes, salaries, and offerings.

I never could articulate why I didn't fit into the mega-church/church growth mentality. I had no way to express the unrest in my spirit when I heard people say that dressing up showed respect for God. This book did it for me.\\"Pagan Christianity\\" presents the factual history on the origins of certain church traditions. This book was written to be paired with Frank Viola's other book \\"Reimagining Church\\", so \\"PC\\" deconstructs and \\"RC\\" constructs a vision for getting back to the concept of church at its most basic, without all the well-intentioned (but misguided) man-made frou-frou.In the past, I didn't know how to handle my questions, though, or how to put them in the context of pastoring when the traditional setting was part of my job. I think that's why I always felt unsatisfied or like something was wrong and also why I probably put people off with my lack of \\"umph\\" when it came to DOING church and following a particular format.Many people never even question WHY and they take the word of man and think that we should just do church a certain way because that's the way it's always been done. I think Frank Viola and George Barna would agree that the point of \\"Pagan Christianity\\" isn't to make people drop everything and change, but it's to at least make us question WHY we do what we do and to see what actually lines up with what God originally intended for his church. Also, it's about looking at the Scriptures in context and examining where our ideas of church actually come from.People are afraid of change, especially within the confines (often an appropriate word) of institutional church walls. They're afraid of not having a middle man between them and God, much like Israel's desire for a king. I've done the traditional pastor thing, and I've also participated in things being done a new way. I can honestly say that when GOD is the one leading things in a new direction, it's a smoother transition than if we were to just try to change things ourselves. It's hard for pastors, though, when they rely on the church for their income. It's scary.Many people deceive themselves into thinking that questioning why we do certain things in church is heresy. Especially in traditional denominations it seems, people have been taught to do certain things in the name of godliness or holiness when, really, Jesus' blood is the only thing that can make someone holy. It becomes all about appearances and impressing man.I think it's easy to look at where Jesus says, \\"No one comes to the Father but by me\\" and know that it's true in your heart. However, when your church leadership is telling you that you should dress a certain way or act a certain way or participate in a certain way, they are presenting people with the idea that they come to God through Jesus, but in the manner that the particular church thinks it should happen. Church tradition for tradition's sake can be just as much a form of bondage as habitual sin. It's easy to believe that God sets me free from sin, but it's hard to believe that God needs to set me free from doing unnecessary and unbiblical acts \\"in His name\\".I highly recommend \\"Pagan Christianity\\" for anyone who is ready to think through and to confront their preconceptions and traditions, when it comes to institutional church and how \\"church\\" should be done. I felt like it was a well-written, fact-filled feast for my spirit, and it wasn't written in an angry or in-your-face manner. You can tell that the authors are passionate about the information they are presenting. I am actually considering reading it again, even though I finished it only two days ago."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"In usual Barna style, things are said simplistically and a bit too definitely. He uses words that are meant to astound, to bring you up short. That is why he sells books. But this results in some trouble with the resulting logic used.For instance, on page ten is said that Jesus \\"ended\\" [a \\"Barna-type\\" term] the temple, the priests, and the sacrifice. \\"Fulfilling\\" is equated with \\"ending\\"; whereas ,in fact, they are very different terms. Because:There is still a temple - Jesus - then us in Him togetherThere is still a sacrifice - Jesus - and then us living in HimThere is still a priesthood - Jesus, the great high priest, a permanent priest- and then we Christians, a royal priesthood, a holy nation.\\"Ended\\" or \\"passed away\\" [p.11] sound like we need to scrap the OT. That thinking then leads to errors later in the book, when building a temple is considered pagan (e.g. p.21) when in fact God told the people how to and when to built a temple.Missing also is the synagogue in relation to church building. The early Christians were always not only in the temple courts but were also in the synagogue. We are told not to give up meeting (synagogue-ing '&eacute;&oacute;&iacute;&aacute;&ugrave; [episunagoge) together.Also equated with pagan influence is reverence for the grave and the bones of those departed. However, we see this often in the OT, in the patriarchs especially.But other than the sensationalism, the information is worthwhile and Christians especially should learn from the historical roots of our faith. I agree with the basic thesis of Viola and Barna \\"Pagan\\". We have incorrectly put the emphasis on the mechanics of the external and not on the heart and life change of following Jesus."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Barna and Viola have struck a chord with Christians everywhere. They have put together all of the puzzle pieces that exposes the Pagan roots of the Institutional Church that have been forged over time into unquestionable \\"biblical tradition\\". Barna and Viola demonstrate how the practices of the early Christians were slowly replaced by a series of paradigm shifts that moved christianity from an informal, community of believers with Jesus Christ as the Head, to a formalized religion with a hierarchal authority structure that mimicked the Greco- Roman Authority systems. The bottom line is this: The Institutional Church today does NOT look, sound or function anything like the early church. Over a span of 1900 years many minor, and a few major paradigm shifts have taken Jesus from his rightful place as Head of the Church. Barna and Viola would like to see a return to Jesus as the Head. They want to see Christian Community as Jesus intended. I recommend this book to all people who want to live in true community with the body of Christ. I recommend all of Frank Violas books for the truely serious seekers."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"OK - I have not read this book, but I've been reading the reviews. But here is the bottom line - if you consider that Christianity began during the 1st century, you'll realize that the Church began during Pagan times, and right smack dab in the middle of the biggest Pagan city in existence - Rome. It is therefore only natural that some Pagan customs would work their way into the rituals for the rememberance and honoring of Christ. And the biggest important point here - there is nothing wrong with that. The fact is that even if the Catholic Church has rituals that have pagan roots, they are NOT honoring Pagan Gods anymore. They are honoring Jesus Christ. And to add to this - attention \\"other\\" Christians (protestants) - you have pagan rituals too. See Christmas (what does a christmas tree have to do with Jesus? Christmas was a Roman holiday that was modified to be the day to honor Jesus's birth), Halloween, and Easter (Easter Bunny???). All sorts of pagan traditions and the like still exist to this day, only they have been modified to honor Jesus. In my opinion, this is perfectly fine, because it helps people to organize their worship. Yes, the catholic church uses rituals and builds grand churches. So what? Personally, I am not religious, although I am researching and doing my homework trying to decide on what I believe. I have been to Vatican City (and numerous other cathedrals and churches throughout Europe), and I can attest to the reverence one feels upon entering these places. I believe that these rituals and structures serve to move and stir the faithful, and in that, they are very valuable, even if they had pagan roots. They give people a place to go to feel awe (God), and to worship. The important thing is that whatever pagan traditions may have been translated into Christianity, the fact remains that they are NOW Christian rituals, and serve to promote Jesus."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"TO ALL NEGATIVE REVIEWS:IN SHORT, I BELIEVE THE REAL PROOFTEXTING IS FOUND IN INSTITUTIONALISM - READ THE WORDS IN RED - JESUS THE MESSIAH RESTORED INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM AND OPPOSED ALL FORMS OF INSTITUTIONALISM; OTHERWISE HE WOULD'VE SET UP HIS KINGDOM ON EARTH.

Having just finished it, now I understand. I can think of nothing more threatening to the churchy status quo than a book that tears apart piece by piece our most sacred traditions and exposes them as inventions of man that not only are not Biblical but actually hinder Biblical community and ministry.What Barna and Viola have to say is nothing new to me and in many ways echoes what I have been thinking the last few years. They just put it more concisely and clearly and with a great deal more research than I do. I imagine that a lot of people will be put off by the title. What do you mean, pagan Christianity! This is how we do church and it is by the Bible! We follow the Regulative Principle of Worship after all! The reality is jarringly different, even for someone who long ago came to see institutionalized Christianity as what can only be called a perversion of the Biblical model of the church. The title is provocative but intentionally so and for a purpose.I can hardly be effusive enough in my praise for this book. Barna and Viola go step by step through all of the traditions that we associate with \\"church\\" and dismantle the flimsy excuses for why we do what we do. Very little escapes their pen, from the oxymoronic \\"Christian tithing\\" to pews & pulpits to the entire clergy system. It is helpful to look at these trappings of \\"church\\" to see that they don't appear in Scripture, show where they came from and how they are culturally derived and finally why they impede Christian community.There are some negatives. They use some of the same phrases over and over again ( ex. \\"knew nothing of\\"). They are smart guys, I am sure they could come up with some different ways to express their thoughts. Some of the footnotes were a little sketchy. I am a little leery of making bold statements footnoted by an email as the source. There are some pretty sweeping generalizations of things like vivid depictions of how the church met even though we have some pretty vague descriptions of the church meeting in Scripture. I found the weakest chapter near the end of the book, Reapproaching the New Testament: The Bible is not a jigsaw puzzle. I found the tone to be a bit haughty as if these two had figured out the key that has eluded Biblical interpreters through the centuries. I agree with some of their assessments but ironically one of their main beefs, i.e. proof-texting, happens a lot in the book with broad statements supported by a couple of parenthetical references to Scripture. I just found the tone to be a bit off-putting and the implications troubling. I will concede that the letters of Paul are only one side of the conversation but I think it is dangerous to try to \\"fill in the blanks\\" and make doctrinal statements based on what we think was going on. I am confident that the God who created all things ex nihilo is capable of preserving what we needed to have and He saw fit to not preserve the \\"other half\\" of the conversations of Paul with the various churches. I can see some people using these principles to chuck all sorts of Biblical truths in the name of cultural or situational anomalies that don't apply today.The big question this book should leave the reader with is a simple one, but important. What do you do with this information? Do you seek a more faithful expression of the church, seek to live more like the first century church (not in terms of dressing in togas but in terms of living in a community of intentional witness to the world)? Or do you toss up your hands and go back to the Scripturally unsupportable model of church that dominates our cultural landscape? I am not sure what I would have done a few years ago (besides not read this book in the first place!). I really wonder what men who have invested enormous time and money into vocational ministry who read this with an open mind do with it. Do they leave \\"the ministry\\"? Do they explain it away or compartmentalize it and go on as before?I would encourage, even challenge, those who are defenders of traditional church structures to read Pagan Christianity and see if our most cherished traditions have any basis in Scripture at all or if they are, as argued in this book, inventions of a pagan culture that sought to Christianize their pagan practices.What if you found out that the most cherished traditions of your church were actually working against being faithful to the Bible? What would you do?"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"I commend Frank Viola on the research he has done in producing this book. I must say that he does a very good job of relating the facts and even certain interpretations to link them with his conclusions. While I do not agree with all of them, his rationale is logical and thought provoking, which is what I believe he wanted to do. However, the tone of the book is rather harsh. While I did not expect him to handle the subject with kit-gloves, I did expect a little more grace. Also, Frank's treatise is somewhat one sided from a couple of viewpoints. First, it appears to be organized such that it is apparently trying to justify the scripturalness of the home church setting as others who wrote reviews also claim. Frank also does not really take into account any transition in Jewish thought or tradition that might have influenced the earlier 1st through 3rd century church. I believe that this may have also influenced their rationale as to why they may have or not adopted Greco-Roman ideals as the years passed. I still recommend the book though. Not for a new believer, but for one who has been in the church a while and seen some of the things that Frank discusses.

I have studied the Bible for more than 30 years, I've used Philip Schaff's volumes on Church History, I read old scholars and current scholars, and I consider this a must read for every believer. For years we've been asking \\"where do we go from here\\", and \\"how to\\" just about everything, but always from the perspective that it has to originate from the 501(c)3 non-profit ministry structure, where the \\"Senior Pastor\\" delegates through the \\"Executive Pastor\\" ( or the \\"Administrative Pastor\\"), through the paid staff, on down to the volunteers, and then wonder why it doesn't work, or the leader gets burned out, or falls into a major sin, etc, etc, etc.Frank's work helps get back to the roots. There is a very profound truth within his book that I wholeheartedly agree with, and can simply paraphrase here: that in order for something to grow/develop/multiply, it has to be within the right soil/environment, and it reproduces after its own kind, exactly as God has established within His Cosmos / created order. If we honestly believe we can improve upon God's methods and design, then we of all people should be pitied.I highly recommend Wolfgang Simpson's book about \\"Houses that Change the World\\" too, a great read alongside Frank's work."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"This book may very well become known as the single most liberating piece of Christian work penned in the last 1700 years. It will hopefully become known as the single most influential piece of Christian literature in this new century. Without doubt it will be loved by many as it will liberate multitudes and for that same reason it is sure to be hated and feared by others.Frank Viola has pulled back the covers to reveal the pagan origins of many if not all of the practices of this thing we call Christendom. In a very scholarly fashion he has traced the origins of the traditions practices and institutions of all that which makeup what we call Christianity today. In contrast he boldly illustrates the simplicity and almost tribal nature of the 1st century church the bride of Christ as she met with her groom in irresistible freedom, life and love.I have suspected for many years that many if not all new Christians early in the adventure of their new life in Christ have deep and unsettling doubts about this institution we call church. Those doubts should not go unheeded. At last the great harlot of the 17th chapter of Book of Revelation has been revealed and the Spirit calls to all who are His, \\"Come out\\".

It meets you where you live with honest considerations.If you have not bought it. Buy it and read it, you should!"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Frank Viola's volume \\"Pagan Christianity\\" is a clear and easy-to-read exploration of the pagan roots of many modern institutional church practices. It is opinionated rather than academic, and the footnotes, while prolific, are much more suited for the armchair reader than the academic. Some of the footnotes refer to secondary sources rather than primary sources.Frank's approach is a rather shrill. I was very surprised by the liberal use of exclamation points and sentence fragments. Some of the facts aren't quite correct - \\"pontifex\\" is literally Latin for bridge-builder. Many quotes from early church fathers refer only to a page in a particular translation, not allowing the reader to go to a different translation (the writings of the early church fathers are annotated with a chapter/verse system in fairly universal use.)The book makes a claim of being a unique contribution - perhaps so, as a compilation of several related threads, but as Frank's research shows, this isn't a new topic: those who read church history know that pagan and Greco-Roman cultural influences shaped much of modern ecclesial practice. If the point of this book is to educate, then it's fairly well done.Editorially, Frank's assumption seems to be that anything springing from a pagan background of developing after the first century cannot be used in the church. Moreover, Frank's conclusions about how the first century church operated are just that - conclusions, not necessarily shared by others. While he supports his conclusions with the work of others, it should be noted that the data we have on the first two centuries of Christianity is very slim and that most of what we do conclude is based on reasonable conjecture rather than direct testimony or other direct evidence.If you are from a Protestant non-liturgical background and are unfamiliar with the details of church history, this book is recommended. Protestants with a lifetime background in the liturgical churches (Lutheran, Anglican, etc.) will likely it amusing that Frank is only now discovering the roots of modern church habits. There is a definite anti-Catholic tone in the book that may offend some ecumenically minded readers.The bibliography for the book was not included - odd. Instead, the publisher has included a link to a web page with the bibliography. The link does not show a bibliography at this writing.This might be fun reading for a first year seminary student or a fan of church history. If you are unfamiliar with the origin of church practices, read and learn - Frank's conclusion is based on some questionable assumptions, but he has many of the basic facts correct."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"When I started reading the book, I was trembling with fear. I thought I would find out incredible things about our church today. Boy, was I disappointed!First of all, anyone who has read the New Testament (especially Acts) has probably realized that there is little similarity in the way church was done then and now. I did not need Mr. Viola to tell me that there weren't pastors, priests, church buildings, church ministries, etc. back then. We developed those things in our natural tendency to organize and institutionalize activities. That does not mean we are better off now, I know. I agree with Mr. Viola that much has been lost in the process.Then, the fact that the pagan did or used or invented something does not qualify it to be of \\"pagan origin\\". I mean, the phrase \\"pagan origin\\" has a satanic implication. No one wants to do something satanic. But the pagans were people just like Christians, except they had and worshipped their own gods. If they had invented the wheel, would we ban the use of wheels because of its pagan origins? I don't think so. I don't see that all they did was wrong. What is wrong about having a building, or having someone taught us something from the pulpit? I can understand that some people will be more comfortable within a home or able to participate in a service. So, let's have both systems. Some people will like one and some other. That's fine, no?Also, I noticed very weak logical reasoning all along (drawing conclusions from insufficient information, etc.), and very few Bible verses to support his points, etc. So, I conclude that the book title is strongly misleading.I would recommend the book to anyone completely BLIND of history and New Testament settings, so they can see what's going on. The rest of us need something different."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Have you ever wondered why the world seems to be changing the church more than the church is changing the world?

Could it be because we, the church, no longer understand what it means to be a Christian?This book leads the reader through a centuries-long, well-documented, discovery of what has happened to the church.

Most evangelicals would consider such a suggestion as absurd, or at best, exaggerated. Yet, undeniably, there is a grass roots revolution taking place on a global scale in Christendom about what it means to be the Church of Jesus Christ.Basically the authors are making three points:1) A great deal of what we do in church today does not come from the New Testament.2) Much of what is practiced originated out of Greco-Roman customs and traditions (paganism, not Judaism), and/or human-made inventions.3) Many of these practices actually hinder the church from being what God designed her to be.The over-arching question the authors seem to be asking is: Do the practices of modern institutional churches reflect a God-ordained/inspired development, or are they a departure from it?Of course, one must read the book to understand why Viola and Barna indeed question \\"church\\" as most of us know it.Beware, though. This book comes with a WARNING:If you are unwilling to have your Christianity seriously examined, do not read beyond this page...Spare yourself the trouble of having your Christian life turned upside down. (pg.7)A glance at the content chapters will suffice as to the reason for the warning!1-Have We Really Been Doing It By The Book?2-The Church Building: Inheriting the Edifice Complex.3-The Order of Worship: Sunday Mornings Set In Concrete4-The Sermon: Protestantism's Most Sacred Cow5-The Pastor: Obstacle To Every-Member Functioning6-Sunday Morning Costumes: Covering Up The Problem7-Ministers of Music: Second-String Clergy8-Tithing and Clergy Salaries: Sore Spots On The Wallet9-Baptism and the Lord's Supper: Diluting The Sacraments10-Christian Education: Swelling The Cranium11-Reapproaching the New Testament: The Bible Is Not A Jigsaw Puzzle12-A Second Glance at the Savior: Jesus The Revolutionary-The Next Step-Final Thoughts: Q&A; with Viola and BarnaIf not already offended at some of the chapter titles, I can almost guarantee you will be after reading what is actually said concerning these staples of institutional Christianity! As difficult as it is to read material that questions church as we know it, this is a well documented book, with over 1200 enlightening footnotes from church historians, theologians down through the ages, the reformers and church fathers themselves, and an extensive eleven page bibliography.Each of the above issues is traced back to its roots of origin and how it evolved over the years into what we have today. The traditions are then examined in the light of what the New Testament actually teaches. Each is shown--in its current form--to NOT be a New Testament practice, but rather, traditions rooted in paganism absorbed by the church down through the ages. Today, what we assume as \\"normal Christian practices,\\" would have been strange aberrations for first-century believers.Of all the chapters, the toughest for me to deal with personally was the chapter, Reapproaching the New Testament. The authors question the evangelical church's \\"clipboard approach\\" to the Bible where we cut and paste portions of text from one document into another to say \\"Scripture teaches...\\" I am still giving this whole issue some thought, but admit a lot of what they point out is true.But I predict the most controversial chapter will be Chapter Five, \\"The Pastor\\" where the birth of the one-bishop rule is traced. Suffice it to say, this makes for some challenging reading, that will most certainly be hotly contested by many in our established church institutions.One note of clarification: I do not hear the authors saying that because these practices are pagan, that they are wrong. Many things we do today are rooted in paganism (eg. our calendars, days of the week, etc.) What I do hear them asking is, which of these current practices/traditions actually hinder the church from being the church that God designed and ordained her to be?For those willing to \\"choose to 'take the red pill' and be shown 'how deep the rabbit hole goes'...if you want to learn the true story of where your Christian practices came from...if you are willing to have the curtain pulled back on the contemporary church and its traditional presuppositions fiercely challenged...then you will find this work to be disturbing, enlightening, and possibly life changing.\\" (PG, page 7)"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"This is a controversial book with tons of valid points, and ultimately, at least for me, an unsatisfying conclusion.Here, in a nutshell, is the argument of the book:1. The origin of many of our church practices (examples: church buildings, orders of worship, sermons, pastors, tithing, clergy salaries) is non-biblical and inconsistent with the practice of the early church.2. Just because something does not appear in the Bible does not mean it is wrong. However, our non-biblical church practices often hinder the development of our faith and keep us from encountering the living God.3. \\"The church in its contemporary, institutional form has neither a biblical nor a historical right to function as it does.\\" (p. xx)4. The church must return to its biblical roots. At a personal level, we must ask questions of church as we know it and pray seriously about what our response should be.This book threatens a lot that pastors and churches hold dear. But it should be evaluated on the evidence, not on how much it will cost us if they're right.Most of the book traces the origins of common church practices today. They succeed in showing what should be fairly obvious: many of our practices do not appear in the Bible, which in itself does not make them wrong. Barna and Viola argue, however, that many of these practices are harmful.It's when you get to their solution that, in my view, the wheels fall off. Viola and Barna argue: \\"\\"the church in its contemporary, institutional form has neither a biblical nor a historical right to function as it does.\\" (p. xx)It could be that Viola and Barna are correct, but I don't think they've proved their case. Pointing out problems with a model means that the problems need addressing. It doesn't necessarily mean that the entire model is wrong.It's one thing to argue that there are problems with our existing ways of doing church. I'm fully prepared to accept this. It's also OK to argue that other models of church sidesteps these issues, but it could be that they end up encountering a whole set of other issues - as is the case. But is it possible for institutional models to be redeemed? Viola and Barna say no. I'm not so sure.I'd much prefer to ask questions that get to the heart of the concerns they raise, such as if it's possible for a church to use a building missionally consistent with its true nature. Also, how can we move beyond being pastor-driven, give more to the poor, spend less on institutional maintenance, etc. These questions may or may not lead to shutting down institutional churches, but they need to be answered.This book, I think, gets at the right questions, but ends up writing too much off. They don't make a sufficient case for anyone to say that almost everyone has got it wrong until now.In conclusion: Barna and Viola have raised some valid issues. Some dynamics of church life that should be present often aren't. We need to take these seriously. However, their conclusion ultimately falls short. There is room for all kinds of churches, including the institutional and the organic. What matters more than structure is the life contained within. Still, I hope institutional churches will take some of the issues they raise to heart."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"\\"Pagan Christianity? Exploring the Roots of Our Church Practices,\\" may very well be the most important book written on the Christian church in the last two millennia. Frank Viola and George Barna team up to give their readers a critical examination of the last 1700 years of church history. Does the institutional church have any biblical and historical right to exist? \\"Are the practices of the institutional church (the clergy/laity system, salaried pastors, sacred buildings, the order of worship, etc.) God-approved developments to the church that the New Testament envisions? Or are they an unhealthy departure from it?\\"The first edition of this book entitled, \\"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices\\" by Frank Viola... is the third book written in a set of five books on church restoration and organic church life. Viola and George Barna, Christian pollster and author of the book \\"Revolution,\\" have co-authored the newly revised and updated \\"Pagan Christianity?: Exploring the Roots of Our Church Practices.\\" Barna brings to the book a fresh look and a polished language that improves on the delivery of Viola's original work. Barna, who has caused no small stink upon his recent confessions regarding the church, makes his decision to leave the institutional church complete with the publication of this book. If it wasn't clear in his book \\"Revolution\\"... it is certainly clear now.I enjoyed the new format of this book. At the end of each chapter, the authors give the reader a \\"Delving Deeper\\" section which lists common questions with answers in return. I felt that this helped to clarify what the authors were truly saying in order that fact might be separated from fiction. I also enjoyed the updated references and the plethora of footnotes listed at the bottom of each page. These references may be in a smaller font, but they are the entire foundation of historicity which resulted in the penning of this book. Therefore, the serious reader will not want to overlook the footnotes. The reader will also find the \\"Summary of Origins\\" and \\"Key Figures in Church History\\" in the back of the book a great help as well. The book may look like a long read... yet, you will find that your interest is peaked beyond that of any other historical book you have ever read. You will read until you are done... or until you have thrown it out the window.The serious questions raised in this book will give the Christian reader more than enough to wrestle over. Viola traces the pagan origins of almost every church practice that institutional Christianity holds dear and holds it to the light of the New Testament. I remember first reading the original \\"Pagan Christianity\\" over a year ago. I had spent 6 years of my life in \\"vocational ministry\\" within the institutional church and I had a degree in Religion/Biblical Studies. I had just resigned from my position as Minister to Students/Education because the church's leaders were opposed to fundamental teachings of Jesus. My wife and I saw that we could no longer serve among them. It was during this time that I began to read and study like never before. I was seeking to be a senior pastor in a church somewhere in the United States. I studied church history, ecclesiology, Christology, etc. I was seeking the Lord's will for his church. I compiled a list of what the New Testament described the church looked like in fellowship and among the world. With the help of Viola's book, I quickly realized that my list did not reflect the church I knew and that that church could not be seen in the model of the traditional church. I had to rethink my understanding of it all.I know how hard this read will be for many people, especially clergy members. \\"Pagan Christianity?\\" will, no doubt, be a most uncomfortable read for all those who believe the Body of Christ is an institution. For the clergy member, the read will almost be impossible. At every turn of the page... the flesh will flare up in a horrible display of arrogance and pride. Many will scoff at its claims and discourage others from reading it before an honest examination can be made. If the reader is not prepared to reexamine his faith and practice for a paradigm shift... he or she might as well leave this book well alone. If the reader is not yet at the end of their rope in frustration against the church practices and shallow conception of Christ that is believed and taught within the institutional church... this book will only breed anger and confusion. But, if you were like me a year ago... you are tired and want answers... and you want more of Christ... then please read this book and allow yourself to be moved by it. I encourage you to have an honest conversation with the Lord as you read. And listen to his still small voice.To the rabid opponents of this book, I strongly recommend you speak to no one before you have done truthful research concerning these matters AND have had an honest conversation with Jesus first. Many will argue that this book only proposes another \\"form\\" or method of church. This book is not about forms, but about principles. To argue forms... is to miss the point of this book. Many will make preposterous claims that this book seeks to tear down the church of Jesus Christ, when in all reality... this book exalts Jesus Christ of Nazareth and submits that we return to simple community gathered around his headship free from the inventions of man and religion that hinders the Body from every-member functioning. This book does not propose we mimic the model of first-century Christianity, but that we mimic our Lord. Out of our Lord's commands and the principles of his person and work (i.e. life and teachings) will come normal Christian church life!Why has this book been written? The authors write, \\"we have written this book for one reason: to make room for the absolute centrality, supremacy, and headship of Christ in His church.\\" (p.250) This statement alone should be enough for any true follower of Christ to pick up and read. But unfortunately, many people, for whatever reason, will choose to accept slander about the authors (even from trusted pastors) as enough reason to discredit and discount them as credible voices of truth in mainline Christianity. This is an incredible action considering that many institutional churches in the last decade have built their entire plan of attack off the statistical findings of pollster George Barna. On top of that... both of these men boldly proclaim Christ in way that is undeniably and unmistakably from a spirit of love and edification. The premature responses of the majority prove how mankind is driven by mere human emotions and tradition... instead of biblical truth discovered through a consistent and verifiable method of biblical interpretation that seeks to exalt Christ above all things.This reviewer and ex-clergy member challenges you to consider the message of these men. Compare the claims of this book with the Christ and the church of the New Testament before you decide who and what are truly following and being a reflection of pagan Christianity. All of us must choose between spiritual revolution (i.e. return to Christ) or religious reformation (i.e. tweaking the old pagan systems). One of these will release the church from her chains and free her from the bondage of man's religion to experience the natural faith of Christ. The other will only prolong God's people from beholding Christ in majesty and splendor to the world. There is only one life to live. Choose wisely.I also recommend reading:From Eternity to Here: Rediscovering the Ageless Purpose of GodThe Centrality of Jesus Christ (Works of T.

It's scholarly without being complex or too wordy and it's a fair examination of historical reality. I do have a few critical remarks of my own, however, they are minor critiques. This book is excellent! Worth the five stars I gave it. If you are looking for an easy-to-read resource chronicling the origins of modern-day church practices, this is your book! This is one book that will be read again and again and the subject of and resource for many a conversation on the matter of this phenomenon we might well call \\"churchianity\\".Having said that, I have to say that I also agree (in part) with some of the book's critics and those who loved this book shouldn't feel threatened or angred by the sub-5-star reviews. Viola's work here, I must agree, is perhaps not quite the caliber of a history text book (so I can't say it's the be-all/end-all resource of resources - though it comes close at times). While there are scores of references in footnotes on every page, it should be noted that a number of the books mentioned are simply references to other authors who happen to draw the same conclusions as Frank - and not necessarily well-known historians or scholars on the subject. That does not make them less-valuable and neither does this mean they are not accurate statements. I simply mean to convey that the critics have a legitimate point of critique here. The book bills itself as being \\"fully footnoted\\" as if footnotes alone equal irrefutable evidence. To boasts like this, I must say, \\"Frank please, we can do without the manipulation sales pitch buddy.\\" ;)Please understand, I have studied much of this subject myself and (though I am no historian expert myself) I do happen to agree with the vast majority of Frank's conclusions in this book and feel they are historically accurate (this is why I wholly recommend this book as a trustworthy resource - not to mention really one of the only books of its kind ever produced), but for technicality's sake, some of the critics comments are justified in the sense that this book is written at more of a high school level. But then, Viola himself would tell you this is the point.A college textbook is not usually much fun to read for the common person and not many would take the time to bother... Not to mention that most people aren't interested in searching through 200 different manuscripts and technical jargon to try and piece together a comprehensible answer to their question. ;) Frank does his audience a HUGE favor by summarizing the details and he does an excellent job in my opinion.Yes, I will agree, there are a few places where he probably could have elaborated more and examined a broader reference of Scripture (I agree with the reviewer who said he would have liked to see an examination of 1 Timothy chapter 5; as indeed this passage in often used by professional preachers to justify ministry salaries). Yes, there are a couple of places in the book where Frank inserts his personal presumptions, though I personally think these are minor details (and to be expected in any book by any author). For example, in one place he makes mention that Abraham's tithe in Genesis was voluntary - yet Scripture does not confirm this presumption (in fact history reveals that it is more likely Abraham was following Arab custom of the day). There are no footnotes to cross-reference on some of these minor points of presumption, but these don't detract from the main point of the book; nor do they discredit it. In fact some are rather insightful and, at the very least, thought-provoking. Yes, there are places that I think would have benefitted from Frank not seeming to presume that house church folks (or those who have read other sources on the same topic or his previous books) would be reading his book. I've watched the reaction of some clueless folks who see the title alone and become disinterested (you would think the title would provoke the opposite effect - but that's the way us out-of-church folks tend to think now that we're out of the \\"system\\" and I think Frank falls into this trap a bit as well).I would have to disagree with the reviewer that thinks the book loses focus at the end. On the contrary I think the book ends appropriately. Frank doesn't use this particular book in his series to push his personal home church views, rather he simply gives the goods to the reader to leave them introspecting and laying their thoughts and concerns before the Lord. Rather than telling them what to do - i.e. giving his solution (as so many \\"Christian\\" topic books do)- Frank blesses his readers by encouraging them (somewhat indirectly) to press in to the Lord and wait on Him for direction. I love that! It's what sets this book in the solid 5 star category because it's only agenda is to present an accurate historical summary of how most of our modern-day church practices came into existence and briefly why many of these are harmful to the Christian's spiritual growth and maturity and relationships with other believers in the body of Christ. If you want to know more about his views on \\"church planting\\", you can always buy another one of his books, but he doesn't tackle that beast here (and I'm glad because I personally challenge the concept Frank titles \\"the church planter\\" anyway - but that's another matter for another time).The book is just tops and I would easily say a must read! While it's easy for some to complain, one might consider the fact that probably none of these critics have taken the time to present a better work. Frank clearly did his homework and, in my humble opinion, has done a great service to the body of Christ! Christians ought to read this book if they are sincerely hungry for truth, not just tradition. Too many things Christians call \\"holy\\" and \\"sacred\\" are such only because man has dared called his concepts \\"ordained by God\\" when nothing could be further from the truth. The knowledge this kind of book equips the reader with (even if it's on a more basic level) will aid a believer by helping them to recognize potential religious manipulation and fallacy. Most of all, it will help to remind us that Christ alone should be at the center of our lives - not religious institutions, rituals, formulas, programs, clergy, or anything else. Christ alone must have the preeminence! God bless you all and keep you free in Christ Jesus!"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"The answer to this question and many others of more significance will be found in Pagan Christianity. The authors have painstakingly dug into the archives of history and shown the origins of the most striking features of the institutional Christianity that emerged in post-apostolic times -- things like the church building, the order of worship, the sermon, the pastor, dressing up for church, seminaries, the altar call and tithing.This book is a fascinating read just from a historical vantage point. For example, you learn that Christians were in the catacombs not because of persecution, but because they wanted to be near the dead. The church service in France is called \\"aller a sermon\\" (go to a sermon). There are a myriad of details drawn from church history that help one understand how certain traditions became entrenched in the way church was done.While there are certainly allusions to organic New Testament perspecives in the course of the book, it is not ultimately about solutions. Pagan Christianity is about documenting the Greco-Roman origins of many church practices that stand in open opposition to the New Testament revelation. \\"The sermon\\" is one tradition that arose from pagan, not biblical soil. In a book to come out later in 2008, \\"Reimagining Church,\\" Frank will unfold more specific pathways to practicing community that would contribute to untangling the churchy mess we find ourselves in.Because this book challenges ecclesiastical motherhood and apple pie, it will no doubt be a hard pill for many to swallow. But it must be stressed that the major points in PC are confirmed by the historical research of scholars from all across the theological spectrum. Emil Brunner concluded in 1952:\\"...what was known as ecclesia in primitive Christianity -- [is] so very different from what is to-day called the Church both in Roman and Protestant camps . . . . many theologians and Church leaders are . . . so much the more painfully aware of the disparity between the Christian fellowship of the apostolic age and our own 'churches,' and cannot escape the impression that there may perhaps be something wrong with what we now call the Church . . . . It is in fact the opinion of the author that the Church itself, in so far as it identifies itself with the Ecclesia of the New Testament, rests upon a misunderstanding\\" (The Misunderstanding of the Church, London: Lutterworth Press, 1952, pp.5-6).Likewise, one of the foremost New Testament theologians of our times affirmed with clarity some of the central theses of of PC:\\"Increasing institutionalism is the clearest mark of early Catholicism -- when church becomes increasingly identified with institution, when authority becomes increasingly coterminous with office, when a basic distinction between clergy and laity becomes increasingly self-evident, when grace becomes increasingly narrowed to well-defined ritual acts. We saw above that such features were absent from first generation Christianity, though in the second generaton the picture was beginning to change\\" (James D.G. Dunn, Unity & Diversity in the New Testament, Westminster Press, 1977, p.351).The quest for authentic, organic ekklesia must begin by an examination of the key components and pillars of what people have come to associate with church. Pagan Christianity has done a superb job of demonstrating that most of what we assume is necessary to practice church is of very suspect origin, and comes into conflict with the simplicity of Christ found in the pages of the New Testament.I would strongly encourage anyone who hungers for the expression of Christ in his body on earth in our day to read Pagan Christianity and explore the implications for their lives. I was greatly blessed by working my way through this material.Jon Zens, Editor, Searching Together"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Tyndale is known for publishing Christian books and has shown a daring initiative in publishing this book that questions traditional church practices. In the publisher's preface we read \`Tyndale does not necessarily agree with all of the author's positions and realises that some readers may not either. At the same time, we stand united with Frank and George in our desire to see the church operate according to biblical principles and be a full expression of God's grace and truth. Furthermore, the authors raise important questions based on their careful research, study, and experiences, and we believe these questions should not be ignored. Our aim is for you to consider their conclusions and then pray seriously about your response'.This book is a revised and expanded hard cover version of the book Frank Viola published some years ago, and he has teamed up with George Barna, well known for his research and statistics of church, and who has been hailed as \\"the most quoted person in the Christian church today\\". Barna's book \`Revolution' is being widely read in home churches across the world.Many traditional church practices are often unquestioned and regarded at least as a \`given', or are thought to have had their roots in the Bible. When many of these are examined and researched as Frank has done, they are shown to be man-made traditions that the earliest church knew nothing of and in fact many hinder the church. Some practices within the following aspects of traditional church life are addressed in this book - \`The Church Building', \\"The Order of Worship', \`The Sermon', \`The Pastor', \`Sunday Morning Costumes', \`Ministers of Music', \`Tithing and Clergy Salaries', \`Baptism and the Lord's Supper', and \`Christian Education'. If you are happy in a traditional church pew, then don't read this book!The actual content of the chapters is little different to the older edition, but the big advantage of this book lies in the additions Frank has made in corroboration with George Barna. There is a \`Delving deeper' section at the end of each chapter, couched as a dialogue between Frank and George, tackling questions raised from the chapter just read. They have done this very well, and these could be the basis for small group discussion and sharing.Another helpful aspect of the book is that it can be read on two levels. The copious footnotes that point to sources, further points that could be considered, extra reading or explanations, provide an opportunity for deeper study. However, a straight read through the book without a serious look at the footnotes, provides lots of information and challenges. A downside of the book is that the footnotes are in very small print unlike the earlier edition where the footnotes were much easier to read.A very helpful part of this later edition is the Afterward. The first section is entitled \`The Next Step' and calls for a response and for community. The challenges are listed asi. A new approach to worshipii. A new approach to spiritual growthiii. A new approach to managing resourcesiv. A new look at identityThis is followed by an excellent question and answer chapter dealing with \`hot potato' issues arising from the challenges to traditional church and its practice, found in the book.Both editions have a helpful summary of origins and dates when church traditions and practices commenced, and also a listing of key figures in church history with a brief word or two about their contribution.A major add-on to this book is a web based download with a free discussion guide and resources for groups and individuals.One of the difficulties home churches struggle with is the \`pull' back to the old familiar ways people have come from in traditional church. It is one thing for folk to step out of the traditional way of church, but to get the traditional ways out of us is much harder, when many of us have been conditioned in these ways for a long time. Some harbaur secret, or overt fears, that they might be stepping \`out of the ark' by moving to a home church. This book will be an enormous help for groups to \`kill the sacred cows' that still \`stick'. It brings ways and practices out into the cold light of day and exposes them for what they are - backed by thorough research. While we hang onto the past, we often remain \`stuck' and fail to move forward in freedom towards the future Jesus is calling us to. I suggest that groups study this book and slaughter those \`cows'!"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Viola's book should be read by every Christian with a hunger for truth. The previous reviewer from Florida obviously wants to steer folks away from this book...and for good reason. It's an eye-opener, alright. Most of what goes on in so-called &quot;church-services&quot; is NOT in the Scriptures. It's simply man-made religion. Viola simply reveals what history books have said all along, and some of us salute him for that.If God's people cannot face the facts, then they are not people of TRUTH. Check for yourself and see if &quot;pulpits, pews, going-to-church, etc.&quot; are anywhere to be found in Scripture. I challenge my brothers and sisters in Christ to take an honest look. Get this book, read it, and make up your own mind. You deserve a good look at the facts! We need more books like this, written by men of courage and integrity who love God and his Word.Don't let any &quot;smug, nasty&quot; reviewer steer you away from this book. Perhaps the straight-forward, simple writing style offend some people with an intellectual bent toward arrogance. Anyway, this book is a great read!"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Taking up topics like these, with a title like &quot;Pagan Christianity&quot; would lead one to expect a lot of fire-breathing and biased finger-pointing, but not so.Even if lots of cherished tradition and conventional wisdom get schredded by Viola's unreletent assault with historical facts, the arguments unfold with an encouraging lack of arrogance. This book contains so much history (both anecdotal and analytical), that it is impossible to find a soft spot to attack. An objective person must address the issues raised, even if they hurt. Protestantism, Evangelicalism and Neo-Pentecostalism all get their fair share of blows, not Roman Catholicism only.The author does not hide his personal leanings toward informal, idealistic models of Christian community, but he isn't &quot;preachy&quot; about it. No Denomination's faithful get demonized, even though the practices of every Denomination imaginable get blasted by Viola's copiously footnoted accounts of how they came to be (As detective Friday would say, &quot;just the facts, Ma'am&quot;).Bottom lines: Highly valuable perspective. I have no reason to doubt any of the ample sources cited in this adequately-researched volume. Well-written; not boring. Viola's conclusions are logical and transparent enough. Provides plenty of raw material as well as food for thought to anyone wondering how Sunday morning in Christendom ever became as predictable and lifeless as it is."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"I went to a four year conservative Bible College and believed like most people that what we have been told through our \\"guided tour\\" of church history was truth and a proper N.T. way to do things. We have been told what to believe for so long that these traditions have somehow become truth and we no longer even question what we do or believe in church.There are many people out there today who have turned to the church for help and have only been turned away or have been hurt in the long run. Have you placed your trust in the institution we call the \\"church\\" only to walk away scratching your head wondering why things turned out the way they did? I have spoken with many, many people who have terrible stories. After going through my own trial with a church and church people I finally studied the right information and my eyes were opened to a big problem. The word \\"church\\" comes from the N.T. Greek word \\"ekklesia\\". The word \\"church\\" does not actually appear in the Greek N.T. One problem I see is that the ekklesia mentioned in the N.T. is not the same as what we call \\"church\\" today. There has been a political evolution of the so-called church for over 1,700+ years. It has evolved into something that it was never meant to be. It finally dawned on me (with the help of Pagan Christianity) that one major reason what we call the church fails is that it really isn't what was originally set-up by our Lord. Today's \\"church\\" is basically made-up and ran entirely on the traditions of men that pastors like to preach about from week to week. It was never meant to be this way and it shows. We cannot expect churches to be a cure-all answer for our problems because in many ways they have become nothing more than country-clubs filled with emotion that never brings lasting results, social activities that aren't much different than activities done by any other social group, and politically motivated agendas that point a finger at what those outside of the \\"church\\" are doing instead of looking at what those in the church are doing. Instead of helping people in many cases they are discouraging people. If this was what Christ had in mind then it seems evident that it would be much more of a success than what it is. But......have hope-- there is an answer out there. Part of it can be found in Pagan Christianity.After an un-wanted marital divorce which was encouraged and even promoted by \\"church people\\" I began looking at what church-goers really do and believe. I began writing my own book about the present contradictions of church beliefs. During this process I discovered Frank Viola's original version of \\"Pagan Christianity\\". I am even more grateful that this book has been updated and co-authored by Barna and that it has been given more promotion within the Christian retail market.I think it is definite \\"required reading\\" for every person of the Christian faith. We should no longer simply believe what we have been told equals \\"TRUTH\\". Tradition never equals truth and never will. Christians like to chastise those who follow the faith of Judaism because of their willingness to hold onto the oral tradition over the written Torah but Christians are just as guilty if not more so for holding on with a secure grip to the traditions of man rather than the Word of God.Church has become nothing more than a socio-political outlet for the masses. We worry about who is wearing what to church and who has on their Sunday best. While we are worrying about our Sunday best we tend not to notice that we give God our Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday WORST!Many of our church fathers did good and wonderful things but at the same time many of them did terrible things and if you search you will find that these men did many troublesome things in the name of promoting their faith. We never seem to hear about these things when we take that above mentioned \\"guided tour\\" of church history. As it has been said many times, \\"The Reformation did not reform the church.\\" Much of what we believe and practice today came from the days of Constantine who seemingly did what was politically expedient to promote his own agenda and from the days of the so-called Reformers. All of these years later we are still waiting for true reformation. History shows us that many, many of our early church fathers and Reformers were anti-semitic. I've often wondered how men who are haters of the Jewish people can properly interpret Jewish Scriptures and more importantly----how can they love a Jewish Savior? It's contradictory to me for someone to hate the Jewish people yet claim to love a Christ who was Jewish himself. Again, we have been taught that Jesus was far away from the practice of Judaism but this is not substantiated in the N.T. Even Jesus said that we should do what the Pharisees teach yet not do what they practice. Apparently Jesus agreed with the teachings of the Pharisees.....he just didn't agree with their contradictory lifestyle. That makes me think, \\"Why would he agree with the contradictory lifestyle of the average church goer either\\"?The church today is worried more about what the people outside of the church are doing instead of looking inward and focusing on what the people inside its own walls are doing. As C.S. Lewis alluded to--\\"People are good at expecting others to live in a manner that they are not willing to live themselves.\\" Nowhere is this visualized more than in the modern church.There are many areas that \\"Pagan Christianity\\" does not cover about our pagan roots and this was an intentional process by the authors. I've said things that are not covered in the book and that is intentional on my part.If you are truly concerned about your faith and want to discover things that you will NEVER be told from the pulpit or your seminary classes then this is the place you need to start. Hopefully you can take this information and draw the proper conclusions. My research led me down a different path that is not necessarily the path of the authors. My faith in God and Jesus as our Messiah is much stronger now than it ever has been.I think this book should be used as a beginning point towards further research that will spark your mind and light your path towards knowing the truth of the Scriptures."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Frank Viola and George Barna have done the church a great service by delving into history to discover our roots. Reading this thoroughly researched and footnoted work is like having a vast library at our fingertips. If you are open to change and personal transformation, then prepare to be inspired.I have visited one of the organic churches Frank started, and I can tell you from experience that what he describes and continues to labor for is the real deal. I have seen with my own eyes why Frank and George are so passionate. Once you have joined in the joyful banquet of dynamic, participatory, and Spirit-orchestrated church life, you will never want to turn back to the dry days of man-controlled, pride-centered, guilt-driven, gift-stifling, and Spirit-less religion again.Church life at its best is not easy to find in this day and age, but it is well worth the effort to get there. It is all at once peaceful, loving, creative, spontaneous, inspiring, liberating, and graceful. God bless you both, Frank and George, for helping us find our way home. And God bless you, Tyndale publishers, for having the courage and vision to bring us this remarkable work."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"In general, this book lacks scriptural evidence/proof. As I read it, I found a lot of the practices, the author claimed stemmed from paganism, are actually found in the Old Testament and in the New Testament. As I did my research on church, synagogue, temple, and tabernacle etc in accordance with God's Word, I found the authors' conclusion in many, not all, of the matters was not Biblical supported because the scripture did not speak for or against it. This book is very opinionated, and the author speaks were God has not spoken. I was looking for evidence based on scriptures, and it was not there. The majority of the sources are the opinions of others, not the scriptures. My advice to all, do your research, look up the words, church, tabernacle, synagogue, temple, garments of priest, ministers, elders, pastors, etc so you will know what God says about it and what He does not say--do not add to or take away from His Word. We should not have a habit of speaking against things that God has not spoke against and implementing things which God has not. Stick to the Word of God, let it be your guide. Deuteronomy 29:29, KJV, \\"The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law.\\""},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Well written and thoroughly documented throughout. It is an easy read and attacks the subject well. I heartly agree with their points about how the church delays baptism of new believers and the overly academic training of pastors.However, the authors have tunnel vision when addressing a problem in the church and leave nothing else for explanation. For example, according to the book, most of the problems ever created in the church come from Constantine. While writing about the church building, they speak about the Temple, but fail to address issues such as the Jews worshiping while in exile, Jesus and Paul teaching in synagogues.Likewise, the authors lambastes proof texting, but utilize this method themselves when it is good for their argument. They rely mainly on 1 Corinthians 14, but fail to interact with many, many other verses in the New Testament that speak about the church and thus use this text as their only one for proving their points.The authors claim that the house church is the perfect model of the church because everyone shares, but puts down the call to \\"equip God's people to function and to know the Lord.\\" (p. 102). Is that a bad calling? Likewise, they state the the role of shepherding is a gift of various people, not critical to a church. However, without a shepherd, the flock would be lost.Regarding their discussion about the offering, they say the New Testament church did not take up an offering and the offering is not biblical. They fail to look at Cain and Abel who gave to the Lord an offering before there was even a church.Finally, if anything from the church has any kind of pagan influence, it is considered non-Christian by the authors. Just because something has a pagan background, does not mean that God cannot use it for His glory. If He used a donkey to speak, surely He can use a guitar, a computer, etc., here in the 21st Century. For instance, he writes \\"the use of chairs and pile carpets in Christian gatherings has no biblical support either.\\" (p. 75). Really are chairs that bad because they are not mentioned in the Bible?"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"The premise of this book is itself silly. There has never been anything like a pure, \\"non-Pagan\\" Christianity. The Israel of Jesus' day was under Roman occupation. Paul himself was a Roman citizen, trained in and influenced by greco-roman philosophy as well as the Jewish tradition. Of course, this entire project relies on a reading of Scripture that is untenable (every Christian has claimed their church to be \\"biblical,\\" so this adjective is useless). Save your money. How do God's people worship? In the Old Testament, they went to a temple. Today Jews go to synagogues. Christians go to Church. Defending modern \\"anti-traditionalism\\" by asserting a more \\"biblical\\" tradition against it is logically implausible. This makes as much sense as hoping for America to go back to a pure, Athenian-style democracy. America is too big for that. So is the Christian Church. House churches are fine, even great. But you can't baptize and commune there, and it is very likely that God wants us to be in a community of saints larger than a house can hold.This is nothing more and nothing less that bad scholarship used to defend the authors' \\"movement.\\" Having footnotes does not an intelligent argument make."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"This is a pretty shameless attempt by the authors to justify their own agenda by trying to denegrate the practices of other churches. Most Christians are aware that the Catholic and Orthodox Churches adapted a lot of early pagan holidays and holiday rituals to help the people transition from pagan religions to christianity. They advise rejecting any such practices in the Church today.They base their own ideas of what our church services should be on a very peculiar interpretation of a few verses in 1 Corinthians, chapter 14. And yet this practice, they call \\"proof texting\\", which they roundly condemn in others, is exactly what the authors are doing themselves. Taking a few verses from the New Testament out of context, and fleshing out their entire theology. Most reader's will see this for what it is, and attach very little weight to it."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"In my lifetime, I've watched institutional Christianity lose influence in the public and private sectors. I've seen friends that I grew up with fall away from belief. Marriages have crumbled in the church. The Christian world has become increasingly disengaged from the issues of real life, while becoming more and more entangled in the affairs of this current age.How could I ignore, then, a book such as \\"Pagan Christianity\\"? Like its companions, \\"Revolution\\" and \\"Reimagining Church,\\" this book aims to trace back Christianity to its roots, to understand the aims that Jesus had as He overturned the religious thinking of the day. Many modern institutional churches want to be \\"New Testament churches,\\" and this book tries to uncover what that really means. It tackles our current concepts of the church building, the pastor, the tithe, and the assumption that all church leaders must receive a formal theological education. It uses extensive footnotes and a great bibliography, while remaining very readable. There's also a \\"Delving Deeper\\" section at the end of each chapter that answers questions raised.And, yes, this book raises questions and hackles! I believe, though, that the authors' intention is not to stir bitterness or division. Instead, they hope to call believers back to an organic church, to a body of believers in which all have a voice and a function.\\"Pagan Christianity,\\" by its very title, aims to shake people from their complacency. I am ready to be shaken. I'm tired of going through the motions. Yes, there are benefits in staying committed to something, but we have swallowed whole many rituals from the past that have nothing to do with the Christianity in the New Testament. This is a call to be the holy priesthood that all believers were called into as Jesus tore apart the temple veil. We all have access to God and to the flow of His Spirit through each believer.Is God bigger than our mistakes and institutions? Absolutely. He continues to work through believers, even in the midst of traditions formed by man. I, too, have been moved by the Holy Spirit in the midst of worship services or sermons. Overall, though, I want to see LIFE in this body of believers. I'm tired of stale religion. I want the real thing and nothing less."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"This book presents some information that is more than valuable for His true church. I Highly recommend reading this book and the others by Frank Viola. It will help you see the true grace of God, as He has allowed all of this pagan influence to train His true church. It is more than amazing what we wretched souls do and have done against our God, His precious Son, and His Holy Spirit. Hope it doesn't hurt your denominational feelings but, instead draws you to Christ. Despite all of the flack against this book, Read It For Yourself, with an open heart and mind, see what Jesus really has to say! Please do not be mislead with Tradition!"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Finally someone is not afraid to write the truth, that Gentile Believers & the Early Church did NOT practice the OT Jewish commandment of tithing 10 percent.A lot of people want to feel they are earning something from God that entitles them to get Gods blessing because they are doing something to make God give back in return. This negates Gods free grace (unmerited favor) paid for by Jesus on His cross and replaces God's gift of grace with works.It is a Pastors right to be paid because the bible says \\"a worker is worthy of his wages\\" however, there is increasing resentment because of the bullying tactics plus quoting the Malachi 3 curse to those Christ has redeemed from the curse (Galatians 3:13).The real motive in giving should be with a heart of sincere gratitude for all God has done for us for us, not to perform, feel superior, boast & try bribe God for a material blessing. It is a shame many Christians have no understanding of Jesus words on the cross---Paid in full."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"There are many good and strong points in this book a few of which are1. Many Christian practices come from paganism2. The Apostles belonged to no set church3. Churches are actually modeled on pagan templesAnd many others4. The Romans used already established Pagan holidays as Christian ones5. Mega churches are in effect dumbing down Christianity confusing the need of people for a close and personal relationship with God by offering them entertainment.The author spends too much of his time describing in great detail what is wrong with the established church and really providing no clear goal or agenda on how to fix those problems. When you cite a list of things that are problems according to your own point and not based on any particular scriptural guidelines then eventually your argument however well intentioned is going to fall apart.Organized Christianity may in many respects be a flawed creation but it's the only one we've got. The author means well but he has in effect thrown the baby out with the bathwater.Overall-It is impossible as the author maintains to \\"get back to the roots\\" of Christianity because Christians can't even agree on what those roots were and speaking for myself my alarm bells go off when I hear people talking about it. The important thing is Christ the Lord not weather or not churches or church organizations have some creeping vestiges of Paganism regardless of weather or not you think it's the Sabbath day or the vestments or the incense or the liturgy or baptism.

One thing many forget and or deny is that we have a freedom in Christ that many other religions do not enjoy. Outright sin and evil are never to be part of a church service, or of private Christian life, but being innovative and using some things in modern society to reach out to the lost is not necessarily a sin. For instance, if a church wants to reach out to rebellious, rocker youth, it may be prudent to put some hymns to rock music, and spice up the service to show the kids that it is possible to be a Christian, and still have fun. I personally do not know of any church that practices communism, but that is exactly what believers did in the early church, at least for a while. The term \\"New Testament church\\" is highly subject to personal interpretation. Some so called New Testament churches \\"practice\\" speaking in tongues, but in reality, they probably are not doing what was done in the first century. I do not honestly believe that God wants us to pattern modern churches after the New Testament church, in any regard but strong doctrine. The early church didn't have tools like DVD players, cars and airplanes, and as such had to do things differently. Yes we worship on Sunday, but the word Sabbath simply means seventh, so any one day out of seven is valid to worship on. Some get dressed up for church, while others go in jeans, it matters not. The author is definitely biased and is tying to impart his particular sectarian beliefs on the rest of us, and while he has the right to try, you have the right to say no. I go to church, I sing hymns, I worship God and fellowship with other believers and I take of the cup and the bread. I also study the word of God with other believers, something that the early church didn't always do, simply because at that time, the New Testament was not yet finished. So, am I pagan for that? Yes, we celebrate Christmas, and we understand that some of the symbols in it and in Easter borrow from paganism, but it has a decidedly Jesus tone now, and belongs to us. Read this book if you desire, but don't condemn fellow believers based on its stilted viewpoints."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"This book stands in the path of heretics. As a church I do not believe we have moved in the right direction but the lack of understanding of the church fathers by the authors is a damage to the church.

These authors have been hurt by the church and need to learn to forgive others is what they need to do. DO NOT READ THIS BOOK unless You want to BE LEAD ASTRAY!!!!"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"My Pastor suggested a book to me the other day that sounded like a good read. It was Pagan Christianity by Frank Viola and George Barna. I'd never read any of Barna's books before, but have used his research on many an occasion. Barna and his firm The Barna Group specialize in sociological and statistical research on religion. He is well-known as \\"the most quoted person in the Christian Church today.\\" The other author Frank Viola is a well-known author and expert in the house church movement. I borrowed my Pastor's copy of the book and read it within a week.The book focuses on contemporary church practices and examines the roots of those practices to see if they truly come from the New Testament church or from other sources, most often pagan religious customs and traditions. The book did an excellent job exploring historical sources for modern traditions, but I think it went too far tearing down the contemporary church. It seems as if both authors approached the project with a preconceived bias and discriminatory attitude before the research even began.The bias begins early with the definition of the word \`pagan'. On page xxxi it's defined as \\"a practice or mode of thinking that has been adopted from the church's surrounding culture.\\" Hence, by that definition almost everything we see in the church today comes from a pagan source. This would apply to any Bible not in the original language, rolled up in a scroll or on papyrus sheets; allowing attendees to wear synthetic fabrics; carpet; electricity; and bathrooms. We find out that both chairs and carpet \\"were invented by pagans\\". I'm sure a lot of things were. The authors go on to say that \\"some pagan practices are neutral and can be redeemed for God's glory\\". That's good, because I don't know if Henry Ford was a Christian. For that matter, I don't think Bill Gates is, but here I am typing onto a PC. Apparently it is only up to the authors what can be redeemed. Using the word \`church' for a building or the common term \\"going to church\\" is also a little too pagan in their eyes.After deciding that church buildings, bulletins, liturgy, sermons, pastors, dressing up for church, music ministers, tithing, church offerings, our way of administering the sacraments, Christian education, Sunday school, how we read and use the Bible, and even how we see Jesus are all pagan and therefore wrong, what are we left to do? The authors don't leave us hanging long without an answer. They are quick to point out that their way of doing church in home settings is the only right way to do it.Though after reading the book, one might think some modern practices don't belong in the church, the reader is more apt to believe that the authors are nit-picking and trying way too hard to attack everything in sight. They simply try too hard. One such example is the use of a raised pulpit. Their primary view is that it is meant to elevate the clergy above and over the people. The truth is, in most modern churches, having a raised pulpit and stage is necessary so everyone can actually see the speaker. They counter this by stating that it \\"calls excessive attention to the preacher\\". Don't worry though, since they already had us fire the preacher.It's clear to many people at some time or another that how we do church needs to adapt and change. It occurs for various reasons. The culture around us changes. New technology becomes available. Old ways of doing things become outdated, like the shag carpet in the auditorium. The authors make no provision for change within the church. They claim that church should be exactly as it was within the New Testament, but the New Testament church ways existed in some part as a product of that culture.If you can read a book and absorb what's good while throwing out the rest, then this makes an excellent Biblical history book. If you can't stand to read a religious book because it's caustic, divisive, and makes you madder than a Greek Sophist at a science fair, then don't even bother picking this one up. On the other hand, if you totally agree with the authors and have space in your living room to host a religious gathering, it will suit you well."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"It's not worth spending much time on here. I guarantee that the positive reviews are from people who are part of the \\"House Church Movement\\". They, like Frank Viola, seem to be angry with anything that does not meet in a home. There is this presumption that the early, first century church was the perfect church (but they forget about Ananias and Saphira, and the overlooking of the people in daily food distribution, for instance). They often quote Acts 2:46, reminding us that the people \\"broke bread in their homes and ate together\\", the bread and butter of the house church movement. BUT, they conveniently leave out the FIRST PART OF VERSE 46, which reads \\"Every day they contineud to meet together in the temple courts\\". That's not a church meeting in a house. That's a LARGE GROUP GATHERING that could not fit in a house. This is one of many examples.Viola/Barna also take issue with preparing musically. The say there is no need for a \\"pastor\\" in a church beyond her early church plant days, but I can guarantee that there is definitely a leader in each house church, who functions like a pastor. Call it semantics, but that is what they seem to be focusing on. Start having people give alleged prophecies in your house church/home group without a leader/overseer presiding and see how long it lasts. Fact is, they DO have pastors, they just don't call them such. There is a warped theology that a pastor is not an Elder, or an Elder is not a pastor. Very, very poor Biblical interpretation.BTW, since Viola and Barna keep emphasizing that ONLY the House Church is the RIGHT and Biblical church, it would seem that they support the idea that only what we find in \\"the Book\\" (Bible) is acceptable. Then why are they SELLING their book for $17, when the whole content is about the church? Did Paul peddle theology for money? They also speak, for fees, at conferences. Do we see even one instance in the Bible of a church conference, where paid speakers are brought in? They do the very thing they accuse others of doing. By their reasoning, they shouldn't even use the internet or the printing press, bc they were not around in the 1st century, and only those things and models that were are legitimate.Be very careful about extremes like this.

Perhaps I expected something more than what this author could give on the subject, but when it was all said and done, it spoke volumes to me about the author's biased toward the home church and the evil of the modern church.It's unfortunate that George Barna attached his name to this revision, I will not be able to look at his surveys in the objective light that I once did.Blessings."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"I came across this book after coming to the humble acknowledgement that there had to be more to this life than what I had been experiencing.

The essential life force of the church, ie, the resurrection of Christ and His indwelling spirit is alive and well. The man made institutions and ideas invented by the pursuit of an ability to control and the 20th Century desire for more, more, more is failing and flying apart like a space craft reentering a thick air atmosphere. George & Frank waved a big red flag and sent up a clarion call four years ago. Do we as Christ Followers have the courage to read, reflex and openly admit what is obvious to all around; THE CHURCH is alive and well, the church institutions are sick, weak and destined to disappear unless we remember this; I live this life because of His life.Pagan Christianity?: Exploring the Roots of Our Church Practices"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"First of all...let me say that I LOVE JESUS and am a born-again believer in Christ. But for YEARS I have been concerned about the health of the church, and how problems persist. Why do we pray that \\"God move today like never before\\" and nothing changes? If the \\"Holy Spirit\\" is truly speaking; why isn't it convicting church leaders of the SIN that everyone knows about?Is \\"teaching\\" just \\"Lecturing\\"? In school we were able to ask questions about what we didn't understand, and we got homework, and were held accountable for our grades. But we don't experience this in \\"The Church\\". Where is the opportunity for EVERYONE to exercise the gifts, and to LEARN by DOING? You can't become a world class singer by just watching MTV. You can't become an NFL player just by watching Monday Night Football.And unfortunately that's what many church experiences have become... a SPECTATOR SPORT. As I learned by reading PAGAN CHRISTIANITY, for 300 years early church was an organic, free flowing fellowship where EVERYONE participated (and not just by sitting in a pew)..and THAT'S how the matured and grew. I knew that there was something about the way we \\"Do Church\\" that was ineffective. PAGAN CHRISTIANITY helped me connect the dots. 1000 COOL POINTS go to Frank Viola and George Barna and their team! This book belongs in the library of EVERY CHRISTIAN who is trying to go full out for Christ!I can't wait to start REIMAGINING CHURCH!!!"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"This is one of the worst written, agenda driven, criticisms of the Body of Christ I have seen. The authors managed to criticize about every church practice, movement of God throughout Church history and church leader including many of the Reformers, Wesley, Moody, Finney, Billy Graham and others.Fortunately for all of us who have been deceived and led astray for 2,000 years, we now have the \\"house church\\" to lead the way. No thanks.Amazon, can I get my money back?"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Recently I read a book entitled \\"Pagan Christianity\\" by George Barna and Frank Viola. Frankly speaking I was shocked by the content of the book.It is no wonder Mark Driscoll said this of the book\\"The book Pagan Christianity is a book that makes some serious charges against the offices, functions, and forms of the church. Additionally, it has become something of a manifesto for those disgruntled with the church, rebellious against spiritual authority, and intrigued by suspicious doctrine.\\" 1The authors of this book are part of a church planting movement that plant house/micro/simple/organic churches. They are also known as a evangelical stream of the emergent churches. Now I have to specify that I have no problems with people who wants to plant such churches. I believe that it is a valid movement and in many ways it brings the church back to smaller community where there is Koinonia. In fact for many years, I personally preferred a \\"multiplying church\\" model as it would allow multiplication of church leadership and ministry and also allow the church the have a greater geographical influence. However I also believed that God allowed different forms of churches to co-exist. From the traditional churches to Charismatic churches, Mega churches to simple house churches.The \\"Pagan Christianity\\" propagates that the church it is today, over the last 1900 years accumulated pagan practices from the cultures that surrounded the church. As such elements of the church such as:1. Church Building2. Sermon3. Order of Service4. Ordained leadership5. TithingThere are also other areas which are deemed as pagan.I have always been a critque of modern day Christianity and my heart has often been broken by the state of the church it is today. This is the reason why I have been praying revival for many years. This book has however gone to the far extreme of labelling everything as pagan. It seems to me that the problem in the world today is the \\"Church\\" and not the devil. Jesus said \\"I will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.\\"To say that everything in the church today is pagan is to say that the Holy Spirit has been missing in action.This point is echoed by Ben Witherington in his Part 1 crtique of Pagan Christianity.He said \\"And of course the big bad guy in &lt;span>Pagan Christianity&lt;/span> is not going to be sin, suffering, the Devil, or any of those things. The big bad guy is going to be what is loosely called the Institutional Church and that other famous whipping boy--\`church tradition' and oh yes--- Greek philosophy. The particular animus is against the Roman Catholic Church for paganizing Christianity. Dan Brown would have liked this book.\\" 2While the Modern church is not perfect, I dare not say that she is pagan.According to Frank Viola, he blames Constantine for much of the practices adopted by the church through the centuries. And since Constantine was not really a Christian but a pagan (according to Voila Pg 18 of Pagan Christianity) much of the pagan practices came as a result of his influence. If one follows such a line of argument, soon we may even come to a doubt the Canoncity of the Bible, for it was King Constantine that decree the council of Nicea.The conclusion of the book, is interesting. \\"With this in mind, the advice we would offer to those who feel called to leave the institutional church is three-fold. 1) Leave quietly and do not take anyone with you. In other words do not cause division.\\" The core of this book is divisive in nature and yet the author advice members who wants to leave not to cause division. It is clear that the very intentional of this book, is really to pull down the normal churches and the conclusion is that the organic church is the only \\"Biblical\\" Model. We are all aware that some cults do propagate that their church is the true church on earth. (I am not saying the Organic Church or Frank Viola is cultic!)Having said what I said, is the Organic church a viable option for a church community? Of course it is! If it is run in such a way with alterations from some the things propagated it is definitely a model which God can use. It minimizes expenditure, does not require many full time staffs, and might be the mode of the church if persecution breaks out. I have friends who are involved in this movement for years. They are not critical of the organized churches and would gladly partner them in ministry and missions.If you would like to read scholarly critique of Pagan Christianity you can refer to these articles which debunks many of the issues brought up by the author. The critique can be found here:[...]In these last days we have to be careful with the doctrines that come forth. St. Paul gave a warning regarding the spirit of deception.But the Spirit explicitly says that in later times some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and doctrines of demons, (1Timothy 4:1)Paul was concern about the doctrinal errors that were attacking the church and instruct Timothy to be vigilant in protecting the church from doctrinal errors. I believed in these last days we too have to be watchful and not fall into deception.ConclusionIs the church therefore really Pagan as what the author said? Absolutely no! She may be imperfect but certainly not pagan. God is preparing the Bride for the His coming. She will go through renewal and transformation through the work of the Spirit."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"It is a known phenomena that many evangelical Christians are looking at the ancient paths of Christianity in search of meaning, truth, and stability. There are no doubt many reasons, but some of those reasons include the growing demands of modern evangelicalism to be exclusive, legalistic, and dogmatic...with many churches being unashamedly narrow-minded in the name of being \\"conservative\\" or Bible-believing\\" (as if others who do not believe it exactly as they believe it are somehow lesser Christians, or worse).So begins this book, Pagan Christianity. Many points are well made and well documented (or at least, well footnoted). Then the author goes off track by his conclusions. Following many of the footnotes, I found the authors chose a) to ignore a broader range of material, and 2) were somewhat misleading by their readings of early church documents by pulling out of context what the early church Fathers said and more importantly, what they meant. I would think such evangelicals would be more dedicated to \\"authorial intent.\\" Obviously Frank Viola has a bias already towards reading the early documents as meaning home church is the only way. He indicates that the REAL way to \\"do church\\" is via home church, as if it is the cure for Christianity (also assuming Christianity NEEDS a cure!). The book is written with this slant throughout.He fails to appreciate such things as the courage and conviction of the early fathers who planted and tended the churches, their struggles to define and defend orthodoxy (after all, the \\"New Testament\\" as we know it today was not available at the local bookstore in 150 AD). He fails to appreciate the battles with heresy, the need to figure out how to preserve the apostle's teaching, and the ongoing struggles with church unity. More importantly, he condemns the great revivals by smugly noting since organized churches and professional clergy was never in God's plan, the great outcomes are nothing compared to what would have happened if we had just been obedient to his vision of home church.The great revivals under Methodism, Congregationalism, and Pentecostalism, including the Charismatic renewal that has invigorated the church throughout the world seem somehow an inadequate stamp of approval to Viola's thinking.His attack on church architecture is particularly weak...saying that the facts some churches are \\"awe-inspiring\\" and beautiful takes away from our awe of God (and says this without that great research Barna is known for). Quite the contrary, such architecture has inspired millions. I completely agree that the church has squandered billions of dollars on itself and infrastructure while not doing the very basic things Christ called us to do (feed the poor, care for the orphan, widow, and stranger in our land). The church is called to two simple things; love God with all we have and are, and love our neighbor with the same kind of love we have and show for ourselves. In this, the church has failed miserably.This book is overall interesting, enlightening in many ways, and well written. The historical points made are well taken, but the conclusions (i.e., what should we do in light of these facts)are weak at best, and dangerous for many. Anyone who has given home church a really good chance knows the risks of unorthodox practices, manipulation (in Jesus name!) and self-serving behaviors are just as real there as in a church building. Jesus did not give us a book of directions about how to implement His desires. He gave up principles to live by, and the Holy Spirit to help us realize the kingdom of God inside each believer. I completely agree with the book that the church is not the building, but the people of God. However, I actually do not know of anyone that is confused about that issue.Enjoy the book for what it is...a brief history of church practices and a pitch for home churches. Read the early church fathers. Then, most important of all, love God with all your mind, heart, and strength, and love your neighbor as yourself. A wise man once said THAT is way more important than what building you meet in."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Glad someone had the eggs to say it, not to mention all the research behind it."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"I can definitely see how a book like this could become a lightning rod for debate. I haven't read all the reviews, but it seems to me that opinions about this book tend to fall into one of two catagories: Readers either love it or hate it. There really doesn't seem to be much in between. Personally, I think this is one of the best books I've ever read. I loved reading about Church history. But I am a history buff, so this aspect of the book might not appeal to all readers. But I know very little about Church history, so it definitely appealed to me. I also found this book to be well-documented. I have to admit though, I found the numerous footnotes somewhat distracting.I can definitely understand why people would feel threatened by this book. Frank Viola and George Barna pull no punches. They are willing to make the reader very uncomfortable and raises isssues and questions that are not easily dismissed. If the reader is willing to approach this book with an open mind, I think it has the potential to be life-changing. It certainly was for me. I also highly suggest \\"Reimagining Church\\" by Frank Viola.This book confirmed what I have suspected for a long time. There are some serious problems with the modern-day Church in America, and this book wastes no time telling the reader what they are. No part of the church service is safe from discussion and critique. I think every pastor and every Christian should read this book. But I have a sneaking suspicion that will probably never happen. I think this book deserves a higher readership than it has received. I know that there are probably people who will dismiss this book out of hand, without even taking the time to read it for themselves. I also believe that some will read it without taking time to really think through the issues presented here. Some people will choose to remain ignorant about these types of issues and will avoid the book all together. I applaud the courage of Frank Viola and George Barna. In Christian circles today, there are many who tell people what they want to hear, and very few who have the courage to tell people what they need to hear, regardless of whether the people want to hear it or not. Thankfully, these authors fall into the second category.A word to the wise: If you are comfortable in Church and have no desire to be made uncomfortable or to think too deeply about issues like this, then DON'T READ THIS BOOK. On the other hand, if you are like me, and have known deep down there is something seriously wrong with the modern American church, then do yourself a favor and read this book. This book will help you discover how and why the American Church has gotten so far off track.I like the fact that this book does not pick on any particular denomination or Church body. The authors are critiquing. Some previous reviewers made the claim that the authors seem to have an ax to grind. But I didn't get that impression at all. I think this book raises some very valid and important issues. Sacred cows are dying right and left. This is an important book, one that should not be ignored."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Pagan Christianity by Frank Viola and George Barna was first introduced to me during a conversation with friends who thought the book brought up some pretty intriguing points. They were subtle in describing a few of the points, and the conversation was not lengthy, but left enough of an impression for me to order it. Little did I know that when I received the book I would take only three days to finish it. That isn't because the book is short (it is over 250 pages) or shallow, but because what was being presented challenged my perceptions of \\"the church\\" at every turn. I had to keep reading even though it is weighty stuff. While I could quote line and verse as to the fact that we (believers in Jesus Christ) are the church, and not the building or denomination, I was further challenged by the unveiling of a historical overview of \\"church history\\" that deviated significantly from the life of the New Testament church as presented in the pages of the bible. This deviation, while not necessarily taking away the truth of the message of believers in Jesus Christ being the body/temple, may make it more difficult for the Body to function as it should.Having gone to seminary (one of the targets in the crosshairs of the writers...and I mean in the crosshairs in the best possible way...they are not attacking, but encouraging), I've had plenty of time studying books of the New Testament, and have focused quite a lot of time on the Pauline epistles, where we see Paul over and over expressing the message of the cross and Christ's substitutionary death for our sins, justification by grace through faith in Christ (apart from works), being made a new creation, having escaped the condemnation of the law, being sealed with the Holy Spirit, and having \\"Christ in us\\" among numerous other New Covenant ideas. However, in terms of understanding the life of the New Testament church and how they met, interacted, and lived life together, I had a significant blind spot. The writers express how differently the early church operated than what has evolved since the early 1st century, and do a fantastic job of explaining how various practices (the sermon, the Lord's Supper, Christian Education, paid clergy (and the division created between them and \\"laity\\"), creating church buildings, service orders, etc.) have been influenced from the pagan culture around them, which have all made an impact on \\"the church\\" (the people) acting as such. For example, a normal Lord's Supper was an actual supper and included a specific time to reflect on the bread (body) and wine (blood), and included sharing life with each other. The implementation of the sermon (rather than common sharing), the professionalization of the pastor, and numerous other practices have aided in burning out pastors, and allowing the Body to maintain passivity and confusion over their true identity. Basically, they argue, it is difficult for the Body to act as the Body when the structure and form so affects the function (I use the word difficult, not impossible).You may not agree with everything in the book, but it is, dare I say, revolutionary. It challenges the church to really start questioning who they are as the church. I said \\"start\\" because I am just starting and plan on continuing the examination with three of Viola's other books. In order, I plan on reading \\"The Untold Story of the New Testament\\" (more NT background), \\"Reimagining Church\\" (apparently a good follow-up to Pagan Christianity, since it asks \\"If not the old institutional way, then what?\\"), and \\"From Eternity to Here\\" (for a good overview of God's eternal purpose). I could always change course and think these guys are crazy, but I freely admit I'm stubborn and it's hard to change my mind, so when I am challenged this much, I tend to think \\"they might be onto something.\\" We'll see...but for now, I say \\"5 stars!\\"As an addendum, I will always have reservations with just about everything, even with a 5 star review (I can reserve the right to change my mind/repent down the road...especially as I see things play out with the follow-ups!). However, I have read some of the one star reviews and have the following thoughts toward some of the negative comments: 1) many answers regarding what a home church could look like are not found here, and are apparently addressed in Reimagining Church, 2) I don't think the authors would argue that church form solves all problems (i.e. sin issues such as in Corinth (what didn't they seem to get into) and Galatia (return to legalism), and others shows whether a home church or institutional, it can be messy. 3) I did not get the impression that the authors were overly negative toward anything but home church. I did feel they were fair in their assessments, and willing to challenge where and why practices came into play. I have read the preface to Viola's Reimagining Church and he comes across very kindly to those who fellowship in a church building/congregation (which so far, I would have to say is still my present \\"form\\"). 4) I am aware that using 1 Corinthians 14 repeatedly feels like proof-texting, even though they emphasize proof-texting is a poor theological method. However, my impression is that the textual examples they use against proof-texting (i.e. wherever 2 or 3 are gathered) are accurate in how they use them. I'll grant a little grace if they do use a text repeatedly if it is accurate and supports their point. I do it all the time with Galatians 2:15-21 in explaining justification by faith in Christ (apart from works of the law).Obviously, most of us who review books such as this, like to make our point. I could belabor mine, but this should suffice for now!"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"I've always thought that God worked through his children and in his Church, but what we call church couldn't really be what Jesus intended when he said to Peter \\"On this Rock I will build my church.\\" Frank Viola answers a lot of great questions, many we were afraid to ask, and really breaks down what is less than ideal about the church as we know it.

I like the critique of the institution of the clergy and of the idolatry surrounding church buildings.As for its weaker \\"how we should really do church\\" side; the book fails to distinguish the basic nuances and tension between whether the New Testament is talking about the early church in descriptive or prescriptive terms.The book is also too hard on music leaders. A group of people sitting in a circle where a few people might break out in song spontaneously (and others encouraged to follow) is no nearer to the heart of God than the skilled song leaders in the Old Testament (who also had heavy instrumentation) singing the songs of Zion.The book tends toward a repristination model of church where a dozen or two people meet on the Lord's day and a few (uninhibited extroverts) control things. Extroverts always end up controlling things in groups when there is no structure.I am a church planter in California (www.RobinwoodChurch.com) and am also self employed (www.ThornHeart.com)."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"'In the same way, the Lord commanded that those who proclaim the gospel should get their living by the gospel.' 1 Corinthians 9:14Yet Viola and Barna naively claim that the clerical/laity distinction is unbiblical, and therefore pastors should not be paid.House-church movement leader, Frank Viola, prefers the sofa over the pew; conversational teaching over the public sermon. His less-than-admirable motives uncover an attempt to overturn historical church polity by arguing that 'ordain' (KJV)/ 'appoint' (NASB) never did constitute installment into office: 'The word ordain does not mean to put into office...public recognition of elders and other ministries was typically accompanied by the laying on of hands...' p 124 Public recognition only procured for them a blessing, says Viola. Where in the Bible was this rite actually performed on 'other ministries' that acted independently of the church?'I was appointed a herald...'

I always knew that what happened on a typical Sunday morning didn't seem to fit with what I read in my New Testament but I never saw it so well organized, researched and documented before. Frank Viola and George Barna have done an excellent job of lovingly exposing the problems in church practices today. They show how years of church tradition and practice doesn't make a wrong \\"right.\\" I have to say that the authors of this book have a lot of guts in writing on such a socially unacceptable hot topic. In writing this book they have made themselves a target with a big red bull's eye. The vast majority of Christianity will disagree adamantly with the premise of this book, but they will not be able to refute the researched conclusions. Definitely worth the read, however, I must warn you that reading it could ruin your \\"Church\\" experience for life. It has mine, praise the Lord!"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"As a former youth minister in an institutional church, I had been out for about 6 years when I read this book. I had been going back through all of the training, all of the doctrines and dogma I'd been taught and was attempting to sift through and discover what was from God and what was from men, using the bible as well as primary sources from history and various reference materials to aid me to that end. I began going through the teachings of my former church one by one, and was having a great deal of emotional turmoil as no one else I knew at the time felt as I did, that many of the practices that we did, were not scriptural but based on people's preferences and traditions. That there was no scriptural description or endorsement for them, but rather that they were traditions and rituals that had been superimposed in scripture. A good friend of mine recommended this book after we spent hours talking about why we as the body of Christ do the things we do, why we say it's endorsed by God, but cannot find any evidence for many of these practices in scripture. While reading Pagan Christianity, I came to realize that I was not alone. That other people felt exactly as I did, that due in part to the years of adding non-biblical practices to the Church, it had become more of an institution than a living organism.Pagan Christianity is thoroughly researched and as I went through, chapter by chapter, I verified the information myself using primary historical sources. To date I've given away two copies to friends as well. In Pagan Christianity, Frank Viola and George Barna have provided a good starting point for anyone interested in separating biblical truth from human tradition and preference. I unreservedly recommend this book as well as other books by Mr. Viola, including Reimagining Church and The Untold Story of the New Testament Church, an amazing work, which I highly recommend as well. If you want to know more about our common history as the body of Christ and learn how and when we started doing things the way we've been dong them, I cannot emphasize enough what a great source of Ecclesiastical history this book is. It doesn't attempt to rewrite history, but reveal a little more of it than most of us are familiar with."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"This book is really meant to be read with the other Viola book \\"Reimagining Church: Pursuing the Dream of Organic Christianity.\\" Pagan Christianity only represents half the story.

It is very eye-opening. It is amazing that so much of what we do within the \\"church\\" system is so totally broken. It is very important to remember that we Christians ARE the Church; we do not \\"attend\\" church. It's not about a building; a facility; a PLACE to go on Sunday mornings or any other day of the week. If you want to know how the early first century Christians gathered together to worship God, read this book. Learn how it was done during Paul's time. It didn't take very many centuries after that to become totally dysfunctional. Wait until you read the chapters on clergy salaries and tithing. We are being lied to from the pulpit regularly. Why do we have \\"professional\\" clergy anyway? What's up with the entire concept of having a pastor? Do we really need one? Is it biblical? Why do we have an altar in our churches? Why is there a difference between the clergy and laity? Where did the elaborate cathedrals and church buildings come from? What about that music anyway?

However he goes too far in suggesting that these practices should be abandoned all together since some of them do have biblical origin. The only problem is just that they've been stained by pagan elements. He does not provide sufficient biblical evidence to prove that the practices in themselves are biblically wrong.For instance he relates the pagan origin of modern church building design. Then he goes too far in suggesting that we meet only at homes as if meeting in buildings is un-biblical. After all Jesus and the apostles preached in the synagogues. There is no biblical principle being violated by meeting in a church building.If there are pagan stains in some features of a modern church then let's remove those stains but keep the biblical features.

Much of the information is not new. However, it has been put together with careful attention to detail and very thorough footnotes and sources.This is not a book written to attack the Church although many may feel that way. It is a book written to address what at its root is a true proposition. Institutional Churches, whether Catholic, Protestant, Evangelical, Seeker Sensitive, and the list could go on, are at the core of their practise following many elements that do not in fact arise from the Bible or early church tradition. This is more than just a history lesson however.When I first began reading this book, after having spent a great deal of time and effort in studying Organizational Leadership at a Master's level, I was first tempted to look at the arguments presented and just say, \\"So What?\\". Every culture's influence is exerted upon it's institutions. That is neither good nor bad in most instances, so unless the premise is that we should just return to the culture of the early church as if it were \\"the\\" culture of God then the argument is really not that strong.As I read however, what I found is that this is far more than just culture being called into question. We're talking about hierarchies, philosophies and practices that find their root not just in cultural elements but in full scale adoption of systems, practices and their underlying belief system that include pagan temples, Greco-Roman pagan philosophy etc.Then my next response was \\"Well, that's what the Reformation was all about wasn't it?\\" Well yes and no. Much of what took place at the Reformation was a rearranging of some things but in effect most of the elements of the existing Church system were left in place.Today however, we have so much change taking place apparently in Churches with so many different \\"brands\\" available, surely these issues are being addressed? Well, not so much.So is this a diatribe to destroy the Church? No. That's not what I read and further the litany of recommendations for this book from Bible Scholars and leaders within the Church should set that concern aside. Viola and Barna do have some suggestions to make and they are leaning in the direction of organic, non-institutional Churches. However even if that is not the decision of those reading this book, the information will equip even those remaining in the Institutional Church to be more discerning about what is really the faith preserved for all the ages and what is in effect just a stowaway that sadly in many cases has arisen to captain the ship.5 Stars. A very important book.Bart Breen"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Somewhere deep in this book is buried quite a fine article about the alienation that many experience from the institutions and traditions of the church, and what a house church might have to offer these people. Unfortunately Viola and Barna decided for some reason not to write this article but instead a lengthy diatribe against any form of Christian community that is different from their own. There is an appearance of scholarship about Pagan Christianity, but the mass of footnotes hide some very sloppy and incoherent historical reasoning and a surprising amount of bigotry.The main problem is that the central issue is so poorly defined, so that Viola is able to both make sweeping attacks against the institutional church and then drastically qualify them in the small print at the end of each chapter without any apparent embarrassment. The term 'Paganism' is generally used to refer to polytheistic and nature religions in contrast to monotheistic or philosophical systems. The claim that Christianity has syncretised with paganism over its history has been frequently made and is a fascinating question. However, Viola chooses to ignore this and bizarrely defines 'pagan' as referring to any practice at all which the church has adapted from the surrounding culture. Having laid this foundation, of course the history of the church is going to appear as 1900 years of apostasy. But there is no compelling reason to make such an assumption except the kind of naive biblicism which Viola appeals to. We are constantly assured that the apostolic congregations had particular values, but only the most general evidence is presented (a few verses in Paul and 'the vibe' of Jesus' ministry), and counter-evidence from the New Testament is ignored and from the earliest post-apostolic writings is dismissed as evidence that 'the rot began here'. In fact, one of the distinctive features of Christianity, and its great genius, is the extent to which it is capable of being 'contextualised' and to take over the forms of culture in which it is accepted, reconfiguring them in light of the gospel. This is arguably partly why the church was able to convert the Roman Empire, not the supposed emotional power of meeting in someone's lounge room. The house church movement that Viola sets up as a reflection of pristine Christianity is in reality a fine example of this kind of inculturation, as it has plugged into the values of the counter-culture movement of the 60s and 70s - distrust of hierarchy and authority, love of informality and communal 'folk' experience. So the house church movement is 'pagan' too according to Violas definition, which shows how useless this definition is.I was also troubled by a persistent lack of balance in the evaluation of the institutional church. Everything is presented in the most jaundiced light as oppressive and boring and badly-motivated, in contrast with the highly idealised picture of 'organic' house churches. I'm sure if you had the desire you could write a parallel book condemning all non-institutional churches for their cult-like conformity, tendency to schism and heresy, and reliance on dionysiac ecstatic experiences as a criterion for true spirituality. But that would be uncharitable and untrue, which is precisely my point. The fact that Viola can condemn universally revered saints such as Ignatius of Antioch and John Chrysostom gives some kind of inkling as to the level of prejudice encountered in this book. The various institutional churches do have weaknesses, but so do all human societies and groups and not even house churches are exempt from this. 'All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God'.Overall, this is a genuine critique of institutional Christianity that has been overthrown by the authors' desire to write a 'total church history' that validates their movement against all others. They quote John Newton as saying 'Let not him who worships under a steeple condemn him who worships under a chimney.' Certainly, but perhaps him who worships under a chimney should not condemn him who worships under a steeple either. Pagans had chimneys too, after all."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"The fact that George Barna is the co-author should be an indicator that this book is going to have problems. He was the one who wrote the book (as I remember it) \\"Marketing the Church\\". He seems to flip-flop his views quite often. He's a statistician, so his views are often more shaped by polls and statistics than Scripture.Viola's view is that virtually the entire way that church is done is both secular and pagan and fights against church fellowship. He does bring about a few points worth looking at, but mixed in with that are proof-texts out of context to prove his points (interesting that he devotes a section of the book to the danger of prooftexting).All in all, although a few points worth meditation were brought out, I was very turned off by the way Scriptures were poorly quoted, for example, Viola quotes 1Co 14:26 as proof that a church meeting should be everyone teaching each other, everyone getting to lead in song (this person leads this song, that person that one), everyone speaking in a tongue. But the obvious context of the passage is Paul is rebuking the church for functioning in this way and so it actually works against his point rather than prove it, but taken out of context, it becomes a proof-text. That says to me that there is greater concern in making a point than keeping the full integrity of Scripture.Would I recommend this book? No. Although it did make me think about some things and ask myself why I do certain things, for the most part my conclusions about body life are pretty much the same as before. I appreciate the fact that Viola wants to see the church engage more as a body than an event, and I don't mind him doing church the way he does, but he suggests Scripture is on his side (which again I cannot see any real support for this) and that if we don't see the church functioning the way he does church, we are caught up in Greek/Roman thought and paganism."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"The history of this book is undeniable. The points it makes are strong and challenging. But as we often find the theology and ideas presented, though they might sound like revolutionary battle cries, are very difficult to weld into our actual daily lives. I know many people who have home groups and that appears to be what the authors prefer. But the Church is still Church by default, and I do not see that changing anytime soon. What I mean by that is, the old building on the corner with a steeple and stained glass is still the first place that comes to mind when a nonbeliever wants to know where they can encounter G-d.A good friend was recently telling me the story of an old alcoholic who awoke one Sunday morning and felt the strong urge to go to church. In his entire life he had only been once or twice but for some reason he put on his shoes and jacket and made his way to the nearest congregation. With tears in his eyes he continues to tell about how the Preacher and Deacon came over to his house the next day and told him about Christ and he became a believer. Although the Church may be a whore of a bride, that is still where many in our culture go when G-d lays His spirit upon them.Frank and George want us to close those buildings down for good. But to me that would mean turning my back on those who are sheep and victims of tradition. Sure, they do not know that their traditions are from a pagan background but I don't think that justifies leaving them in the dark fumbling for the light switch. My response to this book can be summed up with a quote from the famous rapper Ice-Q, \\"If you don't like the system, don't stand outside the gates shouting. Get an education, infiltrate the organization, and take it over.\\"Update:Upon even further studying I have learned that this book may be what is pagan. The ideas in presents and claims that it makes are in many ways misleading about much of the history. Check the sources the authors give and you may come to very different conclusions then they did. Do not be so quick to cheer on a book that casts off the authorities God has put around us for protection."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"I traveled miles to buy the book because the title intrigues me.

It has played a big part of the continued work that God is doing in my life. Thanks to Frank Viola and George Barna I have been able to take back my rightful place in God's kingdom. Pagan Christianity is a concise book that takes the reader on a journey of discovery about the history of the traditions of Clergy/ Laity, Liturgy, church buildings and sacred items of worship. Frank Viola and George Barna show that these traditions of man are only expressions of an institution; instead of a Christ-led life being expressed organically in a believer. Also, they show that these traditions separate God from his people and prohibit every believer from functioning. They show that these traditions by their very nature never allow God's people to freely express themselves the way Christ intends. By the end of the book the reader is left with overwhelming evidence on the damaging traditions of man and a choice to make about how to proceed in Body Life with other Christians."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Hi All,This book is a most timely review of our \\"Christian\\" practices, which has caused me to re-evaluate the validity of continuing my education at Wesley Theological Seminary. It becomes painfully obvious looking at the history of Christianity that things had gone badly wrong. There are books that go into more technical detail about the origins of the Church as we know it today, but this book is a solid introduction to the evolution of the \\"Church.\\" The interesting thing is that in my classes these topics are touched upon but not really delved into in much depth, and consequently one doesn't make much of the discrepancies. However, Pagan Christianity is a helpful in pointing out to the reader the essential questions that need to be addressed, which can get lost in the fog of academic and theological discussions.Pagan Christianity has had such an impact on me, so much so, that I am considering withdrawing from seminary. Of course, for everyone else, whether in a seminary or not, they will have to make a personal decision as to whether to make ministry a profession or not.Pagan Christianity should be read with Reimainging Church because the former is more of a deconstructive argument while the latter is a reconstructive argument for how Church should be. So I would read both books to get the general gist of what the authors are saying. To be sure, it is nothing new, and several theologians and scholars have been saying what Frank Viola and George Barna state, except with Pagan Christianity it is more accessible and less technical.For instance, \\"The Church: The Evolution of Catholicism\\" written by Richard P. McBrien, illustrates how the Church became what it is through a complex series of changes.This book is a must for those who are serious about Christianity's origins, and those who are willing to critically examine their current practices and traditions.Heartily recommended and may you be liberated and blessed by this book.Yuri"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"I downoaded this book to my Sony eReader a few weeks ago, and I'm so glad I did! This is a great, easy to read compilation of how we (the church) got to where we are these days. The fundamental point that I got from reading is this: Church is WHO WE ARE, not a place we go or a thing we do. This book is eye opening and revolutionary because it confronts so many of the traditions many believers take part in on a weekly basis. I, like many of you, grew up \\"going to church\\" and never even thought to ask why is it that we all do things almost the same way, despite denomination or whether we're protestant or Catholic.

I hope that those reading will fall into the first two categories because there is a whole world of glorious church life and freedom that exists when we look more deeply at what we believe and why we believe it. This is not my favorite Viola book, but it is a good one. (My absolute favorite is From Eternity to Here!). PAGAN CHRISTIANITY helps pave the way to understand why so many of us don't experience all the beauty and wonder that is meant for us to experience in the church. Go ahead and purchase a copy of Frank Viola's REIMAGINING CHURCH when you purchase this one; you'll be glad you did. It will be very encouraging and provide a way out of the bondage of empty religious practices and point the way to a refreshing and life-giving church experience. It will help you understand and process what you read in Pagan Christianity."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"I greatly appreciated this book. It clearly explained how many of the traditions of the institutional church are rooted in pagan traditions. And it encourages Christians to be more honest about what the Bible actually teaches verses all the trappings of religion that we have added on over the years since the first believers began to meet together to worship Jesus Christ. It encourages the reader to ask if these things that have been added on are interfering with the clear message of the Gospel. Are you convinced that your church traditions are absolutely Biblical? It is not a book for cowards. Read it if you dare."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"All the good things I could say about this book have already been said so sincerely by folks who also awarded high ratings to the efforts of Viola and Barna. I understand the point of view of the detractors, but I understand their criticism as a clear illustration that they failed to received the message. In missing the whole point of the book, they write negative reviews in order to justify and continue in the same traditions the book seeks to illuminate. If you love Jesus Christ, you truly owe it to yourself to read this book prayerfully. And more, you owe it to your brothers and sisters in Christ. All of us need to re-examine our image of \\"church\\" and try to see THE CHURCH as God sees it so that we can BE the church. Therefore, I would go so far as to say you CANNOT read this book by itself and even come close to seeing it as God sees it. You must also make a commitment to read Reimagining Church and From Eternity to Here (both by Frank Viola). If you can read these three books without having a profound change in your view of the church and falling more deeply in love with the Person of Jesus, one of two things is clear. Either you don't really know Him yet, or you have already had that profound change in your view of the church. I offer my opinion with love for the church and even greater appreciation for what He has done for us."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Viola and Barna do a fantastic job deconstructing the history, origin and motivation for many common church practices. They break the book up by topic, which allows for easy topical sharing, and then dissect each one. Their tone is historical, objective and does not feel condescending towards modern church institutions. Instead, it is simply an informative look at many practices that Christians take for granted.I'd highly recommend \\"Reimagining Church\\" by Frank Viola as a follow up to this book since \\"Pagan Christianity\\" deconstructs the practices of the church while \\"Reimagining\\" goes back to the church practices that are actually seen in Scripture.Reimagining Church: Pursuing the Dream of Organic Christianity"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Awesome book.

The new edition is an enhancement to what was already an eye-opening account. Church practices, in their modern day form, are very rarely questioned on such a fundamental level. I often hear a call for \\"church reform\\" or \\"revival\\" to the church, but I had never before heard this kind of bold call for change; change from the very roots of the traditions of men that have its leaders calling for \\"reform\\" in the first place. This edition features new footnotes and expanded commentary that leaves very few questions with the reader. If people are open and willing to see the true purpose of the Church from Christ's perspective, this book will be a welcomed relief from all they have been taught to believe the church is."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Someone at church mentioned Pagan Christianity and how it had profoundly affected his life, so I was prompted to get this book. I had high expectations. Being raised Catholic, I had always questioned why certain rituals and traditions existed, e.g., incense, women wearing chapel veils, having to remain silent during the mass, etc. In my adulthood, I moved to a wonderful small Episcopalian (now Anglican) church that showed me what a church family was. Our services were not done by rote or habit; there was deep and meaningful worship there. Over time, I left that church and joined a very small non-denominational church and although it's different from my Episcopal church, the worship there is also powerful and not steeped in ritual. Yes we have a sermon, but it's more like a one-way conversation from the heart and steeped in Scripture - not something typewritten and read to the audience. Yes, we sing, but so did David. What's wrong with that?So even though the authors make a strong case about how so many of our church traditions and rituals are not Biblical, or even \\"pagan,\\" I must admit I personally was not moved.However, I believe there are many, many people attending \\"dead\\" churches who would benefit from reading this book. It may help them realize why they don't want to go to the church they are currently attending, or why they feel something is missing in their relationship with the Lord.

However, if you are like a growing number of people who experience the normal way church is done and scratch your head, then you have to read this book. Do you ever wonder why things are done the way they are? Do you wonder why things don't seem to line up with some of the scriptures you come across? This book pulls the cover away to show where these \\"normal\\" church practices came from.

I have to say that I have not ever come across a more succint or reader-friendly account of church history and practice. As Christians it's very good to know WHY we do what we do. Those who are new to Christinity and who didn't grow up in church culture are often puzzled at our customs and Viola is right in that many of our traditions have absolutely no root in scripture. Viola has really sparked my interest in the house church, and it certainly appears that the house church might reflect the true spirit of how church meetings were meant to take place.What I didn't appreciate was the cynical tone that Viola takes throughout the entire book. He basically asserts that any pastor who reads the book has two choices: to either quit the pastorate or to live and work in hypocrisy. His attitude towards the institutional \\"church\\" we have today is that there is no redeeming value to it and therefore God can't use it at all towards His purpose. I am not disagreeing with the assertion that our current way of doing \\"church\\" can be and often is detrimental to Christians. But I really didn't appreciate Viola's assertions that we as Christians need to start from square one with house churches or else we aren't \\"true Christians\\".If you want a very well researched, well cited history of the evolution of the church, then this is the book for you.

It's a \\"bash the church\\" book (lowercase \\"c\\"). The authors' goal is to redirect Christians back to the original teachings of the New Testament, where the \\"Church\\" was never a building.\\"Pagan,\\" as used by the authors, pretty much just means \\"different from what the New Testament teaches.\\" Their goal is to encourage Christians to embrace the original New Testament church.Church buildings are wrong. Sacraments are wrong. Collection plates are wrong. Pulpits are wrong. You'll get a earful, and if \\"wrong\\" means \\"not the way it was first done,\\" then the authors have a well-researched point. But an important distinction needs to be made: The New Testament church, in this book, should not be confused with the \\"first century church.\\" No extraneous Christian teachings are acceptable to Viola and Barna, who either ignore or condemn them. Even if some of these teachings are contemporary with New Testament writings. For example, church fathers Ignatius, Clement of Rome and Tertullian are criticized for introducing a clergy, and the Didache's instructions are never mentioned by the authors, who insist that early Christian worship sessions had no structure. Perhaps the authors subscribe to the view that all of the New Testament Gospels and epistles were written in Paul's time.Part of the intrigue of this book, for me, is that I grew up in a nondenominational church similar to what the authors approve of as \\"organic,\\" and that ignores all Christian instruction outside the Bible. This church has a bit more structure to their worship than what Viola and Barna recommend, but it does meet in homes and all members participate equally in the service. It's a \\"back to Jesus\\" movement patterned after the New Testament.So, my church background may qualify me more than many reviewers to address both the pros and cons of the book's arguments. And as such, I do have one criticism, which drops it from a 5-star to a 4-star rating: The passion of the authors overflows, which should be a good thing, but here it's overwhelming. While they convincingly show that many Christian church customs differ from the first Christians, their underlying assumption that this is somehow bad gets pushed a little too hard for my taste, simply because in my experience, different church atmospheres and practices are appropriate for different people.

As humans we want a plan or form to follow, and there is no shortage of well-meaning Christian conferences and literature to feed that desire. I too have labored along those lines - working to turn churches into little Willow Creeks, Saddlebacks, and later into house churches after attending a conference or reading a book. We want someone to tell us what to do and how to do it. However, what Barna and Viola have supplied is not a 12 step plan to a biblical church. Rather, it's an expos&eacute; of how what we've been doing for centuries has missed the heart of what God intended. Paul wrote, \\"We are to grow up in all aspects into Him who is the Head, even Christ, from whom the whole body, being fitted and held together by what every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each individual part, causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love.\\" If what we've been doing in churches was biblical then it would obviously have the ability to produce what the Holy Spirit communicated through Paul and there would be no reason to abandon it. We would instead continue to tweak our services, sermons, and programs to produce the result God wanted. However, Barna and Viola are showing us that what we have been doing is not biblical, but rather pagan in origin, and that it can not produce the fullness of what God intended, no matter how it's tweaked. In fact, it hinders what He intended - a royal priesthood. A wise man taught me that relationship should drive structure, not the reverse. We've tried to force structures and organizations handed down to us through the centuries to drive depth of relationship with Christ, our brothers and sisters, and the world for way too long. It's time to capture the heart of what God intended and let relationship with Him and His church drive how we gather rather than the reverse. I believe that's what Barna and Viola are saying without prescribing, and I applaud them for doing it and encourage any Christian to read this book with an open mind."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"We've all heard Christian leaders proclaim, \\"At our church, we only do what the Bible says.\\" The irony is that they say it from pulpits that themselves find no basis in the Bible and in church buildings that have more to do with pagan cultures of the past than biblical roots.If you really begin to examine many of the key elements of the Christian faith as we practice it, you'll find little or no biblical basis for them.

The research is thorough, and the inquiry is honest. The reviewer concludes, \\"I know how hard this read will be for many people, especially clergy members.

Ignoring this obvious fact, Viola and Barna seem to characterize Jesus as a Cosmic Christ who \\"floated down from heaven\\" in order to repudiate Jewish religion and establish an ahistorical entity (mistakenly called the \\"ekklesia\\") that transcends all forms of authority (other than the nebulous idea of being submitted to the \\"Headship of Christ\\").When discussing the \\"Lord's Supper,\\" for example, the authors seem oblivious of the connection with the Passover Seder of Jesus and His disciples. Constant references to the \\"first century church\\" or the \\"early church\\" reveals a profound lack of understanding of the inherent Jewishness of the gospel of Jesus -- the \\"King of the Jews.\\"The book is tendentious in that the authors, in a way not unlike various Christian cults, propose relinquishing most church tradition and dogma, and in its place find access to the true faith in their (distinctly postmodern) model. Their iconoclasm is meant to sell you the sequels to the book -- how to grow your own \\"certified organic assembly\\" that is free of the pratfalls of the \\"Church.\\"Very little charity toward the historical Church is found in this book (which reads a bit like a college research project, replete with tiny-print footnotes). No church tradition -- from singing hymns to hearing a sermon -- is immune from criticism; no acknowledgement is given to the work and influence of the Church over the last two millennia. No - Viola and Barna are the postmodern \\"answer men\\" who are here to reinvent innumerable saints -- many of whom were martyred for their convictions -- as (unwitting) victims of paganism who need to get back to the \\"real gospel\\" message, etc. etc.Though it's fun to read (much like the \\"Devil's Dictionary\\" by Ambrose Bierce), it is simply not a serious work of scholarship.

The basis for his declaration that our format is based on pagan and secular practices is well-documented, with quotes from various leaders over the centuries and Mr. Viola follows the development from a Spirit-led fellowship of equality in Christ through Catholicism's superiority complex and down to the split that still interferes with every denomination that uses a pastor, altar, podium, and even worship team.While I don't necessarily agree with (or maybe I just don't follow!) all of his reasoning, the picture that a reader comes away with exposes how little we have really changed from the Roman Catholic structure and what Mr. Viola thinks would be the framework for a church which is truly a living organism.I don't remember any inappropriate portions of this book, but it would not be easy for young children to understand without guidance. While it is not the Bible, it is certainly illuminating."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"This book is fantastic. It is the most thought provoking volume I've ever read. I recommend it to everyone who is interested in how church came to be what it is today."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"If you have never read any of Frank's work the first thing you will need to do is do an honest gut check to make sure you are open to the slaying of your sacred cows. As usual, his work is well researched and hard hitting. I have no doubt a lot of leaders will feel compelled to discredit this work out of self-preservation if nothing else. Pagan Christianity calls a lot of stuff out into the street...just about everything to do with current church culture in fact. Viola and Barna give language to a lot of what I suppose many leaders and others have felt forbidden to question...though deep in their hearts they have longed someone to bring to the surface. Read it and let it read you."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"The concept put forth by the authors in this book is interesting and it seems, at first glance, to be some wildly innovative and revolutionary concept. I read the book at the behest of a friend and trusted brother who asked me, specifically, to read it and test the spirit, so to speak.I did so. I read the whole book. I listened to the argument. I weighed it against the scripture. It comes up remarkably short.Viola and Barna quote scripture, quote sources, cite historical documents and rail against institutional church practices. The problem, as another reviewer stated, is that much of their declarations are descriptive, not prescriptive. And further that they call for applications that they themselves decry.For example, they cite 1 Corinthians as the absolute model for home church structure and that that is the only true model for church structure. It is, in fact, stated that any other church model has no basis or historical right to exist. The problem being that the moment one begins to say that only one form of church works and that all others are, in essence, heretical, then you are just as religious and legalistic as a person who defines church by any form. This would include church dress codes, whether staunch and traditional or modern and untraditional. Further, saying that God only honors the absolute practice of one style is saying that there is some action, some 'work' that God works through and no others. That is harmfully legalistic at best and works based righteousness at worst.And now for the footnoting. Seriously? Footnoting other books you have written? Yeah, I have a feeling I tend to agree with myself most of the time. Footnoting other books that tend to agree with my perspective and point of view while ignoring any that disagree? That's Jr. High Debate League right there.And finally, I would ask that anyone reading the book examine it backwards. Typically, any author or pundit will attempt to lead out with their strongest most generally accepted point first. This is to gain the largest support for the other finer and more disagreeable points. Viola does exactly that. By beginning with an attack on large opulent church facilities (a point most of us can get behind in disliking) and then ending with a point that no one really knows how to read the bible, especially the Pauline epistles (a point most Christians might contend) the author essentially makes his weakest argument last. And when it comes right down to it, the author is essentially doing what the majority of his critics do: pointing fingers and arguing that you don't know history or the bible.I have been involved in institutional and home churches. Neither Viola nor Barna answer some of the serious and grievous issues related to that model. In fact, they seem to believe that aside from the occasional nut-job, it's the only perfect model in existence. I can speak from experience that that is not the case.Further, he argues against a hierarchal leadership model in the church, specifically, because only two churches in the New Testament had elders. Except that he argues for the 1 Corinthian church model even though that model is only given to one church in the New Testament. Arguing against an eldership is a dangerous concept no matter how you dress it up. Granted, certain issues and things that the church has painted eldership with have been extrabiblical or, in fact, heretical, the point remains that elders are an integral part of any church even if they are called pastors or preachers or what have you.I think the book is, as I titled this, compelling, but ultimately the book is wrong. It defeats itself, it defeats its purpose and, to be perfectly frank and honest, it twists the scripture to its own destruction. I believe that Viola and, for whatever role he played, Barna are both 'wolves' in the biblical sense, religious legalists and, to be blunt, heretics.UPDATE: See this site for a biblical critique and review that shames mine: [...]"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Perfect harmony.

It really made a difference in how I see 'church'."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"After recently graduating with my BS in Religion... this book is perhaps one of the most refreshing books I've read in recent years about church history!! Pg. 7 says \\"...Christians outside the pale of institutional Christianity will discover afresh that not only is Scripture on your side - but history stands with you as well.\\" Further Barna and Viola make some statements that one simply won't find in many of today's religious books....Pg. 5 refers to the rebellious hearts amongst our brethren that seek to divide us by wreaking havoc about how we \\"do\\" church. Barna and Viola state; \\"We do not stand with you. Our advice; Either leave your church quietly, refusing to cause division, or be at peace with it. There is a vast gulf between rebellion and taking a stand for what is true.\\"The entire chapter on Baptism and the Lord's Supper is spot on with Scripture!! On pg. 189, \\"Unbelievers are told, Say this prayer after me, accept Jesus as your personal Savior, and you will be saved. But nowhere in all the New Testament do we find any person being led to the Lord by a Sinner's Prayer.\\" Further, on pg. 191, referring to the Sinner's Prayer, \\"There is nothing particularly wrong with it, God will respond to the heartfelt prayers of any individual who reaches out to Him in faith. However, it should not replace water baptism as the outward instrument for conversion.\\"Pg. 78 makes clear that New Testament musical worship was \\"A Cappella.\\" Ironically, the authors don't even belabor the issue of instruments... almost as if to say, the scripture is so clear on this point that it shouldn't even be a point of contention.Overall, an excellent book that will surely challenge one's thinking when it comes to the where's, how's, and why's of how humans practice Scriptural Christianity. While I'm not sure that \\"home-church\\" is the end-all answer for the Metropolitan areas of the world... the organic, home-church is certainly the very best way to grow Christians in any environment!!"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"To some extent, I wasn't sure what I would be letting myself in for when I opened this book. I had read some negative reviews on it before buying it, which prompted me to want to read it for myself and form my own opinion.Viola and Barna take us on an interesting and often embarrassing journey through the history of the institutional church, and do a good job of explaining how we ended up where we are and why we do the things we do in the modern \\"church\\". They also do a decent job of explaining why a lot of what we do is not biblical, and why that has a tendency to be harmful to body life and spiritual growth.Ironically, our pastor has been preaching for years on how we have allowed the world to infiltrate the church, all the while continuing to practice many of the things (including the specific forms of preaching) the authors point out as unbiblical. I wonder if he truly realizes the extent of the truth he has spoken...How you receive the message of this book is going to depend a lot on who you are and how willing you are to change your perceptions and preconceived notions of what church is vs. what it should be.Some have criticized this book as a commercial for house churches, but that wasn't the impression I got at all.No matter what you end up doing with the information in this book, I think it's worth knowing where our church systems and practices come from, and why they aren't biblical."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"The book is a very interesting read and seems well documented. It reveals the \\"origins\\" of today's Christian Church and its practices. I appreciated the candor the author's presented explaining the origins and found the positions and evidence very compelling ane enlightening as to how many Christian traditions emerged through the centuries. It is definitely a \\"good read\\" in documenting how Christian practice emerged through the centuries.But one question that kept being raised in my mind while reading the book is this: \\"So What Difference Does It Make?\\" Does it really matter if Christianity was influenced by \\"pagan\\" culture and practice? Any missiologist will tell you that this type of phenomenon is normative and that assimulation of . Is it therefore possible that God can use any means to get His \\"Good News\\" out? Can God use the Magi (pagans) to tell of Christ's birth (Matthew 2)? Can God use Cornelius the Roman (converted pagans) to reveal to Peter that God has opened up the Good News to cultures far beyond what would be considered \\"kosher\\" by the largely Jewish Christian community (Acts 10)? I question whether or not the material and positions of \\"Pagan Christianity\\" stems from an unbiased perspective or if it is a revisionist historical perspective from those who hold a Reconstructionist Theological world-view?Certainly Western Christianity is in the midst of a tremendous shift as modernism gives way to postmodernist world-views. In many ways our world is increasingly more \\"pagan\\" in influence and we, in many regards, are becoming like the early Roman world with its tremendous diversity and variability in belief systems. Perhaps we can \\"learn\\" from the early church as to how to address a pagan world - to speak their language and to proclaim the Good News of Jesus Christ in a way that is understood and articulated. Maybe we need to understand \\"neo-pagan - post-Christian\\" worldviews in order to get God's message of salvation through Jesus Christ to our world in rapid transition."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"This book is based on half truths and subtle misleading opinions. This book contains many historical facts. However these facts are used with emotional opinions to leap to unrelated conclusions. The book suggests that because we do not do things as done in the first century church, we are not \\"doing church right\\". This book does not allow the church to be affective in the culture in which it is in. This book replaces one \\"system\\" of church with another, the home church. The \\"home\\" church is not proven to be more authentic or better. Because we do things different in the years following the first century, the author assumes it must be influenced by paganism. Perhaps Frank Viola should not use Twitter, Facebook, a blog or the internet then. To follow his arguments, \\"guns kill people, not people\\". He finds fault in everything that is church related and assumes that people are not seeking Christ or being spiritual in all of their church doings. The worst part is, that he takes scripture out of context and ignores other scripture all together. Be careful reading this book.

There was some evidence to support this belief: Apple, Microsoft, SUN Microsystems. My company decided if they could find a way to return to that start-up mentality, they, too would become innovative.The real problem with my company wasn't that they lacked creativity, but that they were out of touch with their customers. They often produced products with innovative features their customers didn't need, at a price they often couldn't afford. And so my company, like much of American industry, began buying up start-up companies, and because they'd forgotten how to manage a start-up company, ultimately drove them out of business.I couldn't help seeing this same mindset as I read \\"Pagan Christianity?\\" Much as I appreciate the courage of Frank Viola and George Barna--whose research I've long respected--to openly confront the problems in American churches, I get the feeling that, like my computer company, they're dealing with the symptoms rather than the root of the problem.Like start-up companies, house churches are a cultural necessity that never really went away. They existed relatively recently in Communist countries and still exist in nations where Christians are persecuted for the open expression of their faith. During the Protestant Reformation, there was a proliferation of itinerant ministers who were often accused by Catholics of being heretics.What happened in 327 AD is that, with Constantine's legalization of Christianity in the Roman Empire, Christians no longer had to hide, just as Christians no longer need to hide in Russia and never have needed to hide in America. But this doesn't mean the house church was God's plan for Christianity.I've never had any particular regard for church hierarchy. Christ told his disciples not to let anyone call them rabbi. When we see priests withholding communion from congregants who voted for John Kerry, it's clear church leaders are overstepping an authority Christ never conferred upon them.But though the book addresses a lot of my gripes about feeling I'm a passive observer in what's become little more than a family entertainment and self-help program, this isn't the reason I stopped attending my church. As I listened to sermons week after week it became clear that, either directly or through inference, the god that was being preached in my church was utterly devoid of love. God was at best indifferent, at worst sadistic.I left my church, not because its practices were pagan, but because I was sick of wasting my Sunday mornings worshipping an awful god. As a former charismatic, accustomed to \\"testing the spirits,\\" my biggest frustration in church was that it was inappropriate for me as an evangelical, let alone as a woman, to stand up in my church and say, \\"Jesus has left the building. I just don't sense his presence here today.\\"My question is whether having smaller fellowships with less hierarchy will fix this problem, or simply redistribute it.At the same time I left my church I left a women's Bible study whose concept of God was just as awful, if not worse. Because these women judged my criticism as evidence I was \\"a woman with a past,\\" it was every bit as intimidating to express my thoughts in this small group as it was in church. Unless you address people's negative concepts of God, as Jesus did in his Sermon on the Mount, and as Martin Luther did during the Protestant Reformation, you're still going to have problems, albeit on a more distributed scale.Just as most start-up companies fail, a significant number of first century fellowships also went astray. Some of these groups were so awful that Paul advised Timothy in his final letter to have nothing to do with them. I'd be open to trying a fellowship like what Viola describes here, but at this point I'm afraid to try any Christian fellowship.Still, it made my week just knowing someone else thinks there's a problem, even if we don't happen to agree what that problem is."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"This one will go down as historical and will change the future of Christendom.

I came away from this book with a profound sense that God is trying to get the Church's attention and is calling us to really think outside the box of the past in order to be effective in our communities and useful to Him.It is sure to be just the beginning of a welcome, long conversation among Christians everywhere.

This is a very narrow look at how the modern church strayed from it's organic roots and adopted practices such as: buildings, alters, vestments, and a professional priest/preacher class from earlier non-christian cultures. It is not much more than an argument for returning to these aforementioned organic roots.

I was looking forward to reading about the origins of many of our sacred cow practices, and hearing some suggestions about how we could start shifting away from doing things because we've always done them to doing them for the sake of honoring Christ. I was already well aware of the fact that much of what we do on a Sunday morning is a result of cultural historical developments of the last two thousand years.I was incredibly disappointed to discover that (from the first 80 pages, anyway), the authors are much more interested in presenting their own version of what church should look like than in actually helping the church be more Christ honoring. That's harsh - I am sure that they have the best intentions and firmly believe that the model they present IS the way the church is to become more Christ honoring. But I also know many faithful Christ-followers who would not be able to honor Christ at all in a gathering of the body like they describe on pages 78-79. Perhaps that is an excuse. It is also a fact.But what really got me was when I started comparing the passages of Scripture held up to as the model of what the church is supposed to be like with the model service described on those two pages. It is apparent from just the first 80 pages that the model of church idolized by the authors is that presented in 1 Corinthians 14, particularly starting in verse 26. That is great; I would love to experience a worship service built around that. My problem is that it is presented (again, at least through chapter 3) as THE Model (capital M) that every gathering of Christians should aspire to. Verses 26-33 are sacrosanct and to be followed to the letter. But I don't understand how they break the model off so cleanly - and without explanation - before the infamous verse 34 when women are forbidden to speak in church. In the sample gathering on pages 78-79, one of the first exhortations or testimonies is from a woman. I don't understand why verse 34 is culturally limited to the situation that Paul was addressing in Corinth while verses 26-33 can be held to be the model to which all Christians must bend their worship together.So I have stopped reading the book.I intend to keep the book on my shelf and look to it for how various elements of modern church came to be. As others have said, the book is highly documented in that regard.I was begging while reading chapter 2 (on the church building) for some suggestion of what the church could look like. However, I never bargained that my desire for a possible vision of the church would be handed down as an ultimatum.I think this book has its best value in showing how our modern traditions came to be, empowering the church to be able to adjust as needed to the best benefit of the community rather than believing that we have to have a church building with padded pews or we can't be a church. Where the authors seeks to offer a model, however, I would be wary of what they say."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"I can honestly review the book since I have read it from cover to cover. When I began the book there was much interest on my part yet still a nagging caution that both Viola and Barna had gone over the deep end. But I was soon pleasantly surprised when into the first chapter.What struck me right away is the amount of documentation and research Frank did in putting together this book. It is not his opinion, but based upon fact of the history of the church, which, unfortunately, is based upon man's idea of church and not Christ's. He has done a great job of backing up most, if not all, that he has written.

In this balance we see the arguments of music style, preaching methodology, inclusion and exclusion of certain individuals from worship, as well as the seeker friendly church. The authors rather than attempt to balance these issues dismiss the recent traditions of the church as wrong by deconstructing them revealing their origins.The historical development of the traditions of the local church have always intrigued me. Not so much as to their Biblicism rather as to understand the response of the church to culture. The authors, to their credit, deconstruct the traditions of the Protestant and Catholic churches to help the reader understand what they deem as the true Biblical understanding of Church.Unsurprisingly, the authors believe that the local church must be a small gathering of believers in a home with communal leadership and an Amish worship style of communal participated promptings lead by the Holy Spirit.

Honestly, this book is hard to swallow for those of us who were indoctrinated in church practice from a young age. Pagan Christianity quite deftly pulls the rug out from under nearly every aspect of the way we do church.Think of a practice your church follows: the way we do worship, the church building, the clergy, communion, tithes and offerings. For these and more, Viola and Barna present a solid historical and Biblical argument against how they are being carried out in the modern church.For me, it was a bit like I'd always known there were pieces missing to the puzzle, but I wasn't sure what. This book fills in a lot of holes.But as many questions as it answers, it creates so many more. As my husband said, \\"But now what do we do with this information?

He seems to imply that Jesus is looking down from heaven at his wits end with all these church people and what they have done to his movement. Nothing could be further from the truth. Christ is sovereign in all things and he is not taken by surprise at our utter stupidity.Is Christ leading his church more to the form that Frank advocates? Probably, but it will not come from human hands but from the Spirit. Institutional church, in my opinion is failing not because of its form but because it acknowledges Christ with its lips but denies his power, and his Word. Frank's book is worth reading but God's book is of far surpassing worth. Drink deep from his well then maybe you won't need to read Franks."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"This is one of those books crammed with facts that may not change anyone's mind about how they practice making a life in the way of Jesus. In my case, it was a convincing argument about how bad things are and why they will not change as long as the vast majority of branches remain too distanced from the vine to get the nourishment they need. I cannot go back to warming a pew and faking it. So if you are enrolled at Dallas Theological Seminary, and expect to make a good living providing pastoring to a flock... good luck! I think the classic church is dying and will continue to become increasingly irrelevant."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"I'm in the process of reading this book still but I thought I would share my overall opinion of it so far. It seems one can actually review a book WITHOUT reading it, so I see no harm in reviewing it while only being partially through it. I LOVE this book. Being only in my 20s, I have been a lifelong attendee of an institutional church and then later I went to bible college a few years ago. Even though I have been raised in the church, something has always been lacking for me and I've had questions that I felt too scared to voice. But thankfully, this book has shed some light for me on some of the ideas that were lingering in my head.I think it's so interesting that some would criticize this book while not reading it. It confirms its necessity though because by in large, the institutional church is afraid to question its own practices. I come from a Pentecostal background and I bring this up because for several decades the Pentecostal movement was widely thought of as having church services that were very lively and \\"spirit-filled.\\" Sadly, even these type of churches house bored souls week after week today. As I sit in my comfortable pew every Sunday it becomes so obvious that what the institutional church is doing is just not working. People are sleeping, texting, eating food, balancing their checkbook, doodling, filing their nails, etc. I have seen it all. But people are not engaging with God while being in church, and I believe much of the reason for this lies in what PG discusses.As for the book's agenda, perhaps I'm just dumb but I don't think it's painfully obvious as some others have pointed out. Sure, the author shares his idea on a solution but wouldn't we accuse him of not doing that if he hadn't chose to offer at least one? So what if he picked the one that he has personally experienced and knows it can work well as a model for being the church? As much as I like the idea of a home church, I do not have any plans to leave my institutional church right now, so it IS possible to read this book and not be \\"brain-washed\\" into hating the IC as some people seem to think. The IC is not bringing in many new converts, it's losing old ones, and the ones who stick around do it because they're loyal enough to do what they've always been taught to do. But for many, outside of Sunday church services, their lives are nothing like what God envisions for His people. They go home and watch tv all night, they refuse to help their neighbors or family, and they exclusively rely on church outreaches or events as a way to evangelize. We are just severely ill-equipped to BE God's community and extend ourselves to the lost. Maybe that's because we're still just as lost too.I recently asked my mother who has been a christian for 40+ years to read this book and she simply won't. I asked her why and she said \\"My grandmother was a wonderful God-fearing woman and she taught me everything I know about my faith and I will never question anything she ever taught me.\\" Her answer scares me but I think it's so representative of many of this book's critics. People have learned their faith by it being passed down to them and have no desire to make sure that it actually lines up with the Word of God. Yet, they're so bored with God and do very little that He commands.After talking to my mom, I couldn't help but think to myself,\\"She would have been one crying 'Crucify Him!'\\" I encourage everyone to read this book. It is filled with biblical and historical facts to support its claims and it leaves room for the reader to discern what to personally do with the information.Thanks to the writer for taking the courageous leap to write this book. It is certainly controversial, but then again, so was our Savior."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Look at all the other reviews.

Yet what Frank Viola had to say in its pages put the last nail in the proverbial coffin for some of my views on what church should be or look like. If I had been in a different place in my Christian journey, it might have been devastating, or even deeply insulting. I might have been tempted to throw the book out of the window. As a result, I completely understand those who have decried the book here on Amazon or elsewhere.Yet before you judge it prematurely, remember that \\"Pagan Christianity\\" is merely the first half of a conversation, the deconstruction, if you will, before the building up. That latter role is filled by Viola's follow-up bookReimagining Church: Pursuing the Dream of Organic ChristianityAll in all, knowing that such a volume exists enables me to recommend \\"Pagan Christianity\\" that much higher. Without it, \\"Pagan Christianity\\" is a little like a doctor who diagnoses a disease but then never prescribes anything to cure his patient.I'm thrilled to be alive in a time when the Church is undergoing such monumental changes and challenges, and I'm confident that many of the called-out ones of Christ will emerge out the other side purer and truer to the principles of the Kingdom than they have been in many centuries. I'm not a proponent of tearing down just for the sake of tearing down, but deconstructing in order to build. I'm confident that Viola is, too, and his watershed book is well-worth reading for that reason."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Some of the negative reviews of this book are way too dismissive. People are offended that the authors seem to reject all models of church other than their own house church approach. But that's over-simplified.The book does suffer loss of credibility, not because of its main argument--that many modern church structures and practices do not come from the Bible--but because 1)the authors over-reach, trying to prove more than the evidence supports, and 2)the model they suggest in place of the traditional church often seems to be no closer to the New Testament than the one they oppose.For instance, they think the early church didn't practice preaching (except by traveling church planters of for special occasions), a proposition that ignores or twists vast amounts of New Testament scripture. They deny that elders were ever paid in the NT church, and that anyone who accepted pay would be taking from the church rather than giving to the church, including one of the most tortured interpretations of 1Tim. 5:17ff I've ever seen. They advance a model of leaderless meeting as the only the Holy Spirit can lead the church rather than humans. But actual teaching of the New Testament is that the Holy Spirit leads through humans, not instead of them. I fully critiqued the book on my blog at authenticmeansreal.blogspot.comI still think the book is worth reading just for the stimulation value.

I thought surely something must be wrong with me because of how much I dreaded going to church every week - yet I pushed myself to be &#34;obedient&#34; and do my duty to go.Then the questions began. Why do we do this? Why does church have the same order of service no matter where you go - and who said it's supposed to be this way? Why do pastors talk about equipping believers for the work of the ministry, yet the structure of the institution is stacked to work against that ever happening, no matter how noble the intent? Why do we pump so much money into buildings and programs? Why do we all stand and sing 3 songs - and why do a couple of people decide what songs those will be? Why do we spend an hour listening to just one person's perspective on the scriptures? Why do we have communion consisting of a thimble of grape juice and a round styrofoam wafer? Why do we sit and look at the backs of people's heads and walk out the door after exchanging a brief hug and pleasantries yet never really get to know anyone?Pagan Christianity? Exploring the Roots of Our Church Practices answers all of these questions and more. It validated my restless spirit's cry for more and opened the door for a better, more authentic, more biblical way of exploring my faith, deepening my relationships with other believers and a process of discovery of what it means to &#34;be the church&#34; rather than to simply &#34;go to church&#34;.I highly recommend this book to anyone seeking an alternative to the institution."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"For several yars I have been interested to learn more of how the early Christian church worshipped.

Just think, if Viola and Barna are generally correct in their understanding of this issue, what are the implications? What natural inferences would you draw? This changes the way we think about everything Christianity! Truly amazing!Now, having said that, Viola and Barna seem to be inconsistent and even subjective in their applications of their historical reconstruction. For instance, they claim at the very beginning of the book that they do not adhere to \\"the silence of Scripture\\" principle (xxxi), yet this principle is the very foundation of their argument throughout! The NT is silent on many of the practices that the \\"church\\" practices today, to which they respond, \\"Therefore we shouldn't be involved in or advocate such and such.\\" Then, when noting that the NT Church didn't use instruments for 300 to 400 years, they seem to brush it aside and say, \\"We'll, this is one NT practice we feel doesn't matter.\\" Hello McFly!I also take issue with their use of 1 Cor 12-14 as the prime example of how a \\"church\\" meeting should function. \\"Open-participatory\\" is one of their favorite sayings in the book, and they speak of it often in terms of empowerments of the Spirit, especially in regard to prophecy and revelation. But, what if the Spirit does not function in this way today? Prophecy and revelation were miracles in the NT Church, the likes of which ceased to exist when the NT was completed. No where does Viola and Barna deal with 1 Cor 13:8-12. If the miracles of prophecy and revelation do not occur today, one will have a hard time living out the example set forth in 1 Cor 12 and 14. By what standard, then, would a meeting function by?And third, Viola and Barna never deal with the issue of women's roles in the Church. What do they make of 1 Tim 2:8-15? Or 1 Cor 14:33b-35? Two things about this latter passage: (1) It is a part of their favorite section of Scripture for proving \\"open-participatory meetings,\\" yet they seem to overlook it as being irrelevant based on examples of house church meetings they have been a part of, which is crazy because (2) Paul specifically says this is a normative principle for \\"all churches.\\" Even if one were to argue, We'll that was just he culture then, the point is moot because Viola and Barna want the Church to function today as it did then. Add to this the fact that when Paul wrote 1 Tim 2:8-15, the context of his admonition is the pagan influence of the role of women at the temple of Artemis. These women, under pagan sway, wanted to lead the Church in Ephesus, but Paul responded in much the same way Viola and Barna argue throughout the book, that is, avoid those things that have pagan influence on the Church. Yet Viola and Barna never talk about this! Why?!I gave the book four stars because I liked the overall flow and argument of the book, but if the above three issues are true, they need to reevaluate their position (which is not to say that institutionalism is therefore right). For it may be the case that the Church today cannot function like it did then, primarily because the Spirit plays a different role now and the Bible itself is the standard by which all is measured."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"I'm reading this book each morning with my devotions, and I am not dissapointed.

We are all facing the same problems as we deal with tradition and I was a bit disturbed by the book because I grasped a picture of hopelessness to work within what has come to be in all of our denominations. In every denomination, I see family having developed and we don't want to \\"shut down\\" all of our tradition for the sake of becoming an \\"organic church.\\" It may work for some, but I sincerely feel our goal in every denomination should be to address our tradition as tradition and be accepting of the work of God in every life.

Maybe a little angry and accuse me of heresy. Maybe you would laugh and say I was ignorant. But these are exactly the things brought out in the book Pagan Christianity by Frank Viola and George Barna. We are taken back through history and proven where every thing we practice in church today originated. It is shocking and more than a little disheartening to see how far the church has strayed from where Jesus started it.A few years ago, I began my own journey to find in God's Word just why I was so dissatisfied with the church as I knew it, and that I had been raised in all my life. I just felt that something was lacking, and that there had to be more than just going to a building every week and performing the same rituals over and over and not feeling any different. When I saw this book I was immediately interested in what the authors had to say. Now that I am finished with the book, I am wondering what I am going to do with the information contained in it.

I was still on fire for God and had a passion for saving souls, but something about the church service just turned me off. Why did I have to sit in the pew and listen to a 30 min. sermon? Why can't I ask questions during the sermon? Why can't I lead a song of worship? Why do I have to get dressed up? Why is everything the same week after week?Then I found it. Finally a book that reveals where all the modern-day church practices came from, such as getting dressed up, weekly meetings, the sermon, the pastor, order of the services, etc. Not one of these was inspired by God! The authors explain in detail where each of these practices originated and how they were brought into the church. They also explain what church was like for the early Christians, they met in homes sporadically and did not have a leader. Instead the group was led by the Holy Spirit and every member participated. This was the way God intended his people to function.Sadly, churches today have turned into a corporate business. If you agree, this book is for you.

It is a scholarly work written in layman's terminology, which makes it a fascinating read. My problem with this edition was two-fold, however. First, the interesting footnotes laced throughout the book are in a tiny font which makes reading them somewhat tedious. Second, the authors do such a wonderful job of dismantling fundamentalist literal interpretation of the Bible--but then it becomes clear that the authors believe that \\"Adam's blunder\\" causing the \\"fall of man\\" (pg. 108) actually occurred. This is a major flaw in the Christian mindset. It denies evolution; it means that they believe that the authors of Genesis had some special insight into the creation of the world (implying that the different creation stories written before Genesis from different cultures are less valid); it also implies that people are born in a state of separation from God--which also means that the authors must believe that baptism (or at least the belief in Jesus) is the only way to have an authentic relationship with God (which is also insulting to the billions of non-Christians in this world); not to mention that this belief is what worried parents enough to push the Church into baptizing infants--we don't want our babies going to hell...since they are born separated from God.

I would argue that the top-down hierarchy and pastor-laity system has been the #1 defining factor in the spiritual immaturity of the US Church.This book and other studies like it have allowed me to experience a true freedom in Christ that is not in bondage of what has become the modern Christian version of the law."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"As a former minister of 20 years, I found this book both interesting and quite depressing. I believe my review title says it all: \\"The Anarchist Bible Against the Organized (or Institutionalized) Church.\\" If I was to believe their \\"research,\\" then I must conclude that the churches of today are nothing but an invented system by humans and used by the devil to deceive multitudes. The authors seem to have a real phobia about \\"programs\\" or \\"structure\\" or designated \\"heirarchy.\\" In their Preface, they write: \\"An organic church is simply a church that is born out of spiritual life instead of constructed by human institutions and held together by religious programs.\\" As a former pastor, I can testify to the fact that \\"whenever two or more are gathered together in His name,\\" there will be appointed structure, heirarchy and eventually a program. If an organic church springs up, people are gathered together to be \\"Spirit-led,\\" even singing together or studying the Word is a \\"program.\\" Appointing Elders or Deacons, which is scriptural, or those gifted with pastor/teaching or evangelism is still a form of \\"heirarchy.\\" (Even though on Page 3, they say that the early church \\"did not organize themselves hierarchically.\\") One doesn't have to be afraid of this process...or the words...nor do we need to avoid what they try to prove is merely man-made. The \\"organic\\" world is still organized. If a home church or cell church or organic church is \\"formed,\\" there will eventually be some kind of organization. Do these spiritual organisms need these authors to do research to see if their procedures are kosher?...rather New Testament? I agree with some of the other comments made about this book. While they have hundreds of footnotes to \\"prove\\" that the church of today is a total perversion and no where close to New Testament principles, they fail to demonstrate what the \\"real\\" really looks like. Other than: it is Spirit-led, organic, no church heirarchy, no programs, nor any of the \\"regular\\" things associated with today's local church. Okay then, I'm ready to lead an organic church. Rather, I want to start an organic church...but, if I start it, am I not the leader? If I start it, and it has some degree of order, does that not constitute a program? If it's Spirit-led only, maybe I should call it an Organic Quaker Church...or if musical instruments are not spiritual nor were they used in the New Testament Church, maybe I should call us the Church of Christ Non-Instrumental Organic Church? But a name would be institutional. So, I will try to use word of mouth for the No-Name, Non-Churched, Organically Organized, Spirit-Led and Spontaneous Local Home Cell. Arghhhhhh!Rev.

Now, here is Pagan Christianity, with these ol' boys (Frank Viloa and George Barna) forevermore shuckin' the corn!!! Everything that I have believed about the institutional church is confirmed, documented historically, backed up by Scripture and written in a style/language that anybody can understand. It is a truth that needs to be realized and reckoned with.

According to the New Testament, they evolved as a place to hide from persecution and overt pressure from the culture at large - both the Judaism of its (or the NT writers) day and the Roman culture against which it clashed.Is this \\"emergent\\" church really like the house churches we see in the New Testament? Is this really like the Acts church? Many folks I know who dig this are members of the ever increasing Church of the Burnt.If you know your church history, there really isn't much new here. If you don't, it's a decent primer.Sure, Christianity has picked up elements from the culture at large along the way. The Judaism from which it emerged did the same; today's Church continues the tradition.This really is not a scholarly tome as much as it is a book with lots of quotes and need of an editorial presence. It reads like a cheerleader's guide to the side for which it roots.In essence, too many exclamation points.A quick search, within twenty pages of one another:\\"Never would any first-century Christian have conceived of the contemporary pastoral office!\\"\\"They exalt the authority and importance of the bishop's office!'\\"\\"He also ordered that the clergy receive fixed annual allowances (ministerial pay)!\\"\\"So after the smoke cleared from the Reformation, we ended up with the same thing that the Catholics gave us--a selective priesthood!\\"I counted over 50 exclamation points by page 250, not including quotations and footnotes, and had to stop.Glean from it what you will - hold fast to that which is good, as Paul says - but refrain from allowing it to be just one more divisive seed in the larger Body of Christ.

For many, these foundational facts may help form the basis of a new found freedom in the expression of your beliefs while relieving the undue bondage of conscience regarding things thought \\"holy\\" which are merely man's traditions.This is not another critique of Catholic dogma, but rather a challenge to the reformed, Protestant faith to know well the reasons and history behind current, ecclesiastical customs and rituals. The authors clearly lay out the discrepancies between today's church practices versus original, early Christian teachings. They leave the implications of these differences to the reader (and the church at large) to work out.Some chapters are weaker than others at presenting the matter at hand.

God bless and enjoy finding out just how far this rabbit hole goes!Deanna Rodriguez~ [...][...]"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"\\"Pagan Christianity\\" is a new book written by two Evangelical Christians whose views support many of the teachings of Latter-day Saints (Mormons) about the apostasy from First Century Christianity.Frank Viola and George Barna have collaborated on an updated and expanded version of one of Viola's earlier books, and titled it Pagan Christianity. It is published by Tyndale Press, an established Evangelical publisher. Barna is a prominent pollster and author for the Evangelical community, while Viola is a \\"traveling apostolic minister\\" in the \\"house church\\" movement that seeks to recreate the form and substance of primitive Christianity.The thesis of Pagan Christianity is that the First Century Christian church did not have a professional clergy, did not have a single minister or priest running the meetings and giving the sermons, did not require tithes (but accepted donations), did not have a set order of worship but had songs, prayer, and exhortations as led by the Spirit, and was not in a hierarchical organization but rather had \\"church planters\\" like Paul who would aid the local churches to get going but did not administer them.The book is exhaustively footnoted, and the footnotes are on the bottom of each page, but they in such a small typeface that I had a hard time reading them. Those I did read seemed to include a number that were not quite as authoritative for the specific points Viola and Barna were arguing.Their argument that tithing does not apply to the Christian church is based on the notion that the Old Testament is not authoritative for Christians, sort of an odd idea since Christ seemed to think so. And of course we have Christ's quotation of Malachi 3 and 4 to the Nephites to make clear to Latter-day Saints that it applies to Christians after his resurrection.Viola and Barna are very specific that the organization and operation of the church changed drastically after the first century, when the \\"traveling apostolic ministers\\" were no longer in operation. They assert that having a paid specialist in rhetoric give a sermon every week is a pagan innovation borrowed from Greco-Roman culture.In fact, they are so critical of the borrowing from GREEK PHILOSOPHY (sorry Pat) in the structure and operations of the church that I was anticipating that when I turned the page, they would be condemning Greek philosophy, too. But alas, it was not to be. Even though they denounce everything else that is Greek in the modern Christian church, they do not attack the Greek philosophical elements in the creeds, and in fact they rely on the creeds to keep their autonomous \\"house churches\\" from going apostate, since there is no higher authority to do it.This is a glaring logical inconsistency, but as a LDS I can understand how it would upset Evangelicals to be told that their creeds, which they use to differentiate between non-Christians (LDS) and Christians (everybody else) are largely a product of a pagan Greek viewpoint that intruded itself in the church after the proper organization was lost following the First Century.The other glaring omission is the fact that real priesthood and authority were important within the First Century Church. Acts demonstrates Peter is the leading apostle. The revelation about baptizing Gentiles was given to Peter, and he and the apostles rendered a decision at the Jerusalem Council. Acts explains that the Samaritans who were baptized could not receive the Holy Ghost until Peter and John came and confirmed them with the priesthood, even explaining that one of the converts, Simon the Magician, offered Peter money for the priesthood power he exercised.Viola admits that the \\"traveling apostolic ministers\\" were essential to the operation of the First Century Church and that it became corrupted with Greek practices after they were gone, but he wants to assert that these house churches can appoint new \\"traveling apostolic ministers\\" so he doesn't have to deal with the fact that the original ones were ordained by Christ, and after the defection of Judas, his replacement Matthias was ordained by the remaining eleven.In an interview about his book, Viola offers the following quote:\\"I appreciate the words of A.W. Tozer on this score: \`If Christianity is to receive a rejuvenation it must be by other means than any now being used. If the church in the second half of [the twentieth] century is to recover from the injuries she suffered in the first half, there must appear a new type of preacher. The proper, ruler-of-the-synagogue type will never do. Neither will the priestly type of man who carries out his duties, takes his pay and asks no questions, nor the smooth-talking pastoral type who knows how to make the Christian religion acceptable to everyone. All these have been tried and found wanting. Another kind of religious leader must arise among us. He must be of the old prophet type, a man who has seen visions of God and has heard a voice from the Throne. When he comes (and I pray God there will not be one but many) he will stand in flat contradiction to everything our smirking, smooth civilization holds dear. He will contradict, denounce and protest in the name of God and will earn the hatred and opposition of a large segment of Christendom.\\" [Note: I recomment reading that again, just in case you missed something! WOW!]Viola and Barna have drawn a detailed map demonstrating that there was a rebellion in Christianity after the First Century that de facto replaced the church with a new institution based on pagan ideas. But he is unwilling to take the next logical step and admit that the new church was really a pagan church, not a Christian one, and it lacked not only the form but also the authority and spirit of the original. They are standing on the edge of the Jordan but are not willing to let go of the Pagan creeds and step in to cross to the promised land of fully restored Christianity which they recognize is on the other side, where the religious leader is a prophet."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"If you REALLY want to know why the established church does what it does, this is the book for you.

Alas, this book doesn't really add to understanding progressive Christianity. Viola has a clear agenda based on his personal approach to practicing his Christian beliefs. My question regarding the Pagan elements/influences in Christianity is, \\"So what?\\". If anything it shows that Christianity was, once in it's growth, a religion that was responsive to the needs and culture it grew in. Alas, for the past 500 years the Christian missionaries haven't responded and recoginzed the value of the cultures they meet, but instead have fostered a percieved need for the cultures to bend to the will of the missionaries; to change their culture to be consonant with how things are supposed to be, from the missionaries' point of view."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Pagan Christianity, by Frank Viola and George Barna is a book that should be read by all present day Christians.

He tells you house churches were the norm because that is the way early Christians chose to worship. House churches were the norm because Christianity had to be secret. Persecutions were terrible and in some instances Christians were roasted on the stake by Nero. The Roman historians claim that part of Romes Fall was due to the way Christians practiced their faith. viola leaves out many NT. historical facts. Bishops and deacons were both mentioned in the NT and each had seperate functions in the NT church. I Cor. 14:26 lists the earliest actual worship service and how it went. Viola discounts this by saying it was not a form. what in the world was Paul giving us, a worship service order. Viola's own authority seems to be his expereince WOW.. that is real authority. I did not particularly like the book. He lists small groups early in the Intro as a fad and then talks about house curches as the answer. What is a house church, a small group. Viola defines John Nelson Darby as an ultimate \\"proof texter\\". darby would be defined better as a \\"Dispensationalist\\" who came up with a theological revisionist history that is totally based on wrong assumptions and missinterpretations of Biblical texts plus proof texting. Viola uses a lot of historial generalizations which he wants you to beleive are true!

It shows us that the kitchen is not just relegated to \`those that have been trained' in the art, but swings wide the doors to the least of us that wish to get our hands dirty trying.I'll go one better, Frank and George deconstruct the \`kitchen', and everything that goes on in it, so well that it no longer has 4 walls with pots and pans all over it and utensils in the drawers, but lets us see that we can \`cook' anywhere, with anything, at any time; just as long as we have Fire.They show us that the Master has always desired to reveal to each of us what our specialty is and, using the help of a trained chef, guide us through the initial apprenticeship. Afterwards, the chef leaves us to use our newfound \`talents' to let us see the Master at work creating those dishes for us to feast upon.For those of you that have ever thought about why the \`kitchen' operates the way it does or desired to get your hands dirty trying to cook, I suggest strongly that you read this book.

In \\"Pagan Christianity\\" Frank Viola explains what he discovered through researching the history of Christianity, exposing the pagan roots of many of our traditions and rituals.

Thank you.As a biblical scholar (PhD Oxford University), I always appreciate carefully researched work. I spent as much time in the footnotes as in the text.

I am especially interested in their methodology for small groups using the \\"organic church\\" model - mostly how they go about training a small community to self-sustain, especially given the highly mobile nature of most congregants = high participant turnover.This is definitely worth reading and contemplating as those of us who try to be intentionally-Biblical Christians reassess our obedience to God both in community and in worship."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Next to the Bible, this is the most important book I have ever read. It should be considered a MUST READ for all Christians. Order it and read it without delay!"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"For longer than I care to admit, I naively assumed that the way we did church was, well, biblical. I simply took it for granted that were the Apostle Paul to be magically beamed into the present, he would feel right at home in one of our American churches and would not at all be startled by our plush red carpets and pseudo-medieval stained glass, our Sunday neckties and high heels, our pulpits and pews and steeples and vested clergy and ritual sitting-standing-sitting weekend calisthenics and choirs and worship teams and the bizarre way we talk in our erudite Christianity-as-a-Second-Language insider jargon. I wonder what he might think of our vogue institutions--like purpose driven, seeker sensitive megachurches, satellite campuses, EFT tithing, cell groups, affinity units, websites, big screen projection systems, stage lighting et cetera, ad infinitum. Would the apostle be envious or appalled? Are we on track or has novelty and technology caused us to veer from a set path? I have colleagues on both sides of these issues and both present sound, even biblical, cases, one for looking back and embracing tradition and the other for implementing technology and looking avant-garde to the future.But I still wonder. And so do church planter Frank Viola and market analyst George Barna in their just-released book \\"Pagan Christianity?\\" They are less ambivalent than I am and view the modern church as more rooted in ancient pagan customs than in being the pure product of the New Testament. What they suggest is the startling, even revolutionary, claim that much of what Christians do in present-day churches has evolved more from non-Christian cultures and rituals developed long after the deaths of the apostles than from scripture. They support their view with compelling historical evidence in what may be a first-ever exploration to document the full story of modern church practices and the way we do church in America.\\"Pagan Christianity\\" will probably pry open an unwelcome can of worms. For Christians committed to a literal reading of scripture, who dogmatically believe in \\"doing it by the book,\\" the authors will present a dilemma. You will have to ask yourself: if I am to believe that our lives should be ordered by scripture; then why not the way we do church? \\"Pagan Christianity\\" boldly goes where no man has dared to go and exposes the problems that emerge when churches function more like profane business organizations than the living organism presented in scripture.Other troubling questions raised are: Why do we modern Christians have such an \\"edifice complex,\\" an obsession with buildings and property? Where did our idea of the need for architecture and steeples, pulpits and pews, departments and budgets come from? What about our chiseled-in-stones \\"order of worship\\"? How biblical is the centerpiece of Protestantism: the sermon? How necessary, really, is a professional clergy and support staff? Does the way we dress up on Sunday merely cover up deeper, more insidious, matters? Does our emphasis on \\"Christian education\\" serve more to swell the head than fill the heart? These are questions you have probably already asked yourself.

Instead, we bithely carry out our religious traditions,never asking where they come from.\\"One of the lessons taken from this book is that traditions can be blinding.Mark 7:8 has Messiah saying \\"Disregarding the command of God,you keep the tradition of men.\\" That statement is still applicable today.Frank Viola does an exceptional job in detailing the history of various denominations. Two examples are: Protestant denominations reformed or revised the theology of Catholicism without returning to the practices of the first century believers.Anabaptists believed in every-member functioning in the body.That was more in line with the \\"early church.\\"He also casts some light on the origins of:sermons,pile carpets and chairs in the building,the church building itself,stained glass windows.What I also found very interesting is the origin of the Bishopry and Apostolic succession.The \\"Sermon on the Mount\\" was not known as such untill Augustine called it that in AD 395.Mr. Viola has researched this subject well and there are extensive footnotes throughout this book.He exposes the un-Biblical practices of most churches.To understand this subject well,a reader has to understand who and what Constantine was. I found the information on the \\"early Church fathers\\" very educational.Two topics that I appreciate in this book that few authors will deal with are tithing(what it really was in the OT)and the art of \\"proof-texting\\". The latter is the common practice of using a verse to prove a point with no regard for the context of that particular verse.Chapter 11 was my favorite in the book. \\"Re-approaching the NT:the Bible is not a jig-saw puzzle\\" is reminiscient of another of his books that I recently read and reviewed.I wish that he would have dealt with the topic of Sunday worship vs the Sabbath.This book is well-written and very detailed. This is the 2nd book by Frank Viola I have read. Based on what I have read so far,I will be reading the other two shortly. This book can be an \\"eye opener\\" and I recommend it!"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Viola and Barna's book Pagan Christianity attempts to expose the pagan practices in Christian worship in an effort to advocate for overturning those practices and return to a biblically based worship akin to that of the early Church. As a theologian and a liturgical scholar, I was interested in this book and what it might offer. The authors underline several practices (including officially designated and compensated clergy, worship leadership by specialists, wearing special clothes to worship, delivery of the sermon, and the reduction of baptism and eucharist to stylized actions) which they feel to be \\"pagan\\" - which is to say they feel them to be contrary to their vision of what the early Church would have worshiped right.And, at least theoretically, some of the comments are correct: worship (or litorgia as it was known in the early church) ought to be the effort of the entirety of the assembly rather than just a select few. Of course, that does not mean we shouldn't have individuals who lead the collective, and we can see evidence of this from the first and second century (on the order of the Didache and Justin Martyr's Apology I). The act of leading itself specializes, so the critique that we should not have liturgical specialists is not only impractical, it's truthfully next to impossible. Furthermore, his comments in regards to non-distinction between clergy and laity (that \\"elders\\" should be internally recognized and not specifically ordained nor compensated) is in contrast to the example of the New Testament, which the authors do state they are attempting to follow. This is simply one example from a single chapter. Nowhere do the authors actually demonstrate the absolute unbiblical or anti-Christian nature of those things which they oppose, much less that these things are actually \\"pagan\\" or what they propose is more \\"Christian\\" than the alternatives.Many of the pre-release reviewers laud the book as speaking the truth as to the nature of early Christian worship and the pagan nature of present practices. The careful reader will no doubt notice that all of these individuals are in one way or another involved with the emerging worship or house church \\"movements.\\" The \\"scholars\\" who laud the book are mostly drawn from tiny schools with little track record of research. One may wonder why if the history the authors here present is both factual and accurate that not one academic liturgist was invited to present a pre-release review, and the truth of the matter is that it is because the historical \\"evidence\\" presented by this book is a bunch of bologna. Though the author does indeed reference known experts in the field of liturgical studies, the quotes are either taken hopelessly out of context or simply did not comprehend the point they were making. There are certainly better, more nuanced books (though probably less readable than this one) out available by respectable researchers which detail the origins of early Christian worship and its historical progress with much more clarity and historical accuracy, and not all of them fawning over themselves to praise present practice among evangelicals, either. One is better served reading what is in the bibliography than reading the work itself, which is a sad commentary.On the whole, I could not provide a more disparaging evaluation of this work if I attempted to. Any possible latent value of the book is eliminated by the overwhelming historical errors and theological agenda pushing that pervade nearly every page. I can only hope the trees that were ruthlessly murdered to print such a monstrosity were replanted."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Frank Viola, the current guru for the \\"House Church Movement\\" has teamed up with pollster George Barna and produced really one of the worst works dealing with Biblical ecclesiology to come along in many years. Barna, in past works (esp \\"Revolution\\") has been beating the drum that based on his research the church, which the Bible calls \\"the pillar and ground of the truth\\" really isn't, and if it doesn't radically change it would go out of business by the next generation.Since that tact of argumentation received little more than a \\"yawn\\" from the evangelical world, he's moved to a new argument; that is, that most, if not everything that is done in the worship service of virtually every conservative evangelical church in the world, has it's roots in \\"paganism\\" and pagan practices (and hence should be abandoned). These practices date back to the merging of the Roman Empire and Christianity under the auspices of Constantine the Great. While it is undeniable that many \\"traditions\\" that attached themselves to Christianity (particularly the Christmas and Easter ones) had parallels in paganism; there is a significant leap in logic from \\"parallel\\" to having roots.This book is poorly researched, presents poor interpretations of both Scripture and history. The treatment of both is superficial and simplistic. The book really reads like the premise for \\"The DaVinci Code\\" and gives the impression that Viola and Barna thought Dan Brown was a writer of non-fiction and was an excellent researcher.\\"Pagan Christianity\\" presents a sub-biblical view of the Church and Ecclesiology in general and will serve only to confuse those who never met a conspiracy they didn't like."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"This is the most compelling, revolutionizing book I have read in many years. My prayer is that Christians would really take heed. The authors brought all the pieces together in one place making a very clear case for a new wineskin.

I read this book in one sitting (as I often do when I am in a bookstore and want to know what a book says but don't want to buy it). The claims are just false. The application of the book, according to Barna and Viola, is to walk away from the \\"organized\\" church and join in on their variety of house churches. This is not surprise as this book follows Barna's \\"revolution\\" where he pointed out that many people who had grown in spirituality had left the church. He advocated this behavior.Barna has made himself and enemy of God's Church, and his knowledge of history and ecclesiology is suspect. Just because Barna has stats that are easily quoted in sermons doesn't mean he is to be relied upon as knowledgeable about what he discusses.(below is my original review, written right after reading the book and when filled with disgust for this dangerous false teaching. Interestingly, many comments show more an eagerness to be offended by my admittedly strong tone than with a book that attacks the bride of Christ.)Oh, for goodness sake. What did Barna ever do to earn all these silly slathering groupies? He's just a second rate pollster with an ax to grind. He's made a fortune telling the church how awful it is, and now he's ready to burn the whole thing down.Yes, he appeals all these wierdo types (\\"Uh, yeah, like, I was a student in a seminary and I, like, bought the line about the church.

A great deal of research has been done to inform the reader of current church practises. I am still wondering the purpose of the book.

This big bombshell of a virus wasn't so much of pagan origins, if at all, as it was mostly a \\"political/power\\" move.I first read about this bombshell in a book written back in the early 60s titled \\"HEROES AND HEREITCS\\" by Barrows Dunham.

Furthermore, on God's orders, the Israelites established a hereditary priesthood that was given the primary task of performing atonement sacrifices to temporarily pay for the sins of the nation.These priests were also called to memorize the Torah, apply it to everyday life, and faithfully teach the people in their care to do likewise. Therefore, contrary to the conclusions of the authors, the idea of the priesthood, a trained clergy preaching the Good News, and official church buildings do have biblical counterparts, and are not pagan in origin at all!The real problem is not that these institutions exist, but that Christ's ministry to mankind abolished the need for a paid priesthood, and specialized temples dedicated to making animal sacrifices, which were no longer required when Christ became our perfect High Priest and atonement sacrifice, and invited us to co-reign and co-minister with Him in His Kingdom.Also, the authors fail to note that wherever Paul went to preach, he always located the Christians in these communities if he could find them, and requested their hospitality before preaching. Then, when Paul preached, he entered the synagogues first. There, he delivered the Good News of the Kingdom of God to the Jews and Gentile acolytes in that community before going to the local town squares or forums to preach to the Gentiles.This practice clearly suggests a need for centralized gathering places that Christians can use as a springboard to share their faith with the world. This also means that the Church has been called to hold open forums and discussions about the Gospel in public places whenever they are allowed. In other words, to be more biblically correct, congregations should hold their Church meetings and love feasts on the lawns of their churches rather than indoors whenever possible as an outreach to their communities!Rather than seeing house church groups as superior to institutionalized Churches, there has always been a need for home churches to work in tandem with centralized houses of worship that can serve as gathering places open to believers as well as non-believers. In this way, they would be able to more effectively share the Gospel, and the love of God with outsiders in their local communities.Remember that the First Century Church was often a persecuted church, and it went underground, and behind closed doors to protect itself from angry Gentiles and Jews that hated the Gospel. It was hated because it gave all people the freedom to govern themselves with the light of the Holy Spirit, and to see to their own salvation by accepting Christ's reign in their hearts in the spirit of a true and democratic theocracy.Sadly, that is the main problem with the Churches in the West today. They have hidden the light of Christ inside their Church buildings instead of taking it to public places to share with anyone who wants to attend their meetings. In the process, they are now losing, and have - in many cases - lost the enormous privilege they once had to share the Gospel openly with the spiritually bankrupt world around them in the West.Secondly, most Churches are so busy promoting missionary efforts in other countries that they have forgotten to take care of the financial and emotional needs of their own parishioners - something that could easily be done if everyone in the community gave their surplus goods and cash to help everyone in the Church like they did in New Testament times (Acts 2:44-47, Acts 4:32).Don't you think it would be easier to spread the Good News if everyone in the Church gave whatever they could to help the poorest and neediest people in their own communities and congregations before worrying about the unsaved in Africa or China? If this were done, modern Churches would likely grow so fast that there would be no need to spend money sending missionaries, for they would witness to people visiting from those communities, who in turn would take the Gospel to their own communities.The New Testament story of the Ethiopian eunuch who practiced Judaism, but then became a believer in Christ and was baptized is an example of this (See Acts 8:27-39). Though it is not recorded in the Bible, this eunuch is traditionally attributed with sharing the Good News of the Kingdom of God with the Queen of Ethiopia, as well as other Ethiopian Jews and Gentiles, and thus helping to establish the Ethiopian Christian Church, which may be the oldest Orthodox Church community in the world!I can see no greater way to achieve the Great Commission than to win converts from among every local community, and among all the foreigners who visit the United States, and the other countries of the West for an education. Isn't it sad that telling others about God the Father and Christ in American and European schools and business places where those foreigners congregate has been outlawed?No wonder God is judging the washed up, watered down, and ineffectual Christians of the world so harshly today by allowing terrorism and religious persecution! Terrorism and persecution are directly tied to the secular and Muslim world's assault on the loving Gospel of Christ, and it won't stop until Christ and His Spirit are allowed a chance to be brought back into every home, church, school and workplace in America, Israel, and the world."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Save your money, there is absolutely nothing new or reliable in this book. Viola's thesis is that _real_ Christianity, from the first century, was quickly corrupted by Pagan Catholicism. WE protestants are right; YOU Catholics are pagans; and we're not real sure about some of the protestants.This is a very old horse to ride, as in:-- Melanchthon, Aplologia Confessionis Augustanae, 1530 AD, detailing Catholic rituals copied from Paganism-- H. Bullinger, De originie erroris libris duo, 1539, detailing Catholic &quot;cultic errors&quot; copied from the Heathens-- Isaac Casaubon, De rebus sacris et ecclesiasticus exercitationes 1614, about how the apostle Paul's use of terminology and ideas from the pagan mystery religions-- Conyers Middleton, A Letter from Rome Shewing an Exact Conformity between Popery and Paganism, 1729and dozens and dozens of books since, as sad protestants have built themselves up by tearing Catholics down; claiming to show how after the apostles (as they see it), Christianity adopted Pagan rituals, ideas and Greek philosophy.Not only is Viola's bigotry dated, his scholarship is amateurish. The cover says he's is a high school teacher who also writes books about Jesus. That fits. What you get here is certainly high-school level stuff - simplistic fundamentalist conclusions supported by superficial evidence; lots of friendly references, all to secondary sources. This is the sort of stuff other lonely kooks post on internet news-groups; Viola has found an evangelical press to put his screed on paper.This isn't really scholarship at all. It's rolling-in-the-sawdust tent-revival silliness. Smug, nasty silliness.-----If you're interested in a reliable synopsis of the modern scholarship on Christianity's Pagan origins, try Professor Jonathan Z.

It's this kind of open-minded approach that every Christian should take.I give the first 75% of this book five stars. It does an outstanding job of explaining how our church building layouts, worship service routines, church attire, and leadership heirarchy are not only inconsistent with the first century church, but are also harmful to our relationship with God. This book's best point might be that the early church had no ordained ministers who paid an institution (like seminary) to turn them into \\"Holy Men\\" who were then set above other Christians.Unfortunately, the final 25% of this book gets only one star. The book starts to fall apart when it criticizes Sunday school and youth ministry programs, because they weren't part of the early church. The authors make the assumption here that we Christians should not have flexibility in our ministry to meet the changing needs of our culture. They fail to mention that the early church didn't need youth ministry because there was no such thing back then as a teenage lifestyle like we know today.Then chapter 11 changes direction and makes the claim that our erroneous practices are often the result of not reading Paul's letters in the order in which they were written, and not knowing all there is to know about the historical (non-biblical)background of the New Testament. So where do we find this historical background? In Frank Viola's other book, The Untold Story of the New Testament Church. So chapter 11 is really just a pitch to get you to buy Frank's other book.In the end, this book limits us to only one solution: home churches are the only churches that satisfy God. I disagree. Not everyone thrives in a church small enough to fit into someone's living room. Some of us develop relationships better in large churches. Also, large churches offer more ministry activities than living room-sized churches can, because not everyone's schedules muat align to pull off a group activity. And let's not forget that new movers will not even know where the home churches are (although the internet helps today, but what were people suppossed to do before that?).Nonetheless, I recommend this book to every Christian, because there's alot to learn here.

I experienced the former-the book resonated with what the Lord has recently shown me in His Word and elsewhere.I found the tone of the book to be refreshingly respectful of the reader and those within the organized church. There is a sincere desire to communicate truth and spark thoughtful discussion. In fact, if you'd like to dialogue with Frank about issues raised in the book, you can email him at Violabooks@aol.com and put \\"PC Question\\" in the subject line,[...].However, sometimes you have to tear down before you can rebuild, and this book seeks to do just that. (A book discussing God's intended design should be released this summer). And the tearing down process can be emotional. I like what Franz Kafka has said: \\"I think we ought to read only books that bite and sting us. If the book we are reading doesn't shake us awake like a blow on the skull, why bother reading it in the first place? . . . A book must be the axe for the frozen sea within us.\\"I believe Pagan could be today's version of Luther's \\"95 Theses\\", and has the potential to start an even greater reformation than Luther's. Luther sparked some wonderful changes in the church's practice and understanding, but unfortunately didn't take us far enough. Luther spent a lot of time dealing with indulgences-something so foreign to mainline Christianity-but was a big deal back then. (A prime example of how the church can drift from the \\"simplicity that is in Christ\\" 2 Co 11:3). And speaking of \\"tone\\"-consider just several of Luther's points:\\"32. They will be condemned eternally, together with their teachers, who believe themselves sure of their salvation because they have letters of pardon.50. Christians are to be taught that if the pope knew the exactions of the pardon-preachers, he would rather that St. Peter's church should go to ashes, than that it should be built up with the skin, flesh and bones of his sheep.86. Again: -- \\"Why does not the pope, whose wealth is to-day greater than the riches of the richest, build just this one church of St. Peter with his own money, rather than with the money of poor believers?\\" \\"The purpose of Pagan Christianity is not to pick apart the traditions and practices of the established church, but rather to show how these practices harm the Body of Christ and prevent it from functioning as our Lord intended. It's ridiculous to say the authors expect us to wear togas and sandals and throw out anything that smacks of the 21st century. But in order to dismantle the deeply entrenched system that we've come to call \\"church\\", it's necessary to demonstrate where these things came from; they're not directives from God's Word. For example, although there is certainly nothing inherently wrong with believers gathering in a building set aside for that purpose, it's not the ideal setting for the church, based on the nature of the church. The church is a family, not an organization. Families typically gather in cozier settings that are more conducive to the life they live together. The New Testament stresses that we have become God's building, His dwelling place (1 Co 3:9, Rev 21). Having a building associated with the church obscures this picture. Consider how the world defines the church, and even many believers- it's a place you go, not who you are. Call it semantics, but there's a huge difference between attending something and being that something.I was very involved and devoted to the traditional church system for 25+ years, but the Lord has shaken the foundations of my understanding of church. I've been a part of an organic church for several years and have experienced the Lord in ways that the system, unfortunately, does not facilitate. I've learned to gather with brothers and sisters, not around a doctrine or creed, but around the living Christ Himself. I've discovered that one man cannot provide all of my spiritual nourishment through a weekly message, but that I am fed by the portion of Christ that each brother and sister brings to the meeting. To my surprise, I've been used of the Lord to feed the brethren. I've been thrilled to find that when the Head is allowed to direct the Body, the meeting is beautifully ordered and Christ's very Life is experienced. I've grown in my personal walk with the Lord, not just for my own gratification, but knowing that my brothers and sisters are nourished as I share of my fellowship with Christ. I've experienced face-to-face community and learned to love brothers and sisters that see things a little differently than I do-those I would intentionally avoid in a traditional setting. The message of Pagan is not just an arm-chair philosophy. It works. But we don't just do it because it works-we do it because it pleases the Father to embrace His design.In his e-newsletter announcing the publishing of Pagan, Frank writes: \\"It's evident to me and many of my friends that God has allowed the second largest Christian publishing house in the world (Tyndale) to publish this book for one reason: He wants the message to go out far and wide. God cares deeply for His church, and He seeks for it to be given back to His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, the true Head of the Body. That's the driving message behind Pagan Christianity.\\"Amen, brother."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"I am a Southern Baptist and a great fan of history. I found Pagan Christianity to be a great read. I enjoyed learning about why it is that we Baptists \\"do what we do\\" every Sunday morning. I also enjoyed gaining an insight into the religious practices and beliefs behind the home church. Although most of the rituals we Baptists perform every Sunday morning can be traced to Pagans, I continue to enjoy those rituals. At the same time, I have gained new understanding and a greater appreciation for those who chose to participate in a home church.Jennifer Knox"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"As George Barna has well documented, the church landscape of America is changing rapidly. A key element of this change is a spreading reexamination of the very nature and practice of church. The extent of this reexamination is demonstrated by the fact that a major publisher like Tyndale would today publish a book like \\"Pagan Christianity\\". Even five years ago this would have been unheard of!Consider these words in the Publisher's Preface: \\"...the authors raise important questions based on their careful research, study, and experiences, and we believe these questions should not be ignored. Our aim is for you to consider their conclusions and then pray seriously about your response.\\"Amazing!This fits with my personal journey. As a pastor in evangelical churches for 25 years, I held strongly to the idea that \\"the Bible is our authoritative guide for faith and practice\\". I preached that, as followers of Jesus, we should courageously examine our lives in light of Scripture and, with God's help, be ready to make changes. I believe most evangelical pastors seek to live and minister from this same core foundational concept.However, in recent years, a growing number of us have been recognizing a major blind spot in the living out of our commitment to a Biblical lifestyle. That blind spot is ecclesiology (the doctrine of the church). I believe \\"Pagan Christianity\\" will play a vital role in shaping the growing conversation on this subject over the next year. Well researched and well written, the book is accessible to both church leaders and those formerly known as \\"the laity\\".Seems to me it's time for every church, whether traditional or non-traditional, to promote an open minded and respectful discussion and courageous reexamination about what our \\"authoritative guide\\" has to say about this critical topic. \\"Pagan Christianity\\" will provide a stimulating starting point for that conversation."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"It amazes me that scholars and researchers keep \\"rediscovering\\" the fact that many church traditions \\"originate\\" in common cultural practices. This is not a new idea. Ever since the Protestant Reformation, enthusiastic people who discover spiritual freedom through authentic Christianity begin to question and reject ossified traditions. There are many things going on here, but what is NOT being discovered is some sort of ancient conspiracy by the Devil to mix paganism with Christianity. That's no conspiracy, that's been his plan all along and everyone knows it. His whole bit is mixing darkness with light and calling it \\"truth.\\"Up until about Gutenberg's printing press and the advent of mass communication, Western Civilization was a culture dominated by mnemonic technology. The arts of memory were essential in transmitting information across space and time, and ancient cultures developed a rich variety of ways to accomplish this. That is why so much of ancient \\"art\\" is stylized and symbolic and iconic and filled with pictures: not because they couldn't read, but because they had to learn and remember everything because books were so rare and expensive. Christian communities could not exist nor survive based on the current paradigm of \\"Me and my Bible,\\" because written Scriptures were rare, expensive, and as in the New Testament, property of the group rather than an individual.In cultures dominated by memory technology, or mnemonics, the only way to change such a completely structured cultural imagination as you find in paganism is to take the symbols and rituals of the common people and \\"redeem\\" them, take their minds back for God, by re-assigning meaning to them. The only way to change the meaning of a symbol is to assign it a new meaning and then to enforce that new assigned meaning through repetition. Thus, you get rituals and symbols within Christianity that yes, had pagan origins, that have yes, been completely forgotten through repetition of the new, Christian meaning. And those formerly pagan people now have ancient Christian churches instead of ancient pagan temples in places where that transfer of meaning was successful. This is why Germany, Holland, France and Spain don't look like India, Tibet, Japan, and Thailand when it comes to pagan temples on every street corner.Christianity has been around for 2,000 years, and just like \\"Global Warming,\\" human meddling cannot alter the will of God, nor change what He has set in motion. What human meddling CAN do, and always does, is find a reason for one group to separate from another group. If the research in \\"Pagan Christianity? Exploring the Roots of Our Church Practices\\" succeeds in helping people break out of legalism and into a deeper personal relationship with Jesus Christ, his Father, and his Holy Spirit, then that's great! But if as is usually the case it leads to church splits, division, \\"We're better than you\\" thinking, and spiritual elitism, then PRESTO! Congratulations, you've just re-invented the Great Enlightenment.Go back and read your history books. \\"Back-to-the-Bible\\" movements have appeared throughout the Modern period, starting with the Protestant Reformation. \\"Sola Scriptura\\" is a phrase coined by Martin Luther, not Frank Viola and George Barna. Just as many people who grew up in \\"Bible-based\\" churches are turning to Catholicism, Anglicanism, Anglo-Catholic Charismatic movements, Othodoxy, and other ancient versions of Christianity, precisely *because* they are full of ritual and Christian symbolism. Ritual is not the problem. Empty, habitual ritualism is the problem. You get that in any religion.If you want to read a verse that will kind of knock this whole concept of \\"dump ritual and tradition if it's not mentioned in the Bible,\\" check out these words from the Apostle Paul: 2 Thessalonians 2:15 (New International Version)\\"So then, brothers, stand firm and hold to the teachings[a] we passed on to you, whether by word of mouth or by letter.\\" Footnotes: 1. 2 Thessalonians 2:15 Or *traditions* So here you have Paul upholding both oral AND written tradition. This verse is often used by liturgical scholars to justify church liturgical traditions.And this passage: 1 Corinthians 5:8 (New International Version)\\"Therefore let us keep the Festival, not with the old yeast, the yeast of malice and wickedness, but with bread without yeast, the bread of sincerity and truth.\\" Where Paul is not encouraging Christians to abandon a traditional Festival, but to observe it with the right heart, which is exactly what people in liturgical, ritual-filled churches have always been challenged to do. Whether you come from a Protestant, Catholic or Orthodox background, the challenge has always been authentic, relational spirituality within the traditional forms of church practice, not one or the other.If you buy this book, please don't use it as anything other than a way to detach yourself from the comfort and security of forms and habits and then to re-attach yourself to God himself, rather than just latching onto a new idea in hopes that by \\"doing church right\\" or \\"doing church differently\\" you will get any closer to Him. I don't think Mother Theresa, St. Francis of Assissi, or Martin Luther King, or even the Apostles who continued to worship in Synagogues as they converted fellow Jews were worried about church practices getting in the way of conversion or vibrant life. I think they were worried about getting more and more of themselves out of God's way, so he could live His life in and through them, accomplishing His purposes in a world destined for the trash heap."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Frank Viola and George Barna have given Christians worldwide a true gem of a book.Despite the misgivings that some may have based on the title or the subject matter, it is definitely worth diving into the content and giving it a chance.Far from writing a condemnation of the modern Christian church experience, the authors are instead taking a close look at the roots of several practices, showing the psychological and spiritual effects they have on their practitioners, and offering biblical and thoroughly researched alternatives.This is a book that is both intellectually and spiritually stimulating and it has the power to change perspectives, opinions, and even lives. Whether you're looking to read about significant facets of Christian practice for the first time or looking for a central reference about those practices you've already researched to keep handy in your library, I would highly recommend this book!Each chapter covers a different practice (everything from the church building to tithing) and is jam-packed with notes that support the content.I've studied Christian history for over 10 years and have never had a book that I could easily reference for historical and practical material on these subjects all under one cover until this was published. As a former Eastern Orthodox Christian, I was especially impressed with the book's treatment of the history of the church building and worship. I had always been taught in Eastern Orthodoxy that Orthodox churches were built in the shape of a cross and faced East because it was Apostolic tradition, but no one could show me where that tradition pre-dated Constantine's time. \\"Pagan Christianity?\\" thoroughly explains these origins and contrasts them with well-documented early Christian practice.This is definitely one of the best purchases I've made in a long time!"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"This book gives the appearance of being carefully researched with its extensive notes, list of Key Figures in Church History, and fairly wide-ranging Bibliography. Sad to say, that is not the case. Instead, it is rather shoddily put together, which is often the case of books seeking to present a \\"restorationist\\" view of the history of Christianity.The thesis of Pagan Christianity--that somewhere early on the Christian Church abandoned its original, primitive self-understanding and began to conform itself to paganism--is nothing new, despite its sensationalist title. Typically, however, books taking this view on early Church history concentrate on doctrinal issues and come from a theologically liberal Protestant perspective, whereas this book (apparently) affirms orthodox Christian doctrine and instead concentrates mainly on what it considers to be departures from New Testament Church practice.Nothing wrong with that, one might suppose, except for the inconvenient fact that rather little is known about actual New Testament Church practices, and that what is known either contradicts the authors' thesis or is quite controversial and by no means settled. For example, the authors talk about the so-called truncation of the Lord's Supper, but already St. Paul, in the late 50s or early 60s of the first century, concentrates on Jesus' words referring to the Bread and the Cup of the Last Supper as his body and blood (1 Cor. 11:24, 25) and earlier says, \\"Is not the cup of thanksgiving for which we give thanks a participation in the blood of Christ? And is not the bread that we break a participation in the body of Christ?\\" (1 Cor. 10:16). In A.D. 110 Ignatius of Antioch writes, \\"[Heretics] abstain from the Eucharist and from prayer because they do not confess that the Eucharist is the Flesh of our Savior Jesus Christ\\" (Letter to Smyrnaeans, 6:2). And by A.D. 150 Justin Martyr says that the bread and wine are \\"made into the Eucharist by the Eucharistic prayer set down by him, and by the change of which our flesh and blood is nourished, is both the Flesh and Blood of that incarnate Jesus\\" (First Apology 66, 20). Further, there are many knotty issues of hermeneutics and exegesis that the authors are either unaware of or choose to ignore because they would severely vitiate their thesis. Additionally, once extra-biblical documents about the early Church begin to appear around A.D. 100-170, they describe Church practices quite different from what the authors' tell us was the norm during New Testament times.What the authors of Pagan Christianity are asking us to believe is that the earliest sub-Apostolic figures whose writings are extant, Ignatius of Antioch and Clement of Rome, who may have known the Apostles, got Church understandings like the monarchical episcopate, the threefold ministry (bishop, priest, and deacon), and the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist completely wrong. Yet these are the same people who are laying the foundations of Christian doctrines like the Trinity, the two natures of Jesus, and the hypostatic union, even as they fought off the first deadly heresy, Gnosticism. How is it that they were getting the doctrine part right, but botching ministry, worship, and ecclesiology? What principle is at work here? If the Holy Spirit was to lead the Church into all truth, how is it that these first successors of the Apostles got so much wrong?Another problem for the authors is that they typically say the point of departure from what they think are proper early Church understandings occurred in the fourth century, starting with the Edict of Milan in 313, when Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire. One problem with this view is that the Church already had firmly in place and without dissent by the middle to the end of the second century the same structures, patterns of worship, Eucharistic practice and meanings, and ministry that it had in the fourth century. Yes, there were developments and fuller explanations of already existing practices and understandings, but there is no discontinuity of any significance between the second and third century Church and the Church of the fourth century. But if you acknowledge that the Church was essentially Catholic by the end of the first century or beginning of the second century--which just about nobody disputes these days--you have a very difficult time explaining how a Church whose leadership either knew the Apostles or knew men that knew them so quickly departed from supposed New Testament understandings. Better to move the departure point forward to the fourth century, which is what the authors do.But wait a minute. Does it really do any good to locate the Big Departure in the fourth century? Isn't this the century of the Councils of Nicea and Constantinople, which once-for-all defined that Jesus was \\"of one being with the Father,\\" which all orthodox Christians believe? Wasn't this the century of one of the greatest heroes of the faith, Athanasius, who was exiled from his Episcopal See five times by Arian Emperors, and who wrote the classic text on Jesus' Incarnation, De Incarnatione Verbi Dei, for which C. S. Lewis wrote an introduction? Wasn't this the century of St. Jerome, the first great Bible translator? Wasn't this the century of the great Cappadocian Fathers, Basil the Great, Gregory Nazianzus, and Gregory of Nissa, who together pretty much saved the Church from the deadly heresy of Arianism? Wasn't this (and the first third of the fifth century) the century of St. Augustine, perhaps the greatest theologian of the Christian Church? Are these great heroes of the faith part of the \\"Pagan Christianity\\" that supposedly took over the Church of the fourth century?Speaking of Nicea, it would be interesting to hear what the authors think of the Nicene Creed, which describes the relationship between the Father and Son with a non-biblical word, homoosious--\\"of one being,\\" or \\"of the same substance\\"--against the Arian position that Jesus and the Father are homoiosious, or \\"of like substance.\\"Which brings up the fatal flaw of this book (and all \\"restorationist\\" books that try to drive a wedge between the New Testament Church and the emergence and development of the Catholic from the first through the fourth centuries): the fundamental doctrines of the Christian Church that all orthodox Christians accept as true were bitterly fought for and won by a Church that the authors consider to be so corrupted by paganism as to be essentially not in continuity with the New Testament Church. The question is, If the Church had become so corrupted by paganism, why accept the doctrinal developments but reject the ecclesiological, ministerial, liturgical, and Eucharistic developments?Protestants more knowledgeable and honest about the history of the early Church have realized that if you question these latter developments, you've got to question the doctrinal developments as well. Thus in Germany, beginning with F. C. Baur, continuing with Adolf von Harnack, and carrying through to Walter Bauer and Martin Werner, a school arose to try to drive a wedge between putative \\"primitive Christianity\\" of the first two-thirds of the first century and a \\"Hellenized Catholic Christianity\\" that arose between the end of the Apostolic Age and the beginning of the second century. A similar and even more radical movement arose to try to drive a wedge between Jesus and Paul. Whatever traction these movements may have gained at one time has been entirely undone in the face of recent Early Church scholarship, which has shown these positions to be completely untenable. (See Ben F. Meyer's The Aims of Jesus, The Early Christians: Their World Mission and Self-Discovery, and Critical Realism & the New Testament; and N. T. Wright, The New Testament and the People of God, for an overview of the decline of these movements.)More recently, especially in the U. S., a similar, more radically postmodern movement has arisen, with even more specious results, under the leadership of persons like Bart Ehrman, Elaine Pagels, and John Dominic Crossan, trying to establish a multiplicity of equally valid Christianities that were eventually subdued by Catholic Christianity. Important to note is that all these movements acknowledge the uncontested appearance on the scene of an essentially Catholic Christianity as the normative expression of Christianity as soon as non-biblical Church documents begin to appear around the end of the first century. Thus, if the task of the committed \\"restorationist\\" to decouple the primitive Church from the Catholic Church is to succeed, it must begin at a much earlier date than Viola and Barna assert and it must be more all-encompassing, embracing a critique of doctrinal developments (orthodoxy) as well as practical developments (orthopraxy). But all this has already been tried and has failed, from Liberal German Protestantism to the Jehovah's Witnesses, from Adventism to Mormonism, from the Plymouth Brethren to the \\"Table Church\\" movement.All in all, Pagan Christianity is a deeply flawed book that fails to give either an accurate or coherent picture of what was really going on in the Christian Church from New Testament times through the fourth century and beyond."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"I know this book will have its critics, but it will only be those who will attempt to keep the institution called \`Church' alive, those who derive their very livelihood from it.For years, I had this nagging feeling deep in my spirit that something is very, very wrong in my walk with Christ. I never doubted Him, I just doubted what I was busy with. Reading Viola's book was like coming home from a long imprisonment. Lord knows, I have tried all the 'formulas' of what the institutional church told me a 'good Christian' should do, but I almost ended up a bigger mess than when I got there in the first place. All along, Jesus was calling me not to do it their way, but to do it His way.Pagan Christianity simply confirmed in words and with scripture what my own spirit was screaming out since my conversion - I just did not have the ability to define it myself. Reading this book gave me the confidence that what I sensed all along was not \`rebellion', but simply God's Sprit trying to teach me the Lord's ways and not the church' ways.

The first was the nailing of Martin Luther's Ninety-five Thesis (or topics for debate) on the door of Castle Church at Wittenberg in 1517. The second was the publishing of the New Testament in English by William Tyndale in 1525 (for which he was executed as a heretic). In my opinion, \\"Pagan Christianity\\" is a \\"church-quake\\" of equal magnitude.The fact that a major publisher like Tyndale would publish this book is astonishing. Most of Frank's earlier works have been published \\"in the underground\\" through his own publishing house, \\"Present Testimony Ministry.\\" As such, he has had a wide following in the house-church movement, but little known outside. That's about to change. In the preface to \\"Pagan Christianity,\\" Tyndale offers their explanation on why they would publish such a controversial book stating it was out of their \\"desire to see the church operate according to biblical principles and be a full expression of God's grace and truth.\\" So the church doesn't operate according to biblical principles, and is not a full expression of God's grace and truth?\\" Shocking! But that's the main point of \\"Pagan Christianity\\" and its plea to return to the beginning. The fact that Tyndale supports this endeavor, and is willing to put their reputation on the line, seems to add potent legitimacy to the most controversial book written since Luther and Tyndale raised such a ruckus 600 years ago.And while Luther paid lip-service extolling the priesthood of all believers, he did very little \\"practically\\" to blur the distinctions between the clerical class and the laity. The same church hierarchy that Luther railed against simply changed its suit. The Catholic priest who officiated over all things spiritual morphed into the Protestant pastor*, who did the same. Ouch!Consider these words from Paul regarding God's purposes for the Church:And this is the purpose: that through the church the complicated, many-sided wisdom of God in all its infinite variety and innumerable aspects might now be made public to the angelic rulers and authorities in the heavenly sphere. Eph 3:8-10 (Amp)Please read those words, carefully, again. Perhaps a third time. Now look at the average \\"church service\\". As \\"Pagan Christianity\\" points out, the order of the protestant ritual is the same, week after week and year after year. The denomination doesn't matter. High church or low church, all follow the same predictable pattern. Here's what Luther gave us 600 years ago, and what we are still following today:SingingPrayerSermonAdmonition to the peopleLord's SupperSingingPost-Communion prayerBenediction\\"Innumerable aspects?\\" \\"Infinite variety?\\" \\"Many-sided?\\" This is not the Chuch of Jesus Christ as described in the heart of God. This is \\"McChurch.\\" The order of service is the same, and tastes the same, always, no matter where it's served up (and we Protestants think we have something over our Catholic brethren and their \\"rituals\\"). \\"Anointed\\" preaching? Perhaps. \\"Charismatic\\" preacher? Probably. But if it's all coming out of a single funnel, this is not classic Christianity. As Paul writes: \\"But if the whole were all a single organ (mouth), where would the body be?\\" I Cor. 12:19. If Paul was asking that question then, imagine what he would be asking now. If His body can't be found, could it be because His headship over His Church has been replaced by human agencies and traditions?An earlier writer, Elton Trueblood, wrote \\"prophetically\\" of the church's return to the primal genesis of the early church. He stated that Luther's reformation has some unfinished business. And just as Tyndale gave the scriptures to the common person, a second reformation will be ignited when the church is given back to the people with the abolition of the laity:\\"Our opportunity for a big step lies in opening the ministry to the ordinary Christian in much the same manner that our ancestors opened Bible reading to the ordinary Christian. To do this means...the inauguration of a new Reformation while in another it means the logical completion of the earlier Reformation in which the implications of the position taken were neither fully understood nor loyally followed.\\"The more we study the early Church the more we realize that it was a society of ministers. About the only similarity between the Church at Corinth and a contemporary congregation...is that both are marked, to a great degree by the presence of sinners. After that the similarity ends, for we think it is normal for one man to do all the preaching, while the others are audience, whereas in Corinth, many did the preaching, \\"When you come together,\\" reported their most famous visitor, \\"EACH ONE a hymn, a lesson, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation\\" (I Cor. 14:26). The ministry of original Christianity was one of its most revolutionary aspects. In contrast to all previous models, the new fellowship emerged as a dynamic force without priest or rabbi or medicine man.\\"One of the reviewers, if I understand him correctly, implies that the church is \\"progressive\\" in nature and questions whether or not we need, or should, return to the New Testament pattern. I suppose by \\"progressive\\" he infers that it has \\"evolved\\" into its current structure of three songs and a sermon with a \\"professional\\" class of Christians performing and an \\"audience\\" class of spectators. First of all, we need to be asking ourselves if what we are doing now is an improvement over what happened then. If we are to judge by the fruit of our endeavors with that of theirs, we are forced to concede that we have fallen far from something of sublime power and genius.Secondly, this idea of the Church progressing into something \\"new and improved\\" can't be found in scripture. Contrarily, Paul states prophetically that soon after his departure, ravenous wolves would come in and destroy the flock. Acts 20:29 \\"Pagan Christianity\\" really is the historical account of this destruction and the church's departure from the Apostolic blueprint. We can scarcely take any credit for remembering what they taught us and adhering to the traditions they passed on to us. I Cor. 1:11.Thirdly, the letters to the churches reveal a constant theme regarding church meetings, which is the MUTUAL CONTRIBUTION of ALL members under the HEADSHIP OF JESUS CHRIST. No priestly or pastoral caste system can be found or magically extracted from the New Testament accounts. No sermons, no pews, no passive priesthood:God has arranged the LIMBS and ORGANS in the body, EACH PARTICULAR ONE just as He wished and saw fit and with the best adaptation. But if the whole were all a single organ, where would the body be? I Cor. 12:17-19.And He has put all things under His feet and has appointed Him the universal and supreme Head of the church, a HEADSHIP EXERCISED THROUGHOUT(each member), which is His body, the fullness of Him Who fills ALL IN ALL--for in that body lives the full measure of Him Who makes everything complete and Who fills EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE WITH HIMSELF. Eph 1:22-23In Him EACH SEPARATE PIECE of building, properly fitting into its neighbor GROWS TOGETHER into a temple, consecrated to the Lord. YOU ARE ALL part of this building in which God Himself lives by His Spirit. Eph. 2:22YOU ALL belong to one body, of which there is one Spirit, just as YOU ALL experienced one calling to one hope. There is one...Father of us all, who is the One OVER ALL, the One working THROUGH ALL, and the One living IN ALL. Eph. 4:4His intention was the perfecting and the full equipping of (all) the saints, that THEY should do the work of ministering toward building up of Christ's body...Eph. 4:12For because of Him, the WHOLE BODY, the Church in ALL ITS VARIOUS PARTS closely jointed and firmly knit together...when EACH PART is working properly in all its functions, grow to full maturity, building itself up in love. Eph 4:16.Let the word spoken by Christ have its home in your hearts...as you TEACH AND ADMONISH AND TRAIN ONE ANOTHER in all insight and intelligence and wisdom in spiritual things. Col. 3:16But to EACH ONE is given the manifestation of the Holy Spirit...for the good and profit OF ALL. I Cor.12:7Now you collectively are Christ's body and individually you are members of it, EACH PART severally and distinct--EACH with his own place and function. I Cor. 12:27If the whole church assembles...(and) ALL prophesy--giving inspired testimony and interpreting the divine will and purpose--and an unbeliever or untaught outsider comes in...he will worship God, declaring that God is among you in very truth. I Cor. 14:23What then is the right course? When you meet together, EACH ONE has a hymn, a teaching, a disclosure of special knowledge or information, an utterance in a strange tongue or its interpretation. But let everything be constructive and edifying and for the good of all. I Cor. 14:26I want to bring you some spiritual strength, and that means that I will be strengthened by you, EACH OF US helped by THE OTHER'S faith. Roman 1:12Open your hearts to ONE ANOTHER as Christ opened His heart to you, and God will be glorified. Rom. 15:7ALL OF US have no veils on our faces, but reflect like mirrors the glory of the Lord. II Cor. 3:18You should be most careful that there should not be in any of you that wickedness of heart...but help EACH OTHER to stand firm in the faith everyday, while it is still called \\"today.\\" Heb. 3:14And let us not hold aloof from our church meetings, as some do, but let us do all we can to help ONE ANOTHER'S faith. Heb. 10:25These scriptures, and many others, support what Frank and George have written regarding what went wrong, and the institutional scandal that replaced the \\"one anothers\\" of the New Testament with a religous, top-heavy heiarchial** structure of \\"professional\\" Christians. Dirty laundry? You bet! But it's time to clean up our act! Christ is returning for a church without spot or wrinkle. Could those be \\"age\\" spots? Christ is not returning for an \\"old\\" church. He is returning for a church that has renewed the glorious dew of her youth. This is a church that has not only renewed her first love for her Lord but for \\"each other\\" as well.Mathew 19:6 states that whatever God brings together, let no man tear apart. In its infancy, the church was wedded to specific Apostolic teaching regarding spiritual and practical ways she was to conduct herself when meeting together. \\"Pagan Christianity\\" exposes the chasm that subverted these teachings and seeks to bridge the gap between what was, what can be, and by the grace of Christ, will be again.Buy and read this book first and then consider:Normal Christian Church Life, TheRethinking the Wineskin: The Practice of the New Testament ChurchThe Company of the CommittedThe Incendiary FellowshipUnfinished Business: Returning the Ministry to the People of GodNote to Tyndale: Thank you for following the sacrifical example of your namesake in publishing this book.

I was heavily involved in the cell church movement, but I kept seeing that the \\"cell group\\" meeting was the basic Christian community, and the \\"large celebration gathering\\" was a supplement to that where the cells gathered to worship and receive teaching. I was talking to the leaders of my church about placing more emphasis on the small meetings and less on the larger gathering. It never happened. The smaller meeting remained as a supplement to the \\"main thing\\" which was the Sunday morning gathering for corporate praise and a 40 minute sermon.When I read Pagan Christianity everything began to make sense. I saw that the current format of our Sunday gatherings in western Christianity was never the intention of the Lord Himself or of the early apostles. I began to see how the many-membered Body of Christ could function together solely under the headship of the Lord Jesus and without the confusion of the clergy-laity distinction. In fact I learned that the office of the modern Pastor as understood and practiced in our modern Protestant churches has no Biblical basis at all. This explained much of the burn-out and depression that I was seeing in church leaders. By releasing all believers to function in their ministries and giftings we reduce the amount of stress on leaders and allow them to function the way Jesus really designed them to function: as equippers and coaches.Shortly after reading this book I left the institutional church that I was a part of and found an organic church. I have never looked back. The community that I am experiencing now in organic church both exciting and challenging, exhilirating and difficult at the same time. I would not trade it in for anything in the church world!Thanks Frank for writing this ground breaking book!"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"I must say that Frank Viola and George Barna do an excellent job at explaning the historical roots of the traditions of what we have been calling \\"church\\". I am a student of church history myself and have been for about 20 years. It can get quite complex and confusing to the casual reader, but these authors lay it out in a simple and very readable format.I am an individual who never takes things at face value. I am always questioning the origins and reasons and motivations behind everything we do \\"in the name of Christ\\". I discovered many of these same things that Viola and Barna describe in this book many years ago. Why do we have church buildings? Where did they come from? Why do we have pews and pulpits, choirs, and Sunday school classes? Where did the clergy/laity system originate and why? What about one man ministry and the modern day pastorate?Viola and Barna answer these questions and then back it up with a huge amount of documentation and historical proof. The footnotes are everywhere in this book! So these questions are answered both intelligently and accurately. And many people are upset about this. The fact is that the truth hurts and actually threatens many present systems and financial structures. But truth is truth nonetheless. The brave thing to do is to face these facts head on and then decide what we are going to do about it. Not run and hide in a corner or lash out at the authors. Please don't shoot the messengers! Just see the truth and receive it. If you honestly take these things to the Lord and do your homework, you will see these brothers are telling the truth.But there is much more at stake here.The problem isn't so much that we are practicing traditions that are unbiblical. We all have traditions that we practive everyday that have nothing to do with the New Testament.The problem is that these traditions actually hinder the life of God and the eternal purpose of God from being fulfilled in the Church. That's where the danger lies. First, the fact that we believe these things to be biblical is an outright deception. Second, these practices are hindering God's people from being, living, and functioning as the Body of Christ, the Bride of Christ, and the House of God. This is why these brothers have written this book. I believe that they honestly want to see God get what He wants!Please brothers, keep up the good work!"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"The book is a passionate plea to explore not only the roots of church practices but a challenge to discover His ways,His thoughts and most of all His heart concerning the Church which is His body.

Because of reading this book, I have wrestled with every facet of my Christian walk. I have even been struggling with my call into ministry, being in occupational ministry, even how I make my living.Have you ever wondered why we Christians do what we do for church every Sunday morning? Why do we \\"dress up\\" for church? Why does the pastor preach a sermon each week? Why do we have pews, steeples, choirs, and seminaries? Pagan Christianity reveals the startling truth: most of what Christians do in present-day churches is not rooted in the New Testament, but in pagan culture and rituals developed long after the death of the apostles.Co-authors Frank Viola and George Barna support their thesis with compelling historical evidence to document the full story of modern Christian church practices. It's a compelling book, that is, at times, very difficult to read. Please consider this a warning, you cannot walk away from this book unchanged.The question is, \\"will you react to what you have read, or will you be informed by it?\\"If I could somehow purchase this book for every church leader, minister, and John Q. Churchgoer, that I know, have known, or will ever know, I would...wholeheartedly. I cannot recommend this book enough.My fear is that when we get to heaven and we stand before God, He reveals that we somehow missed it. By focusing on traditions rather than the foundations that the First Century church left us, we will have labored in vain.\\"Why do your disciples break from the traditions of the Elders?\\" (Mt. 15:2)"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Three books by Frank Viola have had a profound influence on me and on how I understand the church: Rethinking the Wineskin, Pagan Christianity and Who's Your Covering? In these books, Viola pulls no punches and gets right to the point of examining why we \\"do\\" church the way we do. I first read them a few years ago as an associate pastor wrestling with the question: What is church supposed to be like? Viola's books gave me encouragement, comfort, insight, useful information and much food for thought.It used to be that you had to search out Viola's books by going to his website, [...]. His books were self-published and not available in bookstores. It seemed as if no Christian publisher or retailer would touch his books due to their incendiary content.Recently however, George Barna (founder of The Barna Group, a highly respected Christian research firm) teamed up with Viola to revise and re-release Pagan Christianity. This time around, it is being published and distributed by Tyndale House (brave souls they must be).Pagan Christianity traces the roots of our most commonly accepted church elements--from church buildings to choirs to sermons to worship leaders to clergy to tithing--and finds that they were not a part of the New Testament church but were later imported into Christendom from the surrounding cultures. That in itself doesn't make such things bad, but it does make them not inherently Christian and not necessary for a church to exist and function.Viola and Barna go further to show how some of these practices actually are detrimental to the proper functioning of the Body of Christ. For example, church buildings are oftentimes a drain on resources, especially considering the ratio of time that they are in use versus their cost. Another example: The emphasis on ministry being performed by professional clergy actually thwarts the growth of Christians into mature followers of Jesus by turning them into a passive audience.I picked up a copy of the revised Pagan Christianity last week and have thoroughly enjoyed reading through it again. I can't recommend this book highly enough. If I were a rich man, I would purchase millions of copies, delivering them free of charge (and in plain brown wrappers) to church pastors everywhere and hiring volunteers to hand out free copies in church parking lots. I guess it's a good thing I'm not a rich man."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"This book was a waste of money. The authors could have said it all in one paragraph, we believe house churches are the real way to do church and everything else is wrong. And I don't really touch the arrogant way it is written. Writers that write about topics like this and then show no humility make it difficult to read or hear what they have to say. I mean for crying it loud the last I knew Barna was a member at Saddle Back or one of the other mega-churches and here he is now pushing house churches. Dressing up for church, pulpits, tithing, buildings, preaching etc. You name it they are the experts. I mean most mainline churches don't demand anyone dress up anymore. This was some great example of being in touch with reality. I have read lots of historical writers and if I had to say read something to explain history I would recommend N.T Wright or someone like that. George please stick to \\" the survey says' type books."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Pagan Christianity Ruined My LifeThis isn't a review of the book but rather a personal examination of the impact that it has had on my life and that of my family. The title \\"Pagan Christianity Ruined My Life\\" may seem a bit dramatic but it truly reflects what has happened over the past 3 1/2 years.Set the wayback machine to 2007 and the foundation of our belief system was solid and secure. We were 13 year veterans of a growing mega church, actively involved in volunteering, church attendance, and part of a close-knit group of friends in a Sunday School class. It was during this year that the senior and founding pastor announced that he desperately needed our prayers. For the past couple of years he had felt isolated and overwhelmed with the responsibilities that he had and he was taking a 3 month sabbatical to recenter and upon his return, an internal reformation began in the church. This meant that traditions were abolished and the focus of the church changed. Sunday school was cancelled, small groups established, and voting was no longer used for appointing deacons and elders since they would be chosen by the senior pastor (the new CEO of the church organization). This was an unsettling time for most since the very foundations of how we did church were changing. The grousing was prevalent and polarized the church and by early 2008 some had left, some stayed, and most longed for the way things used to be. A handful took an oblique view and asked are we really doing church the way it should be done.I had read Revolution by George Barna and saw that he had a new book out called Pagan Christianity (sorry Frank, I didn't know who you were back then). I was absolutely shocked and amazed at what I was reading (it was my \\"I could have had a V8\\" moment).The way in which church was being done and all of the traditions that we held near and dear to our hearts were nothing but man-made or even worse, pagan traditions, that didn't have any New Testament roots.I shared the ideas and facts presented in the book with all of our friends and was discouraged by the outright rejection that we met with. It wasn't the rejection of the content of the book that amazed me but rather the outright verbal persecution that we personally received from very close friends. Friends who felt abandoned (they actually used the word \`abandoned') because we were wanting to do something different. By different I mean that we didn't want to start shopping around with them for a new church to attend. When we stated that we really wanted to live a shared life of community with other brothers and sisters in Christ and that we wanted to meet under the headship and Lordship of Jesus the first question is always, \\"Who is going to lead it?\\"Unfortunately, friendships changed and we were treated like members of a cult with one close friend stating that \\"We were on the edge of a cliff ready to fall off\\". If falling off a cliff means that Jesus is our \`all in all' and that we want to live by the Tree of Life rather than the tree of knowledge of good and evil, then I want a ruined life."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"I began reading this book because I just kept thinking that something didn't seem \\"right\\" with the way we were doing church in America. Why did the \\"church\\" continue to decline in our society and why were people leaving it in masses? Why did I feel a yearning for so much more? What my spirit hinted at, this book confirmed. Organized religion was no longer the church!I read it feeling like the curtains had been torn away that were seperating me from my God! I consider this the most influential book in my life next to the Bible.Once you learn the truth, there's no going back and a more passionate and true faith to enjoy!"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"This 300 page historical work is an incredibly powerful treatise that uncovers so many assumed traditions that Christians have embraced for centuries. The author systematically and clearly refutes the popular notion that the contemporary church structure and its practices are not grounded in the Bible. The author is not saying that Christianity is pagan. He upholds the inspiration of Scripture and the orthodox tenants of the Christian faith. But he shows that the contemporary practices of the present church system are not Biblically sound and gives a wealth of documentation to support his case. Roman Catholics will vehemently hate this book and savagely attack it by straining at gnats because it exposes the nexus of Jewish, pagan, and Roman mystical elements that underpin the denomination. Contrary to what some reviewers have stated, the book is filled with direct firsthand quotes. Scholars who are referenced in connection with the church fathers are those who have compiled, edited, and exegeted the lives and writings of the fathers. I researched many of these references myself and they pan out with the firsthand sources. It is interesting to me that one reviewer, a Roman Catholic condemned this book in favor of Robert Banks' work. Banks' conclusions in a number of his writings are in perfect line with the conclusions in this book. I enthusiastically recommend it to any open minded person."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"PC is an excellent treatise on church history and how we've gotten where we are with regard to our worship expressions and traditions.

What if the very thing you are so certain of and cherish so much is exposed for what it really is, and you find that you have been essentially living a lie your entire life?Pagan Christianity?: Exploring the Roots of Our Church PracticesFrank Viola and George Barna collaborate together in this production from 2008 called Pagan Christianity. The book sets out to uncover deeply held beliefs and practices that many view as orthodox Christianity. Frank and George pull out all the stops in this treatise against the 'institutionalized' system of the Christian church and set out to trumpet a return to the church's biblical foundations. Frank and George instigate the presuppositions of the church of our day by contrasting it with historical and researched data while all the while campaigning for a more 'organic' approach.From the book, \\"We are also making an outrageous proposal: that the church in its contemporary, institutional form has neither a biblical nor a historical right to function as it does. This proposal, of course, is our conviction based on the historical evidence that we shall present in the book. You must decide if that proposal is valid or not.\\" (page xx)This book is a solid left-hook to the presuppositions and deeply held church traditions of our day. A few years ago, this would have been an extremely difficult book for me to read. But after reviewing the evidence contained in the scriptures, the attestation of scholarship, and willing to be challenged, I have been more swayed now than ever. What I once thought was 'church' never resembled anything close to what is revealed in the New Testament. Frank Viola and George Barna have assembled an excellent survey of the current church characteristics in modern Christendom, commented on them, and backed up their argumentation with a solid list of references, all jam packed into each chapter. You can read the fist chapter of this book online for free, or purchase it from your favorite book retailer.Some of the fundamental flaws of this book are its purpose and lack of depth in the exegesis of some of the entries. Granted, the book presents a survey of the problems the authors see in the institutional church, sometimes it would do well to elaborate further on certain proof-texts that are often cited in defense of institutional practices. Furthermore, the refutation of the latter would be better received with more detailed presentation of the points. To the defense of the authors, they consistently claim that those explanations will come with greater detail in the follow up book, Reimagining Church: Pursuing the Dream of Organic Christianity, Frank Viola's positive follow up to the 'instigation' of Pagan Christianity.All in all, if you are up for a challenging read, and you currently scratch your head every Sunday asking yourself, \\"Why do we do what we do?\\" You will probably find this book an intriguing, fast-paced, and invigorating read. I highly recommend it. Without agreeing to all of Frank and George's propounded views in this entry, I would state that they have done their homework. Where there is disagreement, further investigation quickly becomes warranted, and that is just based on their references alone."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"The author finds many things wrong with the church, and some validly so. However, he offers no viable alternative. The model he does suggest offers more problems than in the church. I think that this book can be detrimental to the faith of almost any Christian who desires that his life count for the glory of God. It offers plenty of information to the person who only wants to serve as a critic of the church and do nothing profitable for God."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"As a graduate of a Bible college, a former institutional church pastor and church planter, this is the last book that I ever thought I'd read or recommend. Let me just say that I read Pagan Christianity, and it was one of the most life changing and challenging books I have read in my Christian life. I strongly recommend every Christian read this book.I fell in love with Jesus at the age of 18. He was everything to me and He was the motivation for everything I did. As you would expect, I was instructed to grow in my newfound faith by joining a local institutional church in my city. I jummped through every hoop that was asked of me. I climbed the 'ranks' within my institutional church system much the way one does in a corporation. After a while, I was recognized as one who had a calling into the ministry. This eventually led me to a Christian University where I would get trained for my profession. After college and few years into my job as an institutional church Pastor, I recognized something very troubling. I was dying on the inside. I could not figure out why. What was I doing wrong? My love for God and people had grown cold. I worked for God, but I wasn't in love anymore. Everything revolved around 'buildings', 'bodies', and 'budgets'. Although I would not have admitted it, Jesus had become a side issue. Simply put, The marriage had grown cold.I began to question why the church I led (or had ever seen for that matter) looked so different from the church I read about in the scriptures. If scripture is authoritative, why was my job as a Pastor & why were the church services that we focused so much energy on nowhere to be found in the scriptures? Why did the Western Church look so different than the underground church movements in Asia that I witnessed overseas? After being warned not to read this 'dangerous' book, I finally read Pagan Christianity. I was relived yet challenged. My suspicions were confirmed by the facts of history contained within this book. I quickly realized that some of the most important terms that a Christian should grasp have been completely redefined! The book clearly and compellingly makes the case that the modern understanding and function of the institutional church have been more influenced by Pagan thought and practice than by the New Testament. These two understandings stand opposed to each other.It is necessary for us come back to a scriptural understanding of essential concepts like 'The Body of Christ', 'Church' , 'Pastor', 'Church Meetings' etc... These basic concepts will fundamentally alter the way we understand Jesus Himself. I can say from experience that while what you find out about the institutional church system may unnerve you at first, this book will be the beginning of a glorious journey that will lead you to rediscover Jesus and His bride in a way you never knew. Ignorance is not bliss this time...take the plunge!"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"I have been a Christian for 17 years, and after 16 years of watching comedy hour every Sunday morning, with the exception of a couple churches, there is finally an answer as to why; Pagan Christianity! My wife and I attented, at minimum, 20+ churches over a 16 year period. We have seen it all, been through multiple denominations, doctrines, i.e. Charismatic, Calvinistic Reformed, Baptist, Evangelical Free, Bible Church, and on and on it goes. For many years we saw false smiles, nice clothes, rock concerts; I mean worship service, manipulation, lies, oppression, legalism and the like, all in the name of Jesus Christ! We've seen families divided by doctrine, love that says, \\"if you believe what we believe we love you\\", hypocrisy, extreme judgementalism, the love of money... I say, \\"over a 16 year period\\", because we stopped attending \\"the church\\" a year ago. I will no longer subject my family to the intstitutional church, and all of it's traditions, period.While I am positive that Pagan Christianity is ruffling church goer feathers around the globe, I am also positive that, for the most part, everything said in it is fact. I lived it for years, and I saw it for years, but could never put my finger on what in the world was going on. You see, man made tradition is extremely deceptive, and many are held captive by it. Pagan Christianity reveals this in crystal clear history, and will absolutely blow you away! After reading this, all the pieces of the puzzle are brought together. You will no longer look at church on Sunday morning as a legitimate source for growing your faith. Be warned, however, if you start talking about this to others who are going to the institutional church, you will be belittled and cast out as an outsider, rebelious, back slidden Christian. Look at it this way, history shows us what happens when anyone trys to break away from the institutional church, be it Pharisees, Catholics, or Protestants. Get the book and be prepared for changes!

Are we really growing spiritually like we should by doing these things?If you can't read the whole book, then definitely make an effort to read the last two chapters; \\"Reapproaching the New Testament,\\" and \\"A second glance at the Savior.\\" They show us how we can grow close to Christ free of our own limiting mindsets.It's a liberating book and an encouragement to grow deeper still in Christ and in the faith."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"I found this book to be an explicit criticism of many of the practices in Christian churches today which claim to be biblical but are not. Mr. Viola backs up his criticism with both scriptures and historical facts. A very enlighteneing book for those who are stuck in binding traditions which inhibit their spiritual freedom and growth. I highly recommend this book to all Christians."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"While the book, \\"Pagan Christianity?\\", does get many to reconsider traditions of men that need to be let go and exhorts Christians to look at the New Testament with fresh eyes, associating Christian practices to paganism is extremely far-fetched. Pulpits and pews are made out to have pagan origins as though these have no practicality. For which one could not help but reply that we could make the case that certain styles of roofing, flooring, agriculture, and so much of culture have pagan origins too. The writers even give this extreme by saying, \\"The use of chairs and pile carpets in Christian gatherings has no biblical support either. And both we invented by pagans\\" (P. 75). Should we lay aside carpets and chairs too? If someone should make the case for pagan origins of the construction of homes, would any Christians have anywhere to assemble since house-churches are pagan? Paganism isn't the motivation of using these inventions, but rather these are accepted for practicality. I find it strange that the authors don't compare their own statements saying, \\"The Christians picked up from the pagans the practice of having meals in honor of the dead\\" (P. 16). Skeptics would love to make such an association to the Lord's Supper and accuse Christ and the Apostle Paul of taking this from paganism too. Why not also recognize that the codex form of the Bible originated from a pagan poet and that only scrolls are truly biblical?The most striking thing about \\"Pagan Christianity?\\" are the blatant double standards. One quote in particular shows this, \\"John Newton rightly said, 'Let not him who worships under a steeple condemn him who worships under a chimney.' With that in mind, what biblical, spiritual, or historical authority does any Christian have to gather under a steeple in the first place?\\" (P. 43)How can an advocate for house-churches condemn judging from those with church-buildings toward house-churches, and yet do likewise and judge those who worship under steeples?The underlying purpose of the book is to promote \\"open meetings\\" by twisting and disregarding scripture. \\"Open meetings\\" are assemblies of \\"open sharing\\", which means open participation where everyone has the opportunity to take a turn in bringing some act of worship openly before the entire church. This may sound nice, but it isn't the Biblical assembly. Their scriptural proof comes down to misusing a rebuke as an authorized example in 1 Corinthians 14:26, which says, \\"How is it then, brethren? Whenever you come together, each of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for edification.\\" The authors believe this text to mean that each person had a role and each person participated in the Assembly, but rather Christ's Spirit was condemning that practice. Jesus Christ's Spirit through Paul said that rather than everyone \\"Let two or three\\" speak and \\"let the first keep silent\\" (1 Cor. 14:29-30, P. 82). Frank Viola's book also makes the Assembly out to be a number of gatherings in different houses and yet one local church while 1 Corinthians 14:23 says, \\"the whole church comes together in one place\\", which is the exact scriptural context of his assertions. In such meetings, women also take a role in speaking over men while 1 Corinthians 14:34, \\"Let your women keep silent in the churches, for they are not permitted to speak; but they are to be submissive, as the law also says.\\" Christianity is a submission religion where everyone must submit to someone else, and do so not by force, but their own free-will choice in submission to Christ. Like today, some of the Corinthians thought they were more spiritual than the Apostle Paul on these matters for which Paul replied, \\"If anyone thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things which I write to you are the commandments of the Lord\\" (14:37).This book advocates house churches only. The text has a long list of errors, inconsistencies and contradictions resulting from their own \\"clipboard mentality\\" and \\"cut-and-paste\\" approach toward the Scriptures, which they discourage(P. 229-239). These authors are truly misguided by their assumptions. The book begins and stands upon misconceptions of Church history and the twisting of Scripture to make the Assembly into a spontaneous open meeting. The book is built upon assumptions. These errors include: claiming that there existed no church-buildings or \\"special buildings\\" until the 4th century (P. 14), that the Lord's Supper was part of a common meal as part of a man-made \\"love feast\\" (P. 192-197), that the Assembly had numerous speakers including women over men (P. 55, 75, 78-79), house churches in an area being governed as one (P. 43-44), that the Church of Jesus Christ is protestant (P. 47), and that the New Testament scriptures were not gathered under the oversight of the Apostles (P. 226). The Scriptures refute these things. On the assumption that there were no special buildings of the Church in the first 3 centuries, this stands in contradiction to the synagogues and upper-rooms, which are by literal definition of \\"synagogue\\" are places (buildings) of gathering together.The most useful part of the book is the list of pagan practices in the back.I have a longer review posted at wordpress under GodsBreath.

This book is definitely a danger to any new believer for it's poor use of Scripture and history. It also makes claims that are \\"reaching\\" and have no biblical basis either. The book seems to state that the church shouldn't have a clear structure to it, but here's the structure you should use.

However, the data that is credible is agenda-laden, and mixed together with quotes from other like-minded \\"experts.\\" In fact, scriptural \\"proof texting,\\" which the authors rail against in the text, is here simply replaced by a variant version of that same practice.I wrote to George Barna not long ago, asking him if the anti-church sentiments expressed in books like this one, and specifically in his recent book \\"Revolution,\\" were part of a regular generational cycle in American life. His reply was that, \\"he didn't comment on the research of others.\\" That's like quoting from Mary Poppins: \\"Kindly do not cloud the issue with facts.\\" So the notion that what we're experiencing is nothing but part of the natural ebb and flow of generational sentiment and experience (read Strauss and Howe) would apparently undermine the preconceptions of the book, and cannot be considered.People of all stripes have claimed to have discovered the \\"real truth\\" -from early Gnostics to the present day. Were this an historical narrative, or simply about reporting polls or trends, it might be useful. Instead, it makes the claim that you can't possibly be alive in Christ unless you practice what they're telling you.

We had the Sunday School, a break, a time of \\"worship,\\" took up the offering and listened to a \\"special piece of music\\" just before the sermon, which was not to go past 11:45 so we could get the \\"altar call\\" in, and then do announcements for the week and be out by noon. And that's what we called \\"church.\\"Now, would someone please point out the above description of church in the New Testament please? Truth be told, you ain't going to find it!I have shared PC with some friends and they agree that something needs to be changed in the church. The big question now is \\"Where do we begin?\\" We have a nation full of churches that are not doing church by the book - the Bible. Paid pastors, salaried employees, elaborate buildings, probably hundreds of millions of dollars in church debt and the list could go on and on. Think of what that money could do toward feeding the hungry, clothing the needy and eliminating poverty. James chapter one, verse 27 states: Pure and undefiled religion in the sight of our God and Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their distress, and to keep oneself unstained by the world.\\" (NASB) If the church in America was rebuilt from the foundation up and doing what it is supposed to be doing we \\"may\\" have no need for a welfare system.Sharing the book with others has caused an uproar claiming that PC was way wrong and \\"mean spirited.\\" I am sorry, but if one reads the book as it was intended - to REVEAL the gradual influx of human tradition as opposed to original purpose of \\"church,\\" they would see that Viola and Barna's intent was to politely expose, not condemn.What I' have found after reading PC is that I have a ton of \\"unlearning\\" to do. I pray that the sequel to PC, \\"Reimagining Church,\\" will shed some light on the subject.I will make this suggestion to the reader. Read about 15-20 pages at a time and put the book down for a day or so. Chew on what you've read. I found it easier to digest as I pondered the pages.It's time for the church in America to wake up. There is a movement toward \\"house church,\\" the way church was originally intended in the book of Acts. Let's hope that the Body of Christ can retrace the roots of the church and pursue the Bridegroom with a holy passion."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"As a \\"fourth generation\\" Christian (if there is such a thing), and a bible college graduate, I have long questioned a lot of what is promoted as \\"church\\" and \\"ministry\\". After reading this book, most of my questions were answered and my supsicions confirmed.I know several in the ministry (different denominations) who I respect greatly and love deeply. However, after having been in countless churches where the paid staff live a life of relative ease, play golf regularly, go off on junkets for \\"God's work\\", while the congregation is working 60 hours a week, I knew that something wasn't right. Churches of gotten too big, too \\"corporate\\" (in a big business sort of way) and ministers expecting to be served instead of serving. This isn't what God intended of His church and \\"Pagan Christianity?\\" more than supports this argument.If I have a negative comment about the book, it would be that I'm not quite sure that I agree with the \\"home church\\" premise as a total replacement for the church as we know it today. I DO think that the typical church is due for a total housecleaning from the top down that MAY result in lots of home churches being formed. I dunno.

When I would ask, I usually got rolled eye balls and never a real answer. e.g. In the Church I was a part of for years, there was what was called 'After Glow' and a time for The Holy Spirit to manifest to and thru the Brethren there assembled. Why do you turn the lights down? I thought we were Children of light! (Luke 16:8; John 12:36; Ephes. 5:8; 1 Thes. 5:5;) No answer with the eye rolls.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with \\"home churches,\\" but unless Frank and George walk to the home church (or ride a mule), in sandles (or barefoot) wear one-piece togas, draw their water from a well, sip a bit of homemade wine during the meal of lentels and fava beans, they are no closer to emulating Jesus, St.Paul, the Corinthians, Galatians, and other early churches than those of us in structured churches. So what is their point? George Barna did his organization a disservice by signing on to this diatribe of modern Christian Church bashing. If the same information was presented in a positive tone, rather than a negative one, it would have been an enjoyable historical read.

Long before my walk with God led me away from organized religion, there were a lot of evangelical rites and rituals that did not ring true to me as vital or beneficial to my relationship with God, or resonate within my spirit as truths. I followed my spirit to Jesus, which led me out of organized religion. To later read the extensive research that Frank Viola and George Barna had compiled and woven together to create this book simply reaffirmed for me that the things that I had rejected were not rooted in scripture or the teachings of Jesus Christ. This book is not only educational, but enlightening. I highly recommend it, both to those who have already abandoned the institutional church for a more intimate and focused relationship with their Creator, and those who are still searching for reason, in their quest for truth."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"In my short lifespan I have heard many Church of Christ folks saying, \\"we need to get back to our roots!\\" But if they actually knew what their roots where, they might not want to go there.

My eyes were widened after I read about the origins of some of the practices I was raised on. However, this book is not for the faint-of-heart. I say that because it can really shake you up about Christianity; it might even make you angry or bitter towards Christianity. But that was not the purpose of this book. I feel the purpose was to help people have a more educated understading of why congregations do what they do and where that practice came from.

I couldn't stop reading . . .You see, I grew up SDA. Surrounded and soaked in the traditions of the church and the institutions and thoughts thereof. Though I knew God on the heart level and lived outside of the box as much as I could --- I knew little life outside of those traditions and theories. I wasn't a back row sitter in the SDA church. I was raised going to church every Sabbath at 9 am. I was schooled my whole life in church school - through college. I worked at the church's summer camp throughout my 20's, I went to VBS, I was counselor at Bible Outdoor School, I taught and directed the local kids Sabbath School for years, I did oversee missions and local missions, I was a worship-leader, I even spoke from the pulpit many times. I put together programs and implemented them. I went to the wall for defense of the 'church.' Until . . . . God called me out.At 35 my marriage was on the rocks. The Spirit lead my husband to a Wild at Heart Boot Camp put on by the Ransomed Heart Ministry team in CO and was awakened and transformed. After 35 years in the 'church' we'd never seen transformation like that. I was so blown away by his transformation and the non-existant permanent transformation of people inside the church that we were forced to take a large step bacd. We stopped going to church because when we did go -- we couldn't stomach it. It all seemed so wrong. We saw the foolishness of the traditions, the half-truths that were being preached, the posing and posturing of people during that 2 hours, and the stage-like performance of the pastor vs audience. I wanted to scream. I did and then we left. Originally we stopped going out of the shock of realizing that we'd been apart of something that claimed to change peoples lives -- but didn't. Then, it turned into more . . . .During the next 4 years God walked us into throwing out everything we once knew. We saw the bigger picture of what the modern 'church' was doing to people and telling people and the half-truths that exist there -- we were convinced that the way they were worshiping and what they were preaching was so very misleading! Of course, we knew that God may still work within the brokenness of the institutionalized church, but we wanted more of the original. Yet, had no way of finding it. We thought we were all alone. We continued to walk with God -- journeying as a family into amazing truths re-discovered and re-claimed as He brought them back to us.We were moved to write books, create online redemptive communities, host like-hearts at our home, put on Freedom Events at the local grange hall, in the mountains, at coffee shops -- we tried many things to find others searching for what we were searching for. Hungry for what we were hungry for. Walking with God lead me to buy many books on Amazon from authors like Greg Boyd, John Eldredge, CS Lewis and then I would see your book. I tried to order the older version of \\"Pagan Christianity.\\" But it was never available when I went there. It was either not the right time, or something was set against me getting it.God continued to journey us.Then, my like-hearted warrior friend called me from the East Coast and said, \\"You've got to read this book, \\"Pagan Christianity.\\" I did. I inhaled it. I cried. This book confirmed for me, with logics and statistics and history, what my heart already knew. God was already walking us away from the legalized, systematized, institutionalized and programitized way of worshiping. Away from the counterfeit. And all I wanted was to find the Church. The Church that Barna and Viola speak of in their book. All of a sudden, though we didn't have a local fellowship, I felt like I wasn't alone. Someone put into writing what I knew to be true and the why's! And now when I tell my 'church' friends about my walk and mention this book -- all I have to do is mention the authors and my friends actually take notice for they've heard of Barna from the pulpit!After reading the book and after journeying through the concept of spiritual alliances, I decided to severe my spiritual alliance with the SDA church (that took 6 months -- they didn't want to let go!). I was convinced, after reading this book, that I wanted to be aligned with the True Church. The Bride who is gathering in the First Century tradition. People who walk with God in the New Testament Tradition -- the dream of Jesus. I am done aligning myself with a man-made institution. An angel stands at the entrance to those places and warns, \\"Jesus has left the building!\\" to all those who have eyes to see.Now, I look forward to finding the Church to fellowship with in New Testament, early Celtic Christian style-- living in community organically, worshiping in that dynamic flow that Viola and Barna talk about. I have met a few like-hearts and have networked with them across the country but am needing to find worship where I live. That, my friend, Frank Viola, is harder than it seems for many of us. I appreciate your effort to connect us, but so far nothing for North Idaho. I know that there are not many. The path is narrow. There are few that find it. There are few with eyes to see. But I thank you my friend, for having the guts and the walk with God that cumulated in a book that helps us mystics out with the history and proof that help us jump away from the fire into the arms of God and His Bride. God has and will continue to use your book and your heart to call people out to the 'real.'Your walk is confirmed by my walk prior to ever reading your book. The Spirit is moving. The Trinity is moving. Aslan is on the move. We are at the End of the Age. I do crave fellowship with the Church---I pray it happens more constantly for this little family in Idaho.www.landofiona.com"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Although I understand the author's reasoning behind this book I think he generally finds just about any way possible to denigrade the church of Jesus Christ which is, after all, the church, the assembly of the elect, IS the bride of christ, NONE are perfect and we all find ways to criticize, which mr viola has done to new heigths.

Understanding the history of Church traditions is one step in healing some damaged caused by man's need for control. I think this book is an excellent read for anyone truly searching for the type of Church and relationships that God intends."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"This book pretty much sums up my understanding of the church - the body of Christ - and it's intended function when it meets together. IMHO, this should stir up believers to throw-off the emptiness of \\"doing church\\" and embrace \\"being the church\\".The bottom line is that God, by His Holy Spirit, has gifted ALL believers (according to His choice). And that giftedness is intended to be expressed within the gathering of believers. Anything less is NOT what god intends.Yes, I have read the negative reviews. One could argue all day long about this. But, in light of the example in 1 Corinthians 14 (esp. vss. 26-40), it seems very apparent that the individual expressions of Jesus Christ through the various members of the body is a must. This reliance on God through the Holy Spirit may be difficult for some, but anything less is a sham, and an affront to the God who created, saved, and sustains us.

But the meat can be tough to swallow.\\""},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"This book is wonderful!

Not only that, they show why and how these do harm to the Church.I look forward to the next book that explores how we can be more faithful to the Biblical model of the practice of the Church."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"This entire book is based on the presumption that the Bible is our ONLY authority as Christians. However, this presumption has no Scriptural basis. No where does the Bible claim to be the ONLY authority. Rather the Bible does make the claim that the CHURCH is the pillar and bullwork of truth (1 Tim 3:15). Jesus passed his authority onto the leaders of the church (the Apostles) and before they died they passed their authority onto others.When there were problems and conflicts the church, guided by the Holy Spirit, used their God given authority to settle the issues. It was using this authority that the leaders of the church would only much later assemble together the books that we know as the Bible today. It wasn't as though the Holy Spirit left the church when Constintine came to faith. Rather it wasn't until long after this that the Bible was assembled.Once the hidden presupposition of this book is revealed, the entire foundation crumbles. The book undermines itself. The Church is not pagan. Rather, the church has taken back from the Pagans, what was originally supposed to be used to glorify God. All of creation was designed to glorify God. The church simply took these things back from the pagans and turned them back to God's glory."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"As of today (6/20/08), 138 others have already written a review of Pagan Christianity. I read all of them - carefully - before venturing to add the 139th. Admittedly, there is little helpful analysis that I can add, since just about everything that can be said about this excellent and challenging book has already been provided for you in the reviews that precede mine. In fact, if you simply take the time to carefully read the reviews by David Flowers, William Dahl, John White, Jon Zens, Jill Scales, N Demaray, Clark Wade and James Miller, I can only add one word. Amen!What I would like to offer, therefore, is less of a review of the book than a review of the reviewers. Clearly, if this were some kind of an election, the \\"pro\\" side would be landslide winners. That fact by itself, of course, does not prove that Pagan Christianiy is a paradigm of insight and truth. There are many books on the market today that are awash with rave reviews that I wouldn't waste either my money to purchase or my time to read or the space on my bookshelves to display. But I did invest in a copy of Pagan Christianty, I have taken the time to carefully read it - more than once - and I will definitely assign it a prominent place on my bookshelves with other esteemed writings that I consult frequently. By the way, as a writer myself, and as a copy editor for a Christian magazine, I must add that from a style perspective alone, Pagan Christianity is a literary masterpiece. About the only criticism I can offer is that the tiny font size chosen for the footnotes is a challenge for my 73 year old eyes.Now, what about the other reviews? I've already betrayed my favorable bias toward Pagan Christianity, so other than recommending that you read the reviewers I've listed above, I can do little more than to endorse their analyses. But I do have some reactions to those who have commented unfavorably about the book. Some allege, for example, that the research is flawed. As one who majored in Church History, however, I would observe that few authors today have consulted so wide a wealth of original resources or so accurately summarized their findings. \\"The rub,\\" to quote Shakespeare, does not lie in the historical data unearthed by Viola/Barna, but rather in the widespread contemporary revisionistic interpretations of that data by defenders of church status quo.Another recurring criticism of Pagan Christianity is the allegation that its call to return to early church values and practices fails to allow for natural progress and infringes on NT freedom. That the NT does not dictate precise forms for body life, but allows for considerable freedom is certainly true. But it does provide many inviolable principles that must govern and shape whatever practices and forms we may adopt to facilitate that body life. The point of Pagan Christianity is not to interfere with the liberty for local assemblies to be creative in how they facilitate body life, but to point to Pagan practices and forms that have subtly intruded into church life over the centuries at the expense of some of those very inviolable principles. Just one case in point: the CEO \\"Pastor.\\" Perhaps we have the liberty to recognize one individual in the assembly as particularly gifted in leadership and training. Perhaps we have the liberty to give that one person the title, \\"Pastor\\" (even though there is virtually no NT justification for doing so). But when that one person becomes the focal point of all gatherings; the only one authorized to exegete God's Word; the final authority on all matters of doctrine and practice; the only one \\"ordained\\" to \\"minister,\\" etc., etc., liberty to choose forms and practices has crossed the line and transgressed the inviolable principles of \\"one another\\" ministry so clearly set forth in at least 58 distinct NT passages.I must confess that I was surprised to find several reviewers who seemed to say, \\"So what\\" to the main premise of the book - the Pagan roots for so many of the trappings and practices of today's institutional church. I would certainly agree that the mere fact that the origin of some church practice or tradition can be traced to Pagan roots does not - by itself - make that practice or tradition evil. Believers often benefit from the scientific and cultural advances of the unbelieving world in which they live. But that is not what the authors of Pagan Christianity are decrying. In every case where they trace a contemporary church practice to Pagan roots, they also provide clear evidence to show that adopting that specific Pagan practice creates a situation that runs totally counter to everything the NT teaches about body life. In every one of the many imported church practices and traditions examined by the authors, having Pagan roots does matter!This is a great book - a few negative reviews notwithstanding. Read it carefully. Then read it again. Then read the entire NT afresh to determine \\"whether these things are so.\\"Cliff Bjork, Associate Editor, Searching Together Magazine"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"The book \\"Pagan Christianity\\" does a nice job of going through many of the forms and practices common in our churches. There are so many things we accept as part of our church life without ever thinking about it. \\"Pagan Christianity\\" goes into several of these issues and explains their origins. As someone who has been a part of churches for many years, I found this book refeshing."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"This book has been one of the biggest eye-openers I have ever read in my entire 20+ year Christian life. For quite some time I have sensed there are many things that we do and practice within the church today that just don't seem right. Things that can't be found in the Bible and/or things that the early church never practiced. For example, a church building, the elevation of clergy, and the non-participatory nature of the church body. Much of what Viola/Barna expose in this book sheds light on these things and so much more. This book affirms that today's church has indeed become very institutionalized and dogmatic, having strayed far from the church modeled in scripture. It has adopted many of the ways and systems of the world, beginning in the 2nd century AD all the way up until the present time. Would the early church fathers, or even Jesus, recognize today's church? I think not.However, there are two things worth considering when reading this book: 1) Viola is very much a staunch supporter of the house church movement. This becomes very evident in Viola's writing as it seems to be the cure all for all of today's church problems. 2) We must ask ourselves is the church of Acts a prescription for the way we must do church? Or, is it just the way believers during the Apostolic period did church? While taking these two things into consideration, several questions arise: 1) Do we completely throw away millenia of church history, traditions, and doctrine and revert to the first century church? 2) Do we surrender to church history and keep going with the way things are? 3) Or, do we slowly begin to reform the current state of the church, perhaps compromising on some issues, and skipping over others to make it look more palatable to the churches that Paul planted?When the church begins to look too much like the world, perhaps it's high time for introspection and prayerfully consider reform. But, is the answer found in the house church model, or are there other options? My guess is the former, since that is what is modeled in the Bible, and how the early church did it. It's been highly recommended by several of my friends that \\"Reimagining Church\\" by Frank Viola must be read as a sequel to this book. But, I also recommend \\"The Myth of a Christian Religion\\" by Gregory Boyd who hits on other issues relating to the church. I dare any Christian, especially pastors and church leaders to read \\"Pagan Christianity\\". I also recommend this book to those who are involved in church-planting ministry. I, as a missionary have greatly benefitted from this book and look forward to implementing some of the things mentioned in this book with the start of our new church plant."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Pagan Christianity was the book that confirmed all my underlying suspicion that something wasn't quite right with the way we do church and got me more actively moving on a spiritual journey and quest for finding the living and breathing body of Christ here in this world."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"The original, \\"Pagan Christianity\\", was a horrible book. Frank Viola's scholarship was non-existent. Viola would quote second and third sources instead of reading and quoting the originals. (This is doubly inexcusable to me as a student of Church history.) Viola also extolled the value of ignorance within the Christian Church. (While I agree that the \\"house church\\" is the most enjoyable form of \\"church\\", I also demand educated teachers, counselors and pastors. The education can be formal, semi-formal or informal. I want someone who can \\"keep up\\" with the technical writings.)George Barna was repaired many of the defects of the original and, by doing so, he makes the book more acceptable for a wider audience. Instead of quoting someone who may have read the Church Fathers, Barna quotes the Church Father himself. This is much better. Regrettably, Barna does not provide the historical context of that particular Church Father. The writings in their historical context do not support Barna to the extent that he thinks the writings do. Nonetheless, the quote and the attribution will permit curious reader to read the entire writings themselves. Barna also uses more pertinent quotes of the Church Fathers than Viola did. Barna's style is much better, in my opinion, than Viola's combative and \\"take no prisoners\\" style. Barna's own history helps his position.Still, the disparaging of an educated clergy is ridiculous and not a Christian virtue. Our leaders need to be educated--both in the letter and the \\"spirit\\" of the Scriptures. Regrettably, the organized Protestant Church no longer provides for the education of its leaders and these educated leaders have come to expect to be paid. \\"What you have freely received, freely give\\" does not apply to those who spend years paying and working during formal studies. Viola and Barna should come up with a credible manner to educate Church leaders \\"for free\\". Until they do so, their demand for an unpaid clergy will go largely unmet.I gave Frank Viola's original, \\"Pagan Christianity\\", ONE star. I have given Barna's edition, THREE stars for his great efforts that greatly improved the book. Had I not read the original, I would have given it TWO starts. Barna's efforts deserve the better rating."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"The title of the book is enough to stump any one, but do not overlook the question mark..the title is a question. Is it Pagan Christianity? I don't know, but Viola and Barna make an excellent attempt at bringing forth historical facts in the origin and development of \\"church and church services\\" over time. The authors of the book are not trying to steer any one away from christianity, at least that is what I gather. For me (anchored in Christ) I had no qualms reading this book. It did nothing to shake the foundations of my faith, but it did lift a veil and I came to an agreement that I have permission to be FREE from human tradition! The book gave very informative facts that helped me to shift my focus OFF of the traditions and ON to the people, the body, the very hearts of gold that belong to God. Take away the building, take away the statues, the plates, the fancy banners, the pastor, the choir, the stage, the 3 fast songs and 4 slow songs for worship...take it all away, and what do we have? I am hoping it's JESUS REVEALED IN US! Pagan Christianity helped me to strip off Human traditions and it began a restoration of the PERSON Jesus in my life. A good book to follow up with after you read this one is \\"From Eternity to Here\\" by Frank Viola...Pagan Christianity breaks it down for you and From Eternity to Here puts it all back in perspective.Bianca"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"I thought the book was very informative and had very good historical references. The one major issue that the authors did not address is the Christian Church's tradition of Sunday worship. They stated numerous times that Constantine infused many pagan traditions into the Church, but did not address this one. There is only a footnote that directs you to an answer session on another website. And in my understanding of God's Word, the answer the author gives simply justifies keeping Sunday worship by misunderstanding verses. Finally, the context of the book seems to be in the dispensational mode, i.e. Old Testament-done away with, God's teachings and instructions-nailed to the cross, New Testament-grace. If you agree with this mode of understanding Scripture, you may really enjoy the book. If you believe that only the added Jewish ordinances, sacrifices and rituals were done away and that God's TEN commandments are still valid with no changes to any of them, including the 4th, you can still get great reference regarding paganism in the Church but may be a bit disappointed."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"This book had amazing research done, and it was well laid out.

Viola and Barna certainly did indisputable research and compiled a read that sheds Blinding Light on what we've been led to believe is THE CHURCH!First you'll read it out of curiosity, content or spiritual hunger to 'know'. Then you will re-read it through new eyes because for perhaps the first time in you walk with the Lord the scales will fall away. After that, the book literally becomes a teaching manual and an indispensible reference guide of it's own volition. You will refer to it again and again and want to share the message with others--THE ORIGINAL MESSAGE CHRIST GAVE and the disciples continued. If you've left organized/institutional 'religion' because something deep inside was missing--Pagan Christianity will help you put your finger on what it is and fill in the blanks. You will have many 'AHA!' moments and be amazed!One theme this book DOES NOT HAVE IS: an agenda--other than sharing factual historical truth--nor is it a 'How To...\\" which seems to be so popular with mega-church pastors--and we so weary of this! Pagan Christianity is succinct, to the point and leaves the reader alone to seriously examine themselves and their relationship with Jesus Christ, to what they've come to know as 'the church', their place in it and how they came to embrace what they've been taught.Also, favorable with me was, the book is not a hard sell nor is it a 'Calling' for people to LEAVE their denominations or congregations as I have heard rumored. PC allows the reader to draw their own conclusions about such an important step and if nothing else, leaves the reader WANTING to do MORE research about church beginnings,reconstruction and reformation.I admired about the book also, that Viola and Barna--NOT ONCE--ridiculed, demeaned or came off with finger pointing with the words: \\"Thus SAITH THE LORD.....though some may see it differently.If you are honest and truly desire to KNOW Christ and examine yourself and what you believe, you will weep tears of humbleness and quiet understanding that starts deep in your soul as you journey through this book! I daresay--it plants the seeds that by the end of it's Chapters gives you SOLID ROOTS--the Roots of how Christ wanted His Bride to appear before Him! We Must make ourselves ready and this is a pivitol step to understanding what God The Father is looking for in a Bride for His Son!Keep in mind: President Obama is embarking on a program/initiative to rally the 'faith based' religions all across this country to partner with him in his war on poverty and charitable 'giving'. Politics will eventually become one of the headings in the liturgical order of services and probably have it's own special heading in the church bulletin--possibly coming to a church near you as a Faith Based Initiative! (Maybe your own?) Caring for the orphan, widow and fatherless has always been the outreach of those who followed Christ. Now we need government assistance to make this happen on a larger scale?

Along with all the other books on this subject, I'm left wondering if Barna and Viola really think that everyone -- EVERYONE -- every single Christian for the past two thousand years has been so hideously and scurrilously misguided.Really? No one has it right, until now? So that whole thing Jesus said about how He was going, but would send the Holy Spirit to guide us into ALL TRUTH, that was just a lie? Jesus, the Good Shepherd who laid down His life for His sheep, He's been having a good laugh on all of us over the years, watching as we've attempted to reach Him, but apparently failing to such an extent that we've devolved into pagan practices that are as far removed from \\"authentic\\" Christianity as, well, the \\"Babylonian mystery religions\\" are removed from the ineffable and superior wisdom of Barna and Viola.What an absolute load of garbage.Listen, if you're a home churcher, BE ONE. You have free will, right? Please feel free to come to Christ on your own terms and have church in your living room or out on your deck or even driving around in the car looking at God's creation. Please yourself! But you don't have to subscribe to the ridiculous notion that everyone called by Christ since His ascension into heaven is wrong and bad and pagan.Unless, of course, the reason for this book and the others like it is to, I don't know, maybe justify a mode of worship that one ought to have the spiritual intuition to know is not pleasing to God, but rather is an enormous boost to one's own ego, looking at all the people trooping into churches and scornfully thinking, \\"Oh, those poor benighted pagans, thinking that they can truly know God and find grace and accept the gift of salvation through the merits of Jesus' death and resurrection in THAT pit of deceit.\\" Trying to provide proof to substantiate one's own agenda by outlining how stupid every other Christian has been compared to you and your big smarts doesn't strike me as compelling evidence that Barna and Viola are on to anything.Because honestly, in reading this book, that's what shines through: a real issue of puffed-up, self-congratulatory pride, basted with something passing for scholarship. It's so incredibly sad, seeing how many people have been gammoned by this nonsense."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Frank's books, especialy \\"Pagan Christianity\\" rocked my \\"religious\\" world and set me on a path for more.

Thank you for revealing the \\"more\\" in Christianity to this stay-home mom of 4! Enjoying the rocking immensely!!!"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"House-church advocate Frank Viola and Christian pollster George Barna collaborated on this revised edition of Viola's original book by the same title, and the result is so controversial that publisher Tyndale issued a rare disclaimer in the form of a preface. \\"Tyndale does not necessarily agree with all of the authors' positions and realizes that some readers may not either,\\" the preface reads in part. \\"At the same time, we stand united with Frank and George in our desire to see the church operate according to biblical principles and be a full expression of God's grace and truth.\\"The controversy stems from the authors' assertion, backed up by exhaustive research and more than a thousand footnotes, that most of the traditions, practices and rituals associated with what we call church are rooted in pagan culture. Viola and Barna document the non-biblical sources of nine specific aspects of church life --- buildings, the order of worship, sermons, the pastorate, vestments, music ministry, tithing and clergy salaries, baptism and the Lord's Supper, and Christian education --- as they challenge Christians to think long and hard about the familiar elements that most believers take for granted.At the heart of the authors' argument is the misuse of the word \\"church\\" --- which, as I would hope most Christians know, refers to the corporate body of believers. Despite knowing that, many Christians continue to think of the word in terms of a building, diluting their understanding of Christian community and thereby giving rise to a host of other problems --- not the least of which is the very existence of church buildings. After meeting in private homes for several hundred years, Christians, who had in other ways begun to adopt the \\"magical thinking\\" of pagans, were ready to adopt the pagan notion of sacred spaces, and the church building was born. Viola and Barna devote considerable space to showing how the church's \\"edifice complex\\" has hindered rather than fostered genuine worship and Christian community.One troubling aspect of the book is the occasional \\"Can you believe this???\\" tone that the writers take. They seem to assume that Christians believe the elements of church life are neatly laid out for us in the New Testament, and the authors are determined to prove that isn't so. Anyone with even a cursory knowledge of the Bible knows that it does not address, say, the order of worship or the wearing of vestments; the authors do a disservice to their readers when they treat such things as shocking revelations. They do make a valid point, though, when they take to task those pastors who insist that everything they do is biblical when their own church life is anything but.What will surprise many believers is the abundance of pagan-derived rituals and practices that are simply taken for granted, from the placement of the candles on the altar to the staging of the clergy and choir at the front of the sanctuary. Even less traditional churches --- to misuse that word again --- have unknowingly retained aspects of pagan culture.Reading a brief synopsis such as this may have you asking, \\"So what?\\" If we aren't pagans ourselves, why would it matter if our practices stemmed from paganism hundreds and even thousands of years ago? Viola and Barna clearly and convincingly make the case that these things do matter and have a profound influence on the way we live out our faith in Christ.Professional clergy and those invested in traditional church life will likely hate this book, because it threatens to shake up the status quo in such a compelling way that its readers will have a tough time walking away unscathed. Those most likely to love it are emergents, younger Christians who eschew traditional church anyway, '70s Jesus freaks who are all grown up but still dissatisfied with church as usual, believers of any age who wonder why on earth we do some of the things we do, and anyone who is bored with church but doesn't exactly know why. In between are those Christians who seldom give a thought to any of this --- and who would do well to start giving some thought to all of this.Despite the wealth of research that went into the book, the authors present the material in an accessible and reader-friendly style, following up each chapter with a Q&A; addressing potential objections to and misunderstandings of the findings. Viola and Barna also offer insights into what to do about \\"church\\" now that readers understand its roots. Several appendices offer helpful guides that summarize main points made in the book.Whether you end up loving it or hating it --- or somehow remaining neutral to it --- PAGAN CHRISTIANITY? is among the few must-reads out there today.--- Reviewed by Marcia Ford"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"I read the first edition of this book and then the second one--I found very little difference. The layout of the book is better, cleaner, and more reader friendly.I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to see why the Church does what it does. It will be surprising to many that what the Church does through its traditions has very little to do with being free in Christ and following him.It is mostly due to Pagan Christianity that inspired me to leave traditionalism to write books of my own. Through Frank's book, I began to evaluate the time I spent as a pastor's and missionary's kid, being a church member, all of the seminary training I received, and the experiences I had as a pastor.As a result of begining my journey away from religion and to God (with Frank's book), I am free and I no longer have any \\"should's\\" or \\"have to's\\" to be on God's good side. God loves me and his grace is sufficient for me. I now have a friendship and peace with God and my fellow belivers without the pretense of churchianity. I hope you will find the same peace and freedom I have found.Knowing God is simple and does not require going to a building, listening to sermons, obeying the clergy, tithing, etc. I finally know what Christ said, \\"You will know the truth and the truth will set you free.\\"I've checked Frank's sources and discovered that some of them I used in the Baptist seminary I graduated from. I have used many of the same resources Frank used in this book in the book he inspired me to writeFree Indeed?: Are Christians Free Indeed or Enslaved by Religion?.This book will help you be free from the traditions of church and men so you can begin enjoying just being with God. I highly recommend other books that goes along nicely with this one:Revolution;The Untold Story of the New Testament Church: An Extraordinary Guide to Understanding the New Testament;The Story of Christianity, Volume 1: The Early Church to the Dawn of the Reformation (Story of Christianity); my bookFree Indeed?: Are Christians Free Indeed or Enslaved by Religion?.

It reminds me of the story of the mother who, when preparing the Thanksgiving ham, would take the cleaver, hack off part of the ham, set it aside and put the remainder in the roaster. Her grown up daughter before hosting her first Thanksgiving asked her mother, \\"Mom, why do you cut off part of the ham and just roast the remainder?\\" \\"I don't know\\" her mother replied, \\"It's the way my mom did it!\\" . \\"Ask your grandmother!\\" The daughter called, \\"Grandma, why do you cut off part of the ham before roasting it at Thanksgiving?\\" \\"Oh my dear\\" she replied, \\"That's the way my mom did it, you should ask her.\\" So the daughter called her great grandmother. \\"Granny\\" she said,\\"Why do you cut off both ends of the ham before roasting it?\\" \\"Oh my dear\\", she replied, \\"we had to cut it down because I only had a small roaster and it wouldn't fit.\\"Such is the nature and evolution of tradition and it is often enlightening to ask WHY do we do these things? Where did our traditions come from? What purpose do they serve? Habits or habitual ways of doing things can either serve us or we can find ourselves serving them - being bound or enslaved by them.Jesus pointed out to the Pharisees and Sadducees that they were enslaved by their traditions! In fact, for many, observing certain traditions had become their \\"religion\\" and it had become more important to them than loving, knowing or obeying God! They had ceased \\"being\\" the people of God and had become just another \\"religion\\". Unfortunately they had become a self-righteous bunch who considered themselves better and more \\"godly\\" than others because of their religious practices and traditions! They had lost the meaning of what it meant to BE \\"God's chosen people\\".\\"Pagan Christianity\\" is meticulously researched and footnoted. It is a deconstruction which forces us to look at the origins of our own (thanksgiving?!) traditions and practices - practices that have become too \\"sacred\\" to challenge. Although this book is not primarily prescriptive it may well stimulate you to ask some important questions like: \\"Why do we do this?\\" \\"What purpose does it serve?\\" It may even occur to you to ask yourself, \\"Is there a better or more elegant way?\\"Today, for all too many, the gospel is about going to church, joining the church, attending church or \\"doing\\" church. Church and Christianity is equated with doing or observing certain \\"Christian\\" practices or traditions religiously! If you read Pagan Christianity with an open and even skeptical mindset it will no doubt challenge you to reconsider our current church practices and study the scriptures for yourself!\\" Reading \\"Pagan Christianity\\" has helped me to rethink the concept of \\"doing church\\" or \\"going to church\\" and begin to move more towards understanding what it means to BE the church\\"?Though Barna and Viola provide lots of research, documentation and historical (some say heretical) insight, the book itself is short on answers! Although it becomes obvious that the authors lean towards a simpler more \\"organic\\" form of meeting together i.e. house church, it is not prescriptive. It is, as I have said, a deconstruction. Having read it you may well be left cold, asking yourself, \\"So what is the answer? What do I do now?\\"I somehow think this was the intention of the authors. Instead of providing a new model or formula for \\"doing\\" church the \\"right way\\", the authors challenge us ask some significant and important questions! It is a very sneaky book! I highly recommend it. It is informative, challenging and stimulating! It may even prove at times to be frustrating and even maddening. But, it is an important not to be ignored book!

I have questioned why our society is rejecting its Judeo-Christian values in an ever increasing rate and further embracing the Post-Modern world-view, seemingly blindly and without question. Undoubtably, there are many reasons, but in my opinion, the greatest reason is that society is not seeing the Truth reflected in church, in the traditional church, as hard as we may try (and in that statement may lay the problem).Viola's/Barna's work is eye-opening and is well documented. I may not agree with all that is being said, but, the question that begs to be answered in light of quickly developing events is \\"Has the season of the traditional church ended?\\" Obviously, the Lord has used the traditional church for 1700 years, but who is to say that He is not now making ready his Bride for the final chapter before the wedding feast?I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"The Pagan title is a little misleading, don't buy this assuming you will gain insight about why we chant prayers on sundays, the authors more so explain how a lot of our christian traditions and practices are derived from Roman and Greek practices.

This book is arranged systematically and in general clear and well written. However, it is still lacking in a number of ways. Firstly, the author(s) seems to be judging these so-called pagan practices without taken into consideration of biblical theology. For example, one would wonder if Old Testament metaphor of the shepherd can be totally neglected as the role of the modern pastor is examined. The author has completely disregard the above when he criticises the modern role of the pastor, taking into consideration only the New Testament text. Secondly, the book fails to take into consideration of the fact that contextualisation of the Christian faith is 'the way it has always been' in the course of history. A casual study on Bosch's Transforming Mission or Lesslie Newbigin will help to inform us this. Though not perfect, but the following quote more or less capture the missional dimension that is missing in this book - 'Christianity is, sociologically speaking, certainly one religion; it is the ancient paganism or, to be more precise, the complex Hebrew-Hellenic-Greco-Latin-Celtic-Gothic-Modern religion converted to Christ more or less successfully.' (Elwood, ed. What Asian Christians are thinking, 361 as quoted in Jones, Wainwright, Yarnold.Sj, (eds) The Study of Spirituality OUP, 1986, 555). The author fails to see that New Testament was not written in a cultural vacuum and we today cannot live apart from our culture. Thirdly, limited by his own preferred ecclesiology and background, the author writes with much in favour of the Anabaptist and home church tradition (which are also cultures). Though he has by at large kept the balance he has occasionally allowed this bias to cloud his judgement. Thus some of his conclusions are harsh. For example, he has maintained that churches are not supposed to have a large building but has not consider the paradigm shift typical of the modern cell church where the large building is never considered 'the church' but a gathering of all home cell group (churches). So although the author's points are clear he would have done better by highlighting the dangers of some of these practices in diluting true Christian values without making harsh but inaccurate criticism of others. Nevertheless I have enjoyed reading this book and find it helpful as a general resource for anyone who is interested in critically evaluating church practices of today. If you would like to have a list of allegedly 'pagan practices' in the church look no further. However, I would recommend it only to those who are already aware of the shortcomings I mentioned above. If you have no idea about the three weaknesses above I suggest you look them up before reading this book."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"This book will challenge the way you think about church, pastors, the Bible, and your own religious experience.

But the scholarship is shoddy at best. In chapter after chapter there are glaring errors.Take the claim \\"the mystique associated with the Eucharist was due to the influence of the pagan mystery religions\\" (p 194). This is false. Paul said those who ate and drank the Eucharist unworthily earned damnation (1 Cor).By 110 AD Ignatius of Antioch wrote that heretics \\"abstain from the Eucharist...because they do not confess that the Eucharist is the flesh of our savior\\" (letter to the Smyrnaeans 6.2).By 150 AD Justin Martyr said, \\"not as common bread or common drink do we receive these; but...as we have been taught, the food which has been made into the Eucharist by the Eucharistic prayer set down by him, and by the change of which our blood and flesh is nourished is both the flesh and blood of the incarnated Jesus\\" (First Apology 66.20).In fact, there is lots of historical evidence proving that the early Christians believed the Eucharist was Jesus.The claim that early Christianity borrowed from the pagan religion was very popular...about 1920. The theory was called the \\"History of Religions\\" theory. Thousands and thousands of scholars wrote and investigated and thousands and thousands of books were published on the subject.The theory is now considered utterly refuted.

It answers the question as to why Christians do things, epsecially traditions, the way they do. Why is communion done the way it is? Why do we have church buildings? Why do many dress up on Sunday? etc. It answers these questions by giving factual, historical evidence of the Christian church, from Jesus, through Constatine, the dark ages, the reformation, etc, right up to present day. For example, even the term 'personal relationship' used by many preachers, was popularized by a radio preach in the 1950's and is not in the Bible.The shocking part is, many of the traditions and things Christians do are not based on the Bible. I think this in itself is shocking to most Christians, and that one point alone is well worth the read. The book does imply that doing things that aren't in the Bible is wrong, although it doesn't come out and say it. Instead they give examples of how the non Biblical things Christians and Churces do actually hurt the true mission of the Gospel. For example, spending so much on a huge, grandiose church building, that is not used except a few times a week, instead of using the money in more effective ministry ways that directly spread the Gospel (missions, etc.).While the book is great and explains and makes a strong argument that muc of what we do isn't in the Bible, it does not do a great job of giving the solution of what to do about it. In fact it doesn't give any real solutions. I found myself saying, \\"OK, now what?\\". I'm not sure what the book wants us to do with this information. Shall we return communion to be a real meal where we worship together instead of a solemn sacrament? Shall we sell our churh buildings and move into house churces? Should we not dress up on Sunday? It doesn't really say.Apparently there is another book coming out soon by the same Authors that will explain and recommend what Christians should do based on this information. I was only going to give it 4 stars because of this lack of a solution, however, the fact that it really makes you THINK - I had to give it 5 stars on that point alone. There aren't many books that really do that!"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"I first read \\"Pagan Christianity\\" in its original edition by Frank alone. It radically changed the way I viewed God, Jesus Christ, the Church, and my own life. This newest edition has great add-ons by George Barna like the \\"Delving Deeper\\" sections at the end of the chapter.My life was so radically effected by the truth about the church portrayed in this book that I bought 10 of them and I've already started sending them to the people who mean the most in my life because the message can't simply be read and ignored."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"This book addresses many questions about todays regilious practices that many people have and why there is so many different afformations. While we do the same thing week after week many of us just do things because \\"That is the way we have always done it\\". Thank you Frank Viola and George Barna for providing information that shows how far we have strayed from the first centry church. I think all regilious leaders should read this book with an open mind.Pagan Christianity?: Exploring the Roots of Our Church Practices"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Frank Viola has done the Christian public a huge service by writing this book. It contains a readable history of the practices of the Christian religion since the first century. Though, as other reviewers wrote, it is not a \\"scholarly\\" sort of work, it fully cites noted historians and New Testament scholars who have demonstrated the things Frank writes about. If you know a bit of western church history anyway, much of what Viola says will be intuitive.I personally had been curious if the practices of our mainline Christianity actually promoted Christlikeness in its members or whether it actually hindered authentic love from growing. A further thing I was wondering was, did Jesus actually give us this mode/way of doing things, especially if it goes against his actual teachings?Pagan Christianity gives a historical answer to these questions. The practices of pagan christianity have little to do with what Jesus is actually doing in our day, and have rather resulted from a misunderstanding and hijacking of the life of the Spirit as expressed in the New Testament.Read this book and all of a sudden you will start saying to yourself about pastors, priests, sermons, order of worship, buildings, choirs, and all the rest of the circus... \\"It's just not there. It's just not there.\\"Its not in the New Testament. And its not in Jesus Christ.Though the established church may never receive the message, Pagan Christianity is a must read.Thank you, Frank Viola, for your brave undertaking, and for helping us get the scales off our eyes."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Frank & George have done something noone has ever accomplished with substantial validity (noted by the number of sources reflected in the footnotes) and credibility. As one who has been concerned and a critic for decades with the formation of the Western church but without the substantiation, this book strikes a welcome chord. If you are one who asks questions as to why, this book is for you. The church is littered with traditions, customs and preferential practice this book addresses in adequate detail. And though some will use this to bash the church as we speak of it today, hopefully those of us who care about the church will take these things to heart and go back to the 1st century way of doing things using many of the findings of this book to truly avoid the potholes our forefathers have fallen into."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"It was a great book that I could not put down. I am happy to see that someone is brave enough to address \\"religion and church\\" that has been filled with lies to most people who truly seek God. I for one have left organized religion because of all the falseness and man made doctrines, and thank both authors immensely for putting into words what needs to be addressed to the churches of this day."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"I was disappointed by this book. It seemed to me that the author had an ax to grind, and he didn't mind bending the truth here and there to make his point.Often his prooftexts in the footnotes don't support his claims. And even when they do, the author has the guts to devote much of the last chapter to a treatise AGAINST prooftexting!His conclusions weren't always logical. For instance, he faults the church for being all messed up...especially during the last 500 years- the time period of the Reformation, America's Great Awakenings, of the Welsh Revival, Argentine Revival, the current revival in Africa, and Azusa Street.As another example, he decries the \\"modern pastor\\" and then traces it all the way back to Ignatius of Antioch! (Ignatius was alive during the time when every New Testament book was written. Had Jesus lived another ten years, he and Ignatius could have known each other.)Even though Viola has many good things to say, his ultimate goal is not to correct the mistakes of the church- it's to start all over. On the last page he challenges everyone to leave the institutional church.It's an interesting read, but because of the book's flaws, I can't recommend it."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"This book literally changed my life.. Frank seems to be writing like from a hurt x church go'er point of view, but aren't we all? At least most of the folks reading this book.. His conclusions are harsh and tempered with that hurt tone... BUT his facts are right on! This book is one that you can trust and get very practical use from whether you are a senior pastor, youth pastor, pew warmer, or home churcher."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"I really think some of the observations in this book are great...for someone who's been living in an isolated cave for several decades and has no awareness of the technological changes that have occurred in the world. First, the book was EXCEEDINGLY repetitive. Every point Friedman said needed to be restated, rephrased and re-explained about 20 times in unnecessarily lengthy sentences. Furthermore, the book is filled with name-dropping and ranting.Aside from its redundancy and soap-box-like agenda, the book also seems to give the impression that India and China are on the fast track to replacing the US and the west in all respects. He virtually ignores the fact that the vast majority of the populations of both countries live in extreme poverty with little chance of escape for either them or their children.I think the book would have been better summarized into a 2-page magazine article, or even better, a short newspaper column."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Other reviewers have mentioned things like \\"just because a tradition's basis is not found in the Bible doesn't make it wrong\\". Viola and Barna seem to disagree with this notion entirely - as do I. They also support their case with examples replete with historical evidence. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"I was already knowledgeable on the subject but it was still eye opening. It is one of my most important books."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"This book was one of the best Christian books I have read in a while. I am originally from India and became Christian four years ago. I had always wondered about hierarchy, structure and the regimented way of doing things like prayer, sermon, etc and all the other jargon that goes along in the church that is purely man invented instead of its true original biblical beauty. This book will help you understand the pagan roots of \\"Christianity\\" as instituted by man but also would be freeing too (I believe, as it was for me).Anyway, read it with an open mind and investigate yourself. Condemnation before investigation is always a bad idea, so give it a try."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"There is a lot I could write about this book. It is challenging, interesting and accomplishes its goals. I will just make a couple of comments.First,despite what some have said about the book not providing solutions or adequate solutions - the book states its intended goals and accomplishes them. Another book will be out this summer dealing with those other issues.Second, some have argued that he overstates his case. I understand this charge completely, but also recognize that he still makes his case.Third, while this book is not intended to answer the \\"what now\\" question in any length, it is clear that Viola knows what comes next as far as he is concerned. This being the case, he often uses language or makes claims that he does not elaborate on and which, when his next book comes out, I will have to evaluate then. For instance, I am interested in learning more about what he regularly refers to as the \\"every member functioning\\" of the church. I am looking forward to his next work.Fourth, in making his negative case against the institutional church he often comes across in a way that many feel is too negative. That is, he seems to think that all leaders are bad, all preaching is bad, etc. He does qualify himself however, a number of times, saying that these things (and other things) have their place. The point is that the place they have occupied in our churches are not themselves scriptural, are grounded in pagan history, or are otherwise questionable. He deserves some leeway here.There are probably a number of other things I could talk about. In fact, I am sure of it. It has had my family talking since we put it down. I find it interesting the number of people who are responding negatively to the book without very convincing arguments. That is, there are countless negative reviews of this book here and on blogs everywhere which do not actually deal with the claims made so much as take a defensive posture, as if defending some cherished institution. Of course, that is probably often the case. I can only say that, as Viola mentions at the beginning of the book, don't read this unless you are prepared and willing to honestly engage the book and likely have your notions of church completely deconstructed, and I don't mean this in the tired postmodern way.I would come at it like this: If Viola is on to something here, then it is extremely important that we deal with it. If he is mistaken, then it is even more important that we address the book fairly and accurately, with a corrective yet gentle spirit. Interestingly, the very fact that there are so many poorly reasoned and sloppily executed critiques to this book suggest there may be something to it. All you can do is check it out for yourself and deal with it honestly.Also, before you give too much weight to some of the comments here on Amazon and elsewhere, check out Viola's Web site where he has set up a very long page answering questions from readers. Since I am not sure I can list Web address here, just google Frank Viola, go to his site, and then look for the \\"Q and A about Pagan Christianity.\\""},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Very little to say here that could add to the others that found this book wanting. All I can say is this: having decided to turn their backs on the institutional church, the authors now feel the need to justify that decision to the rest of us. Mr. Viola and Mr. Barna: we know you have your reasons for making the move to house churches. That is your choice to make, and we wish you well. But to then turn about and presume to stick out your tongues at the rest of us who haven't given up, trumping up arguments as to why you are right and we are wrong? Very bad form. Perhaps you haven't realized this yet, so let me just clue you in here--you've left the institutional church behind. The rubicon has been crossed. From here forward, you may as well leave your advice for the institutional church behind as well. You have no credibility in doing so."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"I read PC over a month ago, but its revolutionary concepts are still on my mind. I have a friend who often remarks when asked if he missed church on a given Sunday, \\"I didn't go, but I cannot say that I missed it.\\" Increasingly that has been my feeling as well. Prior to reading PC I thought I was becoming a \\"bad Christian\\" because I was not \\"assembling myself together with other believers\\" in 'church' (that is the church building) even though I was regularly meeting and enjoying fellowship with other believers outside the building!Reading the book opened my eyes to the many aspects of modern \\"churchianity\\" which are unbiblical and unprofitable. I realized that the very things that have annoyed me the most about the \\"church\\" I have been attending are the things that make it an institution rather than a living organism--the focus on the building , the relegating the Lord's supper to a monthly special event, the denial of the priesthood of believers by emphasis of the pastoral staff's total authority, the ongoing war between the contemporary worshipers and the hymns only crowd, the focus on entertainment not only for the teens and tweens, but also for the aging pew warmers. Since we became \\"purpose driven\\" there has been even less opportunity for individuals to exercise their spiritual gifts in the meetings. Those who are prophetically gifted are encouraged to be quiet or leave, as are those who are opposed to the trend toward the new orthodoxy of casual dress, contemporary me-focused ditties (no hymns, Please!) and sermonettes illustrated with drama or video clips. I am recommending this book to every thinking Christian who senses that something is wrong with church as we know it. Hopefully if enough of us read it and take its message to heart we can begin to experience the body life that the Lord intends for His body on earth. And just maybe the body of Christ will actually begin to be salt and light in an increasingly dark and putrid world.If you are perfectly content with the status quo, this book is not for you--it will make you angry! If, however, you feel as I do and suspect that something is very wrong with the way we \\"do church\\" today, by all means buy PC and read it! This small volume is extremely well-researched and documented with countless footnotes. It will change the way you think about \\"Church\\" forever!"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"This is another book that brings out some interesting \\"facts\\". It does give some ideas as to what is leading the Christian movements today. When we search the Scriptures we do find a difference between how we do it today and how the early Church assembled. The book does offer some interesting ideas and can give insight to our assemblies today.Well worth reading but again use the Bible as a cross reference."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"This is a bizarre book!It is polemic in nature--what a waste!The author makes grandiose claims but fails to deliver and even hurts the cause of the \\"home church\\".The books on \\"home church\\" by Robert Banks are far superior in every area and are profitable.While condemning \\"proof-texting\\" with biblical references, the author employs \\"proof-texting\\" of his quoted sources. He continually misquotes other authors and misses entirely the point that many quoted author are making. This is inexcusible and greatly reduces the trustworthiness of the author's \\"conclusions\\".While condemning the Church Fathers, he never quotes from the Church Fathers but uses the work of others. That is, he quotes what other authors say about the Church Fathers. When the primary sources are available, why use secondary sources? This is the rule of \\"best evidence\\". Read the Church Fathers and draw your own conclusions--don't \\"cherry-pick\\" the comments of others that seemingly support your conclusion. This is shoddy research and a defect apparent to anyone who has read the Church Fathers and other sources.The author discounts the entire Old Testament and the worship of the Old Testament people of God. It is quite amazing that about 80% of the Bible is ignored. (A Jewish uncle once told me that when he was amazed at the similarities between the Roman Catholic/Greek Orthodox worship services and his Orthodox Jewish worship services.)His conclusions are never proven and, surprisingly, he leaves logical conclusions (that disagree with his) wholly unanswered. He misquoted at least one biblical reference that is fundamental to the Church's purpose in the world today.His understanding of Church History is flawed. He \\"paints with too broad a brush\\" (as the Bible Answer Man would say). The issues are the same with Church History as with the Church Fathers.My pet peeve is his universal misuse of the word, \\"catholic\\" (pun intened). While all Christians are \\"catholic\\", not all Christians are \\"Roman Catholics\\" but the author applies the word \\"catholic\\" exclusively to the Roman Catholic Church. This error has the effect of cutting all non-Roman Catholic Christions from the resources and moorings found in Church History.Robert Banks is superior in his presentation of the need of the \\"home church\\" is and exhortatory and encouraging!Spent your money on Robert Banks' books instead!"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Surely most believers today know that the church is the people, not the building, and that community purposes are better served in a multi-purpose facility rather than one geared for listening to sermons or watching drama, and that a pastors job is to equip the saints for ministry rather than doing all the ministry themselves, and that worship is 24/7 lifestyle instead of some weekly gathering, and such other well known truths preached from many a pulpit (God forbid).... If you know that sort of thing already then the remainder of this book is a very condemning and legalistic attempt to force you to only do what the people in the early church did, or what the house church movement is doing today under the guise of only doing what the early church did. Many are not convinced that all their interpretations of key passages about what the early church really did and upon which they base their views are valid, by the way. They go on to blame virtually every later change in church history on a conspiracy of someone adopting \\"pagan\\" things from the historical cultural contexts while failing to realize early believers were as much borrowing from their Jewish or Greek culture as following generations did. The first believers were not exempt from influence nor in some vacuum. Nor were all the \\"pagan things\\" borrowed necessarily wrong. I don't want to take up for Constantine, and I hate the fact that much of our view of God's relation to time came from Plato- not Scripture, but me thinks I smell some vast generalizations here. Stained glass is pretty. God is for pretty. You really think Plato is behind all that then ...and that now that even comes into play? Get over it, but i digress...God did not say in the New Testament....\\"meet in houses.\\" Where else were they going to meet? During times of persecution why would they build a building to meet in? They also met at the Jewish Temple in Acts for a time. Hmmm? And in a school building, by the river at a certain place \\"where prayer was made.\\" The New Testament is much more descriptive than prescriptive when it comes to most such things. These guys are making how the early church met a sort of \\"law\\" we must still follow today as though it were an inspired commandment. Paul began all his mission work in towns he visited with the Jews first, but he did not command others to do that. If borrowing Stain glass is wrong, what will these guys say about your ministry meeting in a bar? Or at a Starbucks? Or using the internet? Or using rock music? Or using drama and the arts?(Wasn't drama some sort of pagan thing at some point?) What about when your ministry size grows to a thousand? These authors have a huge ax to grind. CAN WE REALLY TRUST A MAN WITH A BIG AX TO GRIND? They have their own sacred cows and are claiming they have proof texts for them....mostly amounting to an argument from next to silence and a mistaken belief that the early believers were acting under some inspiration now amounting to a command from God. They are a few people who worship under a chimney condemning those who worship under a steeple....or anywhere else. It's not that I like steeples....who cares about that, or about stained glass (I have some in my house, but don't need it in a church...) What I am reacting against is an attack on freedom. Make no mistake....you may like how they are tearing down things, but don't miss how they are with legalistic zeal equally telling you how you must rebuild. Their tone and words do condemn everyone but themselves. They do not want to merely inform, but rather to compel believers to join some sort of house church like thing where the idea of having any owned building feels sinful and paying people with extraordinary gifts to do full time what they do so well part time is considered mistaken, or the idea of a large group of believers wanting to stay together is unwise and unworkable... I imagined Barna was trying to help justify the new wineskins of postmodern expressions of faith which look so promising, but this is overkill, amounting to a \\"sermon\\" about how only the house church people have it right... The cover said, \\"Frank is an influential voice in the contemporary house church movement.\\" So, I should have seen this coming, but was lulled into it out of apparently misplaced respect for Barna's objectivity. At times I feel they are being intellectually dishonest or just doing shoddy work in their zeal to promote house churches. If it were not so skewed in one direction it would be more valuable as a historical study of the evolving church in culture. Why do I get the sense they are not dealing fairly with the historical sources? Maybe because they are not spot on with what they do with the Bible references they quote? It is a self serving work for the house church movement and therefore to be viewed with caution. There are indeed some good points to be \\"borrowed\\" from the book, but why must it be at the expense of truth and fairness overall. Even so, my greatest irritation comes not from ideas I don't agree with...I read plenty of books that I disagree with and try to learn from. It would help if they could make their points without so much condescension and condemnation. They don't come offering wisdom, but swinging wide and hard. I'm surprized Barna sanctioned this."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"As a pastor of 25 years who has grown more and more discontent with institutional \\"church,\\" I agree with pretty much all the observations that Viola makes. Abuses are widespread and abundant in the body of Christ today: sacred buildings, restrictive order-of-worships, rote sermons, the centrality of the pastor, Sunday morning garb, overly structured music, guilt-ridden tithing, misconceptions of salaried \\"clergy,\\" time-delayed baptisms, the Lord's Supper for only the \\"worthy,\\" egg-headed Christian education, etc. His points are great and extremely valid. His conclusions however, are just as man-centered as the institutional church he decries. Is the answer to abandon completely the institutional church? Viola says on page 250, \\"We must begin all over again, on the right foundation. Anything less will be defective.\\" Obviously the enemy has infiltrated our ranks and sown tares among the wheat. However, do we take it upon ourselves to burn the entire field in response? Do we then seek new ground that will yield for us a \\"pure,\\" Biblically-based harvest? Are we taking upon ourselves that which only God can do? It is one thing to promote the planting of \\"organic\\" churches -- it is quite another to trash entirely the institutional church as we know it. This book also gives the impression that if a tradition or practice isn't mentioned in Bible, then it is contrary to the Scriptures and must be discarded. Scriptural silence on a particular matter doesn't automatically deem it ungodly or undesirable. I give this title two stars because despite all of the jumping to conclusions present, it does make us think and take a good hard look at the body of Christ. As long as we remain faithful to the Scriptures and submitted to the Holy Spirit, this kind of introspection can be a great benefit to all of us as believers."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"I have been a Christian all my life, but have had doubts about some of its methods. Sure enough, Pagan Christianity, cleared up some of those doubts but I still believe that \\"Jesus died for my sins.\\" What I read is what is going on today in ministry and music, the culture of the world has invaded the 21st century Church. What I could say in another way is, \\"the Church has looked across at the Jones' house, and thought that the grass looked greener over there. So, here we go again. We must be like them. I enjoyed the book. The person that suggested that I read it said that it made him mad.

The idea that 80-90% of a church budget (salaries, building, supplies, maint.,etc) goes mostly to support its self preservation seems out of whack. With the many needs that are present in local communities and beyond, it seems these dollars could be more effectively spent. Because of this and many other factors, we are praying about the idea of stepping away from insitutional church and moving towards organic church.Pagan Christianity? helped to give us some \\"proof\\" to what we have been feeling. It is a fascinating read and should provide many \\"aha\\" moments for most readers. We highly recommend this to anyone who just has a feeling that the way we do church just isn't right.

It simply is a history book in a way. You will discover why we do \\"church\\" the way we do. This book did not make me quit my church, but rather understand why many of the same problems seem to be evident in most churches today. This book was not anti-church as some that have read it thinks that it is. It is pro church. God's church is over all the world...it is the believers, the born again in Jesus Christ. The people are the church, not the building. I would recommend this highly."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Wow! This one is heavy. You have to spend some time after you've read it to think about the implications.

I also chuckled over \\"The Calf Path,\\" by Sam Walter Foss, quoted in the introduction. I had seen it before, but not in years.I thought a few of the \\"connections\\" to paganism were a little overdrawn, but all in all it is a compelling book.A Call to Arms!

Their bias toward the \\"Home Church\\" movement is quite obvious; however their documentation often moves the argument along.I had to keep reminding myself that just because the first century Christians didn't have communion like we do, or they practiced a very different form of worship (liturgy) does not make what we do wrong. The authors constantly pointed this out as they wrote.I find myself wondering why we do what we do and why we do what we do in the manner that we do it after reading the book. At first I was distracted during my church services by these thoughts. I had a little difficulty focusing on the service and this is in an independent Bible Church. We do have an order of service and that's as close to a liturgy as we get.I believe this book is very good for individuals interested in Church History. It should be helpful for Sunday School teachers, I've used some information from it in the adult Sunday School class I teach."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Pagan Christianity? Exploring the Roots of Our Church Practices, may very well be the most important book written on the Christian church in the last two millennia. Frank Viola and George Barna team up to give their readers a critical examination of the last 1700 years of church history. Does the institutional church have any biblical and historical right to exist? \\"Are the practices of the institutional church (the clergy/laity system, salaried pastors, sacred buildings, the order of worship, etc.) God-approved developments to the church that the New Testament envisions? Or are they an unhealthy departure from it?\\"The first edition of this book entitled, Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices by Frank Viola is the third book written in a set of five books on church restoration and organic church life. Viola and George Barna, Christian pollster and author of the book Revolution, have co-authored the newly revised and updated Pagan Christianity?: Exploring the Roots of Our Church Practices. Barna brings to the book a fresh look and a polished language that improves on the delivery of Viola's original work. Barna, who has caused no small stink upon his recent confessions regarding the church, makes his decision to leave the institutional church complete with the publication of this book. If it wasn't clear in his book Revolution... it is certainly clear now.I enjoyed the new format of this book. At the end of each chapter, the authors give the reader a \\"Delving Deeper\\" section which lists common questions with answers in return. I felt that this helped to clarify what the authors were truly saying in order that fact might be separated from fiction. I also enjoyed the updated references and the plethora of footnotes listed at the bottom of each page. These references may be in a smaller font, but they are the entire foundation of historicity which resulted in the penning of this book. Therefore, the serious reader will not want to overlook the footnotes. The reader will also find the \\"Summary of Origins\\" and \\"Key Figures in Church History\\" in the back of the book a great help as well. The book may look like a long read... yet, you will find that your interest is peaked beyond that of any other historical book you have ever read. You will read until you are done... or until you have thrown it out the window.The serious questions raised in this book will give the Christian reader more than enough to wrestle over. Viola traces the pagan origins of almost every church practice that institutional Christianity holds dear and holds it to the light of the New Testament. I remember first reading the original Pagan Christianity over a year ago. I had spent 6 years of my life in \\"vocational ministry\\" within the institutional (Southern Baptist) church and I had a degree in Religion/Biblical Studies from a Baptist University. I had just resigned from my position as Minister to Students/Education because the church's leaders were opposed to fundamental teachings of Jesus. My wife and I saw that we could no longer serve among them. It was during this time that I began to read and study like never before. I was seeking to be a senior pastor in a church somewhere in the United States. I studied church history, ecclesiology, Christology, etc. I was seeking the Lord's will for his church. I compiled a list of what the New Testament described the church looked like in fellowship and among the world. With the help of Viola's book, I quickly realized that my list did not reflect the church I knew and that that church could not be seen in the model of the traditional church. I had to rethink my understanding of it all.I know how hard this read will be for many people, especially clergy members. Pagan Christianity? will, no doubt, be a most uncomfortable read for all those who believe the Body of Christ is an institution. For the clergy member, the read will almost be impossible. At every turn of the page, the flesh will flare up in a horrible display of arrogance and pride. Many will scoff at its claims and discourage others from reading it before an honest examination can be made. If the reader is not prepared to reexamine his faith and practice for a paradigm shift, he or she might as well leave this book well alone. If the reader is not yet at the end of their rope in frustration against the church practices and shallow conception of Christ that is believed and taught within the institutional church, this book will only breed anger and confusion. But, if you were like me a year ago... you are tired and want answers... and, most importantly, you want more of Christ... then please read this book and allow yourself to be moved by it. I encourage you to have an honest conversation with the Lord as you read. And listen to his still small voice.To the rabid opponents of this book, I strongly recommend you speak to no one before you have done truthful research concerning these matters AND have had an honest conversation with Jesus first. Many will argue that this book only proposes another \\"form\\" or method of church. This book is not about forms, but about principles. To argue forms is to miss the point of this book. Many will make preposterous claims that this book seeks to tear down the church of Jesus Christ, when in all realitythis book exalts Jesus Christ of Nazareth and submits that we return to simple community gathered around his headship free from the human inventions of man and religion that hinders the Body from every-member functioning. This book does not propose we mimic the model of first-century Christianity, but that we mimic our Lord. Out of our Lord's commands and the principles of his person and work (i.e. life and teachings) will come normal Christian church life!Why has this book been written? The authors write, \\"We have written this book for one reason: to make room for the absolute centrality, supremacy, and headship of Christ in His church.\\" (p.250) This statement alone should be enough for any true follower of Christ to pick up and read. But unfortunately, many people, for whatever reason, will choose to accept slander about the authors (even from trusted pastors) as enough reason to discredit and discount them as credible voices of truth in mainline Christianity. This is an incredible action considering that many institutional churches in the last decade have built their entire plan of attack off the statistical findings of pollster George Barna. On top of that, both of these men boldly proclaim Christ in a way that is undeniably and unmistakably from a spirit of love and edification. The premature responses of the majority prove how mankind is driven by mere human emotions and tradition, instead of biblical truth discovered through a consistent and verifiable method of biblical interpretation that seeks to exalt Christ above all things.This reviewer and ex-clergy member challenges you to consider the message of these men. Compare the claims of this book with the Christ and the church of the New Testament before you decide who and what are truly following and being a reflection of pagan Christianity. All of us must choose between spiritual revolution (i.e. return to Christ) or religious reformation (i.e. tweaking the old pagan systems). One of these will release the church from her chains and free her from the bondage of man's religion to experience the natural faith of Christ. The other will only prolong God's people from beholding Christ in majesty and splendor to the world. There is only one life to live. Choose wisely."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"As a new Christian many years ago, I eagerly accepted the challenge from pulpit ministers to read the Bible every day, only to find that Scripture had little to say about the traditions, dogma and accepted practices found in the Christian church.In many ways, reading \\"Pagan Christianity\\" was a relief. I realized I wasn't the only one who found many of the Christian rituals to be empty and even to be a distraction from growing closer to God.Frank Viola pinpointed one of my greatest questions: \\"How are we to be a priesthood of all believers when we must quietly sit in pews listening only to the pastor? How are we to exercise our spiritual gifts and edify the body of Christ when the church hierarchy demonstrates such things are only open to those who attend seminaries?\\"My hope is that the institutional church will see the questions raised in \\"Pagan Christianity\\" as legitimate concerns and thus the first step to a recovery that can strengthen those who attend, especially new Christians.If the book falls short of answering these questions, its sequel, \\"Reimagining the Church\\" picks up that baton and runs with it."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Reading this book is like walking through concentration camps after the holocaust. Painful, but necessary. It reveals a level of devastation in the church that few really understand. The authors show how many of our \\"sacred cow\\" practices in the church are actually keeping us from being the body of Christ.If you are perfectly happy with the state of the church, you will probably reject what you read in this book. If you find the average church rather meaningless and irrelevant, your gut feelings will be validated and you will find hope in the fact that God means for us to experience so much more.Read it with an open mind. You may not agree with every point they make, but you must agree that the church has strayed far from its roots. I only wish that the authors had taken the space to provide more detailed constructive solutions, because quite honestly, this is a depressing book."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"If the title or contents of Pagan Christianity? provoked or offended you, than it's purpose was half accomplished. While far from inflammatory, it's writing style can come off as melodramatic and over-the-top. This is deliberate. Frank Viola and George Barna have concerns over many modern and traditional church practices, and they want you to take the concerns seriously as they discuss the benefits and hindrances of everything from church buildings and paid staff, to sermons and tithing, to methods of worship, baptism and communion. Steeped as we are, however, in the traditions as given us, a firm shake may be needed for us to realize the questions actually need answering.This book goes to great lengths to show that each aspect of the Christian religion covered is without sound Scriptural basis, at least in it's most common forms found today. The intent is not to utterly these elements and practices from present Christianity, but rather for individual Christians to read the book, and come to terms whether, for example, the sermon as it has come to us adds or detracts from the faith, without conflating it with a perceived spiritual mandate.A valid concern is that this book is too focused on the early church (first century or two after Christ) and on house churches that retain the open and egalitarian nature of the early church. Again, while this is definitely looked toward with preference against much of the accumulated traditions that have arisen since, there is also the understanding that we are not to merely mimic the early church.\\"Therefore, adhering to the principles of the New Testament does not mean reenacting the events of of the first-century church.\\"Finally, a call is made for discernment. Even today we bring our own culture's perspective, assumptions and worldview to the faith.\\"But in the light of tradition we need to sort out those cultural influences that contribute to the integrity of Christian worship from those that detract from it.\\"The intent of the book is to pose the questions, to knock the reader upside the head firmly enough that they have to consider where and how to balance themselves.In addition, the book is brief in many of it's historical explorations, but the research has been done. For those interested in a deeper read, the footnotes in the back of the book can launch a broad and deep journey into the bowels of church history.Full review & discussion at the Jesus Manifesto webzine."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"I have read a number of the reviews on this book and find in most of them good analysis and excitement. That is a sure indication that there are people out there that are as concerned about the state of the church as we know it. The solution has always been problematic and I don't sense a great deal of help from the authors of this book.Perhaps the solution is another book. However, at the on set it should be recognized that getting together to share Christ may lead to all sorts of perversions of the Way of Faith. The early church struggled with that.The authors tell us how the church has been tainted by the pastor system and the training systems of pastors and christian leaders. However, in every chapter they quote those very pastors and teachers as authorities who are part of the system they are criticising .It should be clear. We owe the past and in our longing for the Kingdom (perfect world) we should be cautious that we not ignore that it has in some way come down to us through this very poor vehicle or \\"field of tares\\" called the church.In short, this book approaches an honesty that is needed but by no means rises to the level that has clearly pointed us to a new and better way. In every little house group there are people who will rise to fill the leadership vacuum and the real leaders that will be needed in such a situation will be leaders large enough to keep the \\"floor level.\\""},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"This is extremely dangerous writing. These two authors critique pastors for saying that what they do in worship is from God's Word and then cannot prove it. Worse than that, these authors state that what Christianity has been doing concerning worship since the third century at the least is from pagan sources and thus ungodly because it is unbiblical.First off, anyone who has spent time in the Bible knows that in the NT there is given much freedom in worship, with no prescriptive section which states clearly the order of worship, etc. Therefore, many have concluded with questions like, where does it say we should have music and musical instruments? Vestments, paraments, candles, pulpits, etc. We can or we can't have such, since Scripture doesn't prescribe them nor forbid them.What is dangerous about this work is that it states clearly that it is restoring the Christian church back to its first century moorings, which it then seeks to revolve almost totally, if the reader follows their reasoning, almost completely on 1 Corinthians 14:26, that this be not centered around one person, but all participate with Biblical teaching, hymn leading, etc. In this same Scriptural text they exhibit poor exegetical skills by concluding that everyone ministers when assembling together (ecclesia) however this text denies women to speak in these asemblies. This is but one example of inaccurate Biblical exegesis (which they exhibit none of in this work, other than reference Viola's other writings) but do the proof-texting in the footnotes which they seriously deride their opponents of.To suggest their is no office of the public ministry is false. Paul appointed pastors in the places that he started them, rather than some organic, house church planting. The reason which this work doesn't identify at all is that historically they met in houses because of persecution until Constantine allowed them as legal religion. To suggest therefore, that because first century were in houses, so should be in the 21st century is false historical step.Truly a falsity to anyone who wants to clearly check it out is when they contend that a consensus of scholars on these subjects: liturgy, NT scholarship, church history agree with their opinions just isn't there. Check out a true liturgical, NT Christian who writes with accuracy: \\"Heaven on Earth: The Gifts of Christ in the Divine Service\\" by Arthur A. Just Jr.Also, their comments on the Holy Sacraments of Baptism and the Lord's Supper are biblically and historically inaccurate as well. To just quote some references and then say we don't have time to exegete these to prove our rash statements condemning the pagan influence of Sacramental views that don't match up with ours is most weak. To spend more time on church buildings than the precious Sacraments which are God's means of delivering grace is a sham.Suspect here is Barna's participation since he has written in other places his frustration that in the last three decades Church Growth with all its changes and dumbing down the faith and replacing Scripture driven faith practice with marketing and business management techniques has failed to grow Christ's kingdom and it will take true pastoral leadership to change things, smacks here then of no need for pastors, but return to organic, face-to-face, everyone a minister church again is not following God's plan, but inserting into Scripture what is not there. Frustrated that their techniques in the past have not brought the promised results is shown in this new stream again to be highly suspect and dangerous as the previous remedies were shown.Further, at the very end of the work to suggest that God still works through these pagan borrowing institutional churches is hypocritical to their whole thesis. Although they try to spin answers away from it, where in each small gathering is their to be that under-shepherd appointed to speak for God who is to do the call of such as Titus 1:9; Hebrews 13:17; 2 Tim.4:1-5?Where also is any conviction about seeing that Jesus and Him crucified carries the weight of any ecclessia?Agreement with such contemporary unbiblical practices as commitment prayer, etc. tempted a two-star rating, but this is such a poor excuse for proper NT exegesis and church history presentation that one star is sufficient if not excessive."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"This review will be somewhat less scholarly than the book itself: It's a personal response rather than an intellectual one.As a Christian Artist/Musician I've had a chance to experience many different kinds of churches all over the world, from huge cathedral services to bizarre charismatics and strange Third World stuff to stiff denominationals-- and good and bad \\"house churches\\". For nearly 35 years in North America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Australia I've been involved with almost every conceivable kind of Christian expression. I've even served on staff as Worship Pastor at a large church here in the U.S. The result? I've already learned from study and experience what Frank Viola and George Barna have proven by historical documentation in \\"Pagan Christianity\\": The traditional model of how we \\"do church\\" is very wrong-- and it's strangling Christ's Body.Once you have experienced being a part of a group of believers who meet in unity and are led and directed by the Spirit of Jesus Himself, you just can't go back to any of the man-made forms-- at best, they're unsatisfying; at worst, they're destructive. (Here, I believe, is Mr. Dash's error: He's never known Body life in this way. If he had, he could not have suggested that the traditional structures are anything more than a hindrance.)No matter where you are in your Christian journey, you need to read this book. It's truth whose time has come. Those who have never experienced His tangible presence as a regular occurrence when they meet will find it hard to believe that there is something more than what they know: It's very hard to walk away from what you've invested your life in when you don't know anything else. And the very grace of God Himself can be confusing: He'll fill whatever cup we lift to Him, no matter how small.So, as a fellow traveler, I encourage you to allow Jesus to speak to you through this book-- indeed, through all of Frank Viola's books (I don't know Mr. Barna's that well). I believe it's the beginning of major changes in the way we all learn to relate to God and each other. Jesus will ultimately settle for nothing less than true intimacy with His Bride."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"I appreciate the many reviews that examine the book Pagan Christianity?. These have helped me draw my conclusions now that I have read the book. I will not restate what others have said except to say that I really think this is a very important book and the authors have done a very skillful job of expressing the issues without overly flavoring the work with their personal, subjective preferences. When you look at the state of the modern-day western church, I believe they have painted an accurate picture of what is really going on with the church. As a friend of mine here in Mississippi says, \\"Is you is, or is you ain't?\\".I especially appreciate the background information provided in the footnotes. Interestingly, while I was waiting for the book to be delivered from Amazon, I was led to go to Frank Viola's website. After reading much of what he presents there regarding the book, I saw two things that jumped out at me: 1) the statistic that over 51% of the people who have publicly condemned the book HAVE NOT ACTUALLY READ IT! And, 2) I saw Frank's heart come through by the way he answered his critics. I truly believe this man to be a humble servant of God who is working to differentiate between things that are truly of God and those things man has invented and passed off as God.I am glad I went to Frank's website to get a better glimpse of the man who wrote the book. He even says that a sequel will be coming out sometime this summer to offer alternatives to what they present in Pagan Christianity?. I think the only challenge I had about the book was that after surgically cutting open what a lot of people have held dear in their lives (the authors expose so many sacred religious cows, it is a wonder the church is not Hindu!), there is very little \\"post-op rehabilitation\\". While I know that you first have to cut out the cancer (the intent of this book was to first expose the pagan traditions that have been passed off as \\"of God\\"), if I didn't know that a sequel was planned, I would have felt like I was left to bleed out on the operating table without anyone around to stop itMy prayer is that Frank and George will use the same due diligence they used to expose a flawed foundation in the Church to write a sequel that drips with hearts of love, grace, and restoration to show us \\"the most excellent way\\" to some alternatives to the current form of \\"doing church\\". Otherwise, many who have read Pagan Christianity?

The authors are courageous enough in their tossing to include the proverbial water, tub AND baby.The book is similar to the classical illustration that has been told numerous times. If you've heard it - it's always worth repeating. If you haven't it's insightful and worthy of perpetual consideration. It goes something like this.A newlywed couple gets back from their honeymoon and begin their lives together. One Sunday afternoon she begins to prepare a meal for her husband and herself. The menu calls for a baked ham. As she is preparing the meal, she takes a butcher knife out of the drawer and cuts both ends of the ham off. Her observant husband asks:\\"Why are you cutting the ends off?\\"She replies: \\"My mother baked a ham this way.\\"\\"Why did she do that?\\"\\"I don't know. She just did.\\"The next time the couple visits her mother, the man asks:\\"Why do you cut the ends of the ham off when you bake it?\\"His mother-in-law responded: \\"That's how my mother baked a ham.\\"\\"Why did she do that?\\"\\"I don't know. She just did.\\"The first time the man meets his grandmother in law, he asks:\\"Why did you cut the ends of the ham off when you baked it?\\"She simply answers: \\"The pan was too short.\\"Pagan Christianity covers a lot of territory in areas of how and why the conventional church does what it does. Like the husband in the illustration, the writers ask the pointed questions that require rewinding back to the beginning of the reel to see how we got to the point we are presently. There is often (we discover) a \\"distortion of the concept\\" (p. 108) on the part of our Western culturized perspective. Many common areas are analyzed like church buildings, order of worship, the sermon, the tithe and salaried pastors, Sunday morning costumes, Ministers of music, baptism and the Lord's Supper.... many more.I highly encourage you to read and mark up this book.

But what we can discern from Scripture and history do not necessarily lead to the same conclusions.I've noticed that other reviewers disagree with Viola/Barna's \\"cure\\" for the state Christianity is in today. But beyond that, I don't feel that a return to \\"being the church\\" (the Body of Christ) as opposed to \\"going to church\\" is a threat to pastors. On the contrary, I feel it is the best thing to happen to pastor/teachers since the Great Commission. The solution frees up pastors from all of the high-demand expections we now subject them to.

Biblically imbalanced, Barna appears as if he has an axe to grind against the traditional church. He and Viola argue the lack of Biblical foundation for many elements of the traditional protestant church services. they try to demonstrate the pagan origin of it.He does little to acknowledge the Biblical history of houses of worsihp and the fact that throughout the scriptures the house of God served a valued purpose. Jesus on numerous occassions taught at the synagogue, the early church was always in the temple - praying daily and teaching. Barna appears to be writing a polemic against the traditional church model while becoming a proponent of house churches.the book is noted with such controversy that even the publisher prefaces the book with a disclaimer regarding the content of the book. I find that to be an extremely unusual tactic, esp. for a George Barna book. Were it not for the name and reputation of George Barna, I question whether any publisher in the U.S. would have published this book. Barna would be better served writing a book that explains and promotes his idea of 'church' rather than trying to undermine the traditional church model in this unbalanced attempt.As a note, I have many issues with the traditional church model and I truly enjoyed Barna's book Revolutionary. I consider myself to be a die hard Revolutionary.

Of course, the Bible is and always will be #1, but 'Pagan Christianity?' is a must read for all serious Christians. I believe it is VERY important for us to be aware of where our history began, and what different UNgodly influences have crept into our beliefs and practices, which most of us follow without ever questioning why we believe or do this particular thing. I call this the baby bird syndrome: Eyes closed, head back, mouth wide open, ready to swallow whatever our church leaders drop in without question.I believe that any responsible Christian should question, and take a hint from the Bereans (Acts 17:10-- That very night the believers sent Paul and Silas to Berea. When they arrived there, they went to the synagogue. 11 And the people of Berea were more open-minded than those in Thessalonica, and they listened eagerly to Paul's message. They searched the Scriptures day after day to check up on Paul and Silas, to see if they were really teaching the truth. 12 As a result, many Jews believed, as did some of the prominent Greek women and many men.Holy Bible, New Living Translation, (Wheaton, IL: Tyndale House Publishers, Inc.) 1996.) We should ALWAYS check the Bible for the scripture used, and the CONTEXT of the surrounding text to better understand what was being said and why. If a teaching doesn't line up with, or agree with what the Bible says, then I believe it best that you should absolutely disregard it!We have come so far from the Early Church, and what they believed and practiced, which was based totally on the TRUTH of God's WORD. It is so sad that so much of what modern churches believe and practice has absolutely NO CONNECTION WHATSOEVER with that TRUTH. Believers, read this book, read your Bibles, and get to know the TRUTH for yourselves!!!

The authors next book should be about doctrine rather than practice because an awful lot of Christian doctrine is also based on paganism. E.g. the Trinity, supernatural devil, demons, immortal soul, heaven going, everlasting torments in hell, substitutionary sacrifice - they are all non-Biblical ideas created by the minds of men influenced by pagan thought. At least the Catholics admit this - Protestants, however, try and prove these pagan ideas exist from \\"proof\\" texts in the Bible!The writers go into Constantine building \\"churches\\" a lot but they don't mention that he was the one that gave the Trinity the go-ahead.

For this idea alone I recommend Pagan Christianity to anyone serious about God's plans & purpose for their life.Weaknesses of Pagan Christianity:1. The authors don't understand the principle that the believer is free to do whatever the Bible doesn't prohibit. This robs their argument that many church practices have their origins in paganism of much of its force.2. They don't understand the adverse effects of the church in the 1st century asserting that the church was the new people of God, displacing the Jewish nation. In the NT there is no mechanism to measure and control.3. They don't understand that example isn't normative unless followed by a command. They have little Biblical basis for the particular model of house church they promote, & this principle further erodes their position.4. The quality of their thinking & reasoning is uneven.5.

Then, in 1996, after a \\"close encounter\\" with God, I threw out my formal, theological education and the teachings of the institutional church and began seeking God's truth anew. So, I immersed myself in studying the Bible. I conducted personal research in the areas of Koin&eacute; Greek, Ancient and Contemporary Church History, History of Biblical Translations, History of the Roman Empire and the Roman Catholic Church, History of Politico/Religious Conspiracies, the personal application of Christian concepts and principles to everyday life, and the history and etymology of the English Translation of the Bible. In addition, my personal Bible studies and research over last 10 years began to gel together with the information presented in Pagan Christianity. Note: I didn't take the word of Frank Viola and his book Pagan Christianity; I did own research and validated what he presented.As I write this review, I remember my first reading the original \\"Pagan Christianity\\" over 3 years ago. I read it two more times before the revision came out. The first time I read Pagan Christianity, I was shocked and relieved at the same time. I was shocked to discover the pagan (polytheistic) and political rituals and practices are what make the institutional church. I was relieved because I finally began to understand why today's institutional church doesn't work. Before I wrote this review, I read Frank and George's version twice.Even though I had prepared my mind for a paradigm shift, I struggled to \\"make sense\\" of this new information. Then I thought I can't imagine how difficult it would be for \\"lay\\" Christians to deal with all of this if they are not prepared ahead of time. They will not want to admit that they, their parents, grandparents, and so forth have been deceived: that they have based their lives on lies. It would not only be embarrassing but because they believed those lies, they would have to admit to making many bad decisions and mistakes. The natural tendency is for people to deny the new information and deny that they need to make changes in their lives. I didn't have as much difficulty imagining what the professional Christian would think. After all, I was once one of them. I think I would have asked myself, \\"How do I accept the information in Pagan Christianity and make the paradigm shift? After all, I am the leader...the one in charge...the expert on Christianity...the link between the laity and God. How can I admit that I have been wrong and teaching error all these years? How will I make a living if I leave the institutional church since that it is the only vocation for which I have training?\\"One reason I was able to make the paradigm shift was because I was at the end of my rope. I wanted to know the TRUTH regardless of what it cost me. I wanted to experience God like the New Testament Christians experienced God, regardless of the cost. The reader of Pagan Christianity will probably have to come to the same place or reject the book. Let me say that rejecting the book or rather the truths it conveys will cost you more than accepting it and making changes in your life.Frank Viola and George Barna describe the symptoms of a spiritually unhealthy, perhaps even dead, institutional church vis-&agrave;-vis exposing the practice of pagan (polytheistic) and political rituals. The symptoms include church buildings, the pulpit, the pew and balcony, the order of worship, the sermon, the pastor, religious costumes, the music director, tithing, paid professional clerics and staff, the youth director, Sunday school, baptism, the Lord's Supper, and the academic training for professional and lay church members. Historically, these symptoms began manifesting themselves as early as the First Century BCE. However, the problem is far more serious than practicing pagan (polytheistic) and political rituals as the institutional church.While describing symptoms is important, even more important is recognizing the sinister plot (the disease) that causes the symptoms. The sinister plot is the spiritual war that we read about throughout the Bible. It is the war of the world, the flesh, and the devil vs. God and His people. It is the war between truth and deception. History documents the progression of physical wars, from beginning to end. When one side begins to lose, it doesn't just give up; it throws more and more personnel and resources into the crushing cycle of attrition. This is what Satan is doing. While God and His people will eventually win the spiritual war, the enemy will continue to fight with more and more tenacity and furiousness. Even though Jesus conquered death, purchased salvation for mankind, and started building Christians into a spiritual house, Satan continues to intervene by deceiving and turning people from God. One way Satan turns people from God is by deceiving them into practicing pagan (polytheistic) and political rituals as the institutional church.The ordinary Christian has been deceived and it's not the Christian's fault. Deception by definition blinds the Christian from seeing it: \\"If you are deceived, you don't know it.\\" Such is the nature of deception: it is unseen, unrealized, and, thus, dangerously deadly. There are countless Christians who love God, who love one another, who want to do God's will, and who want to be God's son and daughter in both heart and mind. They sit together in church pews all over the world never suspecting that they have been deceived. They truly believe that they are doing what God wants them to do every Sunday. Sadly, the only way for them to realize that they have been deceived is for a source outside themselves, such as Pagan Christianity or other knowledgeable Christians, to reveal the deceptions to them. Pagan Christianity exposes and documents how Satan used and continues to use pagan religions, ambitious-misled people, and worldly politics to continue his ongoing last ditch effort to win out against God. But be of good cheer, for God and you have the final victory.I am in the process of writing two books that, in part, overlap some of the topics that Frank and George cover. In my research, I discovered many sources that Frank and George did not cite and those sources validated their findings. That is not to say that I agree with every word in Pagan Christianity. I differ, on occasion with specific dates and events, they present. I also differ with some treatments of Greek words and translations. However, overall, I can say that I agree with nearly 90% of what is presented in Pagan Christianity.It is fortunate that today, there are Christians around the world that are standing up and revealing the truth about the history and corruption of Christianity. These are not the first Christians to do this. Christians throughout history have been persecuted and murdered because they stood up against the power of politics and false religions. So, I thank Frank and George for their courage and willingness to risk themselves for the truth.Some readers of this review will hear negative comments about Pagan Christianity before they even read it. All I can do is to ask you to ask yourself, \\"Am I satisfied with my experience with God and the institutional church,\\" \\"Does Christianity live up to my expectations,\\" and \\"Does the institutional church and its activities match up to what I read in the New Testament.\\" If you answer \\"NO\\" to any or all of these questions, then read Pagan Christianity.Some readers of Pagan Christianity will say that the authors are simply tearing down today's institutional church for no good reason. Others will say that Pagan Christianity was written because the authors and/or family members were hurt by a pastor or other church leader. Still others will say that the authors are nit-picking at trivial matters. Let me assure you, \\"I can tell you from personal experience that none of this is true.\\"\\"Pagan Christianity\\" is a book less on a criticism of today's institutional church and more on a call for all Christians to return to their roots as defined by the New Testament and practiced by the early Christianity. Pagan Christianity is a must read that will allow readers to examine their understanding and practice of Christianity and to make changes that will ultimately lead to truth and freedom in Christ.I challenge you to pray and ask God to direct you to either read or not read Pagan Christianity. My best advice is, \\"Always follow the leading of the Holy Spirit.\\" However, if God directs you to read this book, be aware that you will struggle, not only against the lies and deceptions of traditional, institutional church-ianity, but also against the lies and deceptions of the evil spiritual forces in this world."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"I had been asking myself many questions when I got hold of this book: why do we do what we do in the institutional church? Not only did Mr. Viola's writing answer every question I had, but it also explained how our man-made traditions have adversely affected the church, hampering the headship of Jesus Christ. A must-read! But I warn you: this book may shake you up. If you want to be shakened, that's a very good thing."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"I graduated from seminary and taught at two Bible schools. This book confirmed what I have felt since I have been involved in Christian education. The book is superbly documented. The author did rigorous research; his points are solidly and clearly articulated and his tone is honest and inviting. The explosive nature of the book will invite acid criticism. From an academic vantagepoint without warm bias, the book is hard to refute. I recommend it to anyone who can survey it without bias."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"The objective of the book, which is just part of a 5 volume series, is to convince people that the traditional Christian church's practices are of Greek and pagan origin and ought to be immediately discarded and the 1st Century church re-established.It is part of restorationist literature, which has a long and interesting history. (the other pessimistic model of church history is remnant) What makes this book a good entry in the argument is the passion with which the author argues and the wide ranging sources he avails himself of. I intend to follow up on several of the references presented in the footnotes, which alone raise this book above most of its ilk.What is lacking is a systematic review of the process of syncretism, in fact i don't believe he even uses this word to describe what is the process he is discussing. The other glaring deficiency is an explanation of why church history is not progressive, why a restoration of 1st century practices is desirable for today, simply put, why is this normative and not just illustrative or even prelude. These are two really big issues that the book is just silent about, and why i rated it as unpersuasive.What is interesting is that i agree with most of his conclusions, but not for the reasons he presents, although the reasons are interesting and i am glad to have been exposed to them. Although the book will be persuasive to the choir, and unsettling to those with only a little awareness of church history, bcause the fundamental problem of syncretism is enormous and really needs to be dealt with in the church. Perhaps books like this and the house church movement will ignite a discussion, but one from first priniciples not just an emotional appeal.Should the church build huge church buildings? no, but the reasons are not as simple as because cathedrals were built like roman temples over the sites of pagan rituals and that the 1stC Christians met in homes not specially constructed buildings. This is the opposite of the 'history is always progressive' ideal, and it is just as wrong.it is a nice, easy to read, fun book. if i can find other of his books cheap i will read them, ie i will remember his name, but i am not moved to order them immediately and at full price because of what i read here."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"The material covered in this book isn't even thought about much by most church-going people. It challenges every aspect of the way we do \\"church.\\" Long over due and thought provoking, to say the least."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"The problem with this book is that it fails to recognize 3 very important principles. Firstly, the bible itself is not unique in the vast majority of its teachings, i.e., much is borrowed from paganism and baptized/sanctified to begin with. Something early Christians readily recognized and had no problem with. After all, as Augustine put it, \\"All truth is God's truth.\\" Secondly, such leads to a denial of incarnate witness within specific cultures, something that even the Son of God obviously practiced within the very specific Greco-Roman/Jewish context of his day. For example, while his teachings were often uniquely posed his methods were not at all unique to him or the time. Even apostolic/NT exegesis of the OT reveal the then-current Greek penchant for allegory, as many Jewish intellectuals, such as Philo of Alexandria, had long copied. The Jewish Law itself, as well as temple designs, were largely patterned after the wider cultures of the Near East. So, why would anyone imagine that the Church would not also discern appropriate ways of incarnate witness as it moved along and spread throughout the world? I mean, the scriptures never sanctioned the synagogue, but apparently, neither Jesus nor the Apostles seemed to have a problem with it. So, why would the Church not begin using buildings befitting its needs and from within the surrounding culture??? Thirdly, the authors have no idea how very 21-st century and western (indeed, American!) they sound. That in fact, so much of their perspective is itself a product, not of the bible, but of their own cultural (and its resulting peculiar theological) milieu. Maybe they should spend serious time with the early Church Fathers. Then, they might get an idea of how early Christians actually worshiped, thought, and lived. Remembering that, when reading the bible, the Fathers were reading it in their own language and from within the very same culture. Moreover, many of these earliest Christians laid down their lives precisely for what they understood about these things.In reality, what this book does is heighten the debate around regulative vs. normative forms of thinking about the Church. The regulative says all must be mandated directly by scripture. Which fails because, as is obvious, not everything God accepts as good was necessarily so sanctioned (e.g., the synagogue). Moreover, who is still living and thinking as if in a first-century mediterranean culture today? The other side is the so-called normative approach. This position is that something is permissible as long as 1) scripture does not prohibit it and 2) it is consistent with scripture's theological core. In other words, it is the spirit, not only the letter, of scripture that must be taken into account. And clearly, the biblical data itself supports the latter, more incarnational, approach.Of course, we need to separate the cultural dross from the theological gold from time to time. But the idea that there is only one way of doing things, or that all must be done today as it was in the first-century Greco-Roman context (as if it were holier than any other) is absurd. All one has to do is read about that culture and much of the New Testament clearly reflects those influences. So, on the one hand, we have those who want to reduce Christianity to nothing more than baptized paganism. And on the other, those like Barna and Viola who don't seem to understand that all revelation and inspiration take place in real space-time cultural-social history. With the result that many are forced to think that either Christianity must be false or that God abandoned the Church after the last apostle died. Fortunately, neither extreme is accurate."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Although much in this book exposes the dead traditions of men which have been accepted in the traditional denominations like the Roman Catholic Church, and other churches affected by her, that is not the target of the book. This book is aimed specifically at challenging the practise of genuine believers within various Evangelical groups.Like most things real poison can be hidden beneath truth. There is poison in this pot (or should I say book). I believe with all my heart that any practise amongst genuine believers can be challenged and must be challenged if it is not according to scripture. But that is a far cry from challenging normal practise and replacing it with other things less scriptural.In this book the Lord's Table is turned into a social meal. They call a separation of a full meal from the Bread and Cup a pagan-rite. Actually close study will show that Christ separated the two. \\"After Supper...supper being ended.\\" Secondly they constantly make laws and commands where there are none in the whole NT. There is no command to only meet in houses. There is no command to have a full meal with the Bread and Cup as an insignificant part. A third point is the removal of teaching and preaching from the local church and reserving it more for the function of apostles. I could continue on many points but this is not the place.This book may dangerously sway multitudes of genuine believers to doubt many clear scriptural practises which are twisted to the authors own thoughts. Viola has recently promoted forms of Catholic prayer no-where seen in the Bible. Barna for years has written books that promoted the church as a business and techniques no-where found in the Bible. Should we follow such men in calling things blessed of God for 2000 years in many reformations and revivals pagan when they are clearly biblical?I would strongly suggest that you Google: Pagan Christianity - A Response and read the biblical responses by Keith Malcomson before purchasing this or as an addition to reading it, or even if you have already read it."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"This is a fascinating book if you simply look at it as the history of the church and practices in the church. It does a great job of pulling in resources from all areas to summarize why we do what we do.This book is basic trash when it comes to the conclusions. It seems that Viola and Barna have a bone to pick and throw the baby out with the bathwater. There is no allowance for continuing revelation, according to them if it was not done in the Bible then it must be wrong. There is no allowance for a common grace, according to the authors if it came from the \\"pagan\\" world it must be wrong. God shows throughout scripture that he takes the things of this world and USES THEM to teach, train, and enhance HIS kingdom. You simply go to Exodus and see how God used what the Israelites were used to (Pagan Egypt) and turned it into worship of him. Everything from the form of the tabernacle, priestly garb, tools of worship and EVEN THE ARK OF THE COVENANT was modeled after Egyptian worship.If you stick to the interesting history and throw away the rest of the book you will enjoy and learn from Pagan Christianity."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"The ParabolaI LOVED Pagan Christianity.

I wanted to find out the \\"why\\" on alot of the things we do as a church. The major overlining issue with this book is, well, alot of it is made up.Barna claims we adapted preaching from the pagans or stoics, which is, not true. This is so wrong, it is borderline pagan in and of itself. Preaching was adopted from the practice in the synogogues where someone would read/teach scripture from a pulpit. The pagans did this, but well, alot of people teach or preach, that doesnt make it exclusively pagan.Also the point of they didnt meet regularly as a church in the early church is, well, stupid. There has been so many historical documents (most famous was the Roman research of whether Christianity was a cult or not because rumours of cannibalism spread because of communion, their finidings being that the PREACHED, took communion, and met at a REGULAR SEET DAY, being SUNDAY) of what the early church did, and many of which show us that they met on sundays (acts sites several times) and early, because it was not yet a sabbath, so it was a work day.What is most disappointing about this book is Barna is a researcher, if nothing else, and it is the research that makes this book total garbage."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"This book is written with a lot of historical facts on the metamorphosis of the church. It challenges some of our most accepted Christian traditions and causes us to question whether they are really biblical. A work like this could easily be judged and dismissed as negative by those of us who may not be able to handle the truth or who fear somehow that the painful truth will destroy what we already have. But for those of us who know that even painful truth brings freedom, it is an eye opener that will cause you to see church differently than ever before. The best thing about the book is that it's all historical facts and it paints a picture that wasn't so clear to see before, like why we do what we do in the church without even questioning it. I don't know about you, but I don't want to do what everyone else does, I want to do the Bible. This book challenges us to question our Christian traditions by showing where they came from. It breaks off some of the religious nonsense we have inherited, while arousing a desire for the way God truly intended His body to operate. The truth will set us free."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Years ago, I was somewhat blessed with a job that gave me a lot of free time. I used the time to do a lot of studying, diving into history and even researching some popular conspiracies to see how factual they were. What I learned was that a lot of what I was taught in school was a flat out lie. The Civil War, Slavery, Indian wars, WWII, Pearl Harbor, if there was a big event in American history, you can bet there is a world more to it than the official version you read in the majority of history book on the market. I learned a phrase that explained some of these inconsistencies very well: the winners of the war get to write the history books.However, there was one area of history that was pretty much off limits. The Bible and Christianity. The Bible is above criticism because it is the \\"infallible word of God.\\" Or, is it?There was a war against Christianity, and the winners got to write the history books and control the ancient texts and traditions. Somehow, when these people were the Leviathan of Revelations, they were equated with Satan, yet when in control of Christianity, they were saints.If these two things don't make your cognitive dissonance flare up, then denial is very strong with you. Again, if you don't get it, the winners of the war get to write the history books. In the case of Christianity, Leviathan wrote the history books and controlled tradition. It not only had access to ancient texts, it controlled the scribes.Pagan Christianity calmly and plainly lays out the fact that a big part of what Christians do every Sunday didn't actually come out of the Bible they cherish, but were instead a product of (pagan) Rome, with a touch of western philosophy thrown in for good measure. As someone who has been studying the early Church a lot, the book is dead on. An easy five stars.That said, I'm going to throw out a couple of other books that aren't really related to Pagan Christianity at all, but then again, they are. Take a look at:* Mistakes Were Made (But Not by Me): Why We Justify Foolish Beliefs, Bad Decisions, and Hurtful Acts, by Carol Tavris and Elliot Aronson* The Self Illusion: How the Social Brain Creates Identity, by Bruce HoodOne of the things that crossed my mind while reading \\"Pagan Christianity,\\" was that America was in a culture war...with one side, which has very strong beliefs, pushing for a return to a more moral time. The funny thing is, through the pages of \\"Pagan Christianity,\\" you can see these very strong beliefs more closely resemble a house built on sand, than the concrete truth these people think it is.This tips the debate over to the \\"The Self Illusion\\" or \\"Mistakes Were Made\\" area, and it is a somewhat Biblical debate at the same time: free will? Did everyone come to hold these strong beliefs out of free will, or is it more a matter of genes and environment? \\"Pagan Christianity\\" will make the case that we are more swayed by environment and tradition than most of us would care to believe.I will admit it is a little scary to find out a lot of things you believed your whole life aren't based on anything more than pagan traditions. It does tend to knock down the ego a notch or two. But, since returning to simpler, more moral times probably isn't going to happen, maybe everyone getting their ego swatted down is really what America needs at this time.I'm going to throw out one more book, and in this case it is extremely complimentary to Pagan Christianity:* The Secret Message of Jesus: Uncovering the Truth that Could Change Everything, by Brian D. McLarenEvery copy of the Bible should come with a copy of \\"The Secret Message of Jesus\\" rubber-banded to it, in my opinion. If a Gideon Bible is left somewhere, another society should be created to leave a copy of \\"The Secret Message of Jesus\\" right next to it. If we are going to keep going to church buildings, then every pulpit should have a stack of these books behind them, and a copy given to every single person that answers an alter call.If there is any hope of a change in direction for America, it isn't going to come from the institutional church, it is going to come out of \\"Pagan Christianity\\" and \\"The Secret Message of Jesus.\\" Yes, pagan traditions have worked very well for us in the past, but is it such a shock to see that pagan traditions didn't hold up over time?"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"I never knew that nearly everything we experience as being a part of the Church today has more in common with ancient paganism than with the New Testament Church.

This is something I would expect to come across in the Atheist section but it is rightfully placed among the Christian classics of the likes of Oswald Chambers and Watchman Nee. This book touches on the essence of how far we have deviated from the church whose architecture and builder is Christ. \\"Upon this rock, I shall build my church.\\" Brothers Frank and George have done an outstanding job of identifying the source and history of how the mustard seed was manipulated against its nature of an herb shrub to become the Great Tree (Christendom) it is today. As we are to not remain empty but to be filled, we are encouraged to empty ourselves of such practices and to fill ourselves with the life. The way the church was intended to be... a living body.Many of us have left many institutional churches for others because we have been trying to find the church with the least amount of errors. Not knowing that it's not the people but the system that is in error. This revelation didn't come by anything else but by the Lord calling us into His reality. We leave behind for something greater such as how Abraham was called out of Ur of the Chaldeans and Haran to a city whose architect and builder is Lord God. \\"Pagan Christianity\\" serves as a confirmation to those who have left the system and an encouragement to walk by faith for those who have heard the Lord calling but needed that extra light to see the condition of the church (the people of God) today."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"When I first encountered this book, the title attracted me. So, I read it immediately in the library of my school. But that was all. What the authors want to do with this book is just to deny all the tradition of the church after the Apostolic period. If you as a Christian read this book, you would consider to leave the church and feel no need of the church.I am a Ph.D. student in New Testament studies and know at least something about the church history. It is true that the church history has a number of ugly and embarrassing things in it, but it is also a precious deposit of Christian tradition and heritage that numerous Christians before us have inherited to us through their struggles for being sincere and faithful to the Lord.But, the authors of this book simply want to deny all those tradition and heritage of the Christian church and to claim that they stand above them, knowing everything about the church history.This book is very annoying and a product of today's popular trend that attacking Christianity attracts huge attentions of the public and thus means considerable money like Dan Brown is exactly doing.The authors claim to be sincere Christians and want to restore the current church to the pure, original early church. Also, they seem to suggest that they carefully researched relevant resources to make their cases, but actually is not the case. They hardly quote primary sources and relevant ancient resources, but rather they just copied from some critical works against Christianity and pasted them in their books.These authors have no interest in building the church strong and helping fellow Christians to be faithful and mature in this fallen world. What they really want to do is just to make money by attracting attentions of the people who always seek something new.Buying and reading this book will be totally waste of your money and time.I doubt that the authors are really attending the church at all now or really Christians."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Three stars for the history lesson. The title seems to be wrong. Maybe it should be something like, \\"Why I Do House Church\\" or better yet \\"Why I use a corn cob instead of t.p.\\" If you didn't know, Viola and Barna are advocates for small house churches. Nothing wrong with that but making a case against current church practice is simply silly. Thank God church practice has evolved to meet the needs of current Christ seekers and followers. Next Barna and Viola will call guitars pagan. Where does it end? My point is how can we best share Jesus to a 21st century person? Church is meant to evolve - not to be stuck in the 1st Century. I'm wondering if women are allowed to speak in Viola and Barna's house church. Do they wear head coverings? How boring! If not, how hypocritical!

Jewish customs were found to be hindering the gospel than gentile practices. Gentiles were welcome with their foreskins, attire, cuisine (except blood). Only prayerfull men and women who live as pilgrims and strangers (who do not love the world), changed the world and this profile of people can again dream of a Revolution.Agree that tithe is not mondatory. But a tither is doing something about the fundamental sin of SELF than a non-tither.Everything belongs to God. Clergy salary? Barna and Viola are where they are because of a paid pastor.We want our children to be enlightened like them. The building? Everything done out of love glorifies God who is LOVE. The research ,prophecy, zeal, faith without love amounts to nothing.I give the book 3 stars because leaders of the institutional church clearly love the world and people who are full are spiritually myopic.

It brings to light topics of discussions that are happening in the greater church world-wide and gives answers to topics that are often mere rumors within the Christian Faith.If your faith lies within a system, it will radically challenge and test your faith. If you are grounded in a Jesus-centric faith, then this book will only give you reason to further the endeavor to draw closer to Christ."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"I bought Pagan Christianity about 6 months ago. It was LIFE-CHANGING! I always knew there was something missing in church, and when I read Pagan Christianity, I knew why. The Institutional Church as we know it today doesn't look anything like the way the N.T. church looked. The church has adopted practices that the Pagans used and called it Christianity. The book explores where the religious rituals we do in church come from, why they were started, and why some aren't healthy for the body of Christ. I have the e-book and paperback and I lend them out to anyone who wants to explore the idea of \\"Church\\" and why we do what we do when we gather together as believers. I can't say enough good things about this book. It rocked my world, brought my focus back on Jesus and freed me from all the religious baggage we carry around when we walk into a church building. Read it, explore what Jesus wanted when He said, \\"I will build my church.\\" Gathering information should never be something that you are threatened by. We need to keep growing, learning and evaluating why we do what we do. Get this book, it might just change your life and set you free also!"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"My brother bought and mailed me this book several years ago. I was struggling under some abusive church authority and confused. Thankfully, this book helped remind me that God is not the author of confusion. Some things in this book were an outright revelation - like the meaningless traditions that all churches follow, no matter what denomination or orthodox. Other facts were harder to accept like the way tithing is expected in modern churches. I began studying the Bible like never before to find answers. I found that churches want to recreate an Old Testament model, complete with temple and priests (pastors). It's really holding the church back. God wants to do so much more through us, but we don't want to go there! I've used this book as a starting place to examine many things I took for granted.I found that Paul said we are the building - so why do churches spend so much money (millions) and effort to build 'temples?' I think there is great variety in ministries and have seen God allow building programs to flourish, but I have to wonder, is this really what EVERY church body should be doing? I've been a part of music programs where the music minister (can't really find one of those in the NT) proudly calls us the Levites. In my Bible studies, I found that these things had passed away and that God favors no man! How about those churches that won't give anyone else mic. time in case they have to do damage control? We are a long way from where we should be!The tithe threw me for a loop. I have given thousands of dollars to churches over the years. If God instituted 10% in the OT, my Dad says that's a good place to start. However, the NT says to give what you feel led to give. It certainly means to be generous and support missions, but the rigid, weekly tithe is in direct violation of the 'liberty' from Jewish law that Paul talks so much about in the NT. The verses used to make people tithe were about specific mission gifts that Paul arranged and not meant to be legalistic. Yes, it bothers me still because there is a lot of guilt not adhering to this legalism and I don't want anyone to think that my 'understanding' is just an excuse not to give. I also don't want to give up my responsibility to actually give money where it is intended instead of generically dropping it in a plate and letting someone else do the work for me exclusively. We self-righteously put 10% in the plate while the person next to us is drowning in debt and we think they deserve to suffer and not be helped! Besides, we're pretty strapped after giving 10% and can't imagine giving over-and-above. Americans are the most giving people, but the church almost never helps its people in a true financial way, other than the staff salaries. What's wrong with this picture? It's okay to give millions to Africa, but all I get on Mother's Day is a flower? Yes, most churches help their people in a pinch, but they are not set up to continuously help their Christian community of widows and orphans, etc. Why? Because the cost of running the biggest church in my small town is $70,000+ a week. It makes me sick when there is dangerous ice on the roads that one pastor begs people to come to church or not to forget to submit their tithe electronically. Wrong, wrong, wrong!!! I don't like it at all.Also, what about the 10 Commandments? Obviously, God's character and desire is shown through all scripture. If the Sabbath was Saturday originally, and the new Christians changed it to Sunday to signify Christ risen, then what are we supposed to do? Are the 10 commandments part of the old law? My husband and I have had some interesting discussions about this! Certainly, much of the 10 Commandments specify things that are indeed sin, whether OT or NT.God has been generously gracious with His church, even with her flaws. I'm excited to see what our future holds. Meanwhile, I'm open to God's leading as I let His Word continue to teach and lead me."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Great book, important points but with gaps in the early church model and unable to recognize other models than a democratic \`home church'.I agree with 90% of what he says. He articulates some important issues very well. I think much of what has been codified as 'THE RIGHT WAY' is in fact man's design and preferences. Often they are not unbiblical but create competition with what the elements the Bible encourages to have present. The evaluation of present day church life is unfortunately limited to criticism, not seeing how many churches follow much of what he is expressing, at least in part. I have been a part of a model that would probably meet his criteria on most points except size and leadership. You can follow the Biblical principles he espouses and still be a larger congregation. I wish he was not out there quite so far, as I would more readily encourage other to read his books. Here are some issues I have:1. For someone who is so involved in what the early church did, he hardly ever mentions the synagogue. This was THE model the early church followed. He is only reading the NT, which greatly limits his hermeneutics. There is no background understanding or context and he makes mistakes because of that. In fact he very much endorses total breakage from Biblical/Jewish roots.2. He has a view of hierarchy that is so egalitarian that he does not even see hierarchy in the God head. The Father submits to the Son and the Spirit. Any form of leadership that is not from a total consensus is wrong in his mind. This is not a Biblical truth, but he portrays it as one. This really drives much of his criticism.3. There was the 'offices' of elders and deacons in the first century church, and there was usually one 'point man' leader who was the pastor or lead elder. He disagrees, but it is fact.4. There can be a wonderful flow of shared decision making in a group of church leaders that submit to each other, but have a senior pastor. I have been a part of one. It deeply respected the gifts and viewpoints of the team. Perhaps had he been in such a church he would have come to different conclusions.5. It seems his experience drives some of his theology. I wonder how exposed he really is to what has been going on in other movements. For example, he lumps the 'Restoration Movement' in with the '3rd Wave Movement'. They are very distinctly different movements. The Restoration movement was receiving revelation about the truths he is teaching 60 years ago, yet he seems unaware of their local church teachings.6. He believes that any control of a believers expression of their thoughts or gifts in a meeting is wrong. I doubt in practice he really has no boundaries, but he clearly states that position. How then can the injunctions of Paul in 1 Corinthians 14, or any other number of places, be carried out if there is no authority in the hands of the elders?7. His view of elders is weak and taken out of context of the whole Bible.8. Buildings were used by the early church when possible. Some whole synagogues became Messianic, though that was not the norm as the church grew. The house networks were a practical function. Some churches in larger towns and cities became quite large, many thousands in number in Ephesus. Buildings did begin to appear as they were needed and the political/religious climate allowed them.9. The larger a church gets, the fewer people can share. That is does not mean that only the pastor shares. There can be several voices heard in a church service. I have been a part of church meetings of over 1,000 people and there would be as many as 5 plus different voices heard: the worship leaders exhortations; 2 or 3 voices from the congregation giving a prophetic word or exhortation; maybe a musician playing a certain tune the Lord gave him that captured the mood of the Spirits flow; the person preaching the message. All of this was done in an orderly way and greatly edified the church.10. Small groups can have the same flow he describes whether or not they are stand alone small groups or part of a larger church community. Being a small group of people who attend a church together as well does not divorce the people from God's moving in the same way as a stand alone house meeting.11. The great danger of independent house meetings is the disconnect from balancing elements. He explains the excesses of the 'Shepherding' movement of the 70's, but doesn't connect the dots with the fact that in that movement there were not adequate checks and balances. The benefit of a slightly larger group is that you have more of the ministries that build up a church present, as well as more wisdom and strength to keep the church out of the ditch. It doesn't have to be a large church, but if you only have 20 to 30 people (not adults but total counting kids) you just don't have the benefit of balancing giftings and voices of others with insight.12. When you have the gifts of the Spirit operating, there needs to be wise, experienced leadership present or helping to guide the flow and ministry or it can get wacky real quick. Even dangerous. While this can be in a small group, it often isn't and may require outside guidance and yes, control from within or outside the group.13. Most people want two things: a smaller group of friends to grow with in a more intimate way and a larger community to be part of for variety and effective ministries. Why straight jacket people into just the former? Why condemn other churches for providing that?I would recommend 2 books.1. Team Ministry by Dick Iverson. This gives a good intro to the subject of team ministry and plurality of church leadership. This was way before the organizational gurus and John Maxwell were teaching it. Dick got this form the Word and God. All of my studies have caused me to respect what I was taught about the early church pattern that this man saw. I can refer you to more books on this if you are really interested.2. Why I Love The Church by Kevin DeYoung and by Ted Kluck. They can get pretty defensive against the 'Emerging Church' movement and the 'House Church' movement, but they bring out some very good truths. You will probably need to google a few references to various movements unless you have been into modern ecclesiastical theology.Hope this review is of interest. I believe it is important to follow a Biblical pattern if we are to have Biblical results! I hope you continue to prayerfully study on."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"This book is well written in segments giving you time to think and consider the points raised.I have recommended it to many."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"It is somewhat of a luxury for Christians in our time to have access to such a concise, clearly written and well documented book on the history of our church practices. I salute Viola and Barna on this courageous, groundbreaking contribution to the church of Jesus Christ. Please be reminded that the intention of this book is not to present us with alternate solutions, or to describe the church as envisioned in the New Testament. It is rather, a deconstructive work aimed at tracing the widely unknown origins of our modern church practices. Viola builds on this work with his constructive sequel: Reimagining Church. I highly recommend this book. To many of you, it will represent the missing link between the early foundation that Christ and the Apostles laid down, and the institutional churches of today in their various forms."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"While searching to understand the failing condition of America, a notice concerning Pagan Christianity popped up in my email inbox.

But for the pioneer who is willing to \\"go for broke\\" in search of the promised land, this book may be the catalyst to help you take that first step. By the end of the book I had jumped off the cliff. I am still a bit stunned, but in a good way.

I have many times become very frustrated with persons when they present something as biblical fact and cannot back it up scripturally. This is what I love about this book.Not only are you presented with history but you are given the evidence yourself to research and make your determination with. It is a very Berean concept and I love it.Scriptures tell us to test the spirits and that men should be proven. This is what I think Mr. Viola & Mr. Barna have accomplished here. They have proven that this is not just the ramblings of some renegade group of wayward believers stuck in a house, hating on the institutional church. These are true men of faith who are wanting to walk with their Lord and Savior in the fullest measure of truth and their hearts desire is to see the rest of the Body Of Messiah accomplish the same. It provides us with the opportunity to make an informed, factual decision about the IC (institutional church) as it is today and whether or not we are willing to settle or come out of our comfort zones and reach for more.I came upon this book by accident. I had felt in my spirit for a long time that something was \\"not right\\" with the IC. Through the leading of the spirit, I was moved to spend some time alone in prayer with the Lord and try and figure out what was happening to me. In the course of this time, I received an email stating that George Barna had a new book out with a link. I thought, \\"Wow, George Barna. My pastor loved his Revolution Book! He used it in some of his teachings. Maybe I should check it out and let him know about it\\" Little did I know that my pastor had taken some things from Mr. Barna's \\"Revolution\\" out of context in the purpose of using it to strengthen his point in his teaching and neglected to mention what the rest of the book said. Why? Because it is not something he wanted his congregation to know!After clicking on the link and reading a small excerpt, I was stunned! It confirmed everything I had been feeling in my spirit for years! I ran to Borders to buy it and never looked back.I never mentioned the book to my pastor. He would never approve of this book and would never want the congregants to read it!Over the next few weeks, I received confirmation in so many other ways that this was truth. Not to mention my own research that I did based on the facts provided in the book, internet & library research and simply things the Lord placed in my path that I wasn't even seeking. It is truth.I highly recommend this book & say that it will force you to do one of two things: 1) Face the facts and move forward or 2) Ignore the facts, quench the Spirit and stagnate. It's your choice. Don't read it unless you really want the truth and are prepared to get rid of your \\"boxes\\".I pray that He will give you eyes to see, ears to hear and a heart open and ready to receive His truth."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"one of the most powerful and engaging books i've read. it is thoroughly documented and clearly written. a must have for those who want their church practices examined and changed."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"When reading makes me frustrated the point of abrasion can come in two forms: 1) The authors haven't done what I would have hoped that they would do or 2) What I'm reading is too far from what I (or we) are doing for me to see how to get there. Obviously the latter is not bad as it can bring new ways of looking at issues and challenge me to move forward.I just finished reading (as part of my vacation reading plan) Pagan Christianity: Exploring the Roots of Our Church Practices by Frank Viola and George Barna. I found myself frustrated as I read this book. In this case, I had alternating feeling of frustration from both sources. Viola and Barna have challenged me to do something, to think about the church and where to go from here and to live a life more centered on Jesus. At the same time, I think they fall short of their goal, even, at times, suggesting backward movement where the church has progressed positively and often deciding that the best days of the church were some glorified day that makes no sense to us today.Their purpose was to \\"remove a great deal of debris in order to make room for the Lord Jesus Christ to be the fully functioning head of His church.\\" This is a noble goal, and one that I agree with the authors as they set a need. They do a reasonable job of pointing out debris that needs to be removed. I agree that the church building has been falsely raised to a point of idolatry. Similarly, I agree whole heartedly that they idea of dressing up for church as it is a sign of my having when other don't is a great distraction from the message of the gospel. I have been pushing to move our church away from age-graded discipleship methods and from a separation of power, clergy and laity.While I agree often with the authors as they criticized the institutionalized and paganized church, I struggle more with the solution which too often is to return to some model of church-life from the first century. That sounds fine and dandy, as certainly, if Jesus and the apostles lived in the first century, those folks had direct access to what the church should be. This might be somewhat true, but not completely. In fact, if you read the epistles, you should notice that a lot of them were written as correctives to a church that was already missing the mark.Of course, our authors would likely respond that their premise is that the correctives where de-institutionalizing the church. This is true, but still, I think that the authors too often lead us back to a fictional image of the church. It may be that they did much research to discover what the church looked like and was supposed to act like, but it is still an image that we have little evidence to know how this early church formed, moved and interacted. Moreover, there is less evidence to help us to know what a church must look like 2000 years later. We do not really know that the first century church held normative practices or how many of their practices were our of necessity since the church was small and just begining in its formation.I agree that we need to remove debris from the institutional church. A lot of debris. In almost everything there is junk that needs to be removed. Relics of cultures past must be put to rest or they become idols in our worship. The solution, though, is not to replicate a church from another culture long ago, but to re-learn how the church (the people in the family of God) can free ourselves of old cultural relics and appropriately connect with a culture today.I think the church does need to be more organic; more natural to this world and culture; more focus on Jesus Christ and his gospel. Reading Pagan Christianity has helped me to take another look at influences that are clouding our relationship with Jesus Christ. I would recommend it as reading for church leaders (which the authors would say shouldn't exist) and for all church members as we continue to discover God's vision for the church today. My application, however, would be to examine our practices, know that the culture will influence who we are as a people, and eliminate any practice that distracts us from God."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"I have two problems with this book. First, the authors conclude several times that the early church did not conduct themselves a certain way based on a lack of any mention of the subject. Or that one mention of one church acting a certain way at one time is proof that all churches everywhere at all times should conduct themselves the same way.My second contention is the lack of deference to any other plausible explanation for changes in church corporate worship during the second century. Paul preached a soon return of Jesus Christ. Many first century Christians believed that the last remainign Apostle, John, would not die before Jesus returned. ALl of these expectations proved incorrect and resulted in a great disappointment or falling away. The second century faithful Christians struggled to find their way out of that darkness and remain relevant.The authors are so convinced that their explanation is the only one they unnecessarily impugn god fearing men (eg. Dwight Moody didn't see the eternal nature of salvation rather than accepting that he could see that view yet chose to focus on one aspect of salvation).I agree with the authors that Christianity does not need professional pastors and expensive buildings. We might be robbing God in this age not by witholding tithe but by giving it to institutions God never ordained instead of taking care of our Christian brethren around the world. Solid points each well researched and documented. I appreciate this work for that proclamation. It does not grace this important discussion to include illogical proofs or intolerant assertions."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"I too agree with one reviewer who said that the book was great, but that the conclusions and solutions were limited. It almost sounds like the author wants to completely void the Christian church since the First Century because it doesn't fit God's blueprint. To do so is to say that the Holy Spirit can't move amongst His people unless we get the process right.Man has always mucked up the right relationship with God because we want to have idols, sacrifices, rules, and leaders. Remember in 1 Kings when God wanted to be Israel's king, but they wanted a human ruler instead? Does that mean that God didn't move in the nation of Israel after that point? No, I don't think so. I think that Jesus rules his Church and moves in more unconventional ways because he doesn't have the ideal situation in many church bodies, but God is God and His Spirit moves regardless of how we \\"set it up!\\"That being said, I feel that I may be moving towards a \\"house church\\" solution as I crave this in my life as many who read this book will attest to. But what I really wanted to see the authors support, in the conclusion of the book, is a more realistic approach to making things more like the way they should be. There is no way that approximately 600,000 Christian churches in North America (who knows the number worldwide) will drop what they are doing, disband, fire their pastors and become house churches. It's both unrealistic and impossible! However, moving towards seeing the Body of Christ function more properly WITHIN these churches through small groups and house studies is a much more practical solution. Emphasizing this as an alternative would have been a great service to the church! It may not be the perfect solution, but it will allow a similitude of true Christian fellowship and 'ekklesia' (assembly) to occur where it might not normally happen.Notwithstanding this criticism, this book is a must read for any open-minded believer who does not want to be a lemming and is open to a deeper walk with their Lord. It has confirmed many things that I have believed for years, but could never validate before. I just assumed all the things that we did had some spiritual heritage after the New Testament that gave it some credence. I never imagined that these were Greco-Roman and/or pagan influenced rituals.Please do yourself a favor and READ THIS BOOK! I'm buying 10 copies and giving a copy to every family in my small group and a couple of open-minded pastors!"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"If one is not a well grounded Christian with a strong relationship with God, I would suggest avoiding this book. However, if one is a committed Christian seeking to strengthen the Body of Christ, it will provide great food for thought, though it will certainly disturb them."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Take note please - these are the views of an unregenerate Gentile.I here write what I hope is a respectful review not only to Frank and George,but also to those who may presently and sincerely be positioned as a 'pastor'. Great care is needed in handling this matter,for I should think Frank and George could name many men who have sincerely served Messiah Jesus as a 'pastor' ; 'pastors' who have brought many to the Lord in that capacity.IMPORTANTLY,Frank and George distance themselves from anyone who would want to use the information they uncover in a way that would damage the Body (rather than bring the Body back to scriptural practices). When I started to read PC,I tried to read the footnotes on the page too (as I moved from page to page),but it spoiled the flow ; so I would advise reading the whole book,or a chapter at a time,before then going back and reading some of the footnotes later (if you want to).If a spade is still a spade,Chapter 4's contention that disciples 'are not transformed simply by hearing sermons week after week' is all-too-true. That said,there IS a need for weighty teaching of Holy Scripture - for the training,correcting and equipping of the man [and woman] of God. Just as babies need vaccinating against deadly diseases that can be contracted from the world,alas,new babes in Messiah need vaccinating against deadly doctrines than can be contracted from those in the Body.In chapter 5 they really get to the heart of the problem. The contrast between active interdependent disciplehood spoken of in Scripture and the passive dependence of pastor-centered flocks,is stark. (On an unrelated but primary matter,one concern I found in the chapter was where it is written '...neither Jesus nor Paul imposed any fixed organizational patterns for the New Israel.' I hope neither Frank nor George have been fed 'Replacement Theology'. In Second Covenant Scripture,'Israel' refers to Paul's kinsmen according to the flesh,not Messiah's Congregation/Bride. There is a New,Second,Better Covenant WITH Israel - but not a New Israel. For more on this,see 'Our Hands Are Stained With Blood' by Michael L Brown,and 'Defending Christian Zionism' by David Pawson.)'Evangelical' congregations would strenuously deny they are pastor-centered (instead of Messiah-centered),but their practices tell a different story : they (effectively) enthrone a 'pastor' above themselves,then they depend on and orbit around him thereafter ; if he leaves or dies,they search for another one.Alas,so entrenched and sacrosanct is the idea of 'SOLA PASTORA' (i.e. one 'pastor' or 'senior pastor' per congregation) ; so appealing to some is the leadership position of the 'pulpit' ; so cozy to others is the abdication of responsbility in the 'pews' - that a call to authentic scriptural leadership may actually be a stumbling block to many Western 'Evangelicals' who call Jesus 'Lord'.If truth be told,I think many men take their first steps on the 'Road to CLERGYHOOD' (so to speak) in SINCERITY : they feel they are 'called into the minstry' and genuinely want to serve God ; but,as the 'trappings' of the road are accumulated (diplomas,titles of respect,career ; and the approval of men - in the 'pew',the locality and perhaps even internationally) they begin to walk that road in SELF-INTEREST and PRIDE. They forget that the very characteristics of authentic disciplehood involve lifelong persecution,humilty,death to self,a willingness to 'rock the boat' and face ostracization whenever necessary,and above all,TRUTH. Some are now unwilling to forsake the status quo ; they are unwilling to objectively examine the sandy foundations upon which they stand,and repent of the TRADITION-based situation they are in.In chapter nine,it was good to hear George and Frank calling the Body back to immediacy with regard to immersion in water. For a more in-depth discussion of the significance of immersion in water (and much more besides),see David Pawson's TREMENDOUS book,'The Normal Christian Birth.'The closing section of chapter 10 ('Exposing the heart of the problem') is a statement of immense significance - and the end of the \\"pastor's\\" quote is a tragic reflection indeed.As for chapter eleven - yes indeed,the Holy Scriptures are not to be treated as a proof-text jigsaw ; enormous damage has been done by one-sentence 'proof-texting'. What God has put together into a library of God-breathed revelation,man has put asunder - into more than 30,000 pieces ! The anology used in that chapter to illustrate the absurd way Holy Scripture is used today (in comparison to how it was originally written) was EXCELLENT.Chapter 12 (on the boat-rocking manner of Jesus) was good - although in the light of Matthew 12:33-37 I was disappointed to see Martin Luther used as a positive illustration. Reason being,as Leonard Verduin has said (in his TREMENDOUS book 'The Reformers and Their Stepchildren'),'They [the leaders of the Magisterial Reformation] constantly urged the magistrate to draw the blood of the opposition' (Chapter 1).The introduction and the afterword are particularly well written. In the introduction they set the stage for the home truths they are to present ; in the afterword,they challenge the reader : will the reader choose to be merely informed by the home truths (i.e. will they carry on regardless),or will they be transformed ?For a highly complementary read,see Alexander Strauch's bookBiblical Eldership: An Urgent Call to Restore Biblical Church Leadership: in PC,Frank and George reveal the non-apostolic origin of many Evangelical practices ; in BE,Alexander majors on the importance of an unreproachable character if one is to become eligible for elderhood,plus an all-too-rare recognition of God's call for (Body-wide) MALE leadership. It would be a shame to get scriptural and objective about the God-breathed PLURALITY of flock leadership,while remaining subjective about its GENDER. For more on this,seeLeadership is Male, by David Pawson - a book foreworded by Elisabeth Elliot no less. As David points out - rightly,I believe - Paul's views on leadership (WITHIN the confines of the family home and the Body),were not based on the culture of his day (in Ephesus or anywhere else),but on God's creative order (from Eden on).That all said,it is not enough to move from one-man,clerical dependence (in a 'church building') to team oversight (in a network of family homes) - if the Bride is going to change from passivity to EFFECTIVE,Jesus-magnifying,one-another interdependence and action,it is also necessary to contend with teaching that has long served to disempower,desalinate and leave unprepared the Western contingent of the Bride (namely 'Cessationism','Calvinism' and 'Dispensationalism' respectively ; that said,'Arminianism' is a wineskin too - albeit perhaps,the least pernicious one) ; flocks need to be scripturally FED as well as LED.LEADING and FEEDING the local flock scripturally,are intertwined matters. When it comes to FEEDING the flock,here are some areas that need to be corrected in love (and in order that Messiah Jesus be MAGNIFIED and the teaching of God the Savior ADORNED) - together with the books that address them : Sentimental (vs Scriptural) Evangelism - seeIS JOHN 3:16 THE GOSPEL?; Cessationism - seeJesus Baptises in one Holy Spirit; Once Saved,Always Saved and Perseverence of the Saints - seeThe Road to Hell; A/Post-Millennialism and PRE-Tribulation Rapture - seeWhen Jesus Returns.I would also like to urge all Western disciples who congregate in homes (or 'church buildings'),to get themselves a copy of Paul Hattaway's CHALLENGING,HEARTENING,SUPERB,MARVELOUS,TREMENDOUS book,Back To Jerusalem(a book about Chinese disciples who meet in homes) ; in order to LEARN from them,PRAY for them,ASSIST them (with money and Bibles),and JOIN HANDS with them as fellow brothers and sisters in Messiah. In that book,those lovely and fearless agape-soldiers speak of (and also at points,directly address) Western 'pastors' ; but I venture to say they did not get that leadership model from the Word - they got it from the West ! These Chinese servants of Messiah Jesus have no diplomas on the wall or marketplace titles of respect before their names ; but they bear the brandmarks of Messiah Jesus on their bodies. When it comes to books on rubber-hits-the-road holiness,it is one of the most important works outside of Holy Scripture,that a Western believer could possibly read - period!According to God-breathed Scripture,flock leadership is male,homegrown,diploma-less,untitled,plural and non-clerical - not gender-neutral,sourced,diploma-dolatrous,titled,solo and clerical. Evangelicals are known for declaring the Bible to be the infallible Word of God ; may they therefore fully submit to what God has said - and be very,VERY careful not to give way to hot,counterproductive words in regard to PC or anything else. Just as the Apostles rejoiced at being counted worthy to suffer for the Name (and in keeping with a heart like that of John the Baptist) - instead of fighting to hold on to what is not God-breathed,may many 'pastors' humbly rejoice at the prospect of making themselves of no reputation ; at the prospect of becoming much LESS in the eyes of their congregation and locality,in order that Messiah Jesus may become much MORE (John 3:20).As Kim Tan said in 'Lost Heritage' (his excellent historical PRIMER) : 'It has been said that history is the propoganda of the victor : whoever wins writes history from their point of view. Much of the writings of the dissenters were confiscated and burned so that their testimony could be distorted and misrepresented by their persecutors.' Well,it is high time to hear from the true winners of the past on a number of matters (Messiah Jesus above all !),and high time to listen to the home truths revealed in PC. Holiness and maturity (or the lack of it) is not revealed by how someone speaks of their friends and those who agree with them,but by how they speak of their enemies and those who disagree with them. With that in mind,book reviews on PC (indeed,on any book) may sometimes reveal more about the reviewer than the book under review.PC is an iconoclastic BREAKTHROUGH book - no question. George and Frank have effectively lifted the rug and retrieved historical facts that have been swept underneath ; furthermore,they have joined the dots,and shown how the world has influenced the Body on a number of fronts. (At long last this has finally been done.) That said,and with due respect to Frank and George,I am recommending the book itself - not necessarily every book Frank and George ever write. It is not easy to find teachers of depth and quality - two of the finest I know of are Michael L Brown and David Pawson. Frank Viola and George Barna (IRRESPECTIVE of their own personal falliblity - a trait we all share) have very VERY important things to say in PC. I hope many will objectively listen.To draw to a conclusion,let me put this KEY quote before you from Chapter 5 ('The Pastor.' Given the counterproductive leadership structure so prevalent among Western believers,this chapter is of IMMENSE significance.) :'The Greek word translated pastors is poimen...Regrettably,we [i.e. Evangelicals] have filled this word with our own Western concept of what a pastor is....The one-man ministry is entirely foreign to the New Testament....It has rendered you a mere spectator....nothing so hinders the fulfillment of God's eternal purpose as does the present-day pastoral role.'Too true : once POIMENAS is properly translated in Ephesians 4:11,what does an OBJECTIVE reading (of Acts 20:17-38,1 Timothy 3:1-7,Titus 1:5-9 and 1 Peter 5:1-4) tell us ? Who are the 'shepherds and teachers' of a local congregation ? Is it not the ordinary elders/overseers themselves ? Indeed,Paul makes ability to teach a prerequisite of ORDINARY elderhood/oversight. In translating POIMENAS (Strong's Concordance no. 4166) as 'pastors' (instead of 'shepherds' as elsewhere in Second Covenant Scripture),it has enabled a false connotation and man-made tradition to be read INTO the POIMENAS word ; it has obscured the PLURAL leadership thread running through Acts,1 Timothy,Titus and 1 Peter (not to mention James 5:14) ; the word 'pastor' has become an OVERCOAT for a naked (and non-apostolic) emperor.PC may prove to be something of a holiness-ometer : it may bring to the surface the aversion to personal responsibility of some in the 'PEWS' ; it may bring to the surface the self-interest and pride of some in the 'PULPIT.' Alas,Western Evangelicals urge sinners to repent of any self-righteous PRIDE and face up to home truths about mischerished filth (and its ultimate consequences) ; and yet,many Evangelicals are unwilling to HUMBLY face up to home truths themselves,in regard to mischerished,man-made,non-apostolic beliefs and practices. (Is that not a clear case of double standards ?!)In a nutshell (and in regard to scriptural leadership),the (TEAM of) ordinary,UNSALARIED residential elders/overseers are the pastors/shepherds are (TEAM of) the ordinary,UNSALARIED,residential elders/overseers ; period.If you get PC and read the pearls within,do not turn and rend Frank and George - you have a seriously nutricious meal on your hands. But why stop at a nutricious meal,why not combine it with another three,and have yourselves an edification banquet ?! Do consider getting the following four : PC,on the NON-apostolic roots of a number of Body practices (Jeremiah 5:30-31,Luke 5:39,Mark 7:9) ;The Reformers and their Stepchildren(by Leonard Verduin),on the VIOLENT roots of 'Reformed' Evangelicalism (Genesis 6:11-14,Proverbs 6:16-17,Psalm 11:4-5,Psalm 94:20,Zechariah 4:6,Matthew 12:33-37) ;Our Hands Are Stained with Blood(by Michael L Brown),on anti-semitism,the falsity of 'Replacement Theology',and the fact that Israel's salvation actually PAVES the way for Messiah's return (Romans 11:25-26,Hebrews 8:8,Matthew 23:39) ;The Normal Christian Birth: How to Give New Believers a Proper Start in Life(by David Pawson),a serious challenge to sow the Word in a manner that is scriptural (vs sentimental),apostolic (vs non-apostolic), and truly Trinitarian (vs - effectively - Binitarian) See Luke 14:25-35,Acts 26:19-20,Acts 22:16,Acts 8:17-18,Acts 10:47.********The ANTIDOTE :Would it not be silly to expect a boat to stop sinking because you rearranged a few deckchairs ? Would it not be audacious to look to God for revival while doggedly maintaining and defending the very leadership and teaching that keeps lasting fruit at bay ? The root problem among MAINSTREAM 'Evangelicals' (especially those of a 'Reformed' persuasion) is that they are mis-EVANGELIZED,mis-SHEPHERDED and misTAUGHT : they are pastor-centered instead of Messiah-centered ; Jesus is eclipsed instead of echoed - His recipe (promises,commands,eschatology and warnings) has been shelved in favor of candy (promises,promises,promises and promises). Men have been misenthroned ; those under their charge are seriously malnourished - hymn sandwiches on Sunday are not enough to equip disciples for life on the narrow Way.A serious ANTIDOTE is needed,in order that as many Evangelicals as possible be rescued from the pernicious,hollow,ticklish teaching of our day (See 2 Timothy 4:3-4).Different men bring different expertise to the table. Michael L Brown,David Pawson,and Frank Viola together with George Barna,each have around 33% of the ANTIDOTE ingredients.Michael L Brown is perhaps the Body's leading denouncer of 'Replacement Theology' and Gentile-ized 'Christianity' (the Way is a new second,better COVENANT with Israel,not a new Gentile RELIGION called 'Christianity') ; he seeks to (non-legalistically) introduce Gentile disciples to the Jewish roots of the Way ; and,he scripturally declares that Israel's salvation actually paves the way for Messiah's return (also,Michael has a very strong grasp of practical,daily holiness - see his book, 'Go And Sin No More'). David Pawson calls the Body back to evangelism that is scriptural (vs sentimental),apostolic (vs non-apostolic),and truly trinitarian (vs - in effect - binitarian) ; he also calls the Body back to a scriptural stance on GENDER,as well as MARRIAGE ; and in a day when many Western Evangelicals are chronically malnourished,he delivers teaching for Messiah's disciples that is both WEIGHTY and DIGESTIBLE. Meanwhile,Frank Viola and George Barna are aware of the seriously detrimental effect of clerical pastorhood ; furthermore,what they have uncovered in 'Pagan Christianity?' is a vital step toward bringing the Body back to meaningful,authentic,one-anotherness (interdependent,pastor-less familyhood) - as brothers and sisters in Messiah.It would be marvellous to see Michael,David,Frank and George working together : Michael has very important insight to edify David,Frank and George ; David likewise for Michael,Frank and George ; Frank and George likewise for Michael and David. They could bring each other to a slightly more accurate understanding of the Way ; they enhance the insight of each other. Because no one teacher is infallible,the full antidote would at first taste rather vile even to Michael,David,Frank and George themselves (let alone the rest of the Body !) ; each of them has to not only PRESENT iconoclastic boat-rocking truth to others,but also be willing to HUMBLY LISTEN to iconoclatic boat-rocking truth as well.Even the finest Bible teachers can be rather fraustrating creatures (!) ; indeed,I have yet to find a teacher who is not WINESKinCARCERATED in at least one important aspect of the narrow Way. If one could represent different aspects of the narrow Way as alphabet letters - A,D,C,D,E and so on - what you find is that one teacher has A,B,C and D sorted,but holds strange ideas about E ; meanwhile,another teacher is OK on A,C,D and E,but not B ; another is OK on A,B,D and E,but not C. Michael,for instance,needs to listen to Frank and George in regard to pastor-less congregations ; and to David in regard to gender,marriage and evangelism. Frank and George need to listen to Michael about Israel and Gentile-ized Christianity ; and to David about gender,marriage and evangelism. David needs to listen to Frank and George on pastor-less congregations ; and as for listening to Michael,I believe David and Michael could actually sharpen each other,in regard to Israel and the COVENANT framework of Holy Scripture. And a typical Evangelical needs to humbly listen to all four !The expertise that Michael,David,Frank and George bring to the table,is not a complete remedy for all the problems among Evangelicals - but,if these particular areas were dealt with,it would go a long way toward returning Evangelicals to apostolic doctrine ; in order that congregations would adorn the teaching of God the Savior in their locality,rather than bringing the Way into disrepute.Henry Varley said to D L Moody 'the world has yet to see what God will do with a man fully consecrated to Him.' Well,I believe Westerners today have yet to see what God will do with a group of people willing to forsake the approval of men,personal pride and all mischerished doctrinal errors - in order that Messiah Jesus be truly EXALTED,and authentic,effective disciples truly MADE.Yes,God has brought revival in times past : he has used sincere people with wrong views about Israel ; worked through binitarian evangelism ; and worked through non-apostolic clerical pastors - but to echo something Keith Green said (in his peice on evangelism),I believe He (in His mercy) has done so IN SPITE OF,not because of,such beliefs and practices.Let me put the complementary expertise of Michael,Frank,George and David in a nutshell : Michael's teaching serves to RECONNECT the Bride to her Jewish roots (moving her away from the mistaken notion of a new Gentile religion called 'Christianity',back to the new Covenant with Israel) ; Frank and George's detective work (so to speak) serves to RECOMMISSION the Bride (moving her away from inactive pastor-dependent spectatorship in the 'pews',to proactive interdependent soldierhood on the frontline) ; David's teaching serves to REINSTATE truly apostolic,trinitarian evangelism - furthermore (and in addition),David's teaching serves to RE-EQUIP reconnected,recommissioned soldiers with the authentic companionship of the Holy Spirit Himself,as well as the nine tool-gifts provided by the Holy Spirit.Provided that Michael,Frank,George and David were each willing to drop any idea contrary to Holy Scripture,harnessing the expertise of those four could produce a 'dream team' ! Here's hoping Michael,Frank and David get into co-harness (ASAP) ; humbly mix their complementary ingredients together ; brace themselves ; and then (for the sake of themselves as well as the Western contingent of the Body),each take a spoonful !Take note please - these are the views of an unregenerate Gentile."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"I am the publisher of James Russell Publishing.com and the author of \\"The Lost Gospel of John\\".

It's been heating up the internet with rabid denunciations and unqualified praise. As for me, I have mostly praise for the book--it does what no other books of its kind do, bringing between two covers the historical origins of many post-Catholic (that is, Protestant) church practices. Did you ever wonder where dressing up for church began? Or why we have pulpits or choirs? Now you can know! And, as the authors assert, these seemingly trivial matters can have profound implications for how we envision and practice 'church'--often to our detriment.So the aim of \\"Pagan\\" is to contrast many post-biblical-period innovations with the original dreams of Jesus, Paul, John, Peter and others for the 'called-out' community we today call 'church.' This is fine. My one complaint is that I wish the authors would have left more to the readers' imaginations. They could have put their ecclesial cards on the table at the outset, their passions and convictions regarding Christ alone as the head of the Church, articulating their view of a New Testament ecclesiology. Then, they could have gone through their history lesson, leaving us to decide: \\"Is the ____ harmful for our group spirituality, or a helpful innovation?\\" Because I *don't* think tradition is a dirty word, nor do I think there's a neat delineation between \\"God-breathed\\" and \\"human tradition.\\" Everything we do is our own tradition, because even direct theophanies are interpreted through human lenses...and this isn't a bad thing.But please understand--this one caveat does not mean you should avoid the book. You'll never read anything else quite like it. And I daresay that the handful of folks giving \\"Pagan\\" a one-star rating haven't read the book, or at least haven't given it a fair reading. It is in protest of the \\"one star/five star\\" politicization of Amazon rating systems that I give \\"Pagan Christianity\\" four stars--what I actually feel the book deserves, rather than trying to unnaturally pad (or detract from) its overall ratings."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"This is the third in his series.

In contrast he boldly illustrates the simplicity and almost tribal nature of the 1st century church the bride of Christ as she met with her groom in irresistible freedom, life and love.I have suspected for many years that many if not all new Christians early in the adventure of their new life in Christ have deep and unsettling doubts about this institution we call church. Those doubts should not go unheeded. At last the great harlot of the 17th chapter of Book of Revelation has been revealed and the Spirit calls to all who are His, \\"Come out\\".

This is the way of things today: both with the wizards of the Vatican (who preach another gospel entirely, to a Queen of Heaven and sundry saints) and also with the plastic-banana, amusement-park corporate institutions that Americans call \\"church\\" today.This is very, very big business; the seminaries and denominations are the religious guilds of our day, as Viola makes clear. Bully for him; as our brethren in China, India, Africa, Russia, and South America will readily agree -- the modern American church (and I am speaking of Christian churches, not Vatican outposts) is certainly NOT the New Testament model.

I had been wrestling with the whole \\"church\\" thing. I did not see people (myself included) coming out any different then they went in. A lot of it just did not make sense to me. I believe in the Father and his Son. I just didn't see the love that was always talked about. They would break off into little sub groups, if you quite going they did not even notice or call. It just seemed like a business.I don't think this book is going to change the world, I don't even think it puts that idea forward. It does however teach you to not be afraid of striking out on your own to find Christs love. The idea of a smaller more nimble church is a great one in my opinion. It's the same as government to me. On a small scale it can be controlled and used to advance a cause. On a large scale it gets crushed under it's on weight and useless.I for instance am one who does not believe in tongues. Not the gift in the Bible but the sensless noise some people will spout out, scaring children and what not. I brought this up to my preacher. Looking at the translations the KJV adding the word \\"unknown\\" for some reason. His answer was \\"well I can speak in english anytime I want why can't I speak in tongues\\" In effect no answer at all. I have seen this all to often in so many churches. No ability to account for there faith, it's how I was raised so it must be right type answers.The book boils down to this for me.The are alot of things in the church today that should not be there. When I look at Christ as a whole I can understand where 2 or 3 gathered in my name makes more and more sense. The church today seems dead to me, like going to work, listen to what ever they say no matter how insane it really is and go on about your business. When I did a study on Christ (the man) I came across an account of early church service, it said they gathered and sang hymns onto him as if onto God, then they made oaths to not sin and ate a meal together.It had nothing to do with what I was studying but it stuck with me. It sounded so simple, it seemed like they could really fellowship and share there faith. Open further study I am convinced that the luther and Calvin inspired churches do not even know the are Catholic. As far as there beliefs there are a few things you must understand. THESE THINGS ARE FACT.1. Both Luther and Calvin were unrepentant murderers. It for for some reason you doubt this look up the Anabaptist. A group that was not Trinitarian, believed you could only get baptised on understanding , had a fierce sense of communtiy(they would shun outsiders), saw themselves a citizens of heaven, and had a creed of non-violence.Lets break that down for a second.1.Trinity can only be said to be implied at best. Christ said himself there was 1 father, in the Old Testament the Father says I alone can save.(No one can say here Christ said I am God, it is all inferred)Fact is when he asked Peter who do you think I am, Peter said the Son of God.(Not the essence of God, or equal to God)I think the easy way to figure this one out is this. Can the Father exsist without the son? Can the Son exsist without the Father? If the Father is superior in anyway, they are no longer equal.2.When someone confessed there faith, thats when Paul said to baptise them not before.3.Paul says if someone comes with a different gospel to not bid them fairwell, nor Godspeed.4.Turn the other cheek is what the really practiced.Luther and Calvin hated these people (to death) they had as many of them and as many of there scholars killed as they could get there hands on.( I am not an Anabaptist, I do think however they carried far many more of the Christ traits than the \\"major\\" chruches did)2. Luther and Calvin hated the Jews. (Your theology comes from people who hated the choosen ones.I'll seek my lessons from the Son of God over these 2 tyrants anyday.The fact you must understand is that the church did not rise to power in the current form it is in. These \\"home churches are the very thing that forced the empire to notice them. You cannot control an \\"earthly\\" group the has no head. They felt Christ was really there among them, they gave him full control of there services. They had to consolidate, to control. Every kingdom of man has sought to do this. Everyone has heard of divide and counqer, it seems more correct on the macro scale to say combine and counqer.It seems to me the early church was more stable, the y could gather more with little hinderance. They were a real community. They lived in walking distance of each other. When one was suffering they could all pitch in and help right on the spot. They weren't just memebers in a \\"church\\". They were \\"brothers and sisters\\".The true essence to me of Christ teaching, you are not seperate at all but have the same Father. True brothers and sisters. If someone dies in a church body today, it's I'm so sorry, my regrets. The people closet to that member would be the only ones to really \\"feel\\" the pain. Now imagine how it was for them. To truly lose a Brother or Sister, even those who were not close(which would be hard to believe in that type of setting) Would mourn for those who were mourning. They would feel the pain that there brother felt. Why is it different when someone in your family dies and someone in church dies. It's simple really, we have not gotten to the point of family in the church. I long for that, to get past the world and be part of a true body of Christ each memeber a mother,brother,father, sister and shephard of the other. I don't care how small the group is, as long as the spirit is present and faith guides us.Preachers do not have a lock on how to get to God, that is why Christ died. So each man could be forgiven and seek him out. This would bring him to people who had a better understanding than they did. They would grow and learn from each other daily. Today's church is a sad shell of what was intended I think.Like Christ said, his church would never be overcome. I think these are the curches he was speaking. A formless body that could only be controlled by Christ himself.Look nothing is perfect when people are invloved. Even chruch. I think the model of church we are using now is not that healthy for us. We need to learn and exercise or faith. Like some other reviews have said, if you don't already like the \\"church\\" system you will jump on the band wagon. This will not do you much good. Don't believe that the Church is bad and I'll study on my on thing. That is not what this book is saying either. It saying there is a better way, that I do believe. A perfect way, no. That won't exsist on earth.A church filled with love and the direct lordship of our Lord and Savior Yeshua, yes. We can get better and hold each other accountable and tend to each other on a personal level. This book is just a sign on the way in your studies. I have read up on what they had to say about the Romans inparticular. I can see no evidence to the contrary that Christianity was not hi-jacked around Nicea. My goal is start a church in my home, where Christ can freely come in and gide us. Church today makes the Father look alien and out of reach, Moses and Paul said they wished all members could prophesies.We are all \\"ministers\\" in one form or another, this book helps you see that again. In church, much like the woman who put purfume on Yeshua'a hair. Any gift you bring to Father out of love for him is a good gift indeed!!"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Another failed attempt at Restorationism.I hope this book will spark your interest in the topic, but that you will read more than just this book. If you read my reviews you will know that I rarely review books I don't like, even though I read a fair amount of them. But this one merits a critique because it is so off the historical mark. (And no, I did not waste my money on this, but when a friend had it at his house I couldn't resist a fast read.) It is the typical \\"me and Jesus\\" anti-Catholic/Lutheran/Orthodox, anti-tradition pseudo-scholarship that I used to believe and teach wholeheartedly. The only problem is that it isn't true. But to make their points, the authors misuse their sources wildly, including the Holy Scriptures and if you don't know better, you may start to wonder. Here are some basic, general critiques of the author's numerous points, but it is not exhaustive. They have many more mistakes of scholarship that I will not go into.First off, is traditional church worship in liturgy pagan, as the authors claim? No. Look at what God commands his people to do in the Old Testament regarding worship. Surprise! It looks mighty pagan with vestments and songs and incense. Maybe the pagans had something right. Hmmm, maybe it is because pagans, whatever that means, are humans, too, and God created them and their hearts long to worship even what it doesn't fully know and there are only so many ways to do it, just like other things in our lives that take on a ritualistic element, hrmph! I think St Paul had something to say about that at Mars Hill while talking to actual pagans. Liturgical worship is pleasing to God. Read the OT and Acts and Revelation (now that is liturgy!) to tie it into how the earliest Christians worshipped. And no, Jesus did not somehow cancel out the Jewish forms of worship that his own Father instituted, as the practices of his followers demonstrate. They kept to the feasts, the prayers and the breaking of bread, still going to temple to pray. Were the apostles the first Paganized Christians? So much for the Spirit leading them into all truth, or is the publication of this book what that verse meant? I think not.Secondly, you better be careful when you start playing the \\"Constantine did it\\" game, claiming he is the cause for so much of the pagan creepage. Think about the formation of the NT canon and then consider what so many scholars, like Bart Ehrman, do with that knowledge. If you follow their reasoning, and the reasoning of these two authors, then the doctrine of the Trinity is pagan and political, along with the canon of Scripture and the Council of Nicaea, when Jesus supposedly \\"became God\\". But our authors don't want to take it that far for obvious reasons, so they pick and choose what to blame the Emperor for, deciding to have their cake and eat it, too.Thirdly, to say that having a building set aside for worship is pagan is like saying that reading and writing are pagan. It just doesn't follow and you cannot pretend that Acts' house-churches, which did have liturgies, however, are somehow the norm for all ages to come. Where does the bible teach that? Nowhere, of course, because the authors are flatly wrong again. There are buildings set aside for the purpose before the Peace, too. Besides, the houses where they worshipped early on became churches in the sense that they always worshipped there in the same manner, or in the tombs (uh oh, sounds a little pagan again), so in that sense they were churches that functioned as homes when not in use as a church.Pagans talk about a Logos, so the Logos of St John is pagan. Pagans baptize, so baptism is pagan. Pagans speak Greek, so Greek is pagan. You see where this goes, and quickly. And who decides where it ends? The authors, or you, or me. You see, in this model we all read our bibles which tell us what to believe and you and I disagree so we act like our own popes and know in our hearts what is true. Thankfully, however, the bible is not meant to function like the Quran and it is the product of the Church that decided which books were in and which were out, based upon their usage in liturgical (pagan?) worship.Fourthly, saying that there was no hierarchy in the NT seems to forget the role not only of Apostles, but also of the elders and overseers. SeeElders in Every City: The Origin an Role of the Ordained Ministryfor a better review of the material.Lastly, I love how their ideal church structure is amazingly non-denominational Protestant in a curiously American Restorationist flavor. Hmm, it seems that they have been influenced by the pagan culture around them. Bring on the guitars and drums and open bibles and no-one-leading-anything worship going and in two weeks you will, even there, have a untraditional tradition begin to emerge, but in this case it will be amazingly tacky and probably heretical.For an alternative view, please consider reading the following: The book of Revelation,Evangelical Is Not Enough: Worship of God in Liturgy and Sacrament,The Heresy of Orthodoxy: How Contemporary Culture's Fascination with Diversity Has Reshaped Our Understanding of Early Christianity,The Lamb's Supper: The Mass as Heaven on Earth,Constantine's Bible: Politics And the Making of the New Testament,Against the Protestant Gnostics,Retrieving the Tradition and Renewing Evangelicalism: A Primer for Suspicious Protestants,Tradition, Scripture, and Interpretation: A Sourcebook of the Ancient Church (Evangelical Ressourcement: Ancient Sources for the Church's Future),Evangelicals and Tradition: The Formative Influence of the Early Church,Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\",Orthodox Worship: A Living Continuity With the Temple, the Synagogue and Common Ground: An Introduction to Eastern Christianity for the American Christian.

It exposes dogma that not even the proudly non-dogmatic clergy of the denomination of my baptism can see, because it is so ingrained.For someone who is not mature in their faith, my fear would be that it may cause them to abandon their faith... in a sense \\"throwing the baby out with the bathwater\\". Make sure you don't read this book if you feeling angry or resentful at the church, as it may embitter you further.I'm not entirely convinced by the new proposed model of the church, but thats not really the focus of the book.Great read, but be prepared to never attend church in quite the same way again."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"I am on the last chapter of this book and have enjoyed it thoroughly.

This book provides many resources for me to continue my research into what the first century Christian church was meant to be. I got the impression that this book was more for Protestants, but I learned something in every chapter about the foundations of Orthodoxy. It has rocked my world and I have already checked out several books from the library about the pagan roots of Christian liturgy."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"This straightforward expos&eacute; from Viola and Barna could be a valuable starting point for introducing myriad correctives into the industry of Fundamentalist, and certain \\"conservative\\" Evangelical, wings of Christendom, a group proud to call themselves \\"Bible believing,\\" but who in fact have amassed a great body of patently extra-Biblical, merely religious, ideas. Some of the material in this volume is overworked, however, and in this readers view, some of the commentaries are misdirected. While the emphasis is doggedly directed toward the extra-Biblical _practices_ of \`Christian' Fundamentalism (and much of Roman, Orthodox, 'Mainline' Protestant, and Evangelical practice too), mostly as related to worship forms, an even more valuable rendering would examine the extra-Biblical body of cadaverous doctrines [that evolved gradually during the post-apostolic era in which the church was Romanized, and which continued on through the Reformation] that these groups so dearly cherish, but that fit poorly (at best) with the Old Testament, and often not at all with the New Testament. Perhaps that is a volume I will have to write myself.The problem with focusing narrowly on religious practice, and even more narrowly on religious structure and worship practice, is that there really aren't directives within scripture as to what the specifics of worship practice should be. So one _might_ easily dismiss much of this volume by simply noting that the believer is free to worship as he/she feels compelled (but even here the Viola-Barna study is valuable in that it will inform the practitioner that his practices, and his sectarian institutional structures, are extra-Biblical, something of which he/she is likely unaware, odd as that may seem).For many of the religious ideas that fall under the authors' guns--although they are esoterically diverse--the common thread is a rigid (\\"Fundamental\\") religious \\"conservatism.\\" In this reviewer's studied observation, this rigidity is essentially an inevitability within typical Protestant/'Jeromian' hermeneutical \`law'. The far more humble, robust, and engaged model of hermeneutic scholarship that we might call Augustinian (the elements of which are quite a bit more ancient, however), is disinclined to impose the laws of prosaic, humanly constructed religious theory on the study of scripture. The Augustinian approach is consistent with the philological / theological insights attributed to Solomon, and certain aspects of the Apostle Paul's thought. While one would hope such credentials would beg the attention of the Fundamentalist, this is not the case (why should the Fundamentalist be curious or questioning--given his hermeneutical-exegetical law, he already holds all answers!) If you are wondering which Christian groups proceed from the \`Augustinian hermeneutic', rather than the \`Jeromian' hermeneutic, the best examples might be the traditional Friends (Quakers) and the moderate or progressive Mennonites, although this approach is also rather typical of the Biblical scholarship of the Anglican Communion and the Christians (Disciples of Christ). A few other groups come to mind, and none are rightly grouped with Fundamentalism.The above treatment is a digression from the present author's volume under review, but it speaks of a worthier thesis if one is interested in illuminating the standard \\"Christian\\" departure from Christian scripture. Again, this may be a book I should myself write (must we be reminded that Christ had great interest in a man's \`heart' [that is, mind], and no interest in, or respect for, a man's religious practices).While I believe that in spite of high intentions \`Pagan Christianity' is somewhat misdirected, it can serve as a powerful jolt to the so-called Fundamentalist (or \\"Christian Right\\" conservative, if you will), who is far too overconfident that his religious ideas are \\"Biblical.\\""},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"It's about time someone started questioning Contemporary Evangelicalism-Fundamentalism practices and institutions.It's quite obvious to any thinking, discerning New Testament believer that there must be some sort of revival or ecclesiastical overhaul if we are to survive the next decade.Observations:(1) The list of \\"pagan\\" practices needs to be expanded.The chapters on items which we ought to critically question: Order of Worship, Sunday Morning Costumes, etc.Why not dump Sunday worship altogether ?Not because it is pagan, per se, but because of the stigma of tradition.There is a specific directive for believers to assemble together (Hebrews 10:25), but there is no direct, specific command anywhere in the New Testament that we must meet on Sundays.True, Sunday worship was performed by the early church in recognition and celebration of the Resurrection (e.g. Acts 20:7, I Corinth. 16:2), so it's origins are not directly pagan.Still, it's really just a \\"Christian Tradition\\" that has gotten - like hulls on ocean going ships - encrusted.(2) On Chapter 8; In addition to the problems listed, many \\"professional\\" pastors are overpaid and unproductive (read lazy). I would suggest cutting the extravagant salaries. They [pastoral staff] can get part-time work as \\"Tentmakers\\" (Acts 18:3). Paul, possibly the greatest missionary who ever lived, successfully functioned as a pastor AND work a secular job on the side. If he could do it, so can pastors today.If they [pastoral staff] whine & complain that they're not getting their weekly ministry duties done, then the church should find spiritually gifted members in the congregation who can fill the need. In other words, delegate tasks (I Corinthians 12-14).(3) On Chapter 10; Suggest getting rid of \\"Youth Pastors\\". They're mostly just professional religious teenager \\"baby-sitters\\" trying to keep young people interested in God by providing entertainment in some form.(4) On Chapter 10; Training for the Christian ministry needs to be put back, as it once was, into the hands of the local church & qualified pastors. 400 Bible Colleges-Seminaries in the USA alone ? That's ludicrous. The Bible College Movement has come to resemble an assembly line in a Chinese sweatshop...Producing Christian Minister Clones who are not taught to think independently within the context of Biblical revelation. 90 percent of these institutions should close their doors. In some instances, these Bible Colleges & Seminaries exist basically just so Seminary grads, with their masters & doctors degrees, can get a job because otherwise they have no marketable skills... they too should become \\"Tentmakers\\".[Notice to angry commentors: I will delete this post & then re-post it, so don't waste your time]"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Several years ago I emailed my pastor. We'd taken Communion at church that week, and I was curious how we ever got started doing the ceremony as we did. I've come to discover that there are two major ways of taking Communion in churches today: The first follows the procedures of the Catholic Mass, where a minister presides over the table and the rest of the congregation comes forward for the bread and cup to be administered. Second is the version with which I am more familiar, where a minister recites a few sentences removed from 1 Corinthians 11, prays for the bread - which is actually pre-broken crackers in a plate, and then the deacons (whose original biblical job was, after all, distributing food) carry the plates to the congregation, passing them up and down the pews until everyone has some, then marching in unison to the front where they all surrender their trays, sit down, and let the minister serve them bread. Then he sits down and one of the deacons serves him. Then the minister stands back up and leads the congregation in \\"partaking.\\" We do the whole thing over again for the cup, served in trays of thimble-cups. And all I wanted to know is whence this elaborate ceremony came.But my pastor either didn't understand the depth of my question or didn't know and gave me the best he had. No one knows, I concluded. If they don't teach such things at seminary, where else could you learn about church traditions?Pagan Christianity? addresses many points of my inquiry. First of all, it does tell me how we got the ceremony we know as Communion or the Lord's Supper. Specifically the passing of trays was an invention of the church in Geneva where Calvin and his gang emphasized orderliness. Additionally, this short book describes the origins of several other things I mentioned: pastors and ministers, Communion no longer having to do with community, the Lord's Supper no longer being a supper, churches meeting once a week in buildings, tables or altars at the front of the building, congregations as distinct from the clergy, pew arrangement facing a stage, deacons being reduced to ushers, seminaries, and even the practice of removing \\"verses\\" (an added, man-made invention) from context. Most of these are derived either from pagan temple ritual, Roman government structure and formality, or the style of Greek philosophers.My only big concern for this book is that, though it has many footnotes, they do not always direct the reader to original sources. For making such controversial claims, the case would be stronger if the authors could demonstrate their points with attestation a little further back than 50 years.On the whole this book is an astounded critique of how the Church of God has not transformed the world, but rather allowed itself to be conformed. We who are to be the image-bearers of God are looking remarkably like His enemy. This apostasy has dramatically affected the mission of the Church. We stand today divided, running after every new program or philosophy the experts throw at us, losing attendance by the thousands, and exhibiting a very weak testimony of the power, holiness, and love of our God. Pagan Christianity? is a wakeup call to the Church to abandon their manmade traditions with which we have replaced the commandment of God.To God be all glory,Lisa of Longbourn"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"This is not so much a book of information as it is a book of propaganda in favor of the \\"Organic Church\\" movement.I don't know why, but I thought it was going to be about the pagan precedents for the theology, symbolism, and central themes of Christian mythology. Instead it was about the \\"pagan\\" (read \\"worldly\\") origins of the ceremonial traditions, the cosmetic trappings and the organizational structure of the institutional Church. I find it hard to blame the early Christians for adopting elements from the secular culture which surrounded them. Religions always start with pure intentions and become more institutionalized as they grow in popularity. Have such practices eroded the spiritual value of the Church? In many ways, yes. Have such practices led to system-wide corruption and a betrayal of the human spirit? Absolutely. But the book's central thesis (all modern Church practices are derived from pagan religion) simply does not hold up. Most of the elements of the modern Church which the authors criticize are products of the Protestant Reformation and the 19th century Revivalist movement. It can hardly be argued that these practices are \\"pagan\\" in origin.I have trouble swallowing the authors' declarations about the \\"biblical\\" practices of first-century ecclesia. The Bible as we know it did not exist until the fourth century, when the official Canon was decided. Written versions of the Canonical scriptures only date back to 90 AD at the earliest. The authors base most of their arguments about \\"original\\" Christianity on the letters of Paul of Tarsus (and very little on the Gospels) without ever mentioning the fact that Paul was never an apostle and never met Jesus. In fact, he started out as a persecutor of Christianity, and could very well have been a saboteur, protecting mainline Judaism from the Christian \\"menace\\" by infiltrating the cult, contaminating the original Christian message with theology from the Mystery schools and then peddling it almost exclusively to the Gentiles. We do know that the Jerusalem congregation (led by James, the brother of Christ) had serious disagreements with Paul.The authors insist that in the first century, Communion was a whole meal, not a tiny crouton and a thimble of grape juice. \\"According to the Bible,\\" they say, Communion should be taken as part of a meal called a \\"Love Feast.\\" Wrong. The Lord's Supper was part of a meal, but the Bible has nothing to say about the rest of the menu. Bread and wine are the only two items specifically mentioned in the New Testament. So the modern Communion, dull and morbidly symbolic though it may be, is strictly Biblical.The authors also forgot to mention that the early church was a breeding ground for heresy. During the first two or three centuries, all kinds of strange ideas sprang up among various Christian communities. There was no centralized control, no formalized orthodoxy, not even an official Canon of scripture! Every Church had its own sacred writings. Part of the drive to organize was the need to standardize doctrine and stamp out \\"incorrect\\" beliefs. Otherwise Christians today might have ended up believing in reincarnation and abolishing marriage. Yes, these are some of the heretical doctrines of the early Church!Not everything that is pagan is necessarily bad. One could take the authors' arguments to an extreme by insisting that a truly \\"biblical\\" church should conduct its meetings in Hebrew of Aramaic. The English language was invented by pagans, after all. Jesus didn't speak it, and neither did any of the early Christians. The fact is that times change and the Church has had to adapt.Another thing that bugs me is how proud the authors seem to be of their research. In fact, this book has been built on the backs of other people's research. Looking at the list of sources in the back, it appears the authors have consulted an impressive 299 books, plus the Bible. Of these 300 sources, only 9 are primary sources - and I have applied a very loose definition to \\"primary.\\" The remaining 97% of the authors' so-called \\"research\\" comes from 19th- and 20th-century Christian historians. Any \\"real\\" (i.e. secular) historian can tell you that the reliability of these sources is questionable at best. The Christian historian sets out with a tacitly understood agenda, and generally finds what he wants to find, regardless of the facts.Still, despite its flaws, this book raises questions that desperately need to be asked. The institutional, mainline Church is failing. You can probably tell from my review that I am one who has closely questioned and examined my own faith, and I found some of this book to be refreshing - even exciting - but it could have been better executed. I would have liked to have seen this information presented in a way that is geared more towards INFORMING the reader rather than PERSUADING him. The authors are too pushy about an Organic House Church being the only true worship, and the cumulative effect is much more shrill than it needs to be."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Pagan Christianity is an excellent book. Well organized and thought provoking, it challenges many of the basic assumptions upon which the modern western church is founded. While easy to read, it will not be easy to digest for some.There is more than a little irony to be realized here. The bulk of our religious practices, it would seem, have little to do with the Gospel or the ministry of Jesus. In their careful examination of church history and the origins of various church traditions, Viola and Barna amply illustrate that many of our sacred cows are expendable. To many, the questions they ask will be perceived as threatening, or even harmful, but I found them liberating. Unhinging our \\"sacred\\" institutions and practices from their human origins opens up an endless array of new possibilities, if we but implement a degree of apostolic innovation.Viola and Barna, unfortunately, do not come to this conclusion. Their work steers the reader pretty exclusively towards the home church model. While I tend to agree with the premise that the home church more accurately reflects the nature of the early church, the authors fall short of making the case that any other manifestation is not really the ecclesia of the New Testament.This work will be enthusiastically received by a great many modern day reformers, among which I would count myself. But it should be read with a critical eye. Viola and Barna use evidence rather selectively, referencing Scriptures that reinforce their case and neglecting those that don't. They are casually dismissive of certain Biblical passages and arguments without, in my opinion, having adequately justified such treatment.Most frustrating, they seem to work from the age old assumption that Christianity summarily replaces Judaism. They dismiss the possibility that any aspect of formal church assembly was borrowed from the synagogue, and even if it was, they argue, the synagogue is Jewish and not Christian. There is more than a little unquestioned assumption in even making such and argument! While they address, in part, the impact of Constantine on the church, they barely mention the efforts of that era to severe any connection the church had to its Jewish roots. I found this approach inconsistent, if not dishonest. One can hardly argue for a return to the ideals of early Christianity without acknowledging the widespread impact of Judaism.The authors insist that the absence of something in Scripture does not, automatically, make it wrong, though one can hardly read their words without concluding they really believe it does. They find harm in a great many common church practices, and, while I actually agreed with most of their conclusions, I felt they were overconfident, and did not adequately build their case in several instances. Moreover, they tend to offer up a rather narrow list of possible resolutions to the problems they identify.That being said, I highly recommend this book. It adds a great deal to an intelligent discussion about why we do the things we do, and may even serve to break us free from our sadly ignorant defense of our human traditions. I would encourage the reader to proceed with caution, and consider the other side of the authors' arguments, but don't shy away from this read, as it is well worth it. In fact, I would have paid the cover price just for the summary of the origin of church traditions included at the end of the book!If this book interests you, I would also recommend:Organic Church: Growing Faith Where Life HappensThe Forgotten Ways: Reactivating the Missional Church"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Reading this book was a good use of my time. I have always wondered why I felt Church wasn't for me. I have always wondered why I felt a small gathering of believers was more edifying than the run of the mill Sunday service. I believe it was the Holy Spirit checking me and telling me that this is not the real Ecclesia.After reading this book I feel fully at peace to never enter a Church again and to pursue close knit community fellowship. I believe this is why most men cannot stand Church either. Something inside men runs contrary to the Church with a single leader/king who sees the people before him as his kingdom with serfs hanging on his every word and every command.The church is broken and has been broken since Constantine.Although this book doesn't articulate it, this book is a good explaination as to why so many evil deeds were committed in the name of Jesus. The Pagan influence was to rich to let go of Pagan ideas of power and control. I see now how so many pagan cultures up to this very day have bled into the so called Church.I now feel free to let go of my unnatural attachment to the institutionalized chruch and pursue real community.

Because none of this is native to the Church that Jesus is building. The author does a great job in documenting alot of the practices that we esteem so highly and holy in protestantism which is little more than reformed catholicism.I believe every christian should read this book and others just to get a snap shot view of what we are sacrificing for a convenient religion. The author does a great job in showing how the CEO church of today was not the organic and authentic community of the original ACTS church."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"As a Protestant pastor I agree wholeheartedly with the author's essential premise that much of traditional church architecture, hierarchy and liturgy needs serious reform (semper reformanda). The design of the average church building helps to keep the congregation in a spectator role; participation is discouraged, and the Spirit often straightjacketed. If our chief role as pastors is to help the body of Christ grow into maturity and equip them to do the work of ministry (a la Eph 4), then we are being severely hampered by our traditions.As a church history buff, however, I was deeply frustrated by the book's polemical approach and lack of accurate or reliable scholarship. The author maintains at the beginning that this is \\"not a work of scholarship\\" and then goes on to make rather unfair and jaundiced claims about church history to support his points. Sadly, the result makes him appear just as intolerant and bigoted as the blind traditionalism he attacks (surely not his intention). In short, I found the book disappointingly inaccurate and biased, a fact that unfortunately undermines some very strong arguments. I just wish someone else (someone who knows more about church history) had written it. Nevertheless, if you can get past this, the author raises some very valid issues that pastors and church leaders need desperately to consider, with fear and trembling.One problem in the book is that what we know about how the 1st-century church operated is based on scant evidence, and our tendency is to read into this what we want. In reality the 1st-century church was probably a lot more diverse than we realize (or would be comfortable with). Some congregations developed more along synagogue lines, while others had a freer format. It is unfortunate that the author relies so heavily on secondary sources when primary source material is so readily available (in English!). Take the Bible, for example. His claim that the first-century church was non-hierarchical is ludicrous. Look at the Jerusalem church! There was an apostolic council as well as a diaconate. Acts tells us that the believers gathered regularly in homes as well as in the temple to hear the apostles' teaching. If we take that first church (and not Corinth) as our model, then contemporary churches who have weekly small groups as well as larger weekend gatherings with preaching are not so off the mark as the author contends."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"\\"Hold your Fire!!!\\"No group of people is more trigger happy than those enlisted in the army of God. Some reviews of this book are ongoing evidence of this fact. Yet, who are they shooting at and why? With over 500,000 pastors serving in the established church in the U.S. alone (p.138), you can imagine the reaction when two authors suggest that many of the sacred weapons this group of pastoral commanders has come to cherish (and pass along each week to their foot soldiers) emanate from the pagan, secular, Greco-Roman world --- well, you just may have a holy uprising on your hands.Viola is an avowed home-church expert, speaker,church planter and author. Barna has established himself as the foremost social scientist and scholar regarding the church, Christians and the state of Christianity in the U.S. When these two team up, one should probably move beyond the title and snuggle into a foxhole with this magnum opus work to see what they're saying from their outpost on the front lines of the faith wars.When Tyndale starts a book with a \\"Publisher's Preface\\" that includes, \\"Perhaps you wonder why a publisher of Christian books would release a book that questions so many common church practices...Our aim is for you to consider their conclusions and then pray seriously about your response.\\" Wow! Well, that's exactly what I did. I was blessed by this work as it continues to resonate through my being.This book is filled with topics that every soldier wonders about: \\"Why do we do what we today? Where did these practices, people, places, power and ammunition come from? What are the practical implications for my life, and those of my comrades, based upon the battles we are confronted with today? As time has elapsed since the first army was formed, have we actually moved further away from the fundamental truths and practices that our founding Father intended for us to deploy?With hearts deeply sensitive to the earliest recorded wishes of Jesus in the New Testament, the authors methodically ask these sorts of questions as it relates to the practice of the Christian faith in the 21st century.There are more footnotes evidencing the painstaking, scholarly approach and treatment of each and every subject raised in this book than there are individual nylon strands in a parachute.Throughout this book, the authors reverent hearts and compassion for the restoration of the lordship of Christ as the head of the Church is acutely apparent, as stated near the end of the volume (p.250): \\"We have written this book for one reason: to make room for the absolute centrality, supremacy, and headship of Christ in His church.\\"The essence of the book is captured in the following question: \\"Who's really in charge of this outfit anyway?\\" Is it possible that this platoon of disciples (Christians per se) has been led astray from the way Jesus would have us be his church? That's not heresy! It certainly isn't treason. It's evidence of the courage of two men who love Christ and dedicated their lives to becoming more like Him and encouraging others to do the same.\\"Put your weapon down!\\" Don't shoot a fellow soldier just because he/she is asking specific questions about the way things are today, illuminating their historical origins, there adoption and present day application --- backed up by a Scriptural basis for their conclusions. Don't throw somebody in the brig when their is absolutely no question about their undeniable loyalty to God's army, and our Leader, Jesus Christ. As stated by Viola and Barna \\"It is because of our love for the church and our desire to see God's people set free that we have written this book.\\"\\"At ease soldier!\\" It's time to pick up this book and do what the history of our unit is famous for --- it's time for additional training. It's time we adapt to the fact that we have much to learn. Hey, it takes courage to be a soldier in God's army --- particularly when you have a vested interest in the \\"way things\\" are yet your Leader desperately desires that you \\"move out!\\"\\"Moving out\\" requires unburdening - leaving behind some of the weapons, tactics, myths and terrain we have become comfortable with and heavily vested in. Soldiering necessarily involves learning new ways of being a soldier in God's army. Are some of the implications of what these two authors suggesting unnerving? Absolutely! \\"Buck up soldier!\\"Viola and Barna are distinctly invested in the mission of yearning that the Church become all it can be. Their respective lives speak for this fact. I urge you to read what they have labored to produce for that simple reason. When you're done, you will be faced with what any soldier is faced with after training: \\"Will you act upon what you have read, or will you simply be informed by it.\\" (p. 253).Honestly, I'm still processing my active response.Restrain your urge to make Viola and Barna fatalities of \\"friendly fire\\" until you've done what they've asked: Read the book and pray about your response --- intensely. That's courage in action --- embracing the need to learn new ways of being a Christian and His Church today.It took guts to write this book and it takes guts to read it. \\"Transformation\\" is sometimes an uncomfortable reality. It requires confronting the dimensions of truth and reality that only others can share with us, that we cannot derive for ourselves --- particularly if we have a vested interest in the status quo that blinds us to the necessity for change. Let's make sure these two courageous soldiers of Christ are addressed with the courtesy and respect they deserve. Somebody simply must ask the tough questions and illuminate the implications for the necessity to change. It's called \\"duty.\\"For Tyndale to publish this superb work and say, \\"Our aim is for you to consider their conclusions and then pray seriously about your response.\\" Well, that's valor.Finally, my Bible is filled with stories of those who spoke God's truth about the way things are, how we got here, and the way ahead. More often than not, they were mocked and ridiculed. Yet, God ordained truth endures. This book is prophetic. I pray your consumption of it will be deliberate and your reaction to it will be constructive. That would be honorable.Honor-Duty-Valor --- That certainly sounds like an order from Jesus Christ."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"This is a MUST READ for any Christian questioning current Christian practices. Mr. Viola historically traces the steps which brought us to our current institutionalized churches and mindsets. The biggest detriment to this work is his position that our current institutionalized churches lack the ability to equip the saints and consequently stiffle the growth of its members and body yet institutionalized churches are larger in number than those which Mr. Viola participates. Mr. Viola needs to add examples and more proof to his positions (regardless if they are true). The reader must also realize that the underlying premise to Mr. Viola's arguement is: first century church practice is binding on the current church. With this in mind, we know that there are many first century church practices (i.e. examples) which even the author's church does not replicate. Thus, it becomes a shaky arguement to simply pick a few specks in other brother's churches and miss the own in his own eye. Reality is: God does chose individuals for His own plan and glory and we should not shirk from acknowledging God's special purpose for these few Christians and their amazing ability and accomplishments through Christ. Regardless, still a must read but not for those desiring to have an axe to grind with his own brothers and sisters in Christ."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"As a Christian, I never knew why we did the things for church that we do. I love God and have always wanted more. This book showed me why church is so stagnant today and it pointed me to what is missing and how it can be restored. I look forward to reading other books by this author. I have searched for a book like this for a long time but this is only book I know of available today."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"The phenomenon of restorationism (a church body asserting its intentions to recreate the New Testament Church) is not a new one to American Evangelicalism. Generally initiated by those who have little or no understanding of the culture, history, and religious practices of those they wish to emulate, the temptation of a do-it-yourself ecclesiology (with the New Testament as their alleged guide) is irresistible for those feeling alienated by existing church practices.The telltale signature of restorationist movements is to proclaim existing ecclesial structures to be hopelessly out of step with true Christianity. After all, if the Church needs to be restored, then one would assume something had gone terribly wrong else the entire project of restoration would be a colossal waste of time. Unlike reform movements, whose primary motivation is to pressure the existing Church to renew itself from within, the strategy for restorationists is to wipe the slate clean and imagine the Church could be restarted anew. The inevitable result is the affirmation of their own personal beliefs and practices covered by the authority of eisegetic interpretations of Scriptural passages devoid of any context apart from their own.The latest installment of this characteristically American enterprise is now enshrined in Frank Viola and George Barna's Pagan Christianity?. Seeking to justify their own peculiarly postmodern American manifestation of what they believe to be \\"New Testament Christianity\\", they combine their own prejudices with such a staggering display of historical ignorance, that any informed reader is left shaking their heads at their garbled understanding of the Church's past. In their attacks on anything that smells of structure or authority, one can detect a sense of glee as they engage in their ill-informed attempts at iconoclasm.Of course, the church that \\"emerges\\" from their deconstruction is remarkably like the sort of thing that would be hatched in the mind of a postmodern American with a disdain for hierarchy, tradition, and anything that might have been considered to be of enduring value prior to their own personal conversion. Their \\"analysis\\" is a mishmash of outdated secondary sources, out-of-context quotations, unsupported hypotheses, and personal prejudices amalgamated into an \\"any stick will do\\" style attack on historical Christianity. Even worse, on those occasions where legitimate experts on the field are cited (i.e., Dom Gregory Dix, Paul F. Bradshaw, Alexander Schmeman) their views are taken so out of context as to have them seemingly ally with the authors when in fact their views are quite the opposite.Like other revisionists on both the left and right of the ecclesial spectrum, there is an overt removal of the New Testament Church from both the context of the Jewish practice that preceded it and the ecclesial practice that followed it. Once the Church is decontextualized, the inferred meanings of the texts of the New Testament are removed and new meanings assigned. In this sense, restorationists are best seen as sharing the deconstructionist methodology common to many postmodern revisionist thinkers.Viola and Barna begin their argument with an assault on church buildings. Their concern is not any particular problem with architectural style or the lavishness of furnishings but over the very idea of buildings being used for the specialized purpose of Christian gatherings. While the reason given for this aversion to architectural utility is passages in the New Testament that state the early Christians met in each others homes, the hidden reason is likely that one of the authors has been involved for two decades in the \\"house church\\" movement and seems to have made an idol out of a situation that grew out of necessity, was not intended as representative of a command, and was not in fact even followed strictly at the time.The fact is that the Book of Acts clearly state that the early Christians continued to worship in the Temple and the synagogues and largely carried on the established practices of Judaism. It is only where it came to the specifically Christian cultic practices among that they retreated to their homes - the only place available for them to freely express their faith in Christ - but there is no indication that it was ever intended as normative.They go on in rapid fire succession to rattle off a series of complaints against church buildings with allegations of their history that have little or no historical support. Many things they claim were adopted from paganism were also present in the Biblical faith of the Jews that God commanded. It never occurs to the authors the same church they accuse of importing paganism is the one that was laying down its lives in martyrdom for its refusal to compromise with paganism.Their claim that there were no special places of worship prior to Constantine also does not stand up to careful scrutiny. Yes, they often met in houses, but these \\"houses\\" were often the villas of wealthy members of the Church. It was common for expensive homes in the Roman era to have special rooms set aside for cultic purposes and these served as places of worship for the local Christian community. There were also theological schools in places like Alexandria and Antioch that developed (a point the authors acknowledge) and these likely also had places of worship associated with them. There have been numerous archaeological finds that have discovered pre-Constantinian Christian worship spaces that were obviously set apart for that purpose. The reason for having few specifically constructed church buildings was simply that Christianity was for much of the first few centuries a persecuted religion In times of severe persecution, the Christians often had to meet in total secrecy and places like the Catacombs in Rome and other secluded spots were employed. Once the persecution ended, such restrictions were abandoned. The authors make much of the grandeur of the basilicas built by Constantine, but fail to mention such notable places were pilgrimage sites and hardly the norm. In most of the Roman Empire, local churches would continue to be rather humble affairs.The authors' biases are again on display as they go as far in their tirades as to claim Jesus had a negative view of the Temple. Forgetting that the construction of both Jewish temples were ordained by God, they completely distort the obvious meaning of the passage - a negative view of the Jewish authorities - and transfer the negative view to the Temple itself. Jesus referred to the Temple as His Father's House - it contained the very presence of God in the Holy of Holies - and, far from downplaying its significance, chased out the moneychangers for defiling it. The passages they do cite give Jesus' accusations against the Jewish leaders. His statements on the destruction of the Temple was not because the Temple was an evil but because they had rejected the very presence of God who stood before them.The authors continually make the point that Jesus overthrew the existing Jewish structure and replaced it with a non-hierarchal, non-liturgical ekklesia. But the picture painted in the New Testament is entirely different. In Acts, it states the early Christians kept to the teachings of the Apostles, fellowship, the breaking of bread, and the prayers. In the context of the Judaism the early Christians practiced, there is definitely a hierarchy and liturgy implied in these words.The \\"teaching of the Apostles\\" demonstrates that there were those in authority to teach the truths of the faith and authority implies hierarchy. This is bone out as the Apostles are sought out for all major decisions. When controversy erupted over Paul's mission to the Gentiles, the disagreement was brought before the Apostles and elders at Jerusalem who decided the issue in council. In his epistles, Paul makes a point that he too is an apostle and shares the same authority. Paul instructs Timothy to appoint elders in the churches; throughout the New Testament, the Apostles ordain others' ministries by the laying on of hands.All of this should not be surprising - the early Christians did not live in an egalitarian society. Even before the Church, there is an implied hierarchy in the Gospels - Peter, James, and John form an inner circle among the twelve and every list of the twelve has Peter first and Judas last. Most importantly, there is a hierarchy within the triune God as the three persons relate to each other in hierarchal fashion. Thus, it is natural that Christ's body is also hierarchal and reflects an order.The passages cited for their position have nothing to do with the structure of the Church. For example, they cite the worldly desires of some of the twelve who attempt political maneuvers and are rebuked - but the rebuke states nothing about the existence of hierarchy but only their worldly desires. It is quite clear that the authors have long ago came to their conclusions and now are \\"proof-texting\\" their answers with passages that have no real bearing on the subject.The liturgical dimension of the early Christians can be seen in the phrases \\"the prayers\\" and \\"the breaking of bread\\". The prayers refer to the normal liturgical prayers of observant Jews but now given a Christian emphasis. These would develop over time into the Christian prayers of the divine office. The breaking of bread refers to the communion meal and was thought to reveal Christ to the believers (see the allusions to this in the story of the Road to Emmaus in Acts). The breaking of bread at a meal had long been a liturgical act at Jewish meals similar to our own praying grace. The Holy Communion was ordained by Christ as part of a liturgical meal celebrated by a people for whom the consumption of food followed liturgical rules. Considering that all Christian were at that point observant Jews (else the Council of Acts 15 would have been unnecessary), the thought they were somehow non-hierarchal or non-liturgical is merely an anachronistic application of postmodern American ideals on first century Near Eastern people.Turning to the evolution of modern Protestant worship, Viola and Barna continue their pattern of misguided historical analysis. First, they infer the source of the Protestant worship was the medieval mass promulgated by Gregory the Great. Here they ignore that the Gregorian Mass was an amalgamation of elements from existing Roman and Franco-Germanic liturgies and these followed the basic pattern of liturgy outlined by earlier writers such as Hippolytus and Justin Martyr and going back to the Didache at the turn of the first century. The Didache itself follows a pattern taking elements of Jewish practice that date back to the Second Temple period. This is further verified by the practices within the Byzantine Churches whose liturgy developed separately but still maintained the early structure indicated by the early Christians. Even the Church of the East, stretching from Persia to China, followed a similar pattern in its own unique liturgy despite being essentially cut off from contact with the Roman Church.The liturgical developments within Protestantism were, not surprisingly, a mixed bag - some good (the reintroduction of preaching to a key role) and some bad (the anti-sacramental nature of much of its worship) just as the developments in the medieval West had also been much of a mixed bag. Unfortunately, many of the liturgical reforms introduced by American Protestantism is far more reflective of American culture than the practice of the early Christians. Viola and Barna's project, like other restorationist attempts, always end up telling us far more about the participants than the early Church.Yet it is not just the most formal elements of Christian worship that the authors wish to abandon - even so basic and obvious a part of the service as the sermon is found wanting. Here the authors blame it on rhetoricians and philosophers - an assertion so absurd that it would be funny were it not the fact that the naive will take this drivel seriously. Yes, philosophers and rhetoricians often spoke at length about topics - but so did rabbis and those in authority in any endeavor. The Apostles would preach in the synagogues or in public squares where they could communicate the Good News. They also would speak at length in specifically Christian gatherings where they could teach the truths of the faith to the Church. The authors credit Augustine and Chrysostom with making pulpit oratory part of the faith - and they certainly were wonderful preachers - but fail to mention the many great sermons (available in any collection of the ante-Nicene Church Fathers) of those who preceded them. They fail to accept that God can make use of the gifts He has bestowed that are offered to His service in love. Yes, the original twelve were largely a rather unsavory group but God had no problem making use of the obvious gifts of Paul and Luke who were clearly of a far different social strata.As low as their opinions are of sermons, the authors think even worse of those who give them - particularly the authority attached to them. They ridiculously claim that there were no \\"official offices\\" with slots to fill, yet among the first things they did was choose a successor to replace the position of Judas in the twelve and even gave criteria for their nomination. The emergence of the office of bishop was, contrary to their claims, quite natural. As local church's reached points of self-sufficiency, they no longer needed to rely upon the evangelists or the church that had sponsored them. We see first the Church in Jerusalem having such leadership under James the Just and then both Antioch and Smyrna following under Ignatius and Polycarp. As more churches became established, the practice of episcopal leadership spread.As mentioned earlier, the early Church had all their leadership ordained by the Apostles. We see this most clearly in Acts and in the letters of Paul. The imposition of hands was a long established practice within most cultures of the time in conferring leadership and this certainly was not lost on the early Christians. Unfortunately, this does not tickle the ears of today's trendy egalitarians and they need go to great lengths to try to make square pegs fit in round holes.After some rather immature tirades against clerical garb and music ministries, the authors then turn their attention to the sacraments of Baptism and the Lord's Supper. Their obvious biases show by claiming the early Church practiced believers' baptism. There is in fact no evidence of this - baptism was a long standing ritual practice in Judaism (John the Baptist did not invent it) and there were no such restrictions. There are passages in the New Testament where converts' entire families were baptized (presumably including small children) and Paul makes a connection between baptism and circumcision. The sacrament was the entry into the New Covenant with Christ and was open to believers and their children.Since the early Church was growing primarily through conversion, it is natural that most early baptisms would be of adults. But you simply never hear of the children of early Christians baptized after some peculiarly American version of \\"being saved.\\" They all claim to be Christians from their childhood. The only period where there was hesitation was due to some believing wrongly that there were great obstacles to salvation if they fell from the faith after being baptized and hence delayed it until close to death but this practice would be condemned.The Lord's Supper/Communion/Eucharist was an outgrowth of Jesus' liturgical act on the night of His betrayal. The authors make much of the separation of the bread and cup from a full meal as menttioned in I Corinthians but fail to mention that Paul condemns them for their practices and replies with instructions that describe only the bread and cup. They consider the possibility that the separation was done to end abuses but then conclude it was incipient paganism. Their evidence for this: nothing. They just assume a twisted reading of the facts that concludes Christians who were willingly dying for Christ couldn't wait to be pagans. It is almost shocking to read the sheer arrogance of these two pseudohistorians who obviously not encountered the writings of the patristic Church firsthand but rely upon the inaccuracies of anti-Christian writers like Will Durant.The reasons for later developments are quite clear if one uses the original sources and a little common sense. First of all, only the bread and cup are essential. Nothing else is mentioned in any account of the Last Supper. Then there is the implied connection with between the bread and cup and the Passover lamb. They also came to realize the connection in Hebrews as the central ritual of the priestly order of Melchizadek (a type of Christ who offered up a meal of bread and wine). The Church saw this was no mere dinner but that their sacrifice of bread and wine was being united to Christ's sacrifice on the Cross and that he was \\"revealed in the breaking of bread\\".Of course all of this formal understanding and deep thinking about God's Holy Word is a bad idea and the authors proceed to list their complaints against every center of theological training in Church history from the great theological schools in Alexandria and Antioch to the monasteries to the medieval universities to their Protestant counterparts to the seminaries to the little Bible College down the road. Apparently, the Church would have been better off without them even though they preserved the Scriptures and kept alive the remains of Christian culture during times of great social upheaval.Oddly enough, after giving us chapter upon chapter of some of the most horrid proof-texting ever put to print, the authors then complain about proof-texting! They also at the end introduce the idea that house churches are not always a good idea and some instruction is needed to lead them. But wait - doesn't such assistance imply something like the sort of stuff given in seminaries and doesn't the idea that some people are needed to train others institute a de facto hierarchy? Oh, and in case you are wondering where all this wonderful training is brought down to a practical level and who will be the trainers - you can get it in one of the authors' other books. One immediately is reminded of what Orwell wrote in Animal Farm: \\"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.\\"It will be interesting to see what the future holds for the house church movement. Now that so much of the patristic Church is assigned to pagan beliefs, I suspect that the formulations of faith hashed out beginning at Nicea will be called into question. One can expect to see the house churches wrestling with the same heresies the patristic Church faced as new leaders decide the early Church actually believed something else entirely. The refashioning of old heresies in new wineskins is yet another characteristic of restorationist movements.The sort of nonsense we see in Pagan Christianity is nothing new. Hosts of restorationist movements in the past have mounted similar endeavors - each from their own uninformed perspective. While they all had their unique complaints, all had in common the elevation of American ideals to the level of divine command. For them as well as for Viola and Barna, even this error pales in comparison to their belief that their efforts are unique, revolutionary and important. How typically American!"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Pagan Christianity by Frank Viola and George Barna (Barna Books, 2008) is sure to ruffle some feathers. In the authors' attempt to \\"explore the roots of our church practices,\\" they aim their guns at nearly every aspect of the institutional church.Books that critique the current worship practices of the Church come and go. But rarely does one come across a book that so vehemently opposes everything about the institutional Church. Viola and Barna are convinced that the housechurch/organic church movement is the way of the future because it is the only authentic reproduction of the past.Viola and Barna believe that for almost 2000 years, the Church has been seriously misguided. Layers of tradition have stifled the true Christian experience. In order to recover the early church of the apostles, we must see the church as an \\"organic entity.\\"An organic church is simply a church that is born out of spiritual life instead of constructed by human institutions and held together by religious programs. Organic churches are characterized by Spirit-led, open-participatory meetings and nonhierarchical leadership. This is in stark contrast to a clergy-led institution-driven church.Pagan Christianity takes the readers through the history of many of our church practices. The authors argue the following:The church should not contain any hierarchy at all.The senior pastor is actually an obstacle to the fully-functioning body of Christ.The idea of a sermon in a church gathering is pagan (after all, that brings about a clergy/laity distinction).Church buildings take away from the biblical teaching that the Church is a people.Any routine in worship is wrong. All liturgy, whether Protestant, Catholic or free church is misguided and stifling to the Holy Spirit.Dressing up for church is a leftover from paganism and hypocritical for Christians.No one should lead in singing. To have a worship leader picking songs is an affront to freedom in Christ.Tithing is completely unbiblical and now serves to prop up the unbiblical institutionalized church and the salaries of unbiblical clergy.Baptism and the Lord's Supper have been coopted by pagan mysticism.Christian education doesn't work because everything is mind-focused. Discipleship should be an apprentice-ship, not just filling the head with information.The Bible needs to be read in context, not as a jigsaw puzzle.We need to be like Jesus - revolutionaries who are ready to turn aside all tradition.A few areas of agreement (and I do mean a few):It's good to question why we do things a certain way in worship. I do not find fault with the authors for posing good questions.We do need to recover the celebratory aspect of the Lord's Supper, and I think that placing the Supper within the context of a community meal might help.The Bible does, indeed, need to be read as a narrative, and not merely as a list of selective verses.We need to be willing to throw out traditions that are unbiblical.Some areas of disagreement:1. First off, I disagree with the underlying premise of the entire book - a premise that says the early church was untainted and uncorrupted by human tradition. I often ask this question to those who want to get back to the early church: Which early church do you want to be like?Corinth? (Do you really want incestuous church members and no-rules-at-all worship gatherings?)Galatia? (Is it good to model a church that has so quickly abandoned the gospel?)Thessalonica? (Do you want to be the church that has lost the eschatological hope of the new heavens and new earth? A church drowning in grief?)Sure, we can learn from the earliest churches. But I disagree that there is some pristine, uncorrupted, untainted early church that we must aspire to be.2. I dislike the way Viola and Barna put forward their argument. They leave no room for discussion on the issue. If you disagree with them, you must love the traditions of man more than God. It becomes impossible to enter into honest dialogue because of the way they have set up the predicament.3. Pagan Christianity is a historical book that hates history. That might sound like an oxymoron; after all, the book is filled with historical dates and references. But the authors are convinced that all Christianity from the second-century on has been wrong, unbiblical, and harmful to the gospel. In other words, church history is the story of a church that does not at all resemble what Jesus intended.Let me give a quick example. When discussing the liturgy, the authors seek to show how the order of worship of medieval Catholicism is still visible in Protestant churches. There should be no order of worship, no routine, no liturgy whatsoever. The authors compare and contrast the liturgies of varying denominations to show how they are all unbiblical. But nowhere do the authors entertain the notion that perhaps the similarities in liturgy point to the value in structuring our worship a certain way. Have the greatest thinkers of the past 2000 years been blinded by tradition? Or have the great Christian thinkers seen value in the way Christian worship has developed?4. Pagan Christianity will drive more evangelicals to the Roman Catholic Church. Just watching an author like George Barna go from one fad to another in the past twenty years is enough to exhaust anyone who tires of the evangelical merry-go-round. Even though Pagan Christianity condemns Roman Catholic tradition, its equating of Roman Catholicism with Protestantism in areas of church practice will undermine this book's argument. Many disenchanted evangelicals will try out the \\"organic\\" churches that Barna recommends, only to discover the same fallenness in this expression of the \\"church\\" that they saw in the institutional church they left. Burned, confused, and disappointed, many will turn to Rome for the stability they long for.5. Pagan Christianity will give ammunition to those who already dislike the churches they have encountered. I do not believe the book will launch a new organic-church movement. I believe the book will give justification to those who have already removed themselves from their local bodies of Christ. Pagan Christianity, if taken seriously by many Christians, will not lead to a renewal of the church, but to ecclesial amputation - as more and more disenchanted church members abandon their church families in order to seek after the \\"pure church\\" of the first century. They will keep chasing the pot at the end of the rainbow, only to find it eludes them because it doesn't exist."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"The hard-hitting (though certainly not shrill) preface by Viola sets thetone for the rest of the book: \\"Contemporary Christianity has fallen intothe errors of both the Pharisees and the Saducees. ... We break theScripture just as much by burying it under a mountain of human traditionas by ignoring its principles.\\" Barna follows on this note in hisIntroduction with these questions: \\"Does it surprise you that most of whatwe do in religious circles has no precedent in Scripture? ... Does it reallymatter how we practice our faith, as long as the activities enable peopleto love God and obey Him?\\"After an opening chapter to set the stage, they then devote a chapter eachto \\"deconstructing\\" the sacred cows that characterize modern Christianchurch life. The authors have certainly done their homework, as evidencedby the copious footnotes on each page and the extensive bibliography atthe back of the book.The book does a good job of tracing the historical origins of manycontemporary church practices (sermons, tithing, clergy, etc.). I believethe evidence is incontrovertible that the origins of our modern day churchpractices do not find their basis in scripture. Whether or not this issufficient to convince most churches to jettison their current practicesand structures remains to be seen. Part of the reason is that this book isNOT a \\"how-to manual.On this note, it is important to keep in mind the book's scope and aimbefore criticizing it.First of all, the book is not meant to be academic: \\"This is not a workfor scholars, so it is by no means exhaustive\\". Having said that, the bookis saturated with footnotes and concludes with a fairly extensivebibliography should one wish to delve deeper. Furthermore, the book isendorsed by a number of professors, if that matters to you.Also, one should keep in mind that the book does not attempt to say allthere is to say about church life. Indeed, in many ways, this is largely a\\"negative\\" book, given its topic, i.e. debunking traditional churchpractices. In particular, this book is NOT a manual for \\"how to dochurch\\". However, Frank Viola has written a number of other books relatingto church life, such as The Untold Story of the New Testament Church andGod's Ultimate Passion that sets forth his views and vision of church inpositive ways. In fact, Frank has a new book in the wings that will willnicely complement this one: Reimagining Church: Pursuing the Dream ofOrganic Christianity, which is due out this August.Secondly, the authors are not out to bash churches or to encourage you toleave your present church. I grow weary of critics leveling such baselessattacks, especially when some of them probably haven't even read the book!We are all responsible for how we respond to teaching that is presented tous, no matter who's teaching.Thirdly, much of what the authors write here in challenging traditionalchurch practices is not new. Indeed, on my bookshelf are dozens of books(as well as a number of academic journal articles), both popular andacademic, that are saying essentially the same thing. So don't accuse theauthors of trying to introduce some wild and novel ideas with regards tobeing and doing church.Lastly, please read the book before giving your opinions about it. Inparticular, do not misrepresent what they are saying; if you have anydoubts at all, contact them for clarification. They have a web page thatanswers some common objections, so please be sure to read that firstbefore blogging about the book.My own advice to readers: if you find yourself getting frustrated andangry as you read, pause and put the book down. Take a few deep breathsand ask yourself, \\"Why am I so worked up? What exactly am I disagreeingwith?\\" I can understand that this book will bother many who have a vestedinterested in traditional church life; it's not easy when someone comesand demolishes all your sacred cows!Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Pagan Christianity now revised and improved! I have found this revision an even better read than before and what I said in my review of the first edition I now repeat with even greater conviction.I believe \\"Pagan Christianity\\" may very well become known as the single most liberating piece of Christian work penned in the last 1700 years. It will hopefully become known as the single most influential piece of Christian literature in this new century. Without doubt it will be loved by many as it will liberate multitudes and for that same reason it is sure to be hated and feared by others.Frank Viola now together with George Barna have pulled back the covers to reveal the pagan origins of many if not all of the practices of this thing we call Christendom. In a very scholarly yet easy to read fashion they have traced the origins of the traditions, practices and institutions of all that which make up what we call Christianity today and found them painfully wanting. In contrast they illustrate the simplicity and almost tribal nature of the 1st century church the bride of Christ as she met with her groom in irresistible freedom, life and love.I have long suspected that many if not all new Christians early in the adventure of their new life in Christ have encountered deep and unsettling doubts about this institution we call church. I believe these haunting doubts and unanswered longing also lurk in the spirits of many Christians who have lived long in the Lord. These things should not go unheeded!

There is so much stuff that is blatantly contrary to the Word, that occurs in these buildings that we call \\"church.\\" I was one who was \\"at church\\" Tuesday, Wednesday, Saturday morning for prayer and Sunday...like I was really doing something for God. What a joke, I am so thankful that I have this book, I feel as though God is peeling away all the man-doctrine and improper interpretation that is regurgitated from Sunday to Sunday and I am so grateful. Everyone who is a \\"believer\\" and desire better understanding, need to get this book. The chapter on tithing would turn the \\"black\\" church over. Thank you Frank Viola and George Barna, this book was and IS NEEDED."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"This books digs back into church history and asks a very simple question; where did the practices of the modern day church come from. If you want to read this book, prepare yourself to never look at the church the same way again.I was amazed at all the research that went into this book. I have read many books written by the emerging church leaders, but none of them is so well researched. Even if you think that the emerging church is a bad thing, this might be a good read for understanding where people in the movement are coming from, from an academic stand point.What I liked about this book.As I said before, I loved the extensive research put into this book. It is amazing to find out how some things got started, practices that are not found in the New Testament. This is the best history currently available of where church practices came from.Also, for me, it was a faith building book. Sometimes I need to be reminded that my faith is in the Living God, not in rituals of the church. Sometimes I need to rethink why I am doing what I am doing and make sure it is in line with what God wants. This book made me think.What I didn't like.This book was a little dry and hard to get through. I also think the author fails to see that, for some people, the institutional church can be a blessing. Although my ideas of church are more closely aligned with the emerging church, I have seen too many people who have been blessed by the institutional church to completely say it is wrong.I recommend this book for anyone who is searching for answers and has an open mind. Book are written by fallible people, and no books should be taken as gospel truth."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"The premise of this book is quite simple, that much of what we accept as Christian practice in American today has as its roots, not the Bible, but pagan practices and secular ideas from over the last two thousand years. They present this idea in a very readable and easy to understand manner, without losing their footnotes and references for those who want to dig deeper. The authors systematically look at different aspects of Christian practice and look at where they came from. This is fine, and the points the author makes are the vast majority of the time dead on. It is critically important for Christians to look at their practice and their church and to not just do something because it has always been done. For that, this book is fantastic.The problems with this book comes in three forms. 1)They do an injustice to the Jewish aspects of the Christian faith. The authors so overly focus on the Greek and Roman thought that they refuse to look at the very foundations of our faith, Judaism. The \\"OT\\" was the Christian text until the NT got canonized, and yet the authors seemingly ignore Judaism entirely as if Christian sprung on the scene wholly formed. The authors rightly point out that the vast majority of believers were Greek/Roman very early in Christianity, and that the separation from Judaism that brought Christians out of synagogues happened very early as well. However, that does not mean that there were no influences on Christian development or tradition from Judaism or the Jewish scriptures. Likewise, nothing from the OT seems to be seen as a valid practice for Christians to emulate, it is NT or bust.2) While excellent at writing about the problems with what we currently do, they are much less successful at defending their idea of an \\"organic church.\\" The examples they give are vague at best, and unhelpful, while at the same time the authors are critiquing modern churches for being unspecific and unhelpful for believers. Thei descriptions of their form of church are invariably filled with Christianese and lovely words that have no practical meaning in describing what is happening in the gatherings.3)This book is highly American. Much of the flaws in our particular branch of Christianity in America can be found by examining other nations and how they worship, however, the authors only study non-American practices when they are historical and can be traced to founding American traditions. While this is perfectly fine in most cases, it overall creates the sense that American Christianity is somehow the normative practice around the entire world. A few examples of alternative forms of worship from around the world besides the authors' own vague conceptions of organic churches would have significantly helped convince that other options in Christian practice are viable.Overall, this is a very important work to help peopel think about what is wrong with this church today, but is much less helpful when it comes to finding alternatives. As usual, it is much harder to build than to tear down, even when in this case what is torn is legitimately defective or even harmful."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"for sure you won't be able to walk into church the same way again; and you'll start questioning all sorts of things & become a better thinker about the church. i think it explains a lotthought there was some sloppy reasoning; can't say they addressed every concern in their arguments.sometimes repetitivesometimes talked about things that didn't really matter, or failed to make a good argument for why some things were being discussed (church steeples, for example)"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"On the whole the book is very well researched and presented. Their arguments are well articulated and thought out. After reading this book I feel that I can agree with most of what the authors are trying to say.However, I would like to point out a small issue I have around their comments on approaching the Bible as a jigsaw puzzle. They claim that taking a verse here and a verse there makes it possible to build any doctrine and make the text support any point that a person wants to make. However, these same authors use single non-connected quotes throughout the book to backup their claims - this seems duplicitous to me. Also a in Hebrews 5 we see the author say5So Christ also did not take upon himself the glory of becoming a high priest. But God said to him,\\"You are my Son; today I have become your Father. (Psalm 2:7)6And he says in another place, \\"You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek.\\" (Psalm 110.4)Here the author clearly uses two non-connected pieces of scripture together to make his point. We also see Jesus, Peter and Paul use small quotes of scripture in varous places so in and of itself it is not wrong. In the first chapter of Acts we see two separate scriptures used (rightly or wrongly) to justify selecting a replacement for Judas Iscariot. We even see Jude using non-scriptural references (Book of Enoch) to make a point. There does however need to be Holy Spirit led due dilligence when using the scripture but this is always the case anyway."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"I'm not going to critique the book by writing a book, just an easy review....The Good: The author's arguments and historical accounts are backed up by using footnotes and references. The book is an easy read and easy to follow. The author is knowledgeable in the subject and seems really interested in using what he knows to make the reader rethink what he knows about christian practices.The Bad: The author assumes that the reader is christian. I purchased the book to gain more information about church practices I've seen while at weddings, funerals, on tv and the like. I will disclose that I am an atheist, and perhaps it is my fault for not researching the book or author more. I just wanted some information and for the most part I got it, but I was getting pretty annoyed with the constant \\"my dear christian\\" this and \\"my dear protestant\\" that. And whats with all the exclamation points?The Ugly: Again, it is my fault for not researching the author. But it was distressing to read that not only is the author upset that church practices has roots in pagan worship and the jewish faith, but he would reference them as heathen. I got the impression that he thinks that judaism is beneath christianity, like its an insult. This is one of the many reasons I personally reject religion entirely. The author once again shows me that if his religion doesn't agree with my religion then I am wrong. It shows me once again that religion is a divider in society and only unites those with like minds. Many times I just wanted to put the book down, but then I just decided to sift through all his rhetoric and gain the facts and info I was looking for."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Lots of thot provoking good insights. Another that should be in all Christian library's. Frank has done his homework and hats off to the publisher for the brave move.

You either love it or hate it.He does a wonderful job of questioning the origin of our modern church practices and demonstrating why we do some of the things we do in traditional church circles. However, Viola goes too far with the cure.He is very much against any form of paid leadership or even leadership in general. He sort of envisions a meeting with nobody in charge waiting for the Spirit to just move someone to share, sing or otherwise do something.While there is some truth in the book, the prescription is a little off from the ailment he describes. I think Frank Viola uses hyperbole as a benchmark against which to judge the corrective elements to the traditional way of doing things.While the traditional church is structurally flawed, it has done many wonderful things in spite of its deficiencies. And Viola's you're-wrong-unless-you-do-it-the-way-I-prescribe is a little off-putting for many.With this said, I still think it is a valuable contribution to the corpus of writings concerning the house church movement.A much more balanced book, in my opinion, is John Fenn's \\"Leaving the Church to Find God\\" available right here on Amazon."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Pagan Christianity by Frank Viola and George Barna was an exceptional book, willing to explore hard topics concerning the church today. Have you ever left church feeling like you weren't really needed except to work in the nursery? Or felt like deep relationships are not really built in the 10 minute greeting before service starts? Have you felt uneasy with how Christianity seems to be more and more commercialized? Or thought about how much money is spent on large buildings that are only used once or twice a week? Pagan Christianity answers many questions about topics that may make us uneasy, especially when we see how far we've strayed from God's design, but the solutions to these problems will lead us to a closer walk with God and His people."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"This is an important read for anyone having grown up in or is now a part of any of the expressions of institutional christianity. This is important research into what Christ's church was in the first two centuries in huge contrast to what it has become since. It reveals the sources of the changes and the devastating results of those changes reaching on into our time. It is truth that few in Christianity are aware of to their detriment.

The book is very well written and is quite hard to put down once started..."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"For many Christians, there is a sense that something is lacking in our Christian walk. Although we have accepted Christ's gift of salvation and we try to walk faithfully under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, there is a yearning for purpose and meaning. We sit in our church pews and ask \\"Is there more than this?\\" and hope that there is indeed more. We cannot accept the premise that being a Christian means little more than sitting in church, singing a few hymns, listening to the sermon, and then going home until the next service.Many of us want to make a difference in the world but don't know how to go about doing that. We want to do something for Christ but don't know what to do. After all, we are not ordained ministers, youth pastors or \\"called\\" prophets or apostles. So what can we do?We can read Pagan Christianity and understand what we have been sensing in our spirits for so long: that we are called to ministers to others, to actively serve Christ, and to participate in church services- more than simply singing songs.Oftentimes, church leaders tell us that the emptiness we feel in the services is due to rebellion or sin in our lives. Pagan Christianity gives us permission to accept this unsettledness in our spirits without having to worry if our salvation is at risk. It explains that much of our traditional Christian practices, which are not fulfilling us, are not what the early church experienced. It teaches us how the early church worked until man started adding in his ideas so we can get back to the original Christian ministry. After all, we are called to follow Christ, not other men.Pagan Christianity can help Christians who are seeking for something more in their spiritual walk but only if we are willing to question what we have been doing for so and why have we been doing it. With God's help, we can discover that Pagan Christianity is more than just an interesting read - it's a life-changing book that can help us take our rightful places in God's purpose for His People.It is my firm belief that Pagan Christianity was written under the guidance of the Holy Spirit to reach God's People so we can impact the world for Him, during these final days before the return of Christ. In the grand scheme of life, isn't that the reason the Church is still here?"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"This book is very enlightening and is hard to put down once you start reading"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Wow, I was really looking forward to this book.

I love Barna's stuff and couldn't wait for this one. While it has some interesting info to think through, I didn't realize it was just a big advertisment for organic churches. It's one thing to educate and discern, it's another to be a walking commercial that if you get it..leave your church quietly and not cause a stir, if you don't, well you weren't ready for the truth yet. And how do you have a book that talks against modern churches using video to \\"entertain masses\\" co-authored by one who owns a company that makes videos for the church. I still love Barna but the agenda (not the info) in this book was very unsettling to me."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"As a house-church enthusiast, I welcome this book which exposes the origins of many \\"institutional church\\" practices. It is well-researched and well-documented, for the most part. There are a few things I wish he would have spent more time on. For example, he does not believe that pastors should be paid (neither do I) but he doesn't say how he deals with the subject as presented in I Timothy chapter 5 -- this is a passage that is commonly used to defend pastoral salaries.I would have given this book 5 stars, but at the end, he gets away from the subject to take an unneccessary swipe at pre-trib dispensationalists (of which I am one) through a rant on \\"proof-texting\\" (which is a hip way of saying, \\"taking the Scriptures out of context\\"). He seems to take another swipe at those who would start a house church -- and this one I did NOT understand--without somehow getting the blessing of an already existing house church. This is just plain silly. I think that people who have walked with the Lord for all of their lives have the spiritual maturity to begin a house church by themselves under the tutelage of the Holy Spirit. Otherwise, you are just making the house church another \\"institutional\\" church.Overall, however, this is good reference material, especially to use against those who accuse house-churchers of simply wanting to escape \\"authority\\"."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"I was terribly disappointed by this book. Missing from the book are the people that count the most here: the generation immediately following the apostles. Here is one example of a description of worship from Justin Martyr around 140 AD, long before the council of Nicea:\\"On the day called after the sun [Sunday] there is a meeting for which all those dwelling in the cities or in the countryside come together. The records of the Apostles or the writings of the prophets are read as long as time allows. When the reader has stopped, the one who is presiding admonishes and encourages us by a sermon to the imitation of those good examples.Then we all stand up together and lift up our prayers and, as I said previously, when we have finished our prayer, bread is brought forth and wine and water. The one who is presiding offers up prayers and thanksgiving according to his ability and the people acclaim their assent with \`\`Amen.'' There is the distribution of and participation on the part of each one in the gifts for which thanks has been offered, and they are sent to those who are not present through the deacons.This sounds like what I do every Sunday at my \\"institutional church\\". It didn't come from the pagans, it didn't come from Constantine, it's home grown Christianity that grew in the soil of the apostles.\\"If we take them at their word, we see that the generation following the apostles believed in:* worshipping in special places on Sunday* confessing sins before communion* regarding communion with awe and reverence* A distinct role for the clergy distinct from laity* An order of worship almost identical to what happens in a typical episcopal, catholic, orthodox, or Lutheran church.I'll put a few quotes here, but these are just a sampling. You have to read these sources for yourself to get a feel for the liturgical water they swam in:Clement of Rome (80 A.D.) (letter to the Corinthians)\\"Since then these things are manifest to us, and we have looked into the depths of the divine knowledge, we ought to do in order all things which the Master commanded us to perform at appointed times. He commanded us to celebrate sacrifices and services, and that it should not be thoughtlessly or disorderly, but at fixed times and hours.\\"St. Ignatius of Antioch, Epistle to the Smyrnaeans, 8:1, 110 A.D.:\\"Let that Eucharist be held valid which is offered by the bishop or by the one to whom the bishop has committed this charge. Wherever the bishop appears, there let the people be; as wherever Jesus Christ is, there is the Catholic Church.\\"The Didache (90 A.D.)\\"On the Lord's own day, assemble in common to break bread and offer thanks; but first confess your sins, so that your sacrifice may be pure.\\"On a personal level, I find their tone insulting and dismissive. My parents came to know Jesus through a mainline Baptist church. I experience Christ intimately and personally through the hymns, sermon, and style I grew up with, and my Dad's church is amazingly soul winning and involved in community outreach. I'm Catholic and find Jesus no more intimately than in the Eucharist with all the bells and incense and the whole works. The more it looks like the worship described in the book of Revelation the better! He fills me with his very self when I receive him and I'm often moved to tears just by his touch.Our church, and my dad's have their problems, but it's a lack of intimacy with Jesus that creates them, not how we happen to show up, sing, and pay our pastors. Having everyone worship from home won't solve all the problems. God will always be working with wheat and tares in his church. It will always be messy and hypocritical, and yet some how he will use his Bride to lead us to his Son.John Seidlitz"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Pagan Christianity:Wow, what a challenge to the status quo.

His book RETHINKING THE WINESKIN will cause anyone to pause and examine their own church in light of what Viola reveals from the Bible.In this book, Viola takes a look at the history of the many practices found in the modern Church and compares them with both church history and with the Bible to see if these practices are warrented for standard practice. Viola examines everything from church buildings to the modern idea of seminary trained professional pastors/clergy. Viola's main point is to not only solidify the practices and beliefs of the house church movement but to call all Christians to reexamine their faith with the New Testament Church to see if they are following in the steps of the Apostles of Christ or pagans.Overall I think this is a good book. While many who have lived their entires lives in the modern clergy/laity church system will have their faith shaken by what they read, many more will see that God is longing to reveal his glory in his people through his Church. In fact, the modern practices may be what is holding back a great revival in the Church that God uses to touch the nations with his salvation through his Son.

It has the information broken down into bite sized chunks and makes the facts understandable.

I would say therefore that when you read it, prepare to examine what you believe and hang on to God. Pray through it.Taking a look at why we do things that we have accepted without question can be uncomfortable, however it is also liberating because it becomes thinkable to throw out those practices we knew were not really working when we are sure they are neither sacred nor commanded by God.I gave the book 4 stars instead of 5 because I did find myself wanting to read the source documents in order to check out some of the statements the Author made that were obviously reliant on his historical research. It made the book more readable to not have to fumble through a lot of quotations, but I felt that I wanted them. There is an extensive bibliography however, so the information is available.I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to explore the way they \\"do church\\" and gain a fresh perspective on our most common practices.

After many many years in organized church, serving, singing, preaching, setting up/taking down, inviting friends and neighbors, and trying to get to know God's will for my life, I decided it was time to get to know Jesus as a Brother and God as a Father. I started to question what was happening on Sunday mornings in light of this new journey for intimacy with the Creator and His Son. My Sunday morning ritual did not seem to enforce this relational intimacy, and the rituals began to be stale to me.I eventually came across this book, and the Lord used it to reveal to me why it was feeling stale. This book answered many questions about why what was happening on Sunday morning wasn't re-enforcing a relational intimacy with the Heavenly Father. Mostly by by showing that what is practiced on Sunday mornings does not resemble the assemblies of believers as Jesus started in the New Testament, or as Paul established on his journeys. I was following and practicing traditions established after the first century by a Roman emperor.So, the next question became, if the current form of institutionalized christianity is not following the example of ekklesia gathering from the New Testament, what is the alternative? Well, this is where the book 'Reimagining Church' comes in. If you read 'Pagan' and were left with the question of \\"what next?\\", you will need to follow up with 'Reimagining', as the author states they go together as a two parter.Read these two books if you find yourself stale, stagnant, or unhappy with the organized church system, or if you desire a renewed intimate relationship with the Creator and HIs Son that you don't feel you are getting from your pew-sitting.Blessings on you in Christ's name,Gordon"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"While it is very good to re-evaluate at times and make sure we are all still on the right track and didn't lose ourselves in unhealthy traditions and such, the way Viola and Barna present the matter here is degrading and disrespectful.

The argument that much of our modern way of doing church and ministry is \\"pagan\\" requires Viola to develop an ideal or romantic picture of church based on his narrow view of the New Testament church. If the church, were in actuality a static picture then perhaps his arguments would be valid and instructive; however, Viola is fundamentally wrong because he fails to grasp overarching truths of Christianity: it is fluid and ordered by God. Additionally, the church does not exist in a vacuum. Christianity engages cultures and meets people where they are and transforms them by an expression that is translatable throughout the world and generations. Christianity is not stamped into people; they live into it by the Holy Spirit. Christianity is practiced by improvisation, as people are led by the Holy Spirit in their life with God. Therefore, it is actually unChristian to compare everything we do today to the Christians of the first century and say as Viola does \\"That is not the way the first apostles did it so we are wrong and pagan.\\" Are we wrong to practice a period of repentance leading to Good Friday and then Easter because that is not in the New Testament?This book frankly ignores the reality of life in this world, not only ours, but it ignores the reality of the incarnation. The Christian practice is incarnational. God takes the things of creation and sanctifies them and makes them sacred.Viola also writes as if God has not been behind movements and practices of the church since the time of the apostles. This very Puritanical view allows very little freedom to follow the inspirations of God. This is seen in how Viola selectively, negatively highlights writings of the early church Fathers that meet his purpose while ignoring the fact that many of these were effective Christians obviously full of the Holy Spirit who defended Christianity against heresies and pagans. He also fails to recognize that the Canon of the New Testament was not the foundation of the early church but developed out of the apostolic teaching and was not accepted as canon until the 4th century.I think Viola searches the Scriptures and church writings to make his case but fails because he doesn't recognize the power and influence of the Living Christ in the very practices he denounces. The church is not about our story; it is God's story--his drama of which he is the author.At least one theme of his book that I do appreciate is the ungodly expectations and stresses on modern pastors and his criticism of the way many Christians have adopted a \\"weekend, amateur Christian\\" status as opposed to the \\"professional Christian\\" who is pastor. This is an unfortunate effect of how we do church today.Let's remember...Christianity is alive and well and continuing to advance throughout the world, and the Church is always in need of repentance and reform because we all sin and are imperfect. If the answer if a house church movement, let's hope they are big houses to fit all the generations and all of the gifts and varieties of people that make up the complete church."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"My Pastor was talking about this awecome book he'd seen somewhere and wanted to add to his personal library so I headed to Amazon and there it was, for a really good price too!"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Timely message to the Church, refreshing and well studied. A great read for all who desire the experience of a living organic Church."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"When I read this book it was as if it put words and explanations to not only things I felt in my own heart for some time but also what I had experienced being in ministry for years as well as a pastor. First, I want to point out that when approaching this book I had an open mind and didn't read it looking for what was wrong. I have found that helpful to understand the heart of the authors so that I could wrestle properly with some of the more difficult sections. After reading many reviews I find that sometimes people are too quick to jump to conclusions instead of looking into a matter more thoroughly. For me I found the book to be refreshing and could relate to the fact that many of the traditions that were scrutinized I had adopted and accepted as from God Himself. I began to see that yes many of the traditions that we have crystallized into defensible facts of God's church are actually hindrances from realizing His true purpose and experiencing His life to the fullest especially in a community of believers. Unfortunately the institutional system even though God does work within it because there are people, His people in it, by default creates a type of dualism where many view their spiritual lives separate from their daily regular lives. Most kids grow up learning that God and serving Him and worshiping Him is tied to a building or system. Since I did read Reimagining Church, the positive sequel to PC, I can see the major difference between knowing, worshiping and serving the Lord together with your Church family in an ongoing deep and real way that is the expression of the Life of Christ vs. following a set order of worship and having relationship that for the most part is somewhat shallow. By the way that isn't a generalization because i know there are exceptions from time to time.I believe it is important to take a hard look at the traditions we are following especially those that keep us from experiencing and expressing the fullness of Christ's life and that in many ways are man centered instead of Christ centered. Pagan Christianity is a helpful, honest, thoughtful and well put together book. Although if you read it and especially if you took issue with it because it left you either groping for answers to all of the new questions or angry at the system then you really need to read Reimagining ChurchReimagining Church: Pursuing the Dream of Organic Christianityand even From Eternity to HereFrom Eternity to Here: Rediscovering the Ageless Purpose of Godwhich puts these works into a grand theme found in scripture.In Christ."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"This book was really a big disappointment to me because the responses of the contributors are so heavy with political and social commentary.

Humans all too often follow traditions without questioning or studying the roots or reasons why they do, and follow these traditions in ignorance. We become as lazy \\"sheep\\", following the instruction of a pastor or priest, taking the easy route on Sunday or Wednesday services rather than taking responsibility to study the Bible carefully,comparing it with church historical evolution and tranditions. The authors of \\"Pagan Christianity\\" will take you to those roots for you to consider, read the Bible for yourself and pray for God's guidance to live according to His Spirit for life, rather than blind, unquestioning trust in one or more pastors or leaders of a traditional church. The authors will very clearly take you on an historical journey back to the early church and on to the times of Constantine who brought so much paganism into what we think is the biblical way to worship in congregations. There is nothing to fear in studying church history toward a more spiritually sound walk with Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior rather than merely the traditions of man."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"\\"Pagan Christianity\\" is excellent. There was a lot of research that went into this book. I think it should be on every Christian's Top Ten List of books to read.We need to return to the simplicity that is in Christ. We can't mix Christ with Greek philosophy and we can't mix Christ with worldly (pagan) elements.\\"We worship Him in Spirit and in truth.\\""},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"I really enjoyed this book and thought the authors did a great job of demonstrating how pagan our Christianity is today. I have been reading and studying primitive and early Christianity for 28 years, and even I did not know some of things brought up by the authors. However, the authors are guilty of picking on the smaller issues and never mentioning the larger pagan issues.Christmas and Easter are 100% traditions from paganism. There is no Lent, no Ash Wednesday, or Fat Tuesday, no Valentine's Day no Halloween in the Bible whatsoever. Sunday was instituted by Constantine as a holy day for Christians to worship and it was a Roman day for business meetings. The bible teaches us 100% that God gave us the Sabbath as a day to rest from work and a day to worship him in a vast array of ways. Jesus teaching us we can tend to the sick or help a friend or do a good deed as well as study, pray, or worship in song on a Sabbath thus releasing us from the dogma and traditions of the Pharisees version of how to handle the Sabbath. God gave us his High Sabbaths which represent steps in his plan for our salvation, but mainstream Christianity has pushed them away as Jewish and instead adopted the pagan holidays and traditions and giving them a Jesus sticker of approval to make them seem appropriate. I think these are much weightier issues than that of the pulpit or the sermon. Another pagan orator - Plato - has provided the bedrock of the doctrine of the Trinity which the bible never mentions or teaches. It took several centuries for the political clergy to fight over who Jesus was and the trinity doctrine was the outcome of those fights, but there is no Godhead or three person god. God is Spirit and only God is Holy - therfore, God is the Holy spirit but such that he imparts a small amount to each of us as God directs for his purpose. So by allowing paganism in the all the doctrines, the paganism of Sundays as the day to worship, and adding pagan Holidays instead of God's Holy Days is truly a monumental oversight that the authors need yet to address in additional books."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Pagan Christianity is an eye opening book that explores the roots of our church practices. Frank Viola and George Barna show us how far the rabbit hole goes with our church practices; being rooted not in the New Testament, but in pagan cultures and rituals. They contrast how the church was intended to be with the church as it has become today. They delve into the problems that can arise when we accept these practices and rituals. In covering a wide range of topics like the order of worship, the pastor, tithing, and the Lord's Supper, we see how the church has transitioned over time gradually shifting from one end of the spectrum to the other. After reading Pagan Christianity you will not look at church in the same manner as you did before, and will have to \\"decide if you can do church the same way again.\\"\\"Why is it that we Christians can follow the same rituals every Sunday without ever noticing that they are at odds with the New Testament? The incredible power of tradition has something to do with it.\\"-Pg. 222"},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Very informative info on how and why current church practices came into vogue. A real eye-opener."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"(I received a review copy of this book.)In &lt;em>Pagan Christianity&lt;/em>, Viola and Barna state that \\"almost everything that is done in our contemporary churches has no basis in the Bible\\" (pg. 4). This is the primary concern of their research and their book. Chapter by chapter they demonstrate from historical accounts that the church building (ch. 1), the order of worship (ch. 2), the sermon (ch. 3), the pastor (ch. 4), Sunday morning costumes (ch. 5), ministers of music (ch. 6), tithing and clergy salaries (ch. 7), baptism and the Lord's Supper (ch. 8), and Christian education (ch. 9) arise from culture and not from Scripture. Based on the fact that these practices arise from culture and not from Scripture, and their assumptions which will be covered below, they state the purpose of this book: \\"[I]t explains how this practice stifles the practical headship of Jesus Christ and hampers the functioning of His body\\" (pg. 9).Instead of reviewing this book chapter by chapter, which many have already done, I plan to examine the big picture presented by the book. I want to state at the beginning that I agree with many of the assumptions and conclusions of the authors. I agree than many, if not most, of the practices of the modern church arise from past cultures and not from the teachings of Scripture. I also agree that many of these same practices are unnecessary and in some cases detrimental to the maturity of the church and the believer.To me, the most important aspect of this book is that it brings to light many practices and beliefs that are not based on Scripture. All believers should consider the importance of these things. If buildings, budgets, paid staff, choirs, etc. are not taught in Scripture, then they are not necessary for us to live together in Christ. Why, then, do we consider these and other practices to be necessary? Could it be that we are missing something important because we focus on things that are scriptural? I think this is happening.Viola and Barna's historical analysis is very beneficial. Some have discredited them because of their reliance on secondary sources (i.e. history books instead of the actual writings). I also wish that they had included more citations from primary sources. However, if they had relied only upon primary sources, it would have taken volumes to hold the information.When I read the first edition of this book (authored only by Viola), I was disappointed by the tone and rhetoric. In this second edition, the tone and rhetoric is much more balanced. Many who have negatively reviewed this book complain about the rhetoric. It is true that the authors still make some sweeping statements, overall the tone is much more palatable in this second edition.My primary concern with this book is the assumptions that the authors make. For example, they assume that the meeting of the church should include input from many different attenders, not just one or two. Similarly, they assume that leadership should be from example, not necessarily from authority. While I agree with their assumptions, the average Christian today - and the average leader - does not agree with these assumptions. Therefore, their arguments fall apart.For example, the arguments claim that these practices did not arise from Scripture but from culture. Most people will agree with this claim. However, where people disagree is the statement by the authors that these practices negatively affect the church. Why do they disagree? Because they disagree with the authors' assumptions, not with the authors historical analysis. As the authors themselves state, not everything that arises from culture is bad and not everything negatively affects the church. Therefore, they cannot simply demonstrate that these practices arise from culture, they must also demonstrate that the practices negatively affect the church. For the most part, this is assumed without analysis.In other words, more work is needed. Why is it important for many believers to exercise their spiritual gifts when the church meets? Why is it important for believers to see their leaders as equals instead of as authoritarian figures? Why is it important for music sang to God to arise from the hearts of the people instead of from professionals? I agree with many of their assumptions, but I do not think most of their readers will agree.I appreciate the work that Viola and Barna have put into this book. The historical analysis alone is worth the price of the book. I hope more people read this book and decide to study these practices in more detail. I hope more people ask the questions that I've asked above. I think that the church will be stronger if we recognize that these practices are not necessary, and instead they sometimes distract believers from how they should live with one another."},{"Title":"Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices","review":"Not sure why but I expected more from this.I was already aware of most of what the authors had to say on the Pagan origins of many Christian machinations, and sadly the authors ignored or overlooked MANY Cult of Mithras origined practises.Also, this was written from a decidedly Christian slant, and for some reason that irritated me.

This is the second one I picked. It is an excellent resource by the best teacher of death and dying."},{"Title":"Questions and Answers on Death and Dying","review":"Questions & Answers on Death and Dying is an extremely helpful resource to those who are bereaved or are on the cusp of being so. It is also a good introductory book, as was its predecessor-On Death and Dying-to the area of counseling psychology, specifically thanatology, the study of death and dying, for there are many issues in the dying process that are addressed: nonverbal symbolic language, prolongation of life, sudden death, suicide and terminal illness, fear, faith and hope to old age and just plain coping. Encompassed in the very latter, coping-wise, is not simply the patient and family but also the medical staff. The dynamics of dying have a process and to witness a loved one going through that process is obviously painful; it is the agonizing but inevitable hurt that no one wants to go through. But it can and will make the living stronger. This work in particular is helpful in many respects, because it is not necessarily a \\"how-to\\" guide on how to grieve or cope; it simply tries to answer the most fundamental and frequently asked questions that people have in respects to death and dying, i.e. emotional and physical pain, loneliness, anger against God and healthy people and finding some caliber of meaningfulness in their life while simultaneously being in the throes of the dying process. The questions asked are sincere, moving and eloquent. The dam of curiosity is opened, and Elizabeth Kubler-Ross eloquently answers all questions, even ones we would not even think of asking. Her insightful and kindhearted responses go to the core of what we're all essentially curious about; she herself admits that in doing this work, it has created a religious belief system that she believed was nonexistent, as one question illustrates: \\"In all your research on death, what is your personal belief of what happens after death?\\" \\"Before I started working with dying patients, I did not believe in a life after death. I now do believe in a life after death, beyond a shadow of a doubt.\\" What is so nice about this book is that it is a gap filler to the first book. What Elizabeth Kubler-Ross started with in On Death and Dying, the general public-the living and the dying (by their questions)-completed with Questions & Answers on Death and Dying; it went full circle, and it reads as such. This is a valuable work to have.

One learns that many times patients disclose what is on their minds thru a small talk, drawings or occupational therapy. Even bed ridden and seemingly unconscious patients do communicate non-verbally and appreciate small kindness such as talking to them, reading to them, providing them with comfort such as warm cloth bath, warmth, combing their hair. This is a very sensitive book. Although some of the questions are repetitive, I find them to gently re-enforce basic teaching that Dr. Kubler-Ross was trying to convey to both medical staff and general public.

In 1896, Grove wrote \\"Beethoven and his Nine Symphonies\\" which, unlike the \\"Dictionary\\" is still read today in the form in which Grove wrote it. I have recently returned to Grove's study as a guide in listening to and reviewing the Beethoven symphonies in the recordings by David Zinman and the Tonhalle Orchester Zurich and have learned a great deal.Grove's book is written in an accessible late-Victorian style. He devotes a chapter to each of the nine symphonies. He begins with a summary of the instrumentation, publication history and early metronome marks of the symphonies. Grove offers material on Beethoven's life at the time each symphony was composed and describes Beethoven's compositional process. He offers information on early performances and on the reception of each work, including a great deal of commentary from the works of later composers.But the highlight of the study is Grove's movement-by-movement analysis of each symphony. It is a difficult skill to write about music in a way that amateurs may follow; and Grove succeeds admirably. He gives the score for the principal themes and highlights of each movement and discusses them in a way that anyone with a basic skill in reading music can follow easily. I used Grove many years ago when I was just coming to the Beethoven symphonies, and I continue to learn from his book. Much of what Grove says is still current in studies of the symphonies. For example, in discussing the Seventh Symphony, Grove aptly describes it as the most romantic of the nine, and he points out how the rhythm of the symphony may be scanned in terms of the meters and \\"feet\\" of poetry. Maynard Solomon has made the same points in detail in his essay on the Seventh Symphony in his recent book \\"Late Beethoven\\".In addition to the musical analyses, Grove writes with great passion about Beethoven and his work. His study is replete with allusions to the works and writings of other composers that illuminate his analysis of Beethoven. He also gives a great deal of biography, some of which must be used with caution as Grove relied on the biographical writings of Anton Schindler about Beethoven. Schindler has been discredited as as source by modern scholars. Grove has a partiality for large-scale romantic performances of Beethoven, and I don't think he would have been overly impressed with the modern Zinman performances that I just heard and greatly enjoyed. For example, his book is full of strictures against performing Beethoven too fast.Grove clearly shares the prevailing Nineteenth Century view that Beethoven was the greatest of all composers in the depth, variety, structure, and moods of his symphonies. Grove's enthusiasm and love for his subject is eloquent. He concludes his book as follows:\\"These great works he did as no one ever did, and probably no one ever will.... Music will advance in richness, scope, and difficulty; but such music as Beethoven's great instrumental works, in which thought, emotion, melody, and romance combine with extraordinary judgment and common sense, and a truly wonderful industry, to make a perfect whole, can hardly any more be written. The time for such an event, such a concurrence of the man and the circumstances, will not again arrive. There can never be a second Beethoven or a second Shakespeare. However much orchestras may improve and execution increase, Beethoven's Symphonies will always remain at the head of music as Shakespeare's plays are at the head of the literature of the modern world.\\"Some readers in the early 21st Century may question Grove's adulation of Beethoven. Be that as it may, Beethoven's symphonies have remained an inspiration to an untold number of listeners, including myself, and will almost certainly remain so. Grove's book remains highly valuable for those wanting to explore in detail the richness of the Beethoven symphonies.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"The Christian Counselor's New Testament","review":"Dr. Jay E.

But for the rest of us who prefer to not be herded like senseless sheep this book is definitely worth taking a look at,,, while you still can, that is."},{"Title":"The Tenth Man","review":"One of Greene's \\"entertainments,\\" this short novel written in 1944 was hidden away for nearly forty years before being discovered in the MGM files. Written as the idea for a film, the novella is a fine example of Greene's style, as finished and polished as any of his more complex novels.Set in France during the war, the story concerns a group of thirty Frenchmen imprisoned by their German occupiers and then told that they must decide for themselves which three of the thirty men will be executed. One of the men who draws a marked ballot for his own death is a wealthy lawyer with considerable property who offers his entire fortune to any man who will take his place. One young man accepts, drawing up legal papers which give his newly acquired property to his sister and mother before he is executed.The remaining three parts of the novel deal with the return of the now-penniless former owner to \\"his\\" house after the war, where he meets the dead man's sister and works as a servant under a new name; the arrival of an imposter who claims to be the former owner; and the showdown between the former owner and the imposter.As is always the case with Greene, the dialogue is taut, revealing character and plot simultaneously, with no extraneous chat. The main character, like so many others Greene depicts, is a weak man whose bad choices, in this case his decision to buy his own life, have led to the complications which become the story. Living a lie, Chavel/Charlot faces a crisis of morality in which he must decide what, if anything, he can do to redeem himself to atone for the life-or-death decision he forced upon another man. The imposter who arrives at the house claiming to be the former owner is described as resembling a devil, and the showdown between him and the real former owner is seen as the struggle between goodness and evil.Filled with ironies and absurdities, the novel maintains considerable suspense until the dramatic, tour de force of an ending. Too short to allow for much character development, the novella conveys a strong message within an exciting little morality tale filled with sharply observed details--simple without being simplistic. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"The Tenth Man","review":"Greene's writing is phenomenal. He has few words, and packs in oceans of meaning. I've read other authors who publish some 10 books in one series and are still writing- and nothing happens for entire books. This is the opposite type of writing. This is the kind of book that forces you to put the book down after a chapter to contemplate what your life is like and where it is going. And each chapter runs about 3 pages long. I will be dwelling on the final page, the final paragraph, for a long time.Greene knows life. He has a depth of wisdom that he brings in to the characters that goes beyond the simple ethical dilemma of whether or not it is permissable to purchase one's life at the expense of another. Sometimes, dying for another is the easy part. It is the dying every day that is far more difficult. Less glorious, less noticed, but far more eternal."},{"Title":"The Tenth Man","review":"This short &quot;entertainment&quot; lacks the intensity of a major novel, but the tightly constructed plot makes this book worth the read. Graham Greene combines his fantastic prose with a few fantastic twists. What whould happen if you could trade all of your possesions for a second chance at life? Greene takes a stab at this very intiguing question, and throws in enough curveballs to keep you guessing until the end.True, the characters may be flat, but the story is vivid, creative, and well worth a look."},{"Title":"The Tenth Man","review":"Greene presents us with a brilliant morality tale. He quickly sets up his protagonist's choice and then moves to the surprising consequences. If you had the means to buy your 'salvation' would you? Even if it meant that another man would have to die in your place...literally paying someone to die for you? And for the man who is willing to take your offer, what does his sacrifice mean for those he's left behind? Greene deftly entertwines both of these stories into one. I agree that the characters are not well-drawn enough to make us truly care for them. However, the book succeeds on how it makes you consider the consequences of one's choices."},{"Title":"The Tenth Man","review":"Graham Greene has always struck me as an author who took little joy in writing. His short stories are very short, and some of his novels tread the fine line between novel and novella. But what he puts into those brief pages are stunning, and definitely leaves you yearning for more.THE TENTH MAN is probably the one that best exemplifies this feeling. The novel ended so quickly (for me) that I was angry it was over. Not because I felt cheated, but because he had me so taken in by the plot and the tensions created by the choices the characters made, that I wanted it to go on, even just a little longer. But by all means, pick up THE TENTH MAN and just about anything else by Graham Greene."},{"Title":"The Tenth Man","review":"This little story is tightly constructed and gripping. A rich lawyer is incarcerated during the war with a bunch of ordinary joes. As a result of hostage-type negotiations, a set number of them are designated for random executions. The prisoners draw lots to determine those to die, and the lawyer is one of the losers. Desperate to live, he offers all his estate to anyone who will trade places. The man who drew the 10th lot takes him up on the offer, accepts the estate as payment for his life, and has the lawyer make out a will leaving the wealth to his family. The guilt over this &quot;act of cowardice&quot; haunts the lawyer to his grave.This story is hard to put down and gracefully written, but the characters are relatively flat, 2-dimensional figures. They are useful symbolically, but not terribly convincing as real people. All in all the tale reads more like a parable than a novel."},{"Title":"The Tenth Man","review":"\\"The Tenth Man,\\" is a bleak suspenseful thriller, a crime drama of a novel, and a puzzling anomaly in the writing career of distinguished British author Graham Greene. For years, I couldn't figure it out. It is only 156 pages, really novella length, yet it has his usual power, though it lacks the accreted detail I've gotten used to in his work. Still, it gives us an excellent picture of wartime, occupied France, and the people who had to live there; the city of Paris, and the countryside at the time. Greene's characters, as ever, are sharply drawn, and ring true to their natures.It is set in 1944, in a Gestapo prison in occupied France, during World War II, where 32 Frenchmen have been taken hostage. Local resistance activity causes the Germans to decide that one of every ten men - three men--must therefore meet their deaths by firing squad, but they don't care which three men. The hostages draw lots. Jean Louis Chevel, a lawyer and a rich man, gets one of the marked ballots; he offers his entire fortune, and all his holdings, to the heirs of any man who will take his place, and a sickly young man Michel Mangeot, known as \\"Janvier,\\" agrees. As the Germans are driven out of France in 1944--Paris was liberated on August 25, 1944, and the war ends for the French, the hostages are released, and Chevel, not knowing what else to do, finds his way to his hereditary estate in the country. There, under an assumed name, he finds Janvier's mother and sister installed, and becomes their unpaid handyman. He falls a little in love with the sister, but realizes that mother and sister hate \\"Chevel\\" for taking Janvier's life. Then, suddenly, another man shows up, claiming to be Chevel. It is a bleak tale, as noted above, much briefer and less detailed than the author's usual work, although, in this latest crisis in his life, Chevel may be considered at least to have rediscovered his humanity and his courage.The author, it turns out, amazingly enough, wrote the novella in 1944, well before VE Day, Victory in Europe Day, May 8, 1945. He wrote it as a film treatment for the Hollywood film studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, where he was under contract, along with a couple of other treatments, one of which is very clearly the germ of his remarkable novel Our Man In Havana. At any rate, both Greene and the studio forgot about the existence of these treatments and they lay in the MGM archives until 1983, when someone found them and decided to publish at least THE TENTH MAN. Greene could barely remember writing the treatment, and thought it was only a few pages: he was mightily surprised to discover it was more than 150; and, as it was determined it was to be published, he worked on cleaning it up a bit. It was published in 1985. Then, as happened with many, if not most of his works, it was filmed, under the same title,The Tenth Man, as a 1988 television episode for the American show, \\"Hallmark Hall of Fame.\\" And it got the all-star treatment: Anthony Hopkins (The Hannibal Lecter Collection (Manhunter / The Silence of the Lambs / Hannibal)) played Chavel; Kristin Scott Thomas (Four Weddings and a Funeral) played Therese Mangeot, Janvier's sister. Derek Jacobi (I, Claudius) played the imposter Chevel; Cyril Cusack (My Left Foot) played the priest. I caught this movie once on late-night TV, and, as noted above, wondered about it for years.Greene (1904-1991), who was one of the more illustrious British writers of the 20th century, enjoyed a very long life, and a very long, distinguished, prolific writing career. Some of his writing highlights areThe Power and the Glory,The End Of The Affair, andThe Third Man. Many of his books were bestsellers; many were made into movies. He was one of the better-known Catholic converts of his time; many of his thrillers, as this one, deal with Catholic themes of guilt and redemption. He created morally complex characters, while he explored moral and theological dilemmas through psychologically astute character studies, presented in exciting dramas on the international stage."},{"Title":"The Tenth Man","review":"Although short in length, Greene delivers a profound novel in \\"The Tenth Man.\\" The premise is a lawyer who cowardly buys his life as a German POW during World War II. The man who is executed in his place, Janvier, is bequeathed all the possessions of the lawyer (Chavel). Then, the trials and tribulations of Chavel takes center stage as he returns to a postwar world as a penniless beggar who cannot reveal his real identity.Perhaps the most profound concept is that of the disgraced Chavel and his attempts to win back his place in the world. He goes back to the country manor he gave up and now disguises himself as a beggar, but one who was with Chavel and Janvier in the German prisoner. Janvier's sister, as the new owner of his house and soon a fantasy object of his love, accepts his new identity. Yet, all the time Chavel is living life on borrowed time, as he is fearful he will be found out. Indeed, his new life is one of a tortured existence. It is more than once that he regrets that he did not die as he should have in the dank German prison.Throughout the novel, Chavel's attempts at retribution are shown. Although one can sympathize with Chavel's predicament, Greene nevertheless presents him in a less than desirable light. It's difficult to know what one might do in a similar situation. Yet, somehow saving your own life at all costs seems cowardly. Overall, this is a quick read but one which will leave many questions to ponder."},{"Title":"The Tenth Man","review":"What if you were suddenly rendered jobless, destitute, and homeless? What if you were presented the choice either to live or to trade your own life in exchange for the security and well-being of those you care for? What if you knew that tomorrow's sunrise would be your last? In his novel The Tenth Man author Graham Greene presents these questions, and the story's characters offer a chorus of varying responses.The Tenth Man opens in a Nazi prisoner camp located in occupied France during the waning days of World War II. The prisoners are informed of a decimation order to be carried out by their captors at daybreak and they draw lots to determine who among them will face the firing squad. When the main character, a wealthy lawyer named Chavel, draws one of the fateful lots, he offers his estate to any man who will face execution in his stead. Another inmate, nicknamed Janvier, accepts the offer, immediately willing his newfound wealth to his sister and mother to secure their future. So begins a story of atrocities, deceit, murder, sacrifice, love and redemption. Above all, it is a tale of desperation divided by the author into four discrete parts, each of which spirals the plot's desperate stakes ever higher. Set during the greatest conflict of the Twentieth Century and the uncertain days immediately following, The Tenth Man tells of the extreme measures individuals resort to as time runs out and their worlds collide with others in equally desperate circumstances.Part I takes place entirely in the prisoner-of-war camp where Janvier and Chavel make a life-for-death pact that sets the conflict on course toward its crescendo later in the story. Having lived a wealthy but lonely existence, Chavel is described as \\"a man who has carried nothing over from his past to buttress him in the tragic present\\" (p. 33). Janvier (\\"January\\" in French) is severely ailing and his moniker implies something \\"young, undeveloped, and nipped by the frost\\" (p. 36), apparently a reference that Janvier's life may be prematurely shortened by sickness, as evidenced by a severe cough and \\"bony hands\\" (pp. 36-37). His own time expiring, Janvier agrees to assume the place of the condemned tenth man in exchange for the lawyer's estate, which he intends to bequeath to his sister and mother. From inescapable and impending death to self-preservation, desperate motives drive each man in the prison, and afterward Chavel is left to bear the moral consequences of his panicked bid for life.Like many at the time, Chavel remains in desperate straits after France is liberated from the German occupation. Having survived interment, he has nothing now but the clothes he wears and a nagging conscience. In Part 2 he is unable to find work or sustenance, both of which are on short supply on the streets of post-war Paris. His new monetary and moral desperation drives Chavele to the very estate house where he once lived, but which now belongs to Janvier's sister, Th&eacute;r&egrave;se. Hiding his true identity, the starving and tattered Chavele successfully negotiates employment with her as a servant in the house where he once lived. This ironic circumstance creates an element of deepening suspense and sets the stage for dramatic and unavoidable conflict.Greene thickens the plot through the theme of desperation in Part 3 when an accomplished actor named Carosse brings his own desperate baggage to the doorstep of Th&eacute;r&egrave;se's (formerly Chavel's) house. Wanted for collaborating with the Nazis and on the lamb for a recent murder, Carosse convincingly assumes another's identity and insinuates himself into Th&eacute;r&egrave;se's confidence. Not unlike Chavel, Carosse is a desperate man forced to conceal his true identity in order to survive. Sought by the authorities and the victorious French Resistance, his celebrity is now a detriment and his life is essentially forfeit. Unable to find food or refuge elsewhere, Carosse relies on his brilliant acting skills to manipulate Th&eacute;r&egrave;se to gain \\"even a day's shelter\\" (p. 136). Carosse's appearance adds an unexpected dimension of deceit to the dynamic in the household, compounding and intensifying the growing conflict.Throughout the story Greene persistently reminds the reader that time does not suffer mortals, especially the desperate ones. From the coveted pocket watch and alarm clock, which are central to the prisoners' daily routine in Part I, to \\"the ugly church clock\\" (p. 141) in Chavel's home village in Part IV, the reader is reminded throughout that time is a precious commodity that only compounds desperation. As time runs out on Chavel, he arrives at \\"the hour when one sees clearly\\" (p. 141) and an chance at redemption. The conflict reaches climax in Part IV as Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, Carosse, and Chavel vie for resolution of their respective dilemmas: the former driven by revenge for her brother's death, the second by the primal instinct to survive, and the latter by ever-evolving motivations.To fully enjoy The Tenth Man, the reader must accept that many similarly improbable episodes actually played out during the chaos of the post-WWII era. Otherwise, the incredible coincidences that steer the plot could detract from an enjoyable experience. Chavel's metamorphosis from a self-centered man of wealth and privilege to a lowly servant capable of self-sacrifice represents the spectrum of human response to desperation, from the apprehensible to the admirable. It is desperation that builds the plot through each of the story's successive four parts until the spectacular and unexpected resolution. Graham Greene's The Tenth Man is a riveting study in desperation and the various human traits it can evoke. It is a quick read, but its message of moral evolution and resilience will stay with the reader for a long time."},{"Title":"The Tenth Man","review":"Graham Greene is a master of plot, and each story is unique and intriguing in its own way. The Tenth Man is a short, but exceptional story about a rich man placed in a situation where he offers to pay another man to die in his place. The beginning of the story is interesting in itself, but even more interesting is seeing what unfolds as the survivor faces the consequences of his actions, his new life, and his guilt. This is a thought-provoking story that will hold you captive until the end. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Tenth Man","review":"The beginning of the story is quite dull, but after a while you can't stop reading. The story is also written in an easy language, so you can easily read it as a non-native speaker.The end is not very satisfying and the characters are flat, but that doesn't really matter because of the action in the book, I was never bored."},{"Title":"The Tenth Man","review":"A short, sweet tale of a man, whose financial status gives him the ability to save himself when faced with a life or death situation. Circumstances once again prove that money, a timeless denominator, continues to offer the rich unusual buying power.While the story is short and doesn't offer a rich sense of character development, I still found myself extremely curious as to what would happen next. The moral decisions we make, whether hasty or well thought out, keep the human species an interesting animal to watch. I enjoyed the originality of the book, the desperate search for survival by the rich and the moral integrity of the poor. Definitely worth the time spent on a rainy afternoon."},{"Title":"The Tenth Man","review":"According to the introduction, Graham Greene wrote this novella in 1944 and then quite remarkably completely forgot about its existence until it was brought to his attention nearly 4 decades later. The third person narrative tells the bizarre tale of Jean-Louis Chavel, a wealthy French lawyer selected by lot to die in front of a German firing squad. Chavel manages to circumvent Fate by getting another man to take the fatal bullet for him. In return, he signs over everything he owns; 300,000 francs, his ancestral estate and all its contents, to the other man, a sickly Parisian nicknamed Janvier. Janvier immediately wills everything to the only family he has, his sister and mother.Fast forward to the end of the German occupation. A destitute Chavel, now a tormented caricature of his former self, visits the Chavel estate and, without confessing his true identity, stays on as a servant of sorts.The Tenth Man is more of an allegorical tale than it is a work of fiction awash with realism. Think of it as a fatalistic fairy tale for adults. Having cheated death by firing squad, Chavel finds his life no longer worth living. He can accept the loss of wealth and stature but the unremitting guilt over what he has done leads inexorably to his own destruction.A cogent work, full of pithy observations about human nature, the Church and destiny's heavy hand. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Tenth Man","review":"This is a minor work, an idea for a film expanded to novella length, and it lacks the depth of Greene's major books. But it is the work of a master all the same, and raises fascinating questions about the role of those elements other than narrative that make the difference between a story and a novel.Greene pitched the underlying idea for THE TENTH MAN to a film producer in 1937. His fuller treatment of it was not written until after the War, but the manuscript dropped out of sight and was not published until it was rediscovered in the mid-1980s. The author explains these circumstances in a preface, and also includes two very short film treatments written in the same postwar years. The first of these, \\"Jim Braddon and the War Criminal,\\" concerns an American businessman who happens to bear a close resemblance to a former Nazi official; losing his memory after a plane crash, he comes to believe that he IS the wanted German. The story is quite melodramatic and not filled out in any detail, but it contains the essence of the central moral question of Greene's greatest works: is a man to be judged by what he has done, however horrible, or by his spiritual state at the time of his death? The second story, \\"Nobody to Blame,\\" is essentially a sketch forOUR MAN IN HAVANA, though trasferred to an imaginary Baltic state in the late 1930s. Although much longer than the first treatment, it details only the farcial mechanisms of the story, without any reality of setting or depth of character, and absolutely omitting the moral dimension; reading it makes one look again at OUR MAN IN HAVANA with enhanced appreciation.Greene describes his first idea for THE TENTH MAN thus: \\"A political situation like that in Spain. A decimation order. Ten men in prison draw lots with matches. A rich man draws the longest match. Offers all his money to anyone who will take his place. One, for the sake of his family, agrees. Later, when he is released, the former rich man visits anonymously the family who possess his money, he himself now with nothing but his life...\\". Even here, the moral core is clear: redemption for a previous act of cowardice through later generosity or suffering. What it needs to become a true novel is the creation of fully-rounded characters, the establishment of a social and political setting, and above all a sense of time, so that the rich man's transformation will be credible and the moral issues resonate. And indeed in the middle of the novella, when the man returns anonymously to his former house, Greene does provide most of these things, especially in capturing the peculiar political situation in France just after liberation, when strangers of any sort were suspected as collaborators. He also adds one magnificent plot twist, which I cannot reveal here. But the opening of the book seems almost schematic, somehow failing to give depth or immediacy to the hostages in the German prison. And although Greene tackles the moral issues quite explicitly at the end of the book, they seem laid out rather than lived through. The problem, I think, is his compression of time, to bring the action to a climax in a matter of weeks, days, or hours; this might work well in a movie, but in a novel it seems a weakness."},{"Title":"The Tenth Man","review":"I needed book for class.

I read it about twelve times in a month ."},{"Title":"The Tenth Man","review":"An early effort by master writer Graham Greene, The Tenth Man is a startlingly honest story adorned with psychological depth, emotional tension, and compassionate humanism. Beginning in a prison camp, three men of thirty draw lots to determine who must die. One of the men selected, a lawyer, then trades his own death lot to another in exchange for great wealth and property. The one who dies then gives his acquired wealth to his family.The story progresses to reveal a sister filled with hate at the man who lived and caused her brother to die. Her naivety is charming as is her warm heart that cannot sustain the hate she demands of herself. The once wealthy lawyer returns to his place of residence, masking his identity, and proceeds to work as a servant. In his humility and shame he finds love, sensitivity, and mostly courage to seek out an opportunity to sacrifice himself for others. The events of the story move rapidly, with the impetus for the dramatic conclusion being caused by greed and evil.Sentences such as \\"If one had possessed a God's-eye view of France, one would have detected a constant movement of tiny grains moving like dust across a floor shaped like a map,\\" are wonderfully descriptive and cause the reader to see the events in a global imagery. Other expressions like, \\"When it happens you know what you've been all your life,\\" are momentous and create a powerful sense of human depth that drives the book from beginning to end. Greene's prose and characterizations are intelligent, perceptive, rich, and meaningful without becoming contrived or shallow.Many books are page-turners, causing a reader to rush quickly to the end. The Tenth Man, however, is a page-reflector, forcing the reader to enjoy the journey and the pathway toward the conclusion. A gripping read, The Tenth Man is highly recommended for its content, historical perspective, and mostly its demonstration of the forces of good and evil that reside in everyone.

(His novels, while well received, weren't earning him much.) One of his ideas, based on a true incident of the Spanish Civil War, involved a group of French hostages being held by the Germans as guarantors for the good behavior of the civilian population. When a couple of soldiers are shot, the hostages are informed that one-tenth of them will be shot in reprisal -- a decimation. In one hut, there are thirty prisoners, so they draw lots to see which three of them will be executed. One of the randomly chosen three is a lawyer, a man of considerable inherited wealth, who doesn't fit in with the laborers and clerks who make up the rest of the group, and he doesn't see why he should be the one to die. He offers to give everything he has to any of the others who will take his place, and is taken up on it by a young man -- Janvier -- who wants to provide for his mother and sister (figuring they're all going to die anyway, if not now then tomorrow or next month). And so it happens. Now it's four years later. Chavel, the lawyer, who now has nothing -- except his life -- has managed to survive the occupation, and after trying unsuccessfully to land a job somewhere he finds himself drawn to the house in the country, his ex-home, where Janvier's mother and sister now live. He gives them a false name, tells them he knew Janvier, and does odd jobs for a few days. Then he's is invited to stay on and finds himself becoming emotionally involved with the sister. Then another man appears, claiming to be Chavel. You can see where all this is going, right? It's melodrama, certainly, but the set-up is almost Shakespearean tragedy. The interesting thing is, Greene had forgotten all about this story, even when he later was doing The Third Man, and it sat in MGM's vaults for several decades until they stumbled across it, pulled it out, and offered it to sale. Greene cut a deal with the purchaser the write the present book -- which is actually more of a novella, being only 120 pages or so. Not a great book, but there's some good stuff here.

As a novella it is a masterpiece.This is the first book that I read from Greene, and I was very impressed with his style, the structure, the prose, and the overall thrust of the book and his writing in general.In this present novella, he presents a two part story of a man who makes a bargain in jail to save his life. It is set during World War II. The story takes place near Paris and then in rural France. The man trades his home and his money for his life. The first part takes place in jail, and the second part is after he is released from jail. From the jail and the bargain to trade money for his life, the story advances in time to the post-war period and we see how the now penniless man copes with his new situation and how he deals with the people that he knew before the war, and the people that now live in his old house.There is a certain level of depression and desperation transmitted by Greene through his writings so that we have empathy and sympathy with the man who has lost all of his material wealth. Through the loss, he manages to maintain his moral integrity. There is a high level of drama and a surprise ending.This is an excellent novella and a good introduction to Green."},{"Title":"The Tenth Man","review":"Graham Greene is one of my favorite writers. In such novels as THE HEART OF THE MATTER, OUR MAN IN HAVANA, THE HUMAN FACTOR, THE HONORARY COUNSUL and THE POWER AND THE GLORY, he presents ordinary men whose lives unexpectedly acquire a profound moral dimension or political significance. While questionable motivation--that is, navet&eacute;, loneliness, or self-hatred--often impels his characters to act, Greene's plots also force the unforgettable Henry Scobie, Jim Wormold, Maurice Castle, Dr. Plarr, and the whiskey priest to make a choice. Then, they are on paths without return and with, at best, ironic reward.In THE TENTH MAN, Greene gives us Jean-Louis Chavel, a lawyer in a Gestapo prison who, according to my dust jacket, \\"offers his fortune and house to anyone who will take his place before a firing squad.\\" Then Greene follows \\"this survivor on his postwar return to the home he has surrendered.\\"As is usual with Greene's novels, there are several memorable and fully achieved characters--in this case, Chavel, Carosse, and Therese Mangeot--who bump against the limits of their principles or the shallowness of their illusions. As usual, the story is told in a spare style and has layers of conflict and believable emotion, which Greene explores to reveal amazing connections and parallels between dissimilar characters.As the book jacket says: Watch Chavel...\\"discover the humanity and courage that [earlier] failed him.\\" Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"People\`s Witness: The Journalist in Modern Politics","review":"This book examines the role of journalism in shaping our picture of life in the twentieth century, particularly in terms of political events, and by extension, armed conflicts. Inglis chooses a number of exemplary life-stories, sketching them with his customary flair and economy, before using them to highlight the values that each biography teaches us. The journalists are (for the most part) the heroes and heroines, whilst the newspaper and media owners are a more ambiguous lot, and this depiction is surely as it should be. Journalists like Bill Shirer told the truth of what they saw often despite, rather than thanks to, their employers.A few minor grumbles : Izzy Stone's account of the Wake Island meeting between MacArthur and Truman (15th October 1950) is, as Inglis rightly points out, inferential, but he still repeats it verbatim. The significance of the timing (3 weeks before the mid-term Congressionals) is ignored : part of Truman's reason for making the journey to Wake Island would surely have been to associate himself publicly with his leading field commander at a time when the Korea conflict was going very well for the United Nations forces. MacArthur was a complex character, arrogant, yes, but as America's greatest 20th century general, not without some justification, but certainly not the madman described here. I'm not sure that Ceausecu's execution necessarily fitted his crimes : if we executed every politician who allowed himself to be overthrown, the list of candidates would be a long one. Lastly, I'm not sure why the wartime BBC newsreader Bruce Belfrage (pages 171 & 174) is referred to as Cedric : he always gave his name on radio as Bruce.However, these are minor quibbles. This book is a splendid portrayal of a world in which the written and spoken word have been replaced gradually by TV and the immediacy of live coverage. However, that gain has been at the expense of the descriptive power of language itself."},{"Title":"The McCormick Spices of the World Cookbook","review":"Great Purchase for a birthday present - this book represents special memories of Dad's (Grandpas) cooking.

As college students, they rebelled against the old order, and came upon a band that seemed to bring with it something entirely new - The Beatles.They all became friends, so much so that Astrid got engaged to Stu Sutcliffe and took the first professional photos of the band, and Klaus would later design the covers for the Beatles' albums \\"Revolver\\" and \\"Anthology\\" as well as play bass on albums of Ringo, George, and John, after the Beatles' breakup.This two-volume set is absolutely gorgeous. The first volume, besides photographs and documents, goes into the story of what kind of state Germany was in after the war, and why it was that the Beatles' type of music attracted many young people to it, as well as telling how the band came to get there, and what kind of conditions these very young men were willing to put up with in order to pursue their passion of music. Most of the text is by Voormann, but George Harrison and Paul McCartney also wrote short pieces to go into this book.The second volume is a collection of art pertaining to the Beatles done by Voormann. I saw Voormann and some of these pictures at Beatlefest 2001 in Chicago, and these are interesting too, as something that belongs in part of this collection.The main problem with this book is that it is a prohibitively expensive limited edition. However, it is a perspective of the era and the Beatles that is carefully done by people who have known the Beatles since this time, and were qualified in putting a project like this together."},{"Title":"Hamburg Days","review":"This is the kind of thing Beatle fans, Harrison and McCartney fans in particular would love to own. Each Beatle has admitted that he cut his musical teeth performing in Hamburg Germany. It was in this training ground that the Fabs learned to come together as a band.Beatle friends, Astrid Kirchherr and Klaus Voormann were viewed as part of an esoteric intellectual group called \\"Exis\\" (for existentialists.) In 1960, they were students who befriended the Beatles and watched them develop musically in the rough German venues where they played. As post WWII young adults, they rebelled against traditional order and found that rebellious experience in the Beatles.Astrid later married Stu Sutcliff, who died from a brain hemorrhage in 1962. She took the first publicity pictures of the future Fabs; gave them their famous fringed Beatle coiffure; Klaus, an artist drew pictures of the boys throughout their career including the wonderful 1966 \\"Revolver\\" album cover. They are important parts of Beatle history.This is a 2-volume treasure chest and Beatle pirates will love it. Volume 1 provides an overview of Germany and German history in the aftermath of WWII; the pictures are nothing short of spectacular. The times were the ideal breeding grounds for rebellion and dissension to flourish; the Beatles, with their different, distinctive sounds and the dues they were willing to pay to move forward musically is well chronicled in this book.Klaus Voorman provided much of the text, but Beatles George Harrison and Paul McCartney contributed as well. That makes a good thing even better.Volume 2 is power packed with Klaus Voorman's Beatle drawings. A talented artist, Voorman has created the cover for the Beatles' \\"Anthology\\" album as well as the famous 1966 \\"Revolver\\" cover. I had the pleasure of reading this at the 2002 and 2003 Fests for Beatle Fans in Chicago and the 2002 Fest in Boston. Sadly, this book is prohibitively expensive and to date, I do not own it for this reason.What makes this book so special and distinct is that it is the work of those who were there from the inception of the Beatles to their meteoric rise to fame. My two favorite Beatles (the Messrs. Harrison & McCartney) have added their voices to it as well, which makes this book even more desirable.Still, this is a serious book that should be affordable to all who really want it. The high price tag has made it an unreachable brass ring to many fans who would really love to have it. This book covers an era beautifully and portrays a time when the Beatles and their then new musical style would flourish."},{"Title":"Hamburg Days","review":"250.00 bucks!?!? get real, IT IS DEFINATELY something beatles fans would want, but do they think were millionaires?

Written for public consumption during the debate over adoption of the U.S. Constitution, it combined immense learning and sophistication with shrewd insights into the nature of politics in a republic. It's an essential text for anyone interested in American political history or constitutional theory. In fact, the Federalist should be essential readingt for any educated American: it remains an unparalleled example of realistic political analysis being placed in the service of political ideals.After more than 200 years, the Federalist has lost little of its relevance. The sections on judicial review and Presidential nominations, for example, could have been written about current controversies over judges. Likewise, the discussion of Presidential war powers, or the emphasis on checks and balances as essential to the preservation of liberty, are eerily topical in an age of pre-emptive war and one-party control of Washington. Even when the analysis is wildly dated -- as with the Commerce Clause or slavery -- the reader can see how far Constitutional doctrine has wandered from the \\"intent\\" of the Founders.The Federalist is also superb as literature: the writing is droll and eloquent, once you get used to the long, convoluted sentences. The introduction by Benjamin Wright is excellent and helps to place the text in political and intellectual context. I don't know why I wasn't forced to read the Federalist at law school! Six stars.Note: Contrary to one review below, God is hardly mentioned in the Federalist, and then only as a rhetorical flourish. The Federalist has countless references to ancient Greece and Rome, but none to the Old or New Testaments. It is a thoroughly secular document. Religious nationalists and other conservatives should actually read it."},{"Title":"The Federalist: A Commentary on the Constitution of the United States (Modern Library Classics)","review":"Each essay is highlighted by a description of the reason for the publishing and the target of the work, and the timing of it.."},{"Title":"The Federalist: A Commentary on the Constitution of the United States (Modern Library Classics)","review":"This is an excellent book.

For an example of this nonsense, please see the first review on this page.I want to offer a vision of The Federalist in historical context. I will argue that to see it thus enlarges its greatness will allowing us to admit its faults.In many ways, the developments that led to the Constitution of 1787 started as soon as colonists reached our eastern shores. We had at least 150 years of experimentation in writing charters and in representative governance behind us by 1787. After the Declaration of Independence the States either wrote new constitutions or reaffirmed old charters. The national government wrote the Articles of Confederation and we lived under that from 1781 to the late 1780s.The Federalist should be seen as part of that ongoing development. More specifically, it should be seen as part of the ratification debates in New York. Largely written by Madison and Hamilton, these papers reflect the compromises that the founders made in regards to the Constitution. Madison had wanted the President to have a veto over any state laws. Hamilton had favored a President for life during good behavior (read #78 in re the appointment for life of federal judges to sense the fervor that Hamilton felt for the benefits of lifetime tenure). Neither man believed in the necessity of a Bill of Rights. Madison eventually saw the political necessity of such amendments. During the first United States Congress he wrote up the Bill of Rights and guided them through passage. This way he could make sure they did not grow too numerous.As a whole then The Federalist should be seen as rhetorical and political arguments for passage of a Constitution that the authors had some doubts about.Of course, as Publius they could express no doubts. Madison, Hamiltion and Jay used this pseudonym which was a typical rhetorical device of elite writers at the time. (See Saul Cornell's The Other Founders for a nice discussion of the variety of rhetorical strategies used by writers during the ratification debates.) The idea was that hiding their identities would allow readers to focus on the quality of their arguments. As a result, there are many passages that can strike the modern reader as duplicitous because Publius pretends to know nothing of what went on during the convention. Madison and Hamilton, of course, were instrumental throughout the Constitutional Convention.Publius works his explication of the need for the Constitution by critiquing the Articles of Confederation then by going thru the new document, article by article supposedly answering all objections. His counterarguments are largely of two types. In the first type, he will state a political principle so \\"obvious\\" that any \\"candid\\" reader will instantly agree to it. Publius then builds his arguments from there. The famous paper #10 is one such chain of argument. Or Publius will demolish the arguments offered against the Constitution by pointing out that the article objected to is contained in some or many of the States' constitution and have resulted in no such problems. Many of these arguments are justly famous. Number 10 is very much worth reading. (Although I still find it curious that when Madison asserts that a man's property holdings has a great influence on the way he thinks it is celebrated as political realism but when Marx says much the same thing it is decried as class warfare. But that's just me.)But the reader really does get a sense at to how much thought went into the various checks and balances and the competing claims of the states and the new national government. To me this is where the glory of the book lies. We as a people thought our way out of the failure of our first experiment in nation building. We avoided civil war (for a while) and did not become the victims of foreign manipulation. We don't have to make our founding fathers and mothers demi-gods. In their fully flawed humanity, they dazzle aplenty.Finally, it should be noted that The Federalist as a piece of political rhetoric avoided some issues entirely. The main problem that most Anti-Federalists had with the proposed Constitution in re jury rights had to do with the following phrase: \\"such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed\\" (Article 3, Sec.2, Para. 3). Whig thought at that time insisted on juries being as local as possible. Blackstone stated that jury trials should be held within the county of the crime. This guaranteed that local knowledge of the crime, the defendant and the victim would be maximized in the jury pool. Trying cases in distant jurisdictions or without juries had been some of the main provocations of the British prior to the revolution. Men like Patrick Henry saw that phrase in the Constitution as a clarion of the tyranny to come from the new national government. The Federalist does not speak to this issue at all. Instead, Hamilton focuses on arguments about whether jury trials are guaranteed for civil cases and even has Publius argue that maybe we should limit jury trials a little because juries are so bad with complicated issues, blah, blah.Should all Americans read this book? Yeah, probably. Are we the worse if they don't? Again, probably yes, but what we really need as a people is more of a sense of our history. I would rather have more people read a good series of books on our history as a whole (I recommend the Oxford History of the United States as one excellent ongoing series).But if you want to get to know two great minds at work on political issues that are still relevant then this is your book. Forget Locke, Montesquieu and Rousseau. Their philosophies are antiquarian in a way that Publius is not."},{"Title":"The Federalist: A Commentary on the Constitution of the United States (Modern Library Classics)","review":"Having experienced Cliff's Notes in college years ago, it was what I expected.

With the heart of a pastor, he could take high doctrine and relate it to the lives of the average Christian. At the same time he could go head-to-head with any Biblical scholar. His depth and delivery ministered to those who listened to his teaching, whether in the pulpit at 10th Presbyterian in Philadelphia or on the radio. As a note, his radio program, The Bible Study Hour is still broadcast across the county.The Boice Expository Commentary series was not just written by Boice but it \\"IS\\" James Boice. You can hear him speak through the words of this book and all the books in this series. These commentaries are not academic expositions of scripture but practical expositions with a focus on application. Very pastoral. I love using these commentaries in preparation for teaching small group studies."},{"Title":"The Epistles of John: An Expositional Commentary","review":"This is a well written commentary that is rich with references that feed into the meaning of each verse. The strong emphasis on sovereignty that good Presbyterians typically comes through in Boice's perspective (unique among the commentaries I have read) on why John wrote these letters. Boice skips all the statements by John in the earlier part of the letter where he says 'we write to you because...' and focuses on the last one in chapter 5. Boice says John didn't write for any other reason that to give the Christians assurance of their faith. The exclusive focus on assurance is not found in any other commentary I have read. This is Boice's strength. He brings unique concepts to the table. This is also his weakness. He has a bias towards the distinctive doctrines of Presbyterians. And this commentary clearly shows this bias.Yet even with the bias, this is a commentary that will feed the spirit with rich cuts of prime steaks. He is no slacker when it comes to thinking through the exegetical nuances of a passage. Even if you are not a Presbyterian (and I'm not), you will be blessed by Boice's thoughts. He's provoking and passionate about his faith in his expressions in this commentary.One point that I might note is that on some of his lexical work I was left wanting more. For example, in discussing 'ilasmos' the word often translated propitiation in 1 John 2:1-2, Boice tilts towards a legal definition giving almost a courtroom impression of this term. However, Smalley and others show extensively why this should not be viewed as a legal term in John, and Smalley gives the preferred meaning 'intercessor' or advocate in that sense of the word. So sometimes Boice is brilliant and other times I am left wanting a fuller explanation. This goes to show that it's good to consult more than one commentary, especially on crucial verses like 1 John 2:1-2.If you have thought deeply about the links between John 1:1 and Genesis 1:1..and the differences between the related passages, Boice will tie in to these concepts intelligently and in a way that is easily grasped and convincing. Overall I am very glad to have this particular commentary and highly recommend it to everyone. I use it quite often and it is in my top five commentaries for John's letters."},{"Title":"The Epistles of John: An Expositional Commentary","review":"I have often found commentaries to be long & dry. James Montgomery Boice fills the pages with Bible based truth and insights that are so easy to take away with you. The truths are practical and he makes it clear how they can be applied. I have read a number of his commentaries and look forward to reading others."},{"Title":"The Epistles of John: An Expositional Commentary","review":"This is yet another wonderful, expositional commentary by Dr. Boice. His teaching is direct and easy to understand. As a collection of sermons, this commentary is perfect for daily devotions. The Epistles of John are small letters written to the early church as an encouragement to hold fast in the faith. Many had been lost to persecution and others had been lost to unorthodox teachings such as Gnosticism. In the same way, Dr. Boice's exposition of these epistles is an encouragement to contemporary Christians. He applies these truths to our lives today. This book would be especially helpful to those who are wrestling with doubts and lack of assurance of salvation."},{"Title":"The Killing Season","review":"Where David Simon's HOMICIDE succeeds in sounding in prose, THE KILLING SEASON succeeds in speaking the truth. I have read most of the &quot;True Cop&quot; genre, which is mired in cops with axes to grind, journalists with careers to further, and others constrained by their lack of literary talent. As a cop, I was so relieved to see that at least one journalist could shed his skepticism of police officers' motivations and just sit, watch, listen, and reflect.The shock, sadness, and resignation Corwin expresses so eloquently and easily are the constant companions of even the most idealistic cop. Most, however, can't master the vocabulary to express their motivations to the general public, who seem to think we are all power-hungry, single-minded, and without empathy. We think the same of journalists, and Miles Corwin goes a long way to bridging this gap of mutual understanding. If you want to know what cops are like, read this book."},{"Title":"The Killing Season","review":"I won't try to repeat the details from the other reviews, but here's my take:1. I read this in one night -- could not put it down. I'd read Homicide Special before this and enjoyed it. This is perhaps not as engrossing as his later book, which interweaved several detective teams through six investigations -- The Killing Season concentrates on one pair, which gives the opportunity for more detail.2. I can imagine meeting Rakanzas, the senior detective - Corwin's portrait of a tobacco-chewing, wise-cracking veteran is spread throughout the book, building his character slowly but in depth.3. I didn't see the same characterization of his partner, but certainly no worse than par for the course in true crime books.4. The detective team eventually splits. This part of the book seems to gloss over the details, and I think more time could have been spent here.5. Corwin gives a fair amount of coverage to the victim's relatives, and the aftermaths of the murders. He points out the disparity between the news coverage and police effort given to a couple of contemporary murders on L.A.'s prosperous Westside and San Pedro areas, versus the shoestring response to the comparative slaughter in South Central. This could have been followed up a bit more in the book IMHO. (In fact, the LA Times did a front-page Column One series on homicides in South Central earlier this year (2006), and the situation seems to continue.)6. The supporting players (the lieutenants and other detectives) don't get as much attention in this book as in Homicide Central.7. If you are an Angeleno and read crime novels or true crime, I think you will enjoy this book. If you are outside the LA area, it's still worthwhile, but I'd suggest a map to give some scope to the story.8. One thing I would have liked to have seen was an appendix outlining the relationships of the various sets of Crip and Blood gangs, although Corwin does give a reasonable thumbnail history of the gang problem.Overall, I'd give this four-and-one-half stars. The raw material is compelling, and Corwin's style presents it nicely, leading to the refinement of his style in Homicide Special."},{"Title":"The Killing Season","review":"As a native angeleno, I found this book about the daily lives of homicide detectives in South-Central Los Angeles to be fascinating. Corwin also provides an insightful look into the history of animosity between the LAPD and minority groups in the city, thereby providing some enlightenment into the etiology of the 1992 riots. This book is a must read for native angelenos as well as a quick page-turner for anyone fascinated with homicide detectives and their investigations."},{"Title":"The Killing Season","review":"As I got to the end of \\"The Killing Season\\" I couldn't help but notice that all of the murders covered by the detectives primarily featured ran together in a blur. I found myself asking, \\"Now which shooting was this? How was this guy killed?\\" I don't know if this was Corwin's desired affect, but it gives the reader an idea of the workload these detectives are under. I am an Assistant District Attorney in south Louisiana and at a certain point the criminals and their crimes blur into each other. There are always cases that stick out because of special circumstances or some bizarre aspect of the case, but many just fall into a big amorphous blob. The real message of the book in my mind is the complete disregard for life by the killers. The gangbangers in \\"The Killing Season\\" think nothing of executing a complete stranger for a few dollars. While not a good as Corwin's \\"Homicide Special,\\" this work provides an accurate picture of a culture of violence which infects some of our communities."},{"Title":"The Killing Season","review":"Corwin gives us the real-life look of policing in the inner city -- not the 30-minute sensationalized &quot;Cops&quot; version. The book looks at all the players caught up in crime. Corwin's work on describing the Mexican background of one victim is above and beyond the call of duty. The book moves quickly and stays on focus."},{"Title":"The Killing Season","review":"I must say this book is as close to the &quot;real thing&quot; as you can get. I am a homicide detective in California, and I will tell you that Mr. Corwin writes the truth! His coverage of the LAPD's now defunct South Bureau Homicide is done in a journalistic style that keeps you turning the pages and not want to put the book down.I have met Mr. Corwin and can only say that I am looking forward to his next book!!!This is a great read for both cops and civilians who want a look at what homicide cops go through day in and day out."},{"Title":"The Killing Season","review":"Miles Corwin, a reporter for the L.A. Times was essentially embedded for 7 months with LAPD homicide detectives Pete Razanskas and Marcella Winn. The result is his 1997 book, THE KILLING SEASON. Corwin is a good and professional writer and the reader gets a real feeling for what the lives of detectives in murderous South-Central LA are like. They are always on call, often work at least 24 hours straight, are under a huge amount of stress, and are overworked to a lack of necessary manpower and technology.One of the things I appreciated most about Corwin's narrative is that, though he was always with Razanskas and Winn on there calls, he never inserts himself into the narrative, remaining an observer and reporter.But at the same time, the book is unfocused. While Corwin's method of reporting the calls as they came in provides an excellent look at the job's chaos, I found it very hard to remember which cases were which when they were referred to, often briefly, later and then later again. It had for me a kind of scattershot feel to it.There is extensive information on how Razanskas, a veteran, and Winn, his trainee, bond and become true partners, which I liked, but their relationship is at least as important to the book as the workings of the unit. This is not a criticism, just a fact, and many readers might have no problem at all with this. But while the relationship angle is compelling and well presented, I would have preferred, even though this aspect is hardly ignored, a little more on the workings of the unit itself.THE KILLING SEASON is actually a pretty good, book but toward the end I had to kind of force myself to finish it. I think that to a large extent my ambivalent feelings about this book, are, perhaps unfairly, due to the fact that I have also read David Simon's HOMICIDE, a book with an identical premise which is the platinum standard for this kind of thing and which is much better than THE KILLING SEASON.I'd actually give this book around 3.5 stars if I could. I also think a lot of readers will like THE KILLING SEASON more than I did."},{"Title":"The Killing Season","review":"This book was wonderful. I am an avid reader but usually read fiction mysteries.

No, King comes off like some poor innocent citizen walking his little puppy who was viciously set upon for no reason by evil killer cops.

The person had some difficulty that was alleviated to a greater or lesser degree through Scientology counselling and the use of a meter.The introduction does not force people to accept these theories or analyze these subjects, but simply brings these items to view and have the reader come to his or her own conclusions.The Appendices go over the history of reincarnation and past life theory, from the Cro-Magnon man on up.

Though many of these books are dated, it might not be a bad idea to pick one up and check it out at your local library to get a better understanding of what HYLBTL is all about.Fascinating material.

Here is a taboo subject that no one is permitted to know'bout in today's society: that one (maybe, just maybe) doesn't just live once (or as the 1973 song went \\"You only live twice, or so it seems, one life for yourself and one for your dreams...\\"). Of course everyone has a right to their own convictions: I am not saying you ought to read this book, it's entirely up to you, but if you are curious, as I was, about what really happens after death, there's plenty there to whet your curiosity and get you thinking, \\"is that really the way it happens?\\", \\"How come I can't remember a thing ?\\" You decide."},{"Title":"First woman ambulance surgeon, Emily Barringer","review":"I would hightly recommend this book.

The books appear to be the same.]This re-impression of the great Yiddish-English-Hebrew dictionary by Alexander Harkavy restores to print the principle lexicon usable and useful for those interested in classic Yiddish literature, from Mendele Moicher Sforim up to the time of its compilation. The young (by the usual standards in these things) Yiddish scholar David Katz wrote an excellent introduction, in Yiddish and English, and there is a valuable bibliography, for those with the inclination and resources to use it.Drawbacks:1) Because of the great variation in noun gender among the Yiddish dialects (even leaving aside the neuter-less Litvak speech), Harkavy found it appropriate, after the first few pages of Alef, to abandon marking nouns for gender. Remember, Yiddish was never a state language, except in the old USSR (nebbich), and so never was subject to Academies, schoolmarms, and other hypercorrectarians.2) The print is small and somewhat blurred. Adjust your spectacles or get a magnifying glass.A more specific problem, and a greater one, is the haphazard nature of the Hebrew vowel points under those vocabulary items deriving from Loshn-Koidesh. Sometimes they're visible, sometimes not. I'd recommend keeping a Hebrew dictionary on hand for cases of doubt, preferably an old one. I like to use a Founding-of-the-State era Alcalay for this purpose.3) There is little or no grammatical information, unless Harkavy found a particular instance especially interesting, usually for historical or etymological reasons. Remember, this dictionary is intended solely for American Jews for whom Yiddish was the mame-loshn. They needed no instruction in how to use these words.4) Those familiar with modern Israeli Hebrew may find the Hebrew definitions quaint.Aside from its great utility in parsing the classic writers of the unparalleled Yiddish literature in its heyday, Harkavy gives us, in his notes and the very definitions, some considerable insight into early 20th Century Jewish-American life. I can't imagine that enthusiasts of Yiddishkkajt won't find this book as amusing as it is useful."},{"Title":"Yiddish-English-Hebrew dictionary","review":"It is a great shame that such a good dictionary is published as a copy rather than a new typeset edition. Presently, there are many programs that can electronically scan texts and recognize the scanned letters."},{"Title":"Yiddish-English-Hebrew dictionary","review":"If you are a student of Yiddish and need another dictionary besides Weinreich for reading and translation work, this is the dictionary to buy."},{"Title":"Yiddish-English-Hebrew dictionary","review":"Despite the caveats expressed by other reviewers, this is still the dictionary to have for anyone reading classic Yiddish literature, including later 20th century giants like Bashevis Singer and Chaim Grade. Harkavy was an extraordinary lexicographer, and he presents the language as it was written and spoken at the time (including many Americanisms), and not the language as it *should* be spoken, as found in the Weinreich dictionary. For a supplement on the Hebrew and Aramaic (Loshn-Koydesh) component of Yiddish, Yitskhok Niborski's \\"Verterbukh fun Loshn-Koydesh-Shtamike Verter in Yidish\\" is enormously helpful. That said, a reset and revised edition of Harkavy is urgently needed--but, until then, the reprint will have to do. Niborski and Vaisbrot's \\"Dictionnaire Yiddish-Francais\\" is a great contemporary dictionary, comprising Harkavy and much more--but obviously it is only accessible to Francophones. There is a rumor that it is being translated into English, hope that this comes to pass."},{"Title":"Developing Web Applications with ASP.NET and C#","review":"This book is fantastic for self-study and the only prerequisite is that you should have some understanding of C#. I bought Essential ASP.NET by Fritz Onion before this one but it was a little hard to follow at first - also, it deals more with ASP.NET architecture and internals and isn't so practical if you have to start building ASP.NET applications right away. I assure you this one can get you started in 2 to 3 days if you know C#.

A genius for architecture. Photographs by Paul Rocheleau","review":"This is just the kind of big, sumptuous, exhaustive book that Richardson has always deserved. Part coffee-table book, part monograph----entertaining, informative, great to look through. I grew up near Boston and Richardson's churches, train depots, and libraries were a part of the background until I took a close look at Trinity Church and realized that the same person who designed THAT designed all these other structures as well. Richardson not only revived Romanesque architecture but pointed the way to modernism. He was a pivotal figure who didn't live long enough. This well-produced book does him justice."},{"Title":"Henry Hobson Richardson. A genius for architecture.

His breakthrough book 'On Native Grounds' established him as a major critic of American Literature. But it may well be that the writing he will be most remembered for is his memoir- journals.In these he not only reflects upon his own story but presents a picture of major literary characters of his time. He creates a sense of the mood of the time and place. From the beginnings in great poverty in Williamsburg his story is an American adventure in which he comes to know and meet many of the major creative and even political figures of his time. In this journal- memoir he writes with feeling of the world he came from, and the world across the bridge he aspired to. This work is a prelude to his 'Walker in the City' which would be for many the most outstanding of these journal- memoir works."},{"Title":"Artistic Drawing (Creative Kids)","review":"Speaking from an elementary art teacher's point of view I found this book to be an inspiration.

It always looks good (unless you're purist about that kind of perfection thing in which case, this is not the set for you). Also, I liked that the paper is a good quality and the ivory color looks distinguished and good. The box is great and very elegant and has started to hold some of my treasured letters.The only complaint? I'm into writing long letters (as I'm sure a lot of people who own this are) so 30 sheets and 30 envelopes will just leave me with a lot of envelopes left over long after I use up all the sheets.

They explore the ocean and learn about coral reefs. Coral reefs are made of skeletons of tiny sea creatures. Jack and Annie look out the big window of the submarine and see two dolphins. Annie names them Sukie and Sam. When they look at the submarine's computer, they find out that the submarine is cracked. They are being squeezed by an octopus. They start to swim to shore because of the cracks, but when they look back, they see a fin and think that it might be a shark. When they realize they are looking at the dolphins, they ride on the dolphins backs. The dolphins take them safely to shore and they go back home in the magic treehouse.I liked this book a lot because it has a happy ending.

Hatterr,: A gesture","review":"This is a book whose content and literary importance are nearly inseperable. &quot;The first great stroke of the decolonizing pen,&quot; Salman Rushdie (merely one in the great line of authors that Desani made available to themselves and the world) rightly called it. The book's language is its most interesting characteristic: &quot;Hinglish&quot; it has come to be called, proper English Hinduized and thereby made its authors own. The plot itself, while intriguing and playful, does not carry the reader along or provide enough substance to make this book great; the wonderful twists and turns of language and plot that we've come to associate with Indian literature in English is seen here only in germ form. Still, to miss this is to miss a revolution. Its out of print, but hopefully that will change; check the libraries in the meantime, and start a petition for a reprinting or something."},{"Title":"All about H. Hatterr,: A gesture","review":"'All about H Hatterr' is an achievement non-pareil (and I'm not only considering Indian-born writers here). This novel captures the adventures of a certain H Hatterr, an Anglo-Indian never-do-good fellow, amongst the seven sages. He gets into all kinds of trouble, always to be bailed out by his devoted friend Bannerji and 'that gem of a lawyer', Y Beliram. Trying to summarise the story would be a gross unjustice to the book, which is superb in content but absolutely brilliant in form. The style, scathingly original, is at times slightly tough to grasp (reminds one of Ulysses and the good old Joyce). Not a very light read, but really enjoyable."},{"Title":"All about H. Hatterr,: A gesture","review":"I've had my copy of this book in my library since the year 2000. It was given to me in India by a good friend, who told me it was amazing. He was right. I finally have gotten around to reading it after being initially put off for 9 years by its strangely eclectic language and thoroughly unconventional format. I have since learned that these are just two of this book's extraordinary strengths, as G.V. Desani demonstrates a fantastically freewheeling imagination and healthy creative disregard for traditional novelistic forms. He proceeds to structure his \\"chapters\\" like a scientific treatise. However, first he gives us a \\"Warning!\\": Dear reader, this isn't a novel, it's a \\"gesture,\\" but if you can't relate to that, then call it a \\"novel.\\" Then we are given a kind of preface, called \\"All About...\\", followed by ANOTHER \\"Warning!\\" and then a \\"Mutual Introduction.\\" So now you know you're in for something completely different.By page 39 of my Penguin Books edition, we get to the \\"chapters.\\" Each one begins with a \\"Digest,\\" which is a kind of Abstract summary that gives nothing away to the reader. These Digests need to be reread after \\"digesting\\" the actual chapter. Following the Digest is the \\"Instruction\\" section, which is what we are supposed to learn. Then comes a \\"Presumption\\" as to what is assumed by the writer as he goes about relating to us the actual \\"Life-Encounter\\" of H. Hatterr, which is the heart of the chapter.H. Hatterr as a main character is a picaresque cultural mashup of western and eastern thought. He's a seeker and a cynic, a believer and an irreverent skeptic who finds more fraud and nonsense in the world than sincerity. The only sincere person is his loyal friend Banerrji, his Sancho Panza, who loves to quote little fragments from \\"the Bard\\" and other western literary icons. Adventure after wildly funny adventure only confirms Hatterr's outlook on life. Yet, genuine spiritual feelings also arise, but they usually are self-generated by Hatterr, not by the sages and gurus he encounters.The language and style of Desani have clearly influenced other writers, such as Amitav Ghosh. I noticed a similarity between this seminal work and Ghosh's wonderfully freewheeling \\"Sea of Poppies.\\" The language here is rich, funny, and entertaining. I found myself completely lost in its spell.Without a doubt, I highly recommend this \\"novel,\\" \\"gesture,\\" or whatever you want to call it. Don't compare it to anybody or anything else. It stands up all on its own."},{"Title":"All about H.

Hatterr,: A gesture","review":"Salman Rushdie, in his collection of essays &quot;Imaginary Homelands&quot;, acknowledges a longstanding debt to G.V.Desani. He paraphrases Desani's H.Hatterr talking about the migration of the fifties and the sixties. &quot;We are. We are here&quot;, he says, speaking for Indian writers in England. Rushdie's own prose owes much to Desani, and Saleem Sinai to Hatterr. Desani's prose is rollicking, hilarious, wildly creative and even boisterous, in this book that was written in wartime and published in postwar England, over a decade after R.K.Narayan's gentle little &quot;Swami and Friends&quot;. Allan Sealy and, of course, Salman Rushdie are probably the best-known inheritors of the Desani mantle, having learned many tricks of their trade from him. But Desani himself has been sadly underrated for all these years, and, with the book not readily available, one has to hunt for his book in the King's Circle and Churchgate used-book markets of Bombay.

The Broken Vase is one of my favorites. The Fox novels are very good. Fox reminds me of the male protagonist in the Thin Man. Fox is very entertaining, suave and wealthy and is surrounded by a coterie of very, funny oddballs. In a sense, he is Archie's elder precursor. Stout somehow communicates his suaveness, sophistication and elegance. Fox is very much a man about the town and a man in charge.I strongly recommend all of the Fox novels to Wolfe fans and anyone who likes a well-written and entertaining 1940's detective mystery. Stout offered us a rich universe of detective fiction. It'd be silly not to avail oneself of hours of reading pleasure.I can guarantee you'll enjoy them each novel and maybe feel as grateful as I did. Discovering new detective novels by Rex Stout is wonderful! They are equally as good as the Wolfe Cannon.FOR YOUR INFOFor die hard and craving Wolfe fans, Stout wrote two special novels featuring detectives from the Wolfe Cannon. I haven't read the Inspector Cramer (Red Threads) or Doll Bonner (The Hand in the Glove) novels but I tried each briefly and was tempted away by another book."},{"Title":"The Broken Vase","review":"Since I am a huge Nero Wolfe fan, I wanted to read Stout's earlier series and I found it interesting, but...I can see why it didn't go over so well...

These encounters are treated in 6 steps leading us to the 7th and final step of the soul's spiritual rapture into the Holy Trinity.Bonaventure cries out to us to leave behind all thoughts and desires and abandon our lives to Christ. Progressing through love, prayer and gazing on God we will see and know The Persons of the Holy Trinity, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, in this life and in the life to come.The second work, \\"The Tree of Life\\", is a spiritual account of the central events of Jesus' Life: His Hidden Life, Ministry, Passion, Death, Resurrection, Ascencion and Glorification. It is a profoundly beautiful and poetic work. Bonaventure calls us to be crucified in Christ and to live anew in Him through sharing in His Virtues.The final work, \\"The Life of St Francis\\", is a spiritual biography of the little poor man of Christ. St Francis encounters us and bids us leave all to follow and love Christ. Bonaventure shows us that we must, like St Francis, die in Christ and reproduce His Virtues in our own lives. It is a dynamic and powerful work.This book will appeal to all people especially those pursuing the vision of God in Jesus Christ. It is a spiritual treasure for all. For Catholics, Bonaventure will provide great wisdom from the depths of the Church's Tradition regarding the soul's mystical marriage to Jesus Christ. It will be a great blessing for Orthodox Christians as Bonaventure, following St Dionysius and the Eastern Church Fathers, shows us how to ascend to God in spiritual darkness through the Vision of Divine Light. It will greatly bless Protestants as it is a profound account of God's Justifying and Sanctifying Grace.Finally, it will powerfully speak to all Charismatics and Pentecostals who have experienced the Baptism in the Holy Spirit. St Bonaventure is a man filled with the Holy Spirit who has produced a practical guide of great wisdom on how to see, know and intimately love the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.All in all, a great spiritual treasure at a very affordable price. Highly Recommended for all people."},{"Title":"Bonaventure: The Soul's Journey Into God / The Tree of Life / The Life of St. Francis (The Classics of Western Spirituality)","review":"This book comprises much of the great Saints works, and gives readers a glimpse at the different topics the Saint dealt with.

A true classic!"},{"Title":"Bonaventure: The Soul's Journey Into God / The Tree of Life / The Life of St. Francis (The Classics of Western Spirituality)","review":"St Bonaventure was one of the greatest mystics of the medieval period. This edition includes his classic work 'The Journey of the Soul into God', the 'Tree of Life', and 'the Life of St Francis.'Bonaventure was a Franciscan mystic and theologian. He had a very positive view of the material cosmos and the figure of the cosmic christ occurs strongly through his mysticism. For Bonaventure, there are two ways we know God; the book of nature, and the book of scriptures. Through these two paths and then by looking inwards into ourselves at our image created by God, we encounter God's prescence at the heart of our very being, a journey which is deeply Augustinian in its origins.The Tree of Life is an examination of the logos of Christ, in both his passion and his cosmic role. The Life of St Francis is a work of hagiography on that great saint who was the founder of Bonaventure's order.Bonaventure is very much an aesthetic theologian. He is deeply appreciative of the beauty of the world, of Christ, and of God. He sees the world and ourselves as 'God's work of art', to be cherished and loved for what they are, God's good creations. Such a positive view should be welcomed by any Christian spirituality today, when our world is faced with environmental problems of considerable magnitude."},{"Title":"Bonaventure: The Soul's Journey Into God / The Tree of Life / The Life of St. Francis (The Classics of Western Spirituality)","review":"\\"Bonaventure\\" provides a brief biography of its subject, the Franciscan scholar and Minister General, followed by three of his most important works. The works included are \\"The Soul's Journey Into God\\", \\"The Tree of Life\\" and \\"The Life of St. Francis.\\" The first two invite the reader to meditate on the mysteries of God and to be drawn more deeply into them. The Life is a cross between a biography and a Gospel. It contains many factual details but also conveys the deep spirituality of St. Francis.The parts of this book which I enjoyed the most were the biographical information of St. Bonaventure and \\"The Life of St. Francis\\". I think that the editors did an excellent job of relating the spirituality of Francis to the work of Bonaventure. Based on my reading of this book I believe that Bonaventure saw himself largely as an interpreter of St. Francis' spirituality to the world.

St Francis.best wishes, Tom."},{"Title":"Bonaventure: The Soul's Journey Into God / The Tree of Life / The Life of St. Francis (The Classics of Western Spirituality)","review":"In surveying Christian mystics through the medieval period, Bonaventure's The Soul's Journey into God reappropriates a radical spirituality that is best articulated as wisdom theology.This investigation of Bonaventure's spirituality demonstrates Bonaventure's meaning of God, the human person, and how the God-human relationship is integrated with themes of creation theology and Trinitarian love mysticism.From these understandings, it becomes clear how Bonaventure empowers personal spirituality through what can be experienced as a power of radical contradictions - a recurring theme in Bonaventure's theology that communicates the authentic paradox, the parabolic experience, and the radical irony that inspires faith."},{"Title":"Bonaventure: The Soul's Journey Into God / The Tree of Life / The Life of St. Francis (The Classics of Western Spirituality)","review":"Saint Bonaventure (1221-1274) was an Italian medieval scholastic theologian and philosopher. The three works (The Soul's Journey into God; The Tree of Life; The Life of St. Francis) collected in this 1978 volume are his best-known books. The Preface notes that 'Soul's Journey' is \\"a deeply theological and mystical study of man's soaring quest for the Triune God and the steps he must take to arrive at the Good and the Beautiful\\"; 'Tree' is a quest for \\"the wisdom to be found in the tree\\"; and the 'Life' \\"portrays in vivid colors the inner life of the Seraph of Assisi.\\"He suggested that \\"we cannot judge with certainty except in view of the Eternal Art which is the form that not only produced all things but also conserves and distinguishes all things, as the being which sustains the form in all things and the rule which directs all things. Through it our mind judges all things that enter it through the senses.\\" (Pg. 74) He states poetically, \\"In this passing over, if it is to be perfect, all intellectual activities must be left behind and the height of our affection must be totally transferred and transformed into God.\\" (Pg. 113)He suggests that Francis called his brother \\"Brother A__\\" because \\"he felt it should be subjected to heavy labor, beaten frequently with whips and fed with the poorest food.\\" (Pg. 222) Concerning the famous Sermon to the Birds, he said, \\"They all became alert and turned toward him, and those perched in the trees bent their heads as he approached them... saying, 'Oh birds, my brothers, you have a great obligation to praise your Creator, who clothed you in feathers and gave you wings to fly with, provided you with the pure air and cares for you...'\\" (Pg. 294-295)This is an attractive edition of these famous works."},{"Title":"Bonaventure: The Soul's Journey Into God / The Tree of Life / The Life of St. Francis (The Classics of Western Spirituality)","review":"This book has three of Bonaventure's most famous works done in the 1200s. The Soul's Journey into God; the Tree of Life and the Life of St. Francis. I struggled with the Soul's Journey in understanding what I was reading.It was one of those books that after I read it I wasn't sure what I had just read. Maybe if studied it would have been better. Maybe it was becasue it was written nearly a thousand years ago even though mordernized it was a style that I stuggled with. The Tree of Life was not much better. There is some good information there but my retention was zero. You may find it different. The Third book of St, Francis was good and is probably one of his more famous books. It was still a struggle to get through and unless you know something about St. Francis might not be all that easy to understand.These books are classics but I find some of the classics are not all that easy to read."},{"Title":"Bonaventure: The Soul's Journey Into God / The Tree of Life / The Life of St. Francis (The Classics of Western Spirituality)","review":"Great spiritual reading for anyone interested in Western mysticism. Noy only do you get meditations to make your mind soar on the mystery of Christ in the \\"Tree of Life\\", but you also get a \\"skeleton\\" of the mystical life in the \\"Soul's Journey into God\\". I only wish I had more background into the mystics, but for anyone with a background in the gospels, be they Protestant or Catholic, this book will be highly informative. I have yet to read the third part of the book, which is a biography of St. Francis. Needless to say I was pleased. Along with the forward by a Franciscan scholar, you get three classical works in one.For someone really intersted in a life of prayer, meditative and contemplative, this is a must-have."},{"Title":"Bonaventure: The Soul's Journey Into God / The Tree of Life / The Life of St. Francis (The Classics of Western Spirituality)","review":"St. Bonaventure was a crucial successor to St. Francis because his emphasis on academic learning transformed the Franciscan Order. While St. Francis was an unlettered man of undoubtable sanctity and sweetness, St. Bonaventure was an erudite professor at the University of Paris and Roman Catholic cardinal. \\"Within the Franciscan Order, Bonaventure is considered its second founder\\" (p. 7, Introduction). This volume's collection of Bonaventure's writing telegraphically conveys the spirit and seminal history of the Franciscan Order.Along with an informative Introduction, three of St. Bonaventure's works are presented: 1. The Soul's Journey to God, 2. The Tree of Life, and 3. The Life of St. Francis.1. \\"The movement of creatures out from God and their return to God is the central focus of Bonaventure's entire vision\\" (p. 26, Introduction). One could say the same of Dante's Divine Comedy and indeed the entire Neoplatonic corpus. And indeed the Neoplatonic influence is heavily present in this first work, The Soul's Journey to God. (As of course is the Aristotelian influence.) The Soul's Journey to God reminds me of the comment by Manly P. Hall that, if you take an early Christian work and remove all references to Jesus, Mary, and the Holy Trinity, it would be almost impossible to distinguish between it and a Neoplatonic work. In sum, The Soul's Journey to God reads like Christianized Neoplatonism of the Middle Ages. For that reason it is the least impressive of the three works.2. The Tree of Life is a homiletic retelling of the Gospel narrative of Jesus' birth, ministry, death, and resurrection. Being a Franciscan retelling, there is strong emphasis on the humility of Christ and his \\"wealth in poverty\\".3. The Life of St. Francis is, to me, the most uplifting and interesting of the three works. The narrative is so packed with St. Francis's miracles (eg, his changing water to wine, a few strands of his hair preventing a wall from collapsing, his levitation during prayer, etc) that it veers toward light-heartedness. I am not saying these miracles did or did not happen: I am saying the nature and varieties of St. Francis's miracles are simply incredible. As a young man, Francis experienced what Joseph Campbell termed \\"the classic shamanic experience\\" of a serious illness preceding a life-changing epiphany: the voice of Jesus spoke to the young Francis from a wooden cross in a church; later, Francis had a compellingly real vision of Jesus crucified; and of course the climactic vision in St. Francis's life was the six-winged seraph, which vision shortly preceded his receiving the stigmata.What shines forth in the Life of St. Francis is the vision of a humble life of SERVICE TO OTHERS lived without regard for material things - a stunning liberation of the spirit (that is required of all Franciscans, none of whom are permitted to own property). \\"No one should be praised whose end is still uncertain\\" (p. 236), said St. Francis. Francis's end IS certain. He is worthy of great praise as a true ascetic with a heart of gold. How can you not love a man who would pay to ransom lambs from the slaughter and who literally would give you all he had *and* the shirt off his back?St. Francis emphasized the immanence of God throughout His Creation, in a way very evocative of Eastern spirituality. Walt Whitman could easily have acquired his strong joyous sense of God's immanence from St. Francis rather than from Hinduism and Buddhism. The spiritual parallels between the West and East are striking, but then authentic spirituality always presents parallels.By the bye, this book makes an excellent addition to a reading of Umberto Eco's fun novelThe Name of the Rose (Everyman's Library (Cloth)).Bonaventure is a spiritually uplifting and historically interesting work - very recommended."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"I am a big fan of Michael Crichton, but I did not care for this book."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"I am a fan of Michael Crichton's. Having said that, I felt that the writing style of this particular book was incredibly choppy, and that certain characters were not well developed at all (e.g. the wife!)The basic premise was very interesting and the book was suspenseful; it moved along at a fast pace. However, Crichton added too many characters, and made the book too dense. I had to skim the last several chapters because I wanted to know what happened at the end, but I was getting extremely bored.Obviously, he has come a long way since this book :-)Sigrid"},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"This is another one of those books that I found very difficult to put down. It is a definite page-turner! The story plot became more and more convoluted as the mystery continued forward and made for very interesting and entertaining reading. I really enjoyed reading this novel. The novel was extremely informative and educational (in terms of medicine/healthcare). Since I have always been interested in medicine/healthcare and worked in healthcare for 16 years, this book was very appealing and most of the medical terminology/jargon made sense. However, I can see where, in some cases, the less informed reader could potentially be confused by all the medical jargon. Crichton attempts, via footnotes, to give brief explanations where due--however, the novel could have used a few more footnotes to clarify some confusing areas, especially in paragraphs that are loaded with medical jargon. Granted, there aren't too many of these paragraphs.Nonetheless, the book was very good. I enjoyed this book almost as much as I enjoyed &quot;The Terminal Man&quot; (also by Crichton). It would be great to see more medical mysteries from Crichton.This novel is definitely worth the read!"},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"There should be more gripping novels of this type put out every year. This book relies on character interaction and a well thought out plot versus gimmicky techno garbage and other mind numbing junk. Excellent character development and a good helping of suspense are this books strong points."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"This book was written in the late 1960s (copyright is 1968) when the author had just finished his own medical internship. As such, it is not at all surprising that it is somewhat medically dense, nor is it surprising that there are footnotes and appendices (which were commonly used during that time and to which people were accustomed, unlike now when, if we don't know, we either don't want to know or we want it covered in the text). I also found it a fascinating look at the 1960s - the language itself threw me for the first couple chapters until I went back and looked at the copyright page and then I said \\"oooohhh, 1960s - that's OK then.\\" People need to not get so upset about things that have changed - what was acceptable 40+ years ago isn't now - OK, we get that. MOVE ON already and don't trash a book because of it! The fact that the main character of the pathologist RECEIVED PERMISSION FROM HIS BOSS to take off the time necessary to try to clear his colleague has apparently been lost on some readers, who nonetheless become upset over other minor details they feel the writer or editor missed. Nitpicking apart a book is not the way to enjoy it!At any rate, I digress. I had this book sitting around for quite some time before I pulled it out and read it. Like others have mentioned, I need to be in the right mood for Crichton. This book was very well done, especially if - as one reviewer says - it was his first book. I think I was well past the half-way point before I had an inkling of who may have been involved, but I figured out only half of the team, so to speak! Like Dr. Berry himself, I became overly wrapped up in all the details and missed the larger picture. But, I suppose, that is the point. I think the book was wonderfully done and I enjoyed the appendices a great deal. I have a bit of knowledge of medical terminology, so I didn't need all of the footnotes, but I found some of them necessary (and there were places where others would have been helpful!). Nonetheless, this was a well-done book that examined a very sensitive topic (then AND now) from a, I believe, very well-balanced point of view."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"Crichton's approach here is a murder mystery in the scientific world of medicine. It is unlike later novels in which he imagines new scientific worlds. Here we have a respective pathologist acting the detective much like the protagonist in Rising Sun. On the surface an abortion has been committed on the daughter of a highly repected and powerful Brahmin Doctor in Boston. An oriental doctor friend of the pathologist is to be charged with committing the abortion at a time when abortions were still illegal. There is a lot of scientific dialogue as the pathologist interviews other doctors. He also delves into the culture of the daughter's life.Crichton has a pro-choice view here. Despite the changed legal time, I still found the essential story engrossing. A secret operation has been botched, and the daughter is dead. There are powerful conflicting forces that seek to stop him and he has to work around prejudiced law enforement. Our hero is working against a deadline to save a man's name and identify the real \\"killer.\\" I think the characters we meet along the way are believable. I found myself in suspense until the end.It is a quick read. And I think it is worthwhile if you are a Crichton fan because his body of work spans so many different areas of science."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"A Case of Need was Michael Crichton's first novel and it showed. The book was decent, but it lacked the polish of his later work. I was interested, but not engrossed and could have put it down and never missed finishing it. Forgettable."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"A marvelously contrived plot. The reader can learn a lot of medical processes and terminology as well. Well worth the reader's time. But it's by Michael Crichton -- need I say more?"},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"Michael Crichton was only 26 years old when he wrote A CASE OF NEED in 1968. This book, although not perfect, is a very well written medical thriller that holds up pretty well nearly forty years later.A CASE OF NEED deals with the subject of abortion, and an abortion doctor who has been wrongly framed for a botched operation. It probably won't have much appeal for the anti-abortion crowd, although it's interesting to read a book that deals with the subject before the Roe v. Wade court decision took effect.Like all of Crichton's books, this novel has a lot of interesting information about science. In particular, Crichton does a good job of explaining how doctors do their jobs, and what life was like for young doctors in the late 1960s. If you're interested in the medical profession, this book has a lot of fascinating material.The major weakness of this A CASE OF NEED is the large number of characters, and the fact that several of them are not fully fleshed out. I occasionally had to flip back the pages to remind myself who was who. I also felt the hero of this book was essentially uninteresting -- Crichton has never been very good at creating strong central characters in his novels.All in all, though, A CASE OF NEED is a solid medical thriller. It's one of Circhton's better novels."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"Crichton's development as a writer is clearly evident to me in his books, though I've not read them all. \\"A Case of Need\\" is unique among the Crichton books that I have read - it's more of a medically-themed detective story than the technological thrillers that Crichton is best known for. His writing style is more antiquated: more formal and less intended to quickly hook the reader and reel him/her in. It is also peculiar in that it is written in the first person, severely limiting the reader's perspective. The plot is slow, consisting of mostly conversational interviews, lacking the slasher dinosaur scenes of \\"Jurassic Park\\" or even the heart-stopping germ scenes in its closer sibling \\"The Andromeda Strain\\".Overall, it's a good mystery story, but it lacks most of the features that have drawn me back to Crichton novels again and again. I like Michael Crichton because he can write an intriguing, fast-paced, easy-to-read novel while still incorporating themes - fun novels that make you think. \\"A Case of Need\\" is not as fun, and its intentions seem clouded and confused. It's still a worthwhile read, but Crichton has since written better."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"Crichton is one of my authors I have to be in the mood for. I tend towards his early medical stuff, just as I tende towards the earlier versions of ER (actually quit watching it years ago). Chrichton is an intelligent writer, and as this is one of his earliest books you can see for yourself how he has developed as a writer. In some ways, I think he earlier stuff is better, partly because he is writing closer to his 'area of observation?'The book is about a touchy subject, abortion during the sixties before Roe V Wade. It was known to be done, both inside and outside of hospitals, and though I am personally not pro-abortion...I would not want to go back to the era before that when women died having abortions. This is a personal choice area, and Crichton was obviously working his way through his own feelings on this subject. This whole area doesn't just start with the abortion; it starts with parents teaching children responsibility, families that act as families, the whole thing. To debate here or in one book would be senseless.Crichton mystery had me going in several wrong directions before I finally understood what was going on...which is good. I don't like knowing 'who done it' three pages into the book.Interesting, older read for summertime reading...Karen Sadler"},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"It is a good, quick read - much like all other Crichton books. This one has more appeal to the medically oriented crowd. But, as with Michael Crichton, if you liked his others, you'll like this one."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"this book was a good way to spend a rainy day. crichton is so good at explaining technical information to the layperson, in this case medical terminology. as i reader, i felt a part of the medical community. this was a good early effort, preceding his wonderful ER tv series by a good 25 years."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"Good Storyline, controversial topic, ineteresting plot development. One can't help but admire MC for putting himself through medical school by writing mass market paperbacks. The development of his brilliant writing style is evident in this book, and the characters and events are eerily realistic. Unfortunately, I couldn't handle the acronyms (with the accompanying footnotes)! Personally, I would have preferred the complete terminologies, because everytime I stumbled across an acronym (and then had to read the footnote), it broke my concentration. This marred my enjoyment of the book considerably. However, it is still worth buying."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"A Case of Need is classic Michael Crichton. I have read many of his more recent books, but this is the oldest one of his that I have read. Crichton uses his extensive knowledge to explain the workings of the medical profession in the up-and-coming 1960s and 1970s, while at the same time writing a story with so many turns that a twisting mountain road is child's play in comparison. The suspense and superb writing made me unable to put this book down, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"The story was not gripping, and it did not have enough thrills to call it a thriller.

I believe this is not one of his best given he wrote Jurassic Park, and the Lost World."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"Although this book kept me hooked, it just wsn't as suspenseful as some of his others (such as Rising Sun, Jurassic Park and Disclosure). I found the footnotes and appendices confusing and annoying and also wondered about the weight gain and the hair growth as it really wasn't explained."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"I liked the book A CASE OF NEED because it is a book I could and hopefully will relate to in the future. It's a hospital drama. There are several doctors that think they are all better than each other. So therefore they want all the control over hospital operations. The content of my book was wonderful. I understood the book chapter by chapter--it hooked me. I related to the book because I want to be a doctor and I want to be in charge and challenge the Administration. I could throw myself right into the characters' shoes and play from scratch. The book is within the field that I want to be part of."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"Most of Crichton's work is excellent, and this was not quite as good. I guess you have to take into consideration it was his first book. I thought it was extremly stupid for a doctor to be out questioning witnesses and seaking around taking pictures. Shouldn't this have been left up to a private investigator or the police? This book did give you an excellent view into the medical world, though. The medical abbreviations were very confusing, and so were some of the terms. The characters were very believable. Before diving into this book, I'd read some of his others."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"I thought this book was a masterpiece. I loved it. It never had a dull moment.

You cant go wrong by reading this book."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"Michael Crichton's A Case Of Need is a skillful thriller in which Crichton develops likable characters and inspires an excellent who-done-it. The novel surprised me in how good it actually was, considering how long ago Chrichton wrote it, and the risky subject. Many of the characters interested me, and Crichton doesn't over do it in this novel with the medical information. A Case Of Need moves at a quick pace, and is a good book for any Michael Crichton fan."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"Michael Chrichton wrote A Case of Need shortly after finishing medical school. Not only does it succeed as a medical thriller, the 1968 novel stands the test of more than four decades' time.Chrichton's gift is in bringing the reader into the hospital without either simplifying the practice of medicine. Technical terms are explained in excellent footnotes located throughout the book. The author takes his time balancing the urban hospital setting with remarkable character development. A Case of Need is a page turner of the highest order.The plot revolves around an illegal abortionist (as virtually all were in 1968) who is arrested in connection with the death of young woman, allegedly a patient. To complicate matters, the young woman is the daughter of a prominent medical family in Boston and coworker to the accused.Fans of Robin Cook will lose nothing by giving this early brand of Michael Chrichton a try. He is adept at pacing, creating compelling characters, and writing smart dialogue. 4/5 stars."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"I read this book last year. I really wanted something newer by Michael Crichton but since I had already read all his new stuff and his other book release was delayed. I decided to give this one a try. I could tell the difference in writing right away. Michael Crichtons writting has definetly developed a lot more if you read some his newer books. By newer books I mean prey, state of fear and next. This book was still a pleasure to read just like almost all books I've read that we're written by Michael Crichton. Although in my opnion it wasn't as fast moving and a thriller type book when compared to prey, state of fear or next. Still a great read and definetly one too add to your collection if your a Michael Crichton fan since its his first book."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"A Case of Need is a stimulating story that kept my interest and I found that it was hard to put down. It educated s on some of the arguments for both sides of the abortion issue while maintaining a very good story line and character set. The plot revolves around who performed an illegal abortion on a girl from an affluent family.As you read on you that the abortion killed the girl, so the person who performed the abortion is guilty of murder. For medical thriller fans I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"This was Michael Crichton's first novel, completed after he finished his internship for medical school (that's right, for those who do not know he is an MD who decided to become an author). Anyway, Crichton does it again with his near flawless style. This book is about a girl by the name of Karen Randall who dies from an abortion. Was it murder? Or, was it a simple mistake? Keep this in mind as you turn the pages over and over again. Though Crichton does not have great character development, I thought the main character (Dr. Berry) had excellent development. Also, this book contains a lot of footnotes and medical information, so you might not understand it all. Overall, pick this book up. It is well-written, and you know the facts are right because he wrote right after he became an MD! One thing I must say, it was written a long time ago. Keep in mind what time period it is. Good job, once again, Michael."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"Wow. I'm not a very big Crichton fanatic...

Anyway, the parts that I did comprehend were absolutely fantastic."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"This is one of Crichton's best books, and it is also one of the most technical.

The protagonist, John Berry, is a pathologist who carries out an investigation to discover the truth about the death of a young girl to protect his friend, a radical doctor who performs illegal abortions. On the way he is threatened by the patriarch or a powerful medical family who wants the truth to remain a mystery so that he can save embarassment. The stance on issues such as abortion seems a little dated, but all the arguments are familiar, just now society is on the other side of the coin.

Originally published in 1969, the medical aspects of the book are surprisingly un-dated. Subtle humor, suspense and the vintage Crichton style of writing made this a book that I couldn't put down. The controversial subject is as current today as it was nearly 30 years ago - and although the dialogue of the characters is somewhat dated, I was nevertheless unable to put this book down. Part expose, part mystery, part detective story, part edification - and all Crichton at his finest"},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"This book won the 1968 Edgar Award for best mystery novel of the year. An obstetrician has been accused of performing an illegal abortion in Boston in the late 1960's. A pathologist discovers that the girl, who died in the emergency room of a hospital, wasn't even pregnant. He sets out to clear his friend of the charges. Although some of the discussions on abortion may seem dated, this is still a good mystery. Michael Crichton originally published this book under the pseudonym Jeffrey Hudson. Some earlier reviewers have suggested that he did this because of the controversy generated by the topic of abortion. While this undoubtedly was a factor, we also have to recall that this was his first book and Crichton was a medical student in Massachusetts at the time he wrote much of this book. I'm not sure if his faculty would have been too keen on having a student devote a significant fraction of his time to writing a novel instead of to his studies, had they known. But, I may be wrong. Some other reviewers gave it a low rating because it contained too much jargon. Of course, that is a trademark of this category of books; however, I seem to miss the jargon in this novel. Perhaps I missed it but &quot;A Case of Need&quot; seems to be the least technical of Crichton's books."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"Sci-fi wizard Michael Crichton wrote this novel when he was still in medical school. In fact, he wrote many such novels under pseudonyms to pay his way through college. Then, this book won an Edgar Award, and everything changed!'A Case Of Need' is a medical thriller along with a murder mystery thrown in. The story revolves around Dr. John Berry who works in a Boston Hospital. His best friend Dr. Arthur Lee is arrested and charged with murder caused by an abortion gone wrong. The deceased is the daughter or Dr. J. D. Randall, one of the most prominent doctors in town. Was it deliberate murder? Was it accidental malpractice? The police are under a lot of pressure, and finally slap charges on Dr. Lee. John Berry is convinced that Lee is innocent. He sets out on his own investigation into the matter.It's a fast-paced mystery with the hero uncovering shocking secrets about the girl's life. Of course, it isn't as good as other mystery writers. After all, this was Crichton's first attempt at such a topic, and hardcore mystery fans may not find it much exciting. But the fact that Crichton is a doctor himself, makes up for this. The book has quite a few medical details about surgical procedures and the functioning of hospitals and also a lot of arguments on medical ethics.Quite reminiscent of Robin Cook's medical thrillers but with a very different writing style, the story moves quickly, and seems to have lots of unexpected twists. All in all, it's a superb novel, combining elements of mystery and authentic medical detail making it one of the best books of it's kind.Any fan of Crichton should not miss this book. Originally written under the pseudonym of Jeffery Hudson, this one's a rightful Edgar Award winner. Michael Crichton deserves all the praise he gets. Don't miss this one!"},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"I thought this was a good book, which was dated, yet dealt with an important topic yesterday as it is today; abortion. It was well written and easy to read. Actually had trouble putting it down. If you are strictly anti-abortion you may not like this book, if you're able to put that aside you may like it. I did slam nurses though and I didn't like that aspect of the book. Given the times when it was written, nurses were really looked down upon. Unfortunately many of those stereotypical misconceptions from the point of view of the doctor still carry over today 37 years later. Also brought up the unwritten law of medicine, never to turn against your brother MD no matter how incompetent and dangerous they practice. Another code still largely unbroken today."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"There is always a tough mental block when reading a book that is really outdated. This book deals with a doctor connected to a death through an illegal abortion. A small portion of this book deals with why abortions should be legal, and why there should be pity towards the doctors that perform illegal abortions. Of course, in today?s time, abortions are legal and the point becomes deadened quite a bit.In this book a doctor is accused of killing a woman through an abortion. Another doctor tries to clear his friend by investigating the case thoroughly. Without giving too much away, this book details how the doctor investigates the woman and her well connected family through interviews, spying, medical records, and autopsies.While it is a good mystery novel, Crichton doesn?t deliver his normal brilliance. Unlike the Great Train Robbery, the reader is not totally immersed in the setting. Unlike Sphere, the reader doesn?t get trapped in the suspense and mystery of the situation.A good, quick, and mildly exciting read, it?s out of date and not up to the extremely high standards that I expect from Michael Crichton."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"A Case Of Need : by Michael Crichton 4 Stars It has been three decades since the release of this captivating novel written by Michael Crichton. Originally, in 1969, this breathtaking novel was so 'hot', it was originally written under the alias of Jeffrey Hudson. Today, millions of readers acknowledge Crichton's mastery that begun long ago with this novel. Stephen King himself praised the novel as &quot;Fantastic...I loved it!&quot;. I thought was a little confusing so that's why I gave it the last half star. Other than that the, plot was exhilarating and kept me going until the very end. I recommend this novel to anyone who is interested in stories about medical thrillers and constant suspense. Crichton most probably wrote under the pen name Jeffrey Hudson because he anticipated a mixed reaction from the public. At the time, as it is today, abortion was a very controversial subject that raised many eyes. In this book both opinions of the matter are represented in different characters. The ethics of Art Lee can be matched with someone who believes for abortion while the strict opinion of the public at the time believed against it.- Carlos Encalada"},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"ISBN 0451183665 - The story isn't terrible, the writing style is pretty bad, though. Michael Crichton, aka Jeffery Hudson, has more than made up for this book and if you're a Crichton fan, you might want to read it just for the \\"read them all\\" thing, but don't expect too much.It's the late '60s. Abortion is illegal, and Art Lee has the misfortune to be a Chinese abortionist in Boston when the young member of a prominent family dies from a botched abortion. His friend, pathologist John Berry, has plenty of reason to step up and prove Art's innocence. For one thing, Art is actually innocent of killing Karen Randall. For another, John has been helping Art cover up the abortions he HAS done for a long time. The Randalls use their power to speed up the trial date and John doesn't have much time to put together a puzzle with pieces that just don't fit.There are so many annoyances in this book, it's hard to detail them all. I tried to overlook the medical footnotes, much the way I overlooked the use of the words Negroes and niggers - it's the '60s. Those words would have been commonly used and there was no CSI, meaning the average reader might not have had a clue without the footnotes. Still, Dr. Berry ditches work for a week without apparently reporting to anyone, to play detective. One sentence near the end mentions that he used to be a cop, as if that explained everything. There are several typos throughout, for which the editor gets the blame, but the one that drove me crazy was the medical chart page in the beginning, dated 11/15 or 10/15 - either way, it can't be right. The chapters are dated, starting with October 10th (the date Karen Randall died) and ending October 17th. Typos are little things, but one like that makes me certain they re-issued the book just to capitalize on Crichton's fame and didn't actually care. Suspense novels depend on details, and date of death would be one of those things that ought to matter!- AnnaLovesBooks"},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"I found MC's new introduction to his earliest breakthrough novel, A CASE OF NEED, quite interesting. He talks about the controversy the book stirred when it came out, and how his pseudonym -- Jeffery Hudson -- was used so that nobody in the medical world would know who wrote it. He never planned to be a writer -- he was in Harvard Medical School at the time and needed cash (so he turned out paperback spy stories about the cold war) -- but when he won an award for the novel, he had to accept it in person and his so-called secret was out.If you enjoyed JURASSIC PARK, SPHERE, RISING SUN, or any of MC's other truly fabulous novels (I've read 'em all along with thousands of other classical and modern works of literature), you'll love this oldie from the late 60s. It's like reading a film noir -- told in first person perspective, it's about a doctor investigating the murder case of a fellow employee of a local hospital who has been arrested for aborting a young girl's unborn child and, in turn, unintentionally killing the girl later, after she suffered blood loss from the operation.But did he really do it? That's the question that our protaganist tries to solve -- and the outcome of it all is so simple, and yet also so stunning. As the final page turns, you'll wonder how you never solved it beforehand.It has its flaws. Michael Crichton's early work shows signs of minor problems he would solve later -- whether it be plot mistakes or simply story flow. Plus, I doubt whether a doctor would turn himself into Sherlock Holmes quite so well as he makes the character in this book.That all doesn't matter, because you'll absolutely love this novel, especially if you're a fan. If you're new to Crichton, I suggest JURASSIC PARK, the first novel of his I read (and which totally took me by surprise). But if you're a fan, or you want a good medical thriller from the creator of ER, check this out. It's one of Crichton's better quick-reads."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"This is one of the very few books that I have enjoyed that is written in the first person. The story is about a doctor named John Berry. His coleage is arrested for an abortion gone wrong that ended in murder. So Dr. Berry plays detective and tries to get his buddy out of jail. The book takes place during one week and has an ending that I did not expect at all.This was one of Crichton's first books, and the profit off this one sent him through medical school. The book is full of medical terms and has a lot of footnotes that make you constantly have to move up and down pages. Although this isn't Crichton's best, I didn't even use a bookmark because I never put it down."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"Dr. John Berry is a pathologist who's been covering for a colleague's policy of occasionally providing abortions. The colleague, Dr. Arthur Lee, truly believes that failure to provide medical care - in the form of a safe hospital procedure - constitutes malpractice, morally speaking. He bases this belief on the number of women who, when refused such a procedure, end their pregnancies anyway by methods far more dangerous.Now Art Lee is in jail, charged with an abortion that John Berry believes he didn't perform. The patient, daughter of a prominent Boston surgeon, died. According to her family, Karen Randall was a saintly young woman who's been foully murdered. According to Karen's friends and other associates, though, she was anything else but saintly. The same thing goes for her outraged father, and for most of the other people Dr. Berry winds up investigating as he desperately searches for the truth about Karen's death. Who actually did perform the abortion that killed her? That's the only information sure to free Dr. Lee before his case comes to trial, and a trial all by itself - even if it ends in acquittal - will kill his career, in this medical and social world of the late 1960s.Michael Crichton's first novel, originally published under a pseudonym, is an amazing piece of work for so young a writer (he was 26). It's an intriguing detective story entwined with a stinging commentary on social hypocrisy and medical ethics, that 40 years later had the power to put me back in the world of my own adolescence. A world where unwed motherhood automatically branded the woman as at worst immoral, at best grossly immature; and where the laws of most U.S. states made termination of pregnancy in a hospital all but impossible, except when physicians like the fictional Art Lee and John Berry falsified the patient's diagnosis to provide a D&C; for apparent \\"medical necessity.\\"Brrr. That world's memory scares me all by itself. The surprising thing about this book, though, isn't its \\"message\\" (it ought to be required reading for any woman who's grown up knowing she had control of her reproductive capacity from menarche onward). It's the look backward into the time and place that shaped this successful author, and then realizing - if you've read as many of his books as I have - how hard it was for him to let this world go, in creating the characters and plots for his later works."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"Crichton focuses his microscope on the medical profession in this story of a butchered abortion performed on the daughter of a prominent Boston physician. John Berry is a Boston pathologist who has been helping to cover up the illegal abortions performed by a Dr. Arthur Lee. When Lee is arrested for murder, Berry has to unravel the case before the consequences of his own actions catch up with him. There's a lot of the technical medical terminology that Crichton has made popular on the hit TV show \\"ER\\", and a lot more of the serious analysis of the moral dilemmas that face medical practitioners in the real world, particularly as they relate to abortion. Like \\"ER\\" this is not science fiction, but a very compelling story (actually a murder mystery) informed by substantial scientific knowledge. (Crichton was a medical student at the time this novel was written). As such, there is no speculation here, just the facts as Crichton sees them, in the context of a juicy potboiler that includes licentiousness and loose living among the rich and privileged. The end result is a thoroughly compelling can't-put-it-down page-turner that seems certain to please a mass audience.The down side is that apart from the (admittedly even-handed) discussions on abortion, there really isn't any substance to this novel. The characters are pretty generic, and only the hero really manages to make any claim on our sympathy. Mystery lovers are sure to enjoy this book, as are fans of \\"ER\\", but science fiction fans should not be expecting to find any far-out ideas here. Very entertaining, but not mind-boggling, this book will raise your consciousness about the abortion issue. Just don't expect a whole lot more from it."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"When I got A Case of Need by Michael Crichton, I had extremely low expectations. This was Crichton's first novel, written in 1968, and he was only 26. However this was not the case. The novel was much better then I expected.The novel revolves around a pathologist named Dr. John Berry. Dr. Berry's friend has recently been arrested for murdering a girl who comes from one of the leading medical families in Boston from a bad abortion. Dr. Berry investigates to find out the truth.This is a good story that gives the reader an inside look into the medical industry in 1968. This book is certainly entertaining."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"This was an okay book to read. It was entertaining, however, very forgettable. Having finished the book last night, I had already forgotten the main characters name. Crichton deals with abortion in an evenhanded manner. What the story lacks however seems to be any real substance. The story seems very trite and easy to predict each turn that it will take. It does keep you interested while you read it, but only to confirm what you figured out early on. All in all three stars for the lack of depth found in this novel (unlike most Crichton novels.)"},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"This is very much an average book, with nothing new to offer but for a lot of explanation of a great deal of technical terms used in the field of medicine; and it is these details, which give this book some value.Crichton, I feel is surely one of the best contemporary writers, and is the best, when it comes to writing science-fiction novels. Each one of his books, very different from each other, are not only gripping and entertaining, but also are very informative, with all the importance Crichton gives, to explain in detail, the science, he involves in these books. It is this unique quality of his writing-style, which makes him so different from other contemporary authors.\`A CASE OF NEED' is one of his older novels, and is nothing like his later ones. The novel is basically about this pathologist, who tries to save a fellow-pathologist, who is accused of accidentally killing a young girl - the daughter of a leading doctor, while performing an illegal abortion on her. Though this medical-thriller, in itself, is quite an interesting page-turner, however, in no way does it match the brilliance of his other novels. Being a brilliant page-turner is one thing; but being a brilliant page-turner by Crichton is something else, having a league of its own, and this particular page-turner just doesn't belong to this league. The book proceeds through its course in the most mundane fashion, and builds up to the end, which, in itself, is quite trite. This book is nowhere close to his later medical thriller, \`THE TERMINAL MAN', which undoubtedly, is Crichton's best novel to date.On one hand, this book is a bit of a disappointment. On the other hand, however, not everything about this book is bad. Though in each and every novel of his, Crichton tries to give a detailed description / meaning of the scientific terms / scientific concepts used in the book, in this particular novel of his, however, his explanations to the scientific / medical terms used are to the greatest detail, more than any other novel of his. Moreover, his explanations are so simple, that these explanations can interest even the person, who is most indifferent to medicine.Though this book has a very little entertaining value, (considering the standard of Crichton's other novels) it is really informative. Since this book was one of Crichton's earliest books, (infact, it wasn't even originally written under the name, \`Michael Crichton') he was more of a doctor, than an author, as the book shows. But, in the case of his later books, he developed into a better writer, and hence, as in the case of those novels, he is more of a writer than a doctor."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"As is mentioned by other reviewers here, this is Crichton's first novel, a medical mystery written under an assumed name. Its success convinced him to pursue a career as a writer, rather than medicine. As it took me two career changes to find my own niche, and about 10 more years than it took Crichton, I can relate. He made the right move.I ran across this novel in paperback at the library. Having not read any of Crichton's work since \\"The Andromeda Strain\\" long ago (still a favorite), having been sidetracked from reading much for a few years, I was delighted to find that this very dissimilar story is comparable in terms of not talking down to its audience. Subjective comment, no doubt, but I read it right after \\"The Client,\\" my first Grisham read, which was a tremendous disappointment in this department, written on a grade school level.Crichton moves his characters in and out of the story well in \\"ACoN,\\" and doesn't make the mistake of shoving his readers' noses into plot points by telling them how to think about what's happening. The story involves a pathologist, Dr. Berry, who finds that one of his best friends has been charged with a murder that he is sure was not committed by his friend, although at first he only has intangible belief in said friend's innocence.A remarkable travail through the halls of medical power lead him closer and closer to what really happened, and the sense of danger Dr. Berry labors under is relayed quite well through the events of his investigation to clear his friend; no one else wants to disturb the powers-that-be enough to contradict the official story that Dr. Berry's friend is obviously guilty, and that gap forces Berry into the role of investigator, a frame of mind he is familiar with as a pathologist but not from interviewing living people about an event he can't put under a microscope. The character, thus thrust out of his comfort zone, is certainly rough around the edges and refreshing to read.Crichton's genius partly lies in his ability to present heroic characters who are decidedly unheroic people thrust into extraordinary situations. Since real life often works like this, handing each of us challenges where we rise or fall to the occasion, his tales ring true even when the events are extraordinary. I'm now reading \\"Rising Sun\\" and finding the same bluntness of characterization that I appreciate, and am amused to find that other reviewers here think his characterizations are weak. Hey, Crichton's no Dostoyevsky, but he doesn't talk down to me. I'm a fan."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"the only people that will like this book are michael crichton fans. Anyone else will use it as a coaster. The character have no depth, the dialogue is contrived to the tenth degree, and like all his books, the ending is rushed. I love him but his ending rush to fast and he tries to make up for them by adding filling. He seems to give up interest by the end and just wants to end and get it over with."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"Let's dismiss the fact that Crichton is a great novelist for a moment. Now let's take a look at A Case of Need. The writer obviously knows a lot about medicine. Besides that he can write a heck of a suspenseful fiction story. Now we will take back into account the fact that the writer is Crichton. You can truly say that he is one of the best fiction and science fiction novelists during our day and age. If you like his other books you will definitely love this one."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"I absolutly loved this book. A usual Michael Crichton suspense with a twist medical ending. A must read for adults of all ages."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"Michael Crichton's first serious book, this is really quite an accomplishment. He introduces the suspenseful style sustained throughout his career; I was hooked from the very first sentence. Interestingly, it is written in the first-person, something that Crichton has rarely done again. His distinct style is still omnipresent, however. This is a very good mystery and has a lot of evidence for both sides of the abortion debate -- a hot topic then and now. This is still a highly relevant book. There is a lot of jargon and esoteric information, as readers have come to love and expect. This gives Crichton novels a distinctive documentary-style that is entirely his. This is the real first book from one of the great American authors of the last five decades."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"This book is the best--not only is a great novel with a suspense filled plot, it's also presents great arguments and stuff to think about for both sides of the abortion debate, without even trying. Having been written before Roe v. Wade it presents a glimse into what society would be like if that decision was ever overturned. A must read."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"If you are interested in medical thrillers or suspense-filled stories, this is the book for you.One of Crichton's best, will surely intrigue a broad audience of readers.

It has everything - suspense, drama and a throlling ending. Pick up a copy and read it today!"},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"That was basically it. I really liked the first three quarters of the book--up to the point where Berry first meets with Wilson the lawyer. I was sitting there, with my teeth on edge, waiting for something momentous to happen next, and... it went flat. The ending left waaaaay too many characters just hanging--the father, the stepmother, the other doctors. In general, there were too many of them--doctors Berry meets casually, their names too similarly Anglo-Saxon, their little habits unmemorable--it was difficult to keep up with the names.What I really liked was the little look into what goes on in the world of medicine--and little hamburger places! I don't think I'll ever have a hamburger again in my life... It was also a fascinating, albeit a harrowing, look into the time when the rich women in this country were sent to have their abortions to Puerto Rico, and the poor ones--down dark alleys."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"This book is absoloutly riveting! It has great writing and it starts the action right at the beging of the book, there was no waiting. I recomend it for a good read. This is one of his earliest works, and it is still a great book."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"I thought I had read all things Michael Crichton. But last weekend, my brother loaned me a bag of books and inside was A Case of Need.One part of me loved it because it delved into the medical world - and that brought back so much. The funny things about working with other doctors/nurses and treating patients. The sad/shocking things. That part was really interesting - and showed Crichton's typical obsessive research tendancies (which I love - it makes it believable when the author has researched his topic thoroughly so that he can speak with correct terms, context, etc). This was Crichton's first novel ... and his researching skills have remained one of the reasons his books are usually so well written.The other part of me was turned off from the book right from the start simply because of the topic: a pathologist is trying to find evidence to free a friend of his - a doctor who is accused of doing abortions illegally. He does actually do abortions ... and sometimes for people who are using it as a form of birth control. Married women trying to hide affairs. Ugh. Come on people ... don't be having sex if you can't handle the consequences. If you aren't mature enough to be a parent ... you aren't mature enough to be having sex. Crichton was a Harvard Medical School student when he was writing this (and it was originally published under a pseudonym) - and evidently it stirred up quite the controversy.Abortion is and always will be a hot topic. But if you've ever worked in a hospital ... when you're talking about a persons body and their health ... you can see that it's not always a black and white issue. (I have a friend who is doing an OBGYN rotation in Memphis right now - and he wants them to start offering free sterlizations. He sees 20-30 pregnant teenagers a day. Potheads who are on their 6th and 7th child - whose babies are immediately taken into custody by the state. He's pretty down right now and is ready to move on to his next rotation where things might not seem in such a hopeless cycle.)Maybe Stargate SG-1 could bring the Aschen here to sterilize those who seem incapable of mature and responsible actions!I much prefer Crichton's later novels. Loved The Andromeda Strain (I haven't seen the 1971 movie so I don't know if it's a good adaptation or not!), Timeline (the movie was a pretty good adaptation), Sphere (the movie was .... ok), Airframe (I think this is being turned into a film?), and Jurassic Park (amazing film and effects - great adaptation)."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"Putting aside the political aspect of the book (which the back cover declines to mention by the way!), this story is not a \\"medical thriller,\\" there's absolutely no danger to it at all until about 10 pages from the end,and even then there are huge holes in the story which are never explained. It is also poorly research as far as the abortion issues (I believe), no matter your view point. Finally, there are so many footnotes and references to the appendices that it really is hard to follow. There is very little character development and it's overall just a terrible work of fiction."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"A few details could have been better, but the overall book was ok.I thought the use of medical terminology was light, compared to what some of the other reviewers thought.I didn't like the way nurses were portrayed. It was unrealistic to think that the main nurse could be as loopy on drugs as she supposedly was and continue to work as a nurse, much less in an OR.I didn't like that, and it made the whole story seem a little unbelievable.I did like that the half-Chinese doctor was performing illegal abortions, and that it seemed easier for women of that time-era to seek one out than I had previously thought. In that way it was educational.I didn't like that the main character pretty much set up the nurse in the end, and she could have died while he waited around in the ER for her and/or the rough character to show up hurt or dead, when he was supposedly such a humane person. I went from liking him to disliking him at that point."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"Crichton's first book is fantastic - intriguing throughout.

I'm prone to like anything to do with \\"medical\\" or \\"hospitals\\" and that kind of thing though."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"This was a fantastic read, especially considering how long ago this book was written and published. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and in some ways prefer it over his more recent books. I found it somewhat similar to the better Jonathan Kellerman novels. It is a good read for those who enjoy medical thriller/mysteries."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"A Case of Need was an alright book with a so-so book, but I felt that it could have been better, All of Crichton's other novels such as Rising Sun and Jurassic Park have been great so why not this one? Maybe because he wrote it when he was much younger. I think this was published in the 1960's? Whoa! That's a long time ago."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"The novel Case of Need, by Michel Crichton, is a suspenseful mystery. An abortionist named Art Lee has been accused of murder by abortion. The main character Dr. Berry, a friend of Art Lee, is trying to keep Art out of prison. Dr. Berry is a coroner who believes that Dr. Lee is innocent. The girl who is killed, Karen Randall, was a wild girl who was into drugs and sex. She had already had an abortion four times before she died.The suspense in this story goes in patterns. Like most mystery novels the beginning starts out slow. As the story progresses, the anticipation starts to get more suspenseful. The author uses suspense because it keeps you wanting more. The author wants you to be on the edge of your seat throughout the novel. The basic plot in this novel is that Dr. Berry is trying to get enough information to prove that Art Lee is innocent. The main conflict is finding the information. No one wants to give him any information because they don't want to get caught up in the murder case.The novel shows how real friends should act. In the end Dr. Berry shows the court that Art Lee is innocent and that he had been set up. Although Art is safe he still moves away to pursue a better profession in the field of medicine.

M.C. did an impecable job on this novel."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"\\"A Case of Need\\" is worth reading for a devoted Crichton fan if for no other reason than to mark how much Mr. Crichton has improved since this debut novel. You may criticize that his characters are flat, and dialogue is sometimes lacking; but after you have read \\"A Case of Need,\\" you will be amazed how much Mr. Crichton has improved in his writerly abilities since 1969.The daughter of a prominent doctor dies after having had a botched abortion. A close friend of the protagonist, Dr. John Berry, pathologist, is accused. To muddy the waters, the friend Dr. Lee does do abortions, which were illegal at the time, but is highly professional and is extremely unlikely to have done the deed. Dr. Berry is complicit in that he has supplied Dr. Lee with fake pathology reports to cover the abortions. Dr. Berry sets out to clear Lee to save both of them.Dr. John Berry wins my 2003 prize as Most Unlikable Protagonist. He is rude, arrogant, moody and humorless. Oh, and did I say \\"arrogant\\"? His sleuthing method is to barge in on people, insult them, scream at them and wonder why they aren't inclined to cooperate with him. The author patronizes the reader by explaining each medical term with an asterisk (*). Not only does it slow down the story, half the time we already know the meaning and the other half it doesn't matter. The dialogue is so bad; it is painful. Along with most beginning writers, there are far too many characters for the reader to sort out. The accused Dr. Lee is presented in such an unfavorable way (he and the detestable Dr. Berry were made for each other), the reader doesn't much care if stays in jail or not.I enjoy the Michael Crichton stories, from the \\"Andromeda Strain\\" to \\"Jurassic Park.\\" He is a champion page-turner.

It hasn't exactly inspired me to read any others.The story, as the other reviewers have mentioned, is a medical murder mystery. One thing the curious reader should keep in mind, however, is that the book also is very much involved in the abortion controversy. If memory serves, it was written and originally published in the early 1970s (but sometime before the Roe v. Wade decision), and you can certainly tell Mr. Crichton's opinion on the matter. If you are pro-life/anti-abortion/etc., keep in mind that this book will be at times rather teeth-grinding.But, even with the political/moral issue aside, this work is dreadful. The characters having a stunning resemblence to cardboard cut-outs, the plot meanders like a drunken sailor, all leading up to a conclusion both compressed and totally out of left field (not as in &quot;oh, that's inventive!&quot; but in a more deus ex machina &quot;deadline's coming - I have to wrap this up quick&quot;).Looking at the other reviews, apparently Mr. Crichton's writing has since improved.

It calls to mind the fact that, while the Hippocratic oath expressly prohibits doctors from performing abortions, many doctors do so. Written while abortion was still illegal, it brings forth many of the arguments for both sides of the issue, which I very much enjoyed. The plot is very simply about who performed an illegal abortion on a girl from an affluent family. The plot thickens as the reader realizes that the abortion killed the girl, so the true abortionist is guilty of murder. The several appendices in the book further explain the medical terminology and scenarios used in the book. I would highly reccomend this book to any fan of suspense and drama"},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"A case of need is a book that you can't put down. It is highly underrated and even some Crichton fans haven't heard of it.

The medical establishmentand some of the associated lifestyle choices are brought to question whileexamining the ramifications of dishonesty and false implications.This book is well worth your time to read!"},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"The main character of this book, Dr. John Berry, seems a heck of a lot like Robin Cook's Jack Stapleton. In fact, this book is a lot like a Cook novel except the conspirators that are usually after the hero as he methodically pieces together the clues, are noticeably missing from this book.Berry is investigating the death of a rich college co-ed who died from an apparent botched abortion. Berry's friend who clandestinely does abortions (this is the pre-Roe vs. Wade era) is the main suspect. Berry uses his medical credentials and general ability to intimidate people to interview everyone that might have known the co-ed or who could be a lead to where she went to have her procedure done.The author gives a lot of explanation to many medical terms and the book is a fairly quick read. I would have rated it higher but I felt that the lack of the suspense that normally exists in a Robin Cook novel where the main character has to fight the bad guys, slightly detracted from the book."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"i was kind of suprised when i found out that this book was written in the 60's. It seems that this was a taboo topic (i was not alive yet) that nobody should have really written about. the book is very slow moving and somewhat of a bother to have to go to the appendices to find out the various facts of what crichton is talking about. the novel could have been written better, and thank god that crichton has improved his writing skills. the ending is kind of blah and something that crichton whipped together right before turning in the manuscript to the publisher. it was intrueing to find out the actual lives of the patient and and her family and of how that affected her sitation. although it could have been better, it could have been a lot worse."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"I stumbled on this book quite by accident. I'm not really one for medical thrillers (or maybe it's just that I think Robin Cook is a terrible writer), but when I did a little research and discovered that it was Michael Crichton's first book (published under the pseudonym Jeffery Hudson) and also the recipient of an Edgar Award, I thought, \\"If anyone can do a medical thriller well, it's Crichton.\\" His early books like THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN were great; the later ones, not so much.In A CASE OF NEED, Crichton/Hudson writes tightly. The book was published pre-Roe v. Wade, so in the story abortion is still illegal, and a prominent Boston doctor is arrested for performing them; or, specifically, performing an abortion on the wild-child daughter of a big shot in the local medical community. John Berry, the narrator, is a friend of the accused man and sets out to clear him.I don't know if Crichton was ever a teacher, but if he wasn't - he should have been. Even in this earliest novel, his ability to explain technical concepts in everyday language is a marvel, even though he has to resort to the use of footnotes (and a couple of appendixes) in some cases.The problem, as in so many other Crichton books, is a cast of almost completely undifferentiated characters. Everyone speaks and sounds the same, so it's hard to tell one character from another. The fact that they all have completely white-bread names doesn't help. The plot derails about halfway through, when facts turn out to completely contradict all reliable medical evidence. Some of the family dynamics here seem like something out of Falcon Crest or Dallas; others are so mundane as to be boring.Can't quite see why this was worthy of an Edgar, though the controversial subject matter (and its pro-choice leanings) must have been scandalous back in the day. I finished it with difficulty; never a good sign, because I'd normally finish a book like this in two or three sittings. I didn't much care what happened or who did it, and the one final twist was underwhelming.Still, interesting as a period piece and as a sign of what Crichton would someday become."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"I like all kind of medical thrillers, I like Palmer, Cook, Sheldon (Nothing Last Forever) and of course Crichton, when I started to read these kind of novels, many times I had to go to the dictionary to understand many medical descriptions, or ask some friends what does it mean this or that in the hospital, this book explain all that and after you read it you will understand many things about hospitals and doctors, this book doesn't say anything against any doctor as other medical thrillers, in this book you see how the doctors try to help themselves and their medical friends.The case of the abortion is good, nevertheless you will not know exactly how John knew who was the bad guy, he just found it, so, at the end you will be a little disappointed but you will learn many things about doctors, for example: do you really know why the clothes of the M.D. are white?"},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"A Case of Need centers around John Berry, a local pathologist in the Boston medical community. Quickly, the plot is thrown at you. While at his lab, John receives a call telling him that his good friend Art Lee has been arrested on charges of performing an illegal abortion resulting in the death of a young girl. The plot thickens as it is divulged that the deceased is actually the daughter of one of the most prestigious doctors in all of Boston, J.D. Randall. The Randall family was renowned throughout all of Boston as being a 'medical family'. Karen, however, the deceased, had spun off from tradition and was definitely the rebellious one in the family. During college she dormed with some friends, Bubbles and Angela, a training nurse. Throughout the novel John accumulates a plethora of facts that point to a few suspects that include Peter Randall, Karen's uncle, Angela Harding, Karen's roommate, and Roman Jones, an old boyfriend. The book drew me in until the final pages. The end I thought was a little confusing so that's why I gave it the last half star. Other than that the, plot was exhilarating and kept me going until the very end. I recommend this novel to anyone who is interested in stories about medical thrillers and constant suspense. Crichton most probably wrote under the pen name Jeffrey Hudson because he anticipated a mixed reaction from the public. At the time, as it is today, abortion was a very controversial subject that raised many eyes. In this book both opinions of the matter are represented in different characters. The ethics of Art Lee can be matched with someone who believes for abortion while the strict opinion of the public at the time believed against it."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"because, in my opinion, 1) there were too many characters than neccessary (I kept getting names mixed up), 2) a lot of jargons, terms, abbrieviations, etc., were very well explained, but the reason why Karen Randall had gained weight and become hairy prior to her death as noticed by almost every other character was omitted, surprisingly. I assume it was a symptom of being addicted to whatever she was getting high on or did I miss something? (If somebody would care to enlighten me, I'd appreciate it.), 3) Not enough 'suspense' factor. Otherwise, it was educational and thought-provoking."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"I found it to start out great but then the story dragged on too long. I loved Disclosure and Rising Sun and felt like I wasted my time with this book."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"Am I correct in stating that this book is very underrated because it is his oldest work? I assume I am. That is unfair judgement in opinion. A Case of Need is an excellent medical thriller that was written after Crichton graduated from medical school. The plot is very fast paced and the suspense is plentiful. The case is a very serious and heavy one, and is solved throughout the book as more clues are unravelled and revealed.WARNING: SPOILERS*The plot concerns a medical doctor, John Berry, who is working in his office one afternoon when he hears of a colleague that has been jailed for the murder of a young woman. Berry immediately takes action, and asks his friend about the situation. He denies to the crime. He also states that the woman came into his office and requested an abortion. He declines the request, and the girl is mysteriously brought in the following morning and dies of vaginal hemorrhage. John Berry attempts to clear his colleague, after a sequence of autopsies, clues, and more mysterious findings. I feel I should not reveal anymore of the plot to you. You need to read the book for yourself and appreciate it. By the national bestselling author Michael Crichton."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"This Crichton book is a far cry from his later thrillers. Some of these later books, like Jurassic Park, I find very engaging, but others seem too shallow and hastily written. I think that in this book, Crichton really had a passion for his subject matter (he almost became a doctor) and in this context, the details and footnotes that some find too in-depth for a supposedly quick read are actually helpful and intriguing in my opinion. I actually liked learning what all the medical lingo meant, and the fact that it was written and set during the 60's gave it an extra dimension to consider. The many different descriptions of doctors, hospitals and medical stories were an interesting departure from my average read. The only thing that did bother me about the book was that the plot did not seem like the most engaging medical subject--abortion is controversial, but the actual circumstances of death and investigation did not seem very fascinating to me. However, the book still kept my interest with the general medical stories and details, and it should be noted that Crichton was 26 when he wrote it, and not practiced yet. Generally I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"A Case of Need helped introduce some medical history, and medical terms to the layperson. It gives the reader the thrill of being on the treatment end of the ER. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a bit of suspense, and enjoys reading grammatically challenging books. However, the ending was a little bit weak. Therefore, I gave the book 4 stars."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"Mom loves Michael Crichton. I will ask her what she thinks after she reads it. Was a gift to her."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"A case of need was first published in 1968 under the pen name Jeffrey Hudson, just one year before Crichton published Andromeda strain, which was his first novel under his own name. Crichton used several names in his early career even after he was publishing under his own name: besides this book as Jeffrey Hudson, he published 8 novels as John Lange from 1966 to 1972 and 1 as Michael Douglas in 1970. A case of need is a medical mystery/thriller that reflects Crichton's education at Harvard medical school. It has lots of medical jargon, most of which is translated in footnotes. The story is compelling - an illegal abortion resulting in the patient's death, the immediate arrest of a maybe-innocent doctor, and another doctor's investigation to uncover the truth. Multiple suspects emerge as more and more dirty laundry is discovered. There are too many unlikely coincidences for some readers' tastes, and the investigating doctor's accurate prediction of the final end game is not credible at all. Still, it's an exciting read. I liked it."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"I've been a big fan of Michael Crichton ever since I read The Andromeda Strain. Not only is his writing style suspenseful and interesting, but his attention to detail regarding the subject matter can be a learning experience. A Case of Need will certainly give you pause regarding the medical field and the lengths that some doctors would probably go to in order to cover their backsides. Once you are into a Crichton novel it's almost impossible to put down until you are finished."},{"Title":"Case of Need","review":"I rarely read true stories, but after this one, Crichton has redeemed himself. It's interesting, informative and breathtaking. I love it!!!(^u^)"},{"Title":"Green Mansions","review":"Green Mansions starts off well, and the story picks up in the final third of the book, but in between the narrative falters to the point that I was tempted to abandon the book, something which I don't often do. The protagonist, Abel, is not particularly likable -- which I don't believe was the author's intent -- and even allowing for the time period in which the book was written, Abel displays a surprising degree of condescension towards the natives and white men alike on whose hospitality he often depends. My general dislike for Abel made Green Mansions all the more difficult to stick with through its protracted longueur. The religious/eco-mystical aspects of the novel, however, are intriguing, and the writing is lush and evocative. I don't regret the time invested in reading Green Mansions, but it's extremely unlikely that I'll ever feel a need to revisit the book."},{"Title":"Green Mansions","review":"Those of you who have read Rand Johnson's &quot;Arcadia Falls - A Fable&quot; will find interesting parallels here, albeit in a Victorian idiom, as Hudson presents a moving and mysterious romance against a backdrop of great natural beauty, in this case the South American jungle."},{"Title":"Green Mansions","review":"The book is fine for reading, but a bit brittle and yellowed pages, stains.

Somehow it speaks to my inner senses and dreams,and has alot to teach us about human love and love of our mother earth."},{"Title":"Green Mansions","review":"This novel which is uncharacteristic of Hudson,disappointed me because it resembled a romantic work of a lesser author. Perhaps Hudson didn't know personally the area of the Venezuelan rainforest to the degree he knew Argentina and Uruguay, and used the findings of the early explorer von Thurm, who studied the many indigenous people of the Guianas. It came over as repetitive and a bit like watching a modern romantic film on jungle life.The famous film \\"Green Mansions\\" of the fifties with Audrey Hepburn and Anthony Perkins is decidedly agonisingly horrendous, but I would much rather read Hudson's naturalistic books on the pampas and the gauchos which belong to a historical reality, even though now seemingly romanticised."},{"Title":"Green Mansions","review":"Excellent book. Read as a child and now re-visited. Sad ending but still so well written and thought-provoking. The themes of this book will stay with you for a very long time."},{"Title":"Green Mansions","review":"I am really shocked to see this book rated so highly and raved as a \\"classic\\", I find it incredibly boring and full of prejudice.For the record, around the same time, I also read W.H. Hudson's \\"Far away and Long ago\\" which I really like and will give a 5-star rating, but I must judge this book by its own merit and not by my opinion of the author.To start, the story in this book is rather boring. Nothing really happens. Our hero, Abel, because of some misfortunes ended up living with some native tribes (\\"Indians\\"). One day he wanders into a forest and heard some bird-like noise. Eventually he found out this to be from a pretty girl (Rima) the only survivor of a lost race. Abel accidentally reveals the girl's ancestral grounds and together with the girl's adopted \\"grandfather\\" they set out to go there. They got there but did not find the girl's people, confirming Abel's theory that they are extinct. Then the girl decides to go home first and was killed by the Indians (the tribe that Abel initially lived with). Abel finds another group of settlement people to wipe out the entire tribe of Indians, and carries the Rima's ashes to the coast.But really, there is nothing much happening here, especially between Abel and Rima, and the descriptions of Rima is all idealistic and superficial. What's more, the author's (Abel's, as the book was written in first-person from Abel's perspective) attitude towards Indians is full of prejudice -- they are indolent, lazy and devious. The author's attitude toward the girl's adopted grandfather is also very mean-spirited. As described in the book, the old man rescued Rima's mother, then brought up Rima, and did no evil deeds (although he may have had some in the past), which is really a remarkably noble act, yet Abel always looks down on him contemptuously and snobbishly. To avenge Rima's death, Abel's action is nothing short of ethnically cleansing (the entire tribe, which hosted and fed him, was completely wiped out). This is simply deplorable.Of course, I understand we cannot judge a book written more than 100 years ago by today's standard -- I fully understand that. But even by literary standards, I find this book severely flawed."},{"Title":"Green Mansions","review":"I read it in the fifties, when I was 17 or 18 on italian (verdi dimore).

His couple of paragraphs about 'A Crystal Age' stimulated my interest but nowhere could I find the novel he referred to. However, I did find 'Green Mansions' and I have read it several times. It is a beautiful novel with an undertone of darkness (is death the darkness that we all live with during the beauty of life?). Perhaps 'Green Mansions' disappointed me a little after triggering my romantic nerve. I did, however, keep exploring the writings of WH Hudson - 'Long Ago and Far Away', 'The Purple Land', 'Idle Days in Patagonia' and the wonderful 'A Shepherd's Life'.On a recent trip to the States I visited a small specialist bookshop where it was suggested I might be able to get access to 'A Crystal Age' through abebooks.com. This was great advice. I have just finished reading 'A Crystal Age' and I concur with JB Priestley's assessment. 'A Crystal Age' is worth the effort of pursuing - it is a surprising first-person utopian novel in which Hudson's love of nature does not render him oblivious to the fact that there are downsides in all worlds - all imaginable worlds. Just like the dark shadows in 'Green Mansions'. The end of 'A Crystal Age' is so surprising - I believe very few readers would see what is coming - I certainly didn't as I rushed on towards it. There is a certain illogic to the ending, but there is also something that haunts me continuously. I hope the illogic has not been a contributing factor in this novel's failure to be reprinted. But why else has it not been picked up - I am sure there is a market.'A Crystal Age' is a stronger less romantic novel than 'Green Mansions', but it is also exceptional for many reasons. I don't hesitate in recommending 'Green Mansions' but I also urge readers to pursue 'A Crystal Age' - it is only a matter of time before I will be re-reading it myself. As for publishers who are looking for books from the past to reprint - give 'A Crystal Age' a look."},{"Title":"Green Mansions","review":"My mother having read this book sometime before I was born in the 50's, was so moved that she named me after Rima.

Mr. Abel is vulnerable to his new environment's treacherous heat, its indigenous wildlife, the cruelties (as well as the hospitality) of its native peoples, and suffers periods of disease and starvation.Mr. Abel falls in love with a strange, beautiful, and exceedingly elusive young woman, named Rima, who has a rare affinity with nature and its creatures. Rima, whose mysterious family background figures strongly in the plot, is raised by her grandfather, Nuflo, after her mother dies. Mr. Abel accuses Nuflo of hypocracy, but eventually comes to respect him. Mr. Abel, despite his background and personal attitudes, learns to adapt to and eventually to accept nature on its own terms.

I also enjoyed the enthusiasm and insight into the forest and it's people provided by the Abel the story's narrator and main character as he travels from the city on the coast to the interior of the continent and depths of Amazonia.Although this is a Victorian-era novel, it is not a difficult read, and it is a notable and well worthwhile book.

Themes of civilzation vs. savagery and the untouched beauty of the tropics vs. development are found throughout Green Mansions, but these issues are encased in a love story that holds notes of mystery, fantasy, and romanticism.While the novel provides a good introduction to the naturalist writings of this period (and a much easier read than most of the more scientific prose being written at the time), I thought that the ending was not as developed as the rest of the book, in addition to being highly unsatisfying. The novel does, however, offer wonderful descriptions of the wild forests of the region, and develops fantastical characters, particularly in the case of Rima, the primary female character."},{"Title":"Green Mansions","review":"William Henry Hudson's novel Green Mansions is an exotic romance that takes place in the South American rainforest.

This is the only book I have found that has pictures of her Escondido work-- it is a magical place and one can get a feel for it through this book."},{"Title":"Niki's World (Adventures in Art)","review":"I LOVED this book. It's written, it seems, to be a children's book. Yet it works well for adults to explain who Niki is as an artist in simple terms to people who may not be educated about art, especially \\"modern\\" art. I showed it to my sister who never appreciated Niki's work and she finally began to understand it. . The book is simply and wonderfully written. A real find for the Niki fan or someone who may not be."},{"Title":"Niki's World (Adventures in Art)","review":"I bought this book to keep at my house for when my 6-year-old niece visits. She liked it so much that her mom bought another copy of it to keep at their house."},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"Goldie's autobiography is a spiritual journey through her life - its touching and sincere accounts of life-changing events gives the reader a unique view into the life of a movie icon. What you realize is that Goldie is one of us - yes, an amazingly accomplished actress, but also a loyal friend, a loving mom, and a genuine, down-to-earth person.Most noteworthy is the fact that Goldie did not find the need to disparage anyone from her past in order to accurately tell her story.If possible, I'm more of a fan after reading her book."},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"I just recently started this book...its just amazing so far. And for those who don't seem to pay attention they apparently didn't read the part about the book not being some Hollywood tell all story of Goldie Hawn's existence but an uplifting and maybe even a little bit of a unconventional story of the life of a wonderful woman. I haven't gotten that far in the book but what I have read so far...is beautiful her linguistics and imagination and memories are beautiful and so far well worth the time. You read of some tragedy or just some negative memories she has and for a moment the book doesn't seem that great anymore but at the end of every chapter Goldie leaves you with this positive insight that just is so beautiful, the way this woman thinks and perceives the world is just amazing. Overall this book honestly is intoxicating and I recommend it to anyone that wants a uplifting and intriguing experience."},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"I expected to like this book; I tend to enjoy reading first person accounts of famous women's lives. What I didn't expect was such a candid accounting of Goldie's spiritual awakenings throughout her life. This sweet soul goes out of her way to learn more, be more, and share more in order to live fully at every age.Even though I wrote a book about creating our own joy, Goldie said it best in her last chapter when she wrote, \\"How can we count our moments of joy one by one...they should accumulate and be worn throughout life like a mantle of wealth, in which we can drape ourselves, at any given moment.\\"A very good read, I hated to see it end. But since the author is alive and well, this reader is assured that nothing has concluded at all. Miss Hawn seems to be ever-evolving."},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It is very inspiring and I found out a lot about goldie that I didn't know before. She is so happy and it's refreshing to hear about her talking about her struggles in life and at one point in her life when she delt with depression and how she got through it and now is a really happy joyful person who seems to have found peace in her life. The only drawback in the book is that the first chapter is when she's older and then it goes back to her being a child and growing up which, I didn't understand why that was first. Also, in some parts of the book I felt there were certan times when she gave too much information. I also wish she had spoken more about being buddhist and how she came to discover it and study it. Otherwise It's a great book and I give it 4 1/2 stars. I also just started reading you can do it! by lauren catuzzi grandcolas."},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"Goldie Hawn has written an amazing memoir. Once you pick the book up, you will not want to put it down. She speaks lots of words of wisdom in this book. She defines the difference between males and females better than any description I have heard before. She also tells how when bad things happened to her, she moved on, almost immediately and didn't dwell on them. I think this is some of the greatest advice people can receive. So many times, especially when young women are taken advantage of sexually, they can't seem to get past it. But Goldie explains how to go on, go foward, don't look back. She had the most wonderful, loving parents and I think that is the main reason she was able to be so strong. Perhaps for those who don't have this kind of parental guidance is why they can't get past their past. I only had one parent, that being my father, but he was so strong and we knew that we were so loved that it has given me strength all of my life so I could identify with Goldie. I feel that Goldie is trying to be as honest as possible as she tries to convey her life experiences. The dingy parts she played were just that, playing, acting but not her at all. She is a very intelligent and deep person who seems to have it all together as she has grown as a person over the years. I love the flower she uses - a lotus grows in the mud but when it is finally exposed to the light, it is a most beautiful flower. ENJOY!!!!!"},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"Goldie,she is truely a breath of fresh air. Her honesty is to be admired. She's always just wanted to be happy. She has found it. How she finds it...it's in the book."},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"I have been a fan of Goldie's since I was a child in the 70's. I was looking forward to reading her autobiography because I expected she would discuss at length the \\"behind the scenes\\" details on making the movies she's known for such as Private Benjamin, Best Friends, Seems Like Old Times, Overboard, etc. I was not disappointed at all to soon learn that this was about her life, apart from her \\"job\\" as an actor. I had no idea that this woman has led such an incredibly rich life, without considering her films. Reading about her childhood, her relationships with her father, mother, sister, partner, and children were all moving and revealing. What was also interesting was her search for answers about life, and what she has learned along the way. I was surprised how wise this person is, and I have a newfound respect for Ms. Hawn. I applaud her for all work she has done off-screen in addition to on. I was even brought to tears on more than one occassion in some very touching and well-written parts of her story. So, although I wanted to read all the hollywood gossip about her working relationships with Chevy Chase, Warren Beatty, Meryl Streep, Woody Allen, etc., I fully appreciated the story she chose to tell instead about her personal journey through life. And I didn't want it to end. I love Goldie even more now!"},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"I love Goldie because she's real, genuine and has lived her life that way. There's a lot more under that blonde crown than she's given credit for. I love her true, positive spirit!! A GREAT READ! A MUST READ! TRUE INSPIRATION!!! Linda Masemore Pirrung, author of EXPLOSION IN PARIS.... EXPLOSION IN PARIS"},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"Goldie Hawn is one of Hollywood's more interesting stars, since not only has she more or less had a hit or miss track record with movies, but she managed to last over 30 years in a business where it was more likely for her to be a flash in the pan. But still, she's a gifted woman, possessing the ability to make you forget your problems and just laugh, if only for an hour and a half.That's why I was thrilled to read her memoir. Admittedly, she doesn't reveal much dirt about Hollywood life (though she does mention her personality clashes with Walter Matthau and Jonathan Demme), and at times it feels like she is holding back instead of being brutally honest. I strongly believe if you are going to tell your story, you have to do it all the way or not at all, but Goldie even admits she's going to hold back, for better or for worse, and does not apologize.More a collection of stories than one cohesive story, they are all wonderful and uplifting. The best ones are the beginning ones, about the days before she was famous. Some of the highlights include \\"Integrity,\\" a story about how Al Capp tried to seduce her, only for her to refuse and have him tell her she'd never make it in show business (famous last words), and for her to make it before his show made the air, and others, such as one where the power goes out, and a bunch of strangers and her comfort each other in the dark of her apartment, with candles burning.Goldie Hawn fans may enjoy this more than others, and if you want a tell-all book dishing the dirt on Hollywood, this is not the book for you. If you want to read a collection of stories, with the theme of \\"what's less is more,\\" you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"I didn't know a lot about Goldie Hawn when I bought this book. I love biographies and since I had always had a great impression of her, thought it would be interesting. The pretty cover also helped!This is a wonderful book about a wonderful person! It was very interesting to learn about Goldie Hawn's childhood and career path. I was happy to know there is such a great person who struggled yet achieved so much, simply for trying to live a happy life.Goldie Hawn is a great example and role model of a person who truly appreciates life for what it is!This is an emotional, funny and inspirational book. Easy to read, I felt this is a true story written from the bottom of her heart. This book shows a humble, strong yet normal person just like a lot of non-famous people like a lot of us.It is great to know there are extraordinary people in the world, such as Goldie Hawn!"},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"This is one of the most solid, profound manifestations of literature the contemporary world has ever encountered -- a literally \\"transformational\\" monument in words. It is nearly poetry (and does include some verse, a moving homage to Elvis the night he died) in its rhetorical delicacy and beauty. And we have always known there was a lot more depth to Ms. Hawn than the painted go-go dancer we first saw on Laugh-In; life lessons and other studies have provided her with the cerebral ammunition to voice amazing (yet true) scientific conclusions, such as \\"The brain is awesome.\\" Most striking for me was learning that I did not really need to read this great work, in order to absorb it. I could merely stand near someone else who was reading it, and the dendrites of my brain's neurons would pick up that other person's thoughts, like a radio receiver getting transmissions. It's too late for me to do this (since I could not know whether I was receiving information via my dendrites, or merely accessing my memories of this fine book), but you might want to check that out."},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"A waste of time for me. I borrowed a copy from my friend. Completely light weight. I guess I expected more depth. Now, who is the stupid one? Depth from Goldie Hawn? Well, I had hopes. She canNOT be as dippy as the girl from Laugh In, but I am afraid she is. At least she maintains that image in this new age-y, let-me-enlighten-you piece of froth. \\"All I ever wanted was to be happy,\\" she recalls from her days as a very small child. Right. I'm sure.It's easy to pontificate about Buddhism and how material things are really meaningless when you're sitting on $200 million. Give up your money, Goldie, your penthouse in NY, your $10million house in Montana, your home in Canada for your son's convenience, your cars, your \\"assistants\\", your jewelery, etc., and move into an ashram and then I'll have a little more respect for her views on \\"life\\" as a Buddhist.As for her childhood memories, they seem very \\"exact words\\" and although I have a memory and can recall conversations word for word, as well, I find her recollections a little hard to take, re the one on wanting to be happy: I was a very happy kid too and my childhood was wonderful, but I didn't KNOW it until I was able to understand the concept of happiness, to understand how others lived, and that certainly didn't happen to me when I was five.I hope it was printed on recycled paper. It's a shame any tree had to die for this.I think she probably babbled on and a ghost writer did the hard part. And if I was him or her, I'd never let ANYONE know I did THIS book."},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"This book was awful. I cannot believe all the great ratings people have been giving it! First, it was obviously NOT written by Ms.Hawn - she had an omnipresent ghost writer. Second, the regurgitated \\"wisdom\\" that is spewed is simply that! I do not want a pampered, silly Hollywood-ite to tell me how to raise my children, look at spirituality and live my life and that is basically what she attempts to do. Ugh! I can't begin to tell you how insipid and flimsy this book is. DO NOT BUY!!!"},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"I have just started reading this book - I have always loved Goldie Hawn. She has a light, flitty personality which can be very entertaining to watch. I don't know much about her personal life as I rarely delve that deeply unless a person makes a marked impression on me in my daily dealings in life. Very rare.The only thing I wish to comment on thus far is the misnomer of the title of the book. When I think of a Lotus growing from the Mud, I can't help but think of a successful person who has been born into a horrible home, abused, with painful beginings. Ms. Hawn clearly states in most of the chapters I have read thusfar that her mother was very caring, coddling and supportive during her young childhood. This is hardly growing out of mud. So, I can't see the relationship between her life and the title of her book."},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"I've seen pics of Goldie with the Dali Lama and was looking to get a spiritual picture of who she is. I found this book to be very elementary...just entries into a diary, she did try to sound deep but it came off as stale,I wish I hadn't been disappointed! I consider myself lucky that a friend had the book so I didn't loose $$$$....sorry Goldie!"},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"For someone who looks like, as Elvis said, a chicken just hatched, she does come off as particularly not introspective, as so far I could tell, she doesn't mention her first husband, and barely mentions her second, except to say he looked terrified in the delivery room. For someone who dotes on her kids, there's not much about them either. He does spend a lot of time on her father, as it appears to be a version of her father which appeared with her in the movie Protocol. He is not eccentric, but appears to be and her mother is certainly not a performer but appears to have wanted what her daughter got in life. She is candid about Swing Shift, which was a mess, and Private Benjamin, which wasn't and she details the Eileen Brennan car crash in a way I've never seen described in the press. Still not very much about her or her current projects."},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"The very words spiritual journey mean you're in for many chapters of searching for who knows what, but searching, searching, searching, and it's not that fascinating. Hawn says very little, sometimes nothing at all, about most of her career and her three main relationships. Still, you get the impression she is one of the least-Hollywood people in Hollywood. Somehow she came from a close and loving family, even though her parents didn't stay together. Unlike other celebrities who were sexually abused as a child and never told anyone and suffered as a result, she screamed when it was happening and told her mother immediately and that was the end of that. She seems like a very happy, outgoing person who truly enjoys other people, so why she is on this constant spiritual journey to find something is a mystery to me. I admire her for never getting her [...] enlarged. And she very tactfully doesn't say bad things about anybody except Al Capp. I was surprised to find her as religious as she is. At the same time, this means the book is a bit dull."},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"This is one of the best biographys I have read. She is so insightful and amazing. I really liked this book."},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"I got this book for my Mom for Christmas, she loves it."},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"Very disappointed. This is no Ved Mehta book."},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"I was a big fan of Goldie back when and kind of lost interest for awhile. When I heard she wrote a book I became mildly interested. After reading this book, I love Goldie again. She is a caring, sensitive, compassionate person. Anyone who can't see that in reading her book is obviously threatened by her openness and honesty. She is just another human being trying to get through life and on the way trying to do her part for humanity. I could not put this book down. It is something I needed at this time. I have a hard time trying to be happy in this unhappy world. Sometimes I don't think happiness exists. After reading Goldie's book, I have faith that it is out there if you believe in yourself and work at removing the obstacles that stand in your way. Having patience with yourself and others goes a long way. I like Goldie's reference in the book about slowing down. Everybody is in such a hurry. I work at taking my time, walking slowly, breathing in the (sometimes) fresh air. Take time to read this book. Laugh, cry, and rejoice with Goldie! Thanks for sharing your life's journey with us Goldie. You Rock!"},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"Well, the only reason I bought this book was because when Iwas in high school in 1967, I read a \\"local girl makes good\\"article in the school newspaper. It was about Goldie Hawn, whohad graduated from the same high school a few years earlier, andnow had a role on a TV sitcom. That was the first time I everheard of her.So when the book appeared in the local bookstore, I pickedit up and started reading it, not intending to buy it, justlooking for some nostaglic thrills as she talked about the placesand events of her childhood, which presumably would correspondto some of the places and events of my childhood.Well, from that standpoint the book was disapointment,as there weren't many such nostalgia-triggeringreferences. But to my surprise, the book really grabbed me, Icouldn't put it down, and I had to buy it. I don't normally readbiographies of movie stars -- my intereests lie elsewhere -- butthis one grabbed me. I had several sleepless nights until Ifinished reading the book.What is is that grabbed me so much? I'm not very articulateabout such things, but all I can think of is that somehow, viathe writing style or whatever (I know it was ghost-written), thebook made me identify with Goldie Hawn. Her life path has nothingin common with mine, and her presepctive on things (thespiritual-mystic stuff) has nothing in common with mine, but forthe duration of the book, I felt like I was inside her, seeingthe world from her perspective, experiencing her life. Whatmore can you expect from this kind of book? It just had meriveted.And in the end, the book made me feel like I would like tomeet Goldie Hawn if possible. (Of course it will never happen).So, I have to recommend this book."},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"I enjoyed reading every page of this book. Goldie is such a great lovable person and she writes a powerful honest book. Goldie's message about life is truly inspirational and uplifting.I am purchasing five copies of this book and sending them to each of my children I feel they will benefit from reading about Goldie's parents loving relationship raising their children. Relationships in life are important and how you interact with people. You must love and know who you are first before you love and interact with others.After reading this book I stand in awe of Goldie Hawn. She is a remarkable person who lives her life being true to herself.I would highly recommend this book to all. Thank you, Goldie for sharing your life and your memories. You are so loved and respected. I wish you and your family all the happiness that you deserve.

What it is: chapters of experiences in Goldie's life and what she learned from each one.It's a great book . . . written with a sense of fun, yet with an underlying stability and with the knowledge that family and relationships are the most important elements of our lives.This book will offer you insights and reading it will give you a sense of calm.I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"I was walking thru one of my favorite superstores when I came across this book - the always beautiful woman made me notice the cover but the title made me pick up this book containing steps of her journey thru life.At first I was a little intimidated or should we say annoyed with the size of this book. Memoirs are normally not this large in size and I immediately wondered what piles of conceit can someone so young in life have to say. I expected this from maybe Oprah but not Goldie. And that was not an attack on neither person but more of an explanation of what I have seen from the work and travels of both women. I later became glad the book contained such volume, for there was no way to tell her tale in short for the tale would have been missing all the reasons life is beautiful.I have not had the fortune of seeing all of her movies, but I will say I have had the fortune of reading this book. And her spirit is lovely. She does not force her beliefs on the reader but more of explains how she came across these beliefs.How very unfortunate if you don't find this book enjoyable. I or the rest of the reviewers who are watching the Lotus grow from our own version of mud - will not hold it against you.For those of you who are open, perhaps spiritual and easily touched, don't let the size of this book intimidate you. It's a good read by a good person."},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"I love Goldie Hawn and will see any movie she's in, many times. (How could she not have been nominated for an Oscar for First Wives Club??) That said, this book was disappointing. She's interesting to listen to on talk shows, so I was surprised I couldn't read this book without my mind wandering. Maybe I'm just not that interested in Goldie's musings on...breathing...life...karma...whatever. Too ephemeral for me, not enough real-life feelings and details."},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"Until I read this book, I knew Goldie Hawn as a funny and wonderful and lovable actress. After reading it, I realized she was much, much more. She is a wise, extraordinary woman.This book flows seamlessly between Goldie's memorable life experiences and her reflections upon these. She teaches by example a way to look at life with a perspective I found compelling because it includes gratitude and generosity not only to those around us but also to ourselves and those who came before us. Goldie shares her life challenges, doubts, and confusions as well as her joys. I felt the turmoil and triumphs of her relationships with friends, family, and the arts, especially dance, as her words carried me along with her on her captivating journey.This is not a \\"self help\\" book, but I found out more about myself as I learned more about Goldie's experiences. Her willingness to share fear, vulnerability, pain, as well as spirituality, love, and joy are so forthright that it was easy to make a personal connection with Goldie through the good times and the bad.One resounding message comes through that I can't be reminded about enough. Being a compassionate parent, appreciative child, a great friend or lover, offer us opportunities to give and receive unconditional love - a profoundly nurturing source of strength, comfort, and self-generosity.It was as if the more I read Goldie tell her stories, the more aware I became of my own. I now enjoy friends, family, and indeed each new day with a brighter smile - and I'm not surprised because Goldie's smile has kilowatts to spare."},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"This is undoubtedly one of the best books I have read and the best \\"biography\\" I've seen!In a collection of \\"short stories,\\" Goldie expresses to readers her joy for life and all that it has to offer!

Certainly not for the new agey blather that pours forth in this one. I want to know about their lives, how they got where they are, who they met along the way and a bit of dish about the rich and famous. Goldie gives advice about raising kids (who asked?) but never really talks about her kids. She never writes about why she married her two husbands or hooked up with Kurt and only mentions in passing that her marriages broke up. She flits about the world dispensing goodness and light like a rich hippie. I thought it was especially funny when she talked about a \\"simple life\\" vacation in Ibiza (I suspect a housekeeper did all the cooking and laundry without the usual modern conveniences) and then whinges about having to return to her Malibu beach house. I find the remembered \\"conversations\\" annoying since they are clearly works of fiction. Who remembers every detail of what someone said 50 years ago? Come on. She mentions Eileen Brennan's awful accident but never tells us if she has kept in touch with Eileen and how's she's doing now. As someone else noted, she clearly had a ghostwriter. Hope he/she was well paid. Frankly, I knew this book was a loser from the first page, and if I hadn't paid for it I wouldn't have bothered to read it. I eventually just skimmed over the philosophy parts to get to whatever little action was contained in it. I'm at a loss to understand all the positive reviews that appear here."},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"I adore Goldie Hawn. She has always struck me as a person who would be so much fun to know because of her laughter and bright sunny disposition. I have been a fan since I first saw her on Laugh In, and have thoroughly enjoyed her in everything since. I have had this book for several years and just never got around to reading it because I thought it was going to be another typical autobiography. I picked it up yesterday, and read it straight through. This is not a tell all, reveal all autobiography. This is a remembrance of special moments in Goldie's life, and it is special. She is special! She is one of the rare stars who looks like and seems like she enjoys life and laughter and she absolutely adores her family. She was blessed to be raised in a loving family who supported her and loved her through her rise to fame, and she loved and supported them in turn, and still does. This is a very special book, one I feel that you will enjoy. As I said, I read it in one day and I am sorry that it is over because I just wanted more and more from this delightful lady.

Enjoy her book, and then move on."},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"I'm glad to have read the book about Goldie Hawn, and to have gotten to know more about her. One thing that wasn't detailed, was her work at the New York Worlds Fair, in 1965, and what kind of person she was back then. Well, she was a GO-GO Dancer at a bar on the Fair Grounds and danced in a cage just like the one you would see on \\"Laugh In\\", and was told she acted in real life just like she acted on the Show. I worked at the Worlds Fair, as a Host for one of the Big Three Automobile Company's, and fellow party goer's wanted to hook me up with Goldie, because they thought we were both crazy, and they wanted to see what would happen if we met. Well, that didn't happen, I had to escort a Miss Universe contestant throughout the fair that day, and couldn't get word out that I would be a no show. And thus, I never got to meet Goldie. Darn! I'm still just as crazy, I'm told, and am now on Youtube. As the:King Of Woodward."},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"There is a ghost in Goldie's past and I firmly believe that she is the one who wrote this book (could it be the life-long soulmate who acted as her assistant for thirty years but that she does not elude to throughout the book? Possibly either of her two husbands who she emotionally shoves aside while focussing so intently on those in her life that have made her feel so very special?).I guiltily admit that I did finish reading this book but only under the pretense that it is not a memoir but, instead, a work of fiction based on twisted reality. Goldie's excruciatingly detailed accounts from 5 months old (who at that age remembers sucking on their toes or the smell of baby lotion?) through adolescence left me skeptical from the turning of the first page. If she can make that up, what else did she embellish? And I stopped counting after fifty times her use of the word \\"beloved\\". I have subsequently become desensitized to the use of that beloved adjective. Thanks Goldie."},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"Goldie's book is fun, enlightening, and pleasant to read.

And her laughter simply bubbles."},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"Goldie Hawn is not the person you think you know.this is an interesting book from an interesting person.Great read!"},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"I could not finish the book. I did skim through the second half, but I could not read it through. Actually, it is horrible.I know the title a reference to Buddhism, and on and on about that, but for someone who has had two failed marriages and doesn't trust her live in boyfriend and father of one of her children enough to marry him, she has a lot of nerve lecturing everyone else how to live, how enlightened she is. She has a lot of nerve period. What, is she the lotus that grew out of the mud of Takoma Park?Everything in the book that is autobiographical is old news. Nothing new.What is ridiculous to me is how the photo on the cover of the book and the ones on recent magazine covers are so polished. I've seen Goldie in the past year in person and she does NOT look like this photo. Her hair is greyer, and her face is a lot more wrinkly. She should be! She's almost 60! Nothing wrong with that, but why does she act like she's so natural when she's so fake? I must add to be fair, that her figure is good, although her breasts are implants. Come on, Goldie, you have bigger and higher breasts now than ever. Compare old photos of Goldie to more recent ones and you'll notice a new breasts, new nose and chin. That's fine, nothing wrong with that, but to come across like she's so accepting of herself as she is, the way she is naturally, what a load.I have more respect for someone like Phyllis Diller who admits to facial surgery (and in my opinion was beautiful before she had it) or someone like Olivia DeHaviland who has grown old very gracefully and naturally. Now THERE's a natural beauty, even at the age of, I don't know, she's got to be 80, and she looks lovely. Phyllis Diller, too, is in her 80's, now THERE are a couple of role models. Goldie a role model? No. Nothing but giggly and goofy, full of new age superiority, a below average actress who knows how to keep her name in the public view. Which is actually quite impressive considering I've never seen a movie with her in it that was anything I'd ever watch twice.In recent magazine articles to promote her new book, well, in one of them, she states that men are naturally polygamous, that she's come to accept that.Well, Goldie, maybe YOUR men are polygamous, but there are men that are MONOGAMOUS. Just because you think so doesn't mean you are right.If you want to read this book, wait a few months, it will be on sale on the remainder table for a few bucks. Dont' waste your cash. Get Phyllis Diller's autobiography instead. MUCH more interesting!"},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"Now, I like Goldie. I do think Kate Hudson is supremely overrated, while her dad Bill Hudson of 70s snoozefest saturday morning show \\"The Hudson Bros. Razzledazzle Show\\" is completely underrated. Anway, I'm glad Goldie did this book. Why? For many reasons really. Firsty, she was THE commanding dramatic performance in the movie \\"Wildcats\\" though she doesn't write about that here. Someone suggested to me a while back that \\"Wildcats\\" was intended to a be comedy, but that can't be true. I wept for the entirety of the film.Also, she never mentions her marriage to Sonny Bono. Great stuff."},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"This book does not deserve a Star nor is it about one! Goldie literally needs therapy. I do not respect her or her lifestyle that she has tried to sell. I am disgusted that Goldie has created a scenario of lies which keeps Kate's father from having a relationship with his daughter. What Goldie Hawn has written is an amalgam of her own fictitious ramblings that co-exist with her fabricated self-righteous sacrifices which have forged a divide with the Hudson kids and their father. I am aghast at her blatent lies and how she weaves the truths into a warm and comfortable blanket of deceit that she believes the public will accept. The book is just as dishonest as the image of Goldie on the book! She looks NOTHING like the cover!!! Hence Goldie Hawn wants to SELL you the IMAGE that SHE wants YOU to BUY! Well, thank God I did not buy this book. Hopefully, you won't either unless you enjoy toxic regurgitated fools GOLD fiction. Get REAL Goldie Jeanne Hawn!!!"},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"It arrived very quickly and in good shape, I can't review it beyond this point, because I have not had a chance to listen to it yet. Nancy, Mi."},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"I don't remember Goldie Hawn from Laugh In. I have seen her in only two movies, The Banger Sisters and Butterflies Are Free, and not in the theater but on tv. The book is pretty on the outside and the colored pages are nice. I couldn't get interested in it so I didn't buy it."},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"A long time ago, I had a son with a sense of humor to match \\"Rowan And Martin's Laugh-In,\\" and the whole family would watch this silly show mainly to hear Goldie's infectious giggle. One Saturday, the local radio station was doing an open house at a hardware store and offered the recording from a Rowan & Martin show to the next customer who came through the door and asked for it. My sons and I were in the car, so I parked at the front door and urged Zach to ask for the tape. The radio host, George Martin, decided to interview me as a 'bad mother,' allowing my children to hear this risque stuff. He asked, \\"Are you really going to let them listen to this?\\" I said, \\"Oh, they've already heard and seen it all, so why not?\\" Of course, I meant the t.v. show -- not that we act that kooky at home or say that kind of thing at home. No way!She was never beautiful, but this photo on the cover is simply glamourous, and the lotus flower so graceful and lovely. Goldie wasn't graceful on that show; in fact, she was usually fumbling around trying to be funny. She was the dumb blonde. As she warns in the beginning, \\"be careful what you wish for.\\" I was told that three years ago by someone I trusted, and it was oh, so true as the person I was corresponding with via email wasn't who I thought it was.Recently, Kate Hudson was in Knoxville with the band her husband is a part of; don't ask what it's called as it is not my kind of music and so I didn't know they were here at the newly renovated Tennessee Theatre. Her remarks about our charming dead town to David Letterman made front-page headlines as she told the truth; you have to make your own fun here. This is a college town, but it's ugly and backward and not progressive at all. The downtown is like an abandoned mining town after hours and on weekends. Some of the townsfolks took issue with her truthfulness about nothing to do in Knoxville, Tennessee. It's too bad she wasn't here during the month of April, as the town blooms with dogwoods and is actually pretty for a few weeks. One week of that month the downtown comes alive with activities. It used to be two weeks six years ago, and the whole month ten years ago. The town is dying by degrees. She was right and I sent a Letter to the Editor of The News-Sentinel to support her. I was born here and I can't find things to do via public transportation at night or on weekends as the buses quit early Sundays evenings and few and far between after 8:15 p.m. weekdays. Except for the University area, where they give free rides to the students to the drinking holes in a dangerous part of town. Sometimes, there is music on Market Square, but not of the caliber she is used to, and it isn't my kind of music, either.The postcards are novel and this one about the lotus special: \\"How can we count our moments of joy one by one? Isolated from one another? They should acummulate and be worn throughout life like a mantle of wealth in which we can drape ourselves, at any given moment.\\" She was so cute in 'Cactus Flower' and 'Private Benjamin.' She was a delightful 'flower child' and I was delighted when she married Kurt Russell."},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"I only bought the book actually because I found it at a bargain store and I enjoyed most of her movies.In fact when I came home with it, I was about to put it into my bookcase for a day when I had nothing to do (like that ever happens) LOL,but I had to wait for someone so I started to read. After returning home and going to bed instead of watching a little TV I picked up the book again. After reading the book, Goldie should add author to her already huge list of accomplishments.The book evokes all emotions,laughter,tears,anger,compassion and most of all love.She is a wonderful writer and you honestly feel this is a woman you would want as a friend.It is beautifully and honestly written. She states in the beginning that she was not going to give out intimate details of others that would cause them pain and embarrassment and she does not. If you are looking for a juicy who slept with who,what a louse Bill Hudson was etc...you will not find it in this book.While she is still (at least to me) one of the most powerful women in Hollywood,she is still thoughtful and humble. Her true hearts love is still her family. While she does not make her parents \\"Leave It To Beaver\\" kind of people, it is clear that they were loving,nurturing,loving parents who were there for their children with faults just like the rest of us. She presents herself in the same light. The book is an interesting and easy read no mumbo jumbo,she tells it as she sees it and does not force her views or opinions on anyone.I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes her or her movies and if you are a fan of hers, (you probably already have the book) if not after reading this book you might become one."},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"I've always been a big fan of Goldie Hawn. Her performance in Butterflies are Free (which was not mentioned in the book) embodied a free-spirited, totally loving, beautiful person and I think I accepted that as being Goldie. Now I wonder a little. Some of the comments of the other readers here have me questioning the truth of the image, especially the business of preventing her children by Hudson from seeing him. ??No one is perfect and of course she is going to present the best part of herself in her autobiography. She comes across as incredibly loving, spiritual and filled with pure gold. Somehow, though, I was a little disappointed in the book---maybe it's the fault of the ghost writer. Maybe if Goldie, herself, had written it, it would have conveyed the freshness, charm and sparkle of the Goldie-as-performer. Or maybe the sparkling Goldie-as-performer that we have fallen in love with, isn't the whole story?I've seen a few tv appearances, where she still exudes that childlike sense of wonder which I find so captivating. But then, at other times, when she tries to talk \\"seriously\\" she adapts a tone of voice and attitude that I find totally boring and even off-putting. Maybe it's the part of her that was only a C student trying to convince us that she's really smart?I found this same dichotomy in this book. The parts that tell the funny, odd, touching events of her life are captivating--I loved the encounter with an old Italian gentlement she met in her hotel on location for a film. It's when she moralizes that I get bored and want to turn to the next chapter. If she had let the encounters stand as they were, without her pontificating on them, the book would have been more enjoyable.I borrowed the book from the library and did enjoy a lot of it, but I would have been disappointed if I'd paid money for it."},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"I have very mixed feelings about this book. There were some very interesting parts about her early days struggling to make it in New York and her fascinating trips to India, Africa, Italy, etc. But there were also some Spiritual Growth and Philosophy of Life sections which were really dull, and which I skipped over. Also I was disappointed that she doesn't delve deeply into so many things that could have been interesting; she hardly discusses many of her films, and mentions her kids, husbands, lovers and co-stars only very quickly and superficially. It's like she'd signed confidentiality agreements with everyone connected with her, or at least was bound and determined to be totally nice and not upset anyone by revealing anything personal about them. You gotta admire her for being classy and not catty, but it makes the book rather unsatisfying. Also, the photographs are sort of randomly inserted into the book and don't correspond to the text at all; for example, when Goldie was going on and on about her sister and their wonderful trip to Italy together, I hunted and hunted for pix of her sister and finally gave up -- but then I came across them much later in the book. On the whole, I liked Jane Fonda's memoir a lot more."},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"I like Goldie Hawn as an actress. Because of this, I wanted to read her book. I also wanted to love it, but I just couldn't. I can't believe anyone would believe she had professional help writing it. It definitely read like she was just looking at her journals and winging it. It was barely in chronological order...She so lightly touched on her personal life and even her career. It was very much about her thoughts and feelings. I found the accounts of her travels to be absolutely boring, as well as her visits to what could be called \\"new age\\" healers and spiritual advisors. I skimmed the last quarter of the book.On the positive side, she gave an account of her first panic/anxiety attack and speaks of her fears about death and dying. Even we normal folk don't want to talk about that, let alone write it down for all to see. An honest thing to do. She also let us in on how Hollywood is a man's world and women who speak up are seen as bitchy and difficult to work with. She also seemed to want us all to know that the dumb blond thing was all an act, as most \\"dumb blonds\\" do. I was not surprised because I think it is practically impossible to achieve great success if one is \\"dumb\\".Anyway, this book is readable, but don't expect an auto biography. It's just not there."},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"I absolutely loved this book and have told so many others to read it. Goldie is so down to earth and let's no stone go unturned. She knows how to live her life and inspires others to learn from her and know that what is really important isn't the material things but the memories and experiences you pick up along the way. Thank you Goldie! I've passed the book onto a recently widowed neighbor who can smile alittle bit more while turning the pages."},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"There are a few laughs and sweet remembrances in this very long book of anecdotes that seem largely ghost-written, but unless you are extremely open to New Age-ist ideas and life philosophies, you will probably find this read to be slow going.Ms. Hawn continues to be a charming and appealing personality, in front of and behind the cameras...and undoubtedly she is a great humanitarian. However, often the writing comes off as over inflated and grande--exactly the opposite of her image as the fun loving girl you'd like to hang out with in your spare time. That pretension unfortunately makes her many good deeds and loving heart seem like they are theidle amusments of someone rich, privileged and bored. That's not Goldie!I believe the book could have benefitted from more Editorial guidance and, hopefully, this beloved brainy, bubbly blonde will write more books in the future...with a more down to earth and inclusive narrative."},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"As a rule I avoid books by celebrities simply because 99% of them are self absorbed know it alls who are so far removed from us commoners that they don't see how superficial and stupid they sound. This book is one of the rare exceptions simply because its more fun and admits this from the get go. And it's a good, easy summer read."},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"Goldie Hawn is a Hollywood anomaly and a tremendous survivor in the world where anyone over the age of 21 is considered has been. This book is witty and riveting. While the book reveals a lot about the respect Goldie has for all the loved ones in her life, it does tend to skip over many parts of her life. I don't know she does out of respect for privacy. Even without the missing pieces to her puzzle this book will give you a revealing look into a multifaceted woman filled with laughter, joy, faith, hope and intellect. It also reveals a woman who is deep and complex but not afraid to show her insecurities. One word could sum up this book and that is unique. But isn't that who Goldie is a unique individual."},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"The content of this book was surprising to me because I expected the usual autobiography, full of details moving from one experience to the next. What I found was something different. She picks and chooses experiences from her life that have taught her something and passes them along to the reader, so he/she can learn something from them as well.You won't find many celebrities mentioned here, unless they were part of the experience in question. No kiss and tell.What you will find is the Goldie we have loved forever, funny, smart and full of the knowledge about oneself that only comes with the years.If you love her and admire her like I do, you will love her book as well."},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"Goldie Hawn has been an inspiration to woman everywhere for more than four decades. Her beauty, humor, wit and adventurous nature most of us have seen on the screen are all wonderfully illustrated in detail in this unique, can't-put-it-down biography. She shares her innermost feelings and reveals her secrets for staying grounded while dealing with the pressures of stardom. Best of all, she teaches us what she's learned along the way. I finished this book feeling inspired and refreshed. Thank you, Goldie."},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"Ah, Goldie, gotta love her! I grew up watching Goldie Hawn on Laugh-in and then in movies- everything from Butterflies are Free (where her hippie, dippy side got to cut loose) to Private Benjamin.All along, she seemed both funny and gutsy but what REALLY got me to buy this book was a television profile where Goldie spoke of a long battle with depression and insecurity. Her longtime companion, Kurt Russell, and their children (some from previous marriages) also appeared and I realized that there might be more depth and complexity to this woman than I got from the fleeting images on screen.Thankfully, I was right. This book was a joy to read, revealing the depth, intellect and pure gutsiness that Goldie Hawn possesses. She was brave enough to reveal the insecurities and pain that she felt during some of her early years in show biz as well as the joy she felt as she discovered Buddhism, met Russell, gave birth to her children - and so much more. Written with a unique style (would you expect anything else from Hawn?) the reader will find both entertainment and inspiration within this one."},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"The cover is nice. Some pages are blue or purple with very attractive motifs and graphics inside. Nice pictures too of Goldie at work, rest and play including snapshots of her children and partner Kurt Russell.The content is only losely biographic. This is more Goldie Hawn's philosophy of life through the window of her journeys and successes in the movie industry. Co-authored with another. It reads very well.Little subchapters called \\"Postcards\\" capturing experiences. There are also poems and thoughts: \\"Is our smile coded for in our DNA or is it nurtured?\\" (paraphrased). In this sense the book has some fine quotations.As a woman who represents openness and seems to be something of a spiritual student this book is great for exploring themes on happiness, relationships, death and being human. Designed to bring out the best in anybody.This book and its sentiments represent a fantastic contribution to genuinely making the world a better place - not by throwing money at problems but by being well inside.I liked reading it - ideal as a gift or to dip into though not to be read from cover to cover necessarily. Really well edited - not much gossip, thankfully."},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"I've always enjoyed the light heartedness of Goldie Hawn. She has a fresh airy style that makes most movies that she's in just that much more fun and entertaining.Her personal life has been pretty full of controversay over the years. Between her divorce to Bill Hudson...and the estrangement with her children. I had been really intersted to know more about \\"why\\". She barely mentions Bill Hudson. Really! I guess I could be more optomistic, and say that \\"at least she didn't bash him...\\"....but I was a bit disappointed with the fact that she brushes over her relationships...and her kids. Still, she spends vast amounts of text talking about her trips to India, and riding on an elephant...and her relationships with people I don't care about at all. I bought the audio cd - which she narrates. She did a good job, but I couldn't help thinking that most of the time she sounded alot like Barbara Mandrell. Hmmm...I had never notice that before."},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"The book will draw just because it's written by Goldie Hawn. And then you readers will be unconventionally and pleasantly taken ... moved actually ... by the weaving of the stories with the lessons gleaned from her experiences and what they mean to her, deep down, in her heart, her gut. Regardless of being written by a famous woman or not, there is a lot to be learned here. If you are on any path in life to learn ... whatever it is you are desiring to learn ... this woman will be your gentle guide. Enjoy the read ... and all the best to Goldie Hawn."},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"Goldie Hawn shares with incredible honesty, wisdom and compassion in this memoir that is filled with heart-felt insight, integrity, and poignant lessons learned from her pure heart.One thing is for sure, you will learn a LOT. Goldie has always searched for truth, and she is a shining example of living purely from the heart center, with compassion for all.A note to the reviewer below that calls this genuine woman named Goldie a \\"man hater\\", dear Sir, take a look in the mirror, it is you that hates yourself. So we have compassion for you.Goldie Hawn is the epitome of a humanitarian, and an example to learn from.10 Stars for her and this Fantastic Book!"},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"I don't know why anyone would consider her a 'man-hater'- as she expresses nothing but love for sons, stepson, grandson and her de facto husband Kurt Russell!You don't have to be Jewish or Buddhist to appreciate the insights she makes about her life's journey. I've always liked her and I was particularly moved about how she and Kurt helped a horribly scarred Peruvian street kid named Juan but even eliminating the exterior scars proved to be no guarantee he'd heal from the interior ones. Still, Juan's life is far better off than had no one attempted to help him- as are Goldie and Kurt's for sharing in that journey.I like how she told this as a series of vignettes instead of trying to chronicle every picayunish detail and helps the reader understand where she is coming from. She acknowledges that things may not be perfect but it's good she and her family have found a means to bolster themselves through the tougher times and their comitment as a family to each other appears solid regardless of the absence of a marriage license."},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"Heard GOLDIE: A LOTUS GROWS IN THE MUD, written andread by Goldie Hawn . . . this is not your typical autobiography,in there's not much name-dropping and very littlegossip . . . instead, it feels more like a class you'd takewith the talented actress, during which she points out the paththat she has followed to get to the point where she is now.Along the way, she had to battle depression and insecurity, andit took her many long years of therapy . . . in addition, shediscovered and developed a love for Buddhism, along with adesire to help others.I came away feeling that I got to know her better as a person . . . also,the book forever changed my opinion about her being just a ditsyblonde . . . she is anything but, as evidenced by her being a bigsupporter of Operation Smile (the group which offers reconstructivesurgery to youngsters in less-developed countries)."},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"This book was hard to put down.

Audio books don't get better than this.Many of us remember the seemingly irrepressible Goldie Hawn from her early \\"Sock it to me\\"days on Rowan Martin's Laugh-In through her movie roles, Cactus Flower, Shampoo, Private Benjamin, right up until she carried home an Academy Award.. She's a generous, appealing actress - the same adjectives describe her writing.\\"Each of us goes through transitions and transformations,\\" she says. \\"The important thing is that we acknowledge them and learn from them. That is the idea behind the book. Not to tell my life story, but to speak openly and from the heart about episodes in my life in the hope of explaining how they changed my perception and how they helped me to look at the world more clearly.\\"This she does. She speaks of the good times and the bad - her excitement at being a part of a new CBS series and the childhood sexual assault she suffered in her own home by one of her sister's friends. \\"Laugh-In\\" was, of course, an enormous boost to her career, and her relationship with Kurt Russell occupies a large part of her heart.Goldie, the pixie-like gamin is a mom, mother to Kate Hudson, Oliver Hudson, and Boston Russell. She speaks of the difficulties and the pleasures in watching Kate grow into her own person. Every mother can relate to the experience of \\"letting go.\\"With appreciation she tells of the kindness shown her by many, and reflects on anger, love, compassion, and her Buddhist beliefs.This is, of course, Goldie's story until now. She says, \\"Every day I ask myself, wondering aloud, \`What does the future hold for you now, Goldie Hawn?' And the best thing of all is, I just don't know.\\"If her future is anything like her past, she will learn, experience and see a great deal more. Let's hope she shares it with us.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"I was very inspired by this book, and gave it to a few friends who also found it so, even those that have an aversion to all things 'new age'. This definately does have a new age angle, and Goldie by no means leads a 'regular' life, but she manages to approach her own tale from the perspective of the common events most of us experience - childhood traumas and joys, parental difficulties, career struggles and successes, relationship traumes and joys, and parenting joys and challenges. If you are looking for Hollywood dirt or lots of details on her life with Kurt or family, you won't find it, although you get some vignettes. Mostly it is a personal tale of a woman finding herself through all the activities of her life, and in that sense is inspiring."},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"I love Goldie Hawn and her book.

She talks about her life as a child and her parents, right up to her life today and her relationship with Kurt Russell."},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"Goldie is an American Icon - she is so charming and funny but this does not come across in the audiobook. She read the audiobook and it seemed pompous and self serving. When something serious happens this silly music comes on and you wonder is this for real - really. You get the sense she is trying to let everyone know how great she thinks she is. The greatest daughter, sister, wife, mother ....... Hey and what about \\"Foul Play\\" she does not mention it and she was so great in that movie! I think she is terrific but it does not come across in the audiobook."},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"This book is an excellent read and well worth it. Goldie is very down-to- earth dispite her celebrity status. She is intelligent and I loved her ispiritualism. She tries to be a good person dispite being famous, she isn't one to use her status. She deals with celebrity the right way. Money and celebrity don't make a person. Whats inside is the important part of how we life and deal with people and things. She does with no problem."},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"This is a fascinating read. Goldie's everyday life is filled with artistry and a world of dance. When she begins working at a young age she tells a story most honestly, the way it really is. She survives an accident in NYC. Becoming an actress was filled with highs and lows. She expresses agonizing times, but becomes very successful. She travels to different parts of the world while working with the movie industry. She opens a door to her personal life, marriage and children. With her warm, wonderful laugh, she invites one into her privileged life that she has earned.

I wish I was her friend. Being a week from 43 Im reclusive and sick. Watching all her movies and ending it on this book has made me more love for this woman in a way like a garden of trees and roses. When I was 9 in 1978 it goes back to Foul Play when it all this started. As a child she was like a golden goddess who made me smile and now still does and spiritually. I went out in the back yard sat in my mom's sanctuary looked at the flowers roses and trees birds and the open air of clouds...and cried."},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"Although Goldie is one of my favorite actors, I didn't expect much from this book. In fact, she writes very little about what you would expect; acting, marriages, kids, personalities. But, I was blown away by the books' insight, compassion, inspiration and pure love. I could never improve upon the description of the book by the write-up on the inside flaps. It is a perfect summation of the book. I love the short stories she tells between chapters that she calls 'postcards'.The book shows that she's as intelligent and passionate about life as she has been and still is: the funniest, sexiest creature on the screen.If you want to know about Goldie's life in the movies, there are other books that tell much more (you get a lot of opinions along with movie facts, however). This book is strictly from the heart and so much more valuable. It has a permanent place in my library."},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"Only my bookshelves really know how many Hollywood biographies / autobiographies I've read in 30 odd years. I could categorize them in several groups: highly researched / Dull chronologies / attention-grabing narratives... But I prefer to put them in alphabetical order, by person. The quality of each book remains in my head...I'm almost conviced that if I had read Hawn's preface while I was at the bookstore, I wouldn't have bought this book. It truly reduced my envy to read it, as she prepared us for a kind of self-help + autobiography rendition of her life, a somewhat unconventional approach. But still curious about her and her career, I took a chance. Pleasant surprise! This is a well written account, very human, solidly built around her experiences as a little girl, an actress, a mother, a lover... and a daughter. Each chapter ends with a look or a lesson on what she learned with her life experiences, without any moralistic attitude. I felt like I was learning about her in a very pleasant surrounding !I guess Hawn tried to make an original book, something different than the usual Hollywood autobiographies out there, and she really succeeded! Bravo Goldie (and thank you) !"},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"I enjoyed this book. Some have found fault with the writing, which is but clear and tasteful and doesn't call attention to itself. This memoir is a contemplative glance back upon the moments of her life that have led her to this point in time. She celebrates and reflects on the trials and joys of her childhood, her turbulent life in show business, her personal challenges, and the loves of her life, all as experiences to cherish. The inevitable falls were opportunities for growth and are gratefully recalled. Through the telling of these stories, which are sketched with light, feathery strokes, rather than with course and detailed etchings, we look upon the treasured events in her life as markings along what is essentially, a joyful spiritual journey."},{"Title":"A Lotus Grows in the Mud","review":"The item arrived on time and in the specified conditions.

Featuring the Works of Finney, Mahan, Wesley, Bunyan, ... on Holiness, Revival, and The Atonement.","review":"I was a confused, bewildered (almost tending towards atheism), teenager until I met Finney and those great saints from centuries back. In a world where Truth has become the abused damsel of many, it's absolutely refreshing to understand truths like Sin, Selfishness, Benevolence, Salvation, the Ultimate Purpose behind the Church's existence and Reality - truths this generation of the Body of Christ has failed to comprehend and teach. Get this material to as many people as possible - it'll save youth like me the trouble of 'Churchianism' and 'Feelgoodianism'! I'm so elated I found this in my youth - the world needs reformers today like Finney. We (especially the CONFUSED youth - though they are not admitting it) need this. We need the REAL TRUTH.

Good for a bride who needs some direction.

Oregon: A Brief History with Documents (Bedford Series in History and Culture)","review":"Nancy Woloch has written, as the title suggest, brief history of Muller v. Oregon. The book is broken up into two halves. The first half deals with the history of Muller and the second half gives primary documents related to Muller and the time period. Woloch lays out a very logical argument and looks at the constitutional issues with Muller and the importance of the \\"Brandeis Brief\\" and how the brief was successful over time became less by the time the Court heard Adkins v. Children's Hospital. Woloch also looks at the reactions and results of the Muller decision and the cause and effect with cases that came after Muller. The addition of documents, which make up the second half of the book; the documents help to give greater insight to the history and understanding of not only Muller but of the Court and ideas during the early part of the 20th Century.I would suggest this book to anyone who has to do research or is interesting in learning about women's history. This book has been extremely helpful in the writing of my maters thesis. The book is easy to read and Woloch makes clear points and is pretty even handed. I did not overly notice a bias one way or the other. There is a wealth of information in the book, yet it is not overwhelming but makes the reader engage with the book and read more.

It is a rather short story and is targeted toward the 9-12 age groups although in many ways most 12 year olds may find the reading less than challenging.This is the story of a small boy who lives on a farm in the upper mid-west. They have just lost the family dog, Captain who was fourteen when he passed on, which made him about five years older than the little boy in the story; he was the only dog the lad had ever known. Needless to day, the young man was having difficulties accepting the loss of his dog. He states very emphatically that he never wants another dog!Shortly after this, as chance would have it, the young boy finds a very bedraggled dog hiding in the culvert on their farm. The dog is near death from starvation and has obviously been abused. Daniel, the young boy, nurses her (He names her Lady) back to health. Lady is a very nice looking English setter, but having been very badly treated (We never really find out what her background is), she has trouble accepting Daniel's friendship and has problems trusting Daniel, and humans in general.Even though this is a rather short little books we find quite a number of very good lessons; hard lessons to be truthful, woven into the pages. Daniel has a lot of maturing and growing up to do. Will the dog be able to touch Daniel's life as he has touched hers? Can Lady replace Captain...should Lady replace the old dog? Are Daniel's expectations too high; are they realistic? The reader shall see.The story moves along quite well. This author is a very descriptive writer and pays very close attention to details. Not only do we get a snapshot of a young man maturing and learning life lessons, we also get a good look at farm life and family dynamics.This is a pretty easy read with a vocabulary which will challenge just enough to make it useful and the story flows fast enough to keep in quite interesting all the way until the end. I've read this work to several of the kids I work with and it has been very well accepted.The black and white pencil drawings found throughout the book enhance the story very nicely.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"The Comeback Dog","review":"Do you like books that make you feel happy and sad at the same time??

She said the quality I described didn't sound like a Hay House publication, and had a copy sent to her office so she could see it in person. When her copy arrived she called me and we compared notes. Her copy of Crystal Therapy was properly formatted and had full color pictures. Darcy then sent that copy to me, and I was excited to see what the book was really supposed to look like. It was so different from my Amazon-shipped copy. It was a smaller book; the font was a normal size, crisp and clear, the inks chosen for their beautiful colors; the pages are of thick, shiny high-quality paper; and the glossy color photographs are light-years ahead of the dull low contrast black and white pics in the first copy. It is possible to ID crystals in this copy of the book.Thank you, Darcy!Compared to the B&W; copy, this little book is a sparkling gem.So, I'm upgrading my review and want to be clear: the actual book is very well done, has good editing and decent pictures in FULL-COLOR.I am very impressed with Hay House and with Darcy who was very kind and helpful. I sent my black and while book to her so they can determine if counterfeit copies are being sold, or if books that shouldn't have been distributed were sent out by mistake.I hope that every one who orders Crystal Therapy will get the correct copy, but if you don't, be sure to let Amazon or Hay House know so you can get the right book.__________________________________________________________________Original 3-Star Review: \\"Poor quality black & white photos\\"The \\"beautiful color photographs of each crystal family\\" do not exist in this book. There are black and white pictures of some stones and crystals. The images are of varying quality, and in almost all cases the poor quality and lack of color make identifying a crystal or stone difficult to impossible.I am reluctant to write anything other than a positive review for this book because the intent of the authors seems to be very good, and that makes me want to give only positive feedback, but I wish the book had been more accurately described. What reason is there to exaggerate certain aspects of the book? Go with the strengths that actually exist: the channeled messages and angelic relationships.The information is not very extensive. For example, one of the stones mentioned in the book, Beryl, doesn't have a description anywhere in the book. There may be more instances like this, but I noticed this one because it is listed as one of my astrological sign stones. I was interested to learn about Beryl because of this, and found it strange that a stone would be mentioned and then not described or discussed at all.There were other small things, like inaccurate page references and the HUGE font. I just now saw the \\"Large Print 16 pt edition\\" listed in the publisher's info above. Unfortunately I didn't think to check the size of the font before purchasing the book, as it has never come up before when shopping for books on Amazon. It came as a big surprise when I first opened the book (the H1 and H2 fonts in the book are even bigger that the paragraph text). Also, the formatting seems to be mostly missing from the book as a whole. On some pages it takes a conscious effort to keep track of where a block of information starts and stops, and in some cases, to determine which text goes with which image.There is interesting and lovingly presented information about the stones and crystals healing properties, relationships to angels, and also channeled, loving messages from the stones and crystals themselves. This was the most enjoyable part of the book.The section on crystal cleansing is only 5 sentences long. This was disappointing, as there were no further directions or explanations, just that a bath in sea salt water or natural water source, burying, sun or moon exposure or using prana were options. I ended up googling for more info and found recommended times ranging from a \\"spritz\\" to 24 hours for a standard salt water cleansing, and 3-4 days after an exorcism. Information from the authors on this would have been appreciated. Such loving care is taken when talking about crystals, I'm surprised that proper crystal cleansing care was not also lovingly included.I was really looking forward to receiving this book. I did extensive comparisons and was under the impression that this was one of the best books I could get on the subject of healing stones and crystals and identification, in no small part because of the glowing reviews and helpful information such as one reviewer's comment: \\"If you're looking for the perfect place to identify crystals & their powers, benefits and energies you can find it in this book.\\" Maybe s/he didn't mean you could actually identify crystals, but rather look up one of the crystals mentioned in the book, and if a profile exists, you can then identify the healing properties of that crystal.I was expecting the promised tantalizing color photos and was excited to identify my stones and crystals and learn about new ones. I do not recommend this book for that purpose at all. It is very limited, and frankly, seems incomplete. However the provided healing information and spiritual aspect of this book are really nice.I'm left unsure of what to do with this book. I'm reluctant to give up the healing properties information and \\"messages\\" information. On the other hand, the book is not as described, the very large font makes it harder to read, and the pictures ...Maybe I'll ask Amazon if they sent a black and white copy by mistake. Maybe it was a test run by the publisher, which could also explain the lack of formatting."},{"Title":"Crystal Therapy: How to Heal and Empower Your Life with Crystal Energy","review":"This book is easy to read and has quite a bit of information.

Civilizations both ancient and modern have used crystals and stones for jewelry, talismans, and home ornamentation. In addition to these uses, crystals have also been a part of sacred ceremonies, prayer, meditation, and healing.Using a process called piezoelectricity, crystals serve as powerful energy conductors and amplifiers. Crystals are used in watches, radios, and other electronic devices and crystal sensors are even used in hospitals for diagnostic and healing work.Because crystals amplify and conduct energy, they serve as excellent channels of Divine light and healing intention. In addition to human intention, the formation and color of crystals also contribute to specific healing properties.In the new book Crystal Therapy - How to Heal and Empower Your Life with Crystal Energy authors Doreen Virtue and Judith Lukomski share their wisdom of \\"crystal friends\\", and how these elemental beings are the offspring of Heaven and Earth's marriage. A gift from Gaia-the spirit of our planet-these healing stones are available for healing, grounding, and supporting virtually any area of life. Whether you seek to heal an animal, meditate for world peace, attract abundance, or ameliorate dis-ease, crystals and stones are valuable allies.The authors provide an introduction to crystal therapy, an overview of the four ways in which crystal deposits are formed, and an explanation of how crystalline structures reflect the sacred geometry of Platonic Solids. Putting crystal therapy in practice through intention and methods such as chakra balancing, angelic communication, astral travel and Feng Shui are also explained, as well as the purpose and character of 15 archangels. Other fascinating elements covered in Crystal Therapy include crystal selection and care (including cleansing and charging), and how to create eleven different crystal grids as an energetic framework for purposes such as world peace, healing, creativity and sleep.When using clear quartz for healing, practitioners often use jargon to describe the various characteristics of the stone. The authors explain this terminology, and pictures of each are provided. These include phantoms, record keepers, generators, double terminated, manifestation, time links, and others.The bulk of Crystal Therapy, however, is a directory of over 90 crystals outlining their healing properties, color/s, pronunciation, and the archangel/s associated with each. In addition to a channeled message from each of the stones, color photographs of most crystals are provided.At 220 pages, Crystal Therapy is a solid contribution to the field of crystal healing--especially for those interested in angels and crystal channeling.If, however, you are interested in crystal properties such as chemical compositions, hardness, and extensive astrological correlations-as well as the history and legend of over 140 stones and crystals accompanied by large, color photographs-I'd recommend Healing Crystals and Gemstones - From Amethyst to Zircon by Dr. Flora Peschek-Bohmer and Gisela Schreiber. Or, if you are looking for a book that addresses magical properties and intentions, planetary and elemental rulers, and stone symbolism-as well as how to use stones for divination and spells-you'd be better off with Cunningham's Encyclopedia of Crystal, Gem, and Metal Magic by Scott Cunningham (which includes a 16 page insert of color photographs of over 100 crystals, stones, and metals.)Janet Boyer, author of The Back in Time Tarot Book: Picture the Past, Experience the Cards, Understand the Present (coming Fall 2008 from Hampton Roads Publishing)"},{"Title":"Crystal Therapy: How to Heal and Empower Your Life with Crystal Energy","review":"Crystal Therapy is a fantastic introduction to the metaphysical world of crystals.

One who has not fully studied crystals, but has been fascinated with them, can easily use this book of knowledge for personal and/or professional healings.The channeled information that came from each crystal, mineral, stone etc., is a powerful way to connect to each indidividual energy and immeidately, what a gift that is. Each photograph has captured the beauty of their presence and ancient wisdom therein.Thank you Judith and Doreen for this easy to use and very powerful reference book. Your work is definitely a gift to many of us who are at the bridge of connecting ourselves to the magic and wonder of the Mineral Kingdom. God bless you both!"},{"Title":"Crystal Therapy: How to Heal and Empower Your Life with Crystal Energy","review":"I really enjoyed Crystal Therapy by Doreen Virtue. I am a Reiki Master-Teacher, Reiki-ssage Practitioner, Crystal Therapist, and I love to see what books would be good for my clients to use in order to help them grow with their crystals. This book has beautiful pictures of the crystals, affirmations, and ways for them to utilize the different crystals according to need. It also gives maintence tips, in easy to understand verbage. I would recommend it hightly."},{"Title":"Grizzlies in Their Backyard","review":"This is a very enjoyable book. It is NOT a wildlife book, but a book about a couple that chose to live in the wilderness among the wildlife. It is about their adventures and about the grizzlies that they lived so close to, as well as the other animals. When you consider it was 1919 it is also a history book. I got this book as a gift many years ago and still continue to read it again and again."},{"Title":"Grizzlies in Their Backyard","review":"If you are looking for a book about bears, keep looking. The word Grizzlies in the title is for marketing purposes. The book is essentially a chronicle of a couple settling in Knight Inlet, BC in the early 20th century as told to the author Beth Day in the 1950's. The book is ably written and entertaining, but is not about bears. The grizzlies have occasional cameo appearances, but don't even rate a co-starring role. There is nothing to be learned about bears here, just a light days read."},{"Title":"The Velveteen Rabbit, Or, How Toys Become Real.","review":"Think carefully about what the Bunny has to teach us.
