Once and a while it seemed a bit of a slow read, but overall it was a great book. It shows evidence that the third mass extinction on Earth is already underway. And mankind could very well be the catalyst of this extinction. It's a wake-up call to humanity that we must try to avert this catastrophe as soon as possible. For the fate of countless species is at stake, including our own."},{"Title":"The End of Evolution: A Journey in Search of Clues to the Third Mass Extinction Facing Planet Earth","review":"This would definitely be the book for someone to read if they have the time and want to know just about everything from the Paleozoic to the Mesozoic, along with issues of extinctions facing humans today. Mr. Ward goes quite in-depth with all his information to give a very full picture of how our predecessors lived when they graced the Earth, along with the cause of their demise and eventually ours if we don't slow the destruction being done to the environment. The language is easy to read and understand, with the exception of the occasional not so well explained term (KT boundary, etc.). Interesting overall if you have an interest in the life from the start of the Paleozoic to current times and have time to spare."},{"Title":"The End of Evolution: A Journey in Search of Clues to the Third Mass Extinction Facing Planet Earth","review":"Ten years ago, Mr. Ward was predicting some of the weather-related occurrences we have seen in the past few months. He blames it on certain atmospheric disturbances which multiply and may cause another extinction of life on earth.Ozone is a form of oxygen which blocks the sun's damaging ultraviolet radiation. This thinning of the world's ozone level was first detected in 1985, twenty years ago, and is being destroyed by man-made compounds leaking into the atmosphere. CFCs were polluting and destroying ozone molecules. If the ozone continues to be depleted due to the rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, increased amounts of ultraviolet radiation will bombard the earth continuously, and cause a higher rate of cancer in humans.It's because of the changeds of levels of critical gases such as CO2 (carbon dioxide) and water vapor. Our planet stays warmer in large part known as the greenhouse effect called global warming. It will increase the spread of deserts and cause droughts and reduce water supplies.In 1995, Mr. Ward predicted that this global warming is sure to lead to massive environmental changes over much of the earth. Even if detailed understanding of global warming still defies prediction, generalities emerge. It will cause the seas to rise to dangerous depths. The ice caps will melt and increase sea levels. The rate and extent will decide mankind's fate.The faster the oceans rise and erode land, the greater incidence for loss of life. We've seen this already in New Orleans, where most of the occupants were forced to leave this historic town for a time, and Thailand where land lose and deaths were terrifically tragic.Twice in distant past, catastrophic extinction caused the end of evolution. Our first mammalian ancestors survived, some 250 million years agao. The second great mass extinction occurred 65 million years ago when the dinosaurs perished. It was thought to have been caused by earth's collision with an asteroid.He declares tht the signs for a third mass extinction have alrady started on our planet. We need to find some way to save the rich diversity of life and birds now endangered by changes and climate. We must strive to preserve life as we know it before our own extermination by poisoning from the air we pollute.Peter D. Ward is a paleontologist in Seattle (where the 'think tank' for intelligent thinking exists) and is associated with the University of Washington. In 1991, he wrote ON METHUSELAH'S TRAIL: LIVING FOSSILS AND THE GREAT EXTINCTION. He follows this END OF EVOLUTION with FUTURE EVOLUTION in 2001). In 2004, his mastrepiece was GORGONS: PALEONTOLOGY, OBSESSION, AND THE GREATEST CASTROPHE IN EARTH'S HISTORY. They are all parts of this book, which is a bit over my head."},{"Title":"What Is It, Tink, Is Pan in Trouble?: A Doonesbury Book (Doonesbury Books (Andrews & McMeel))","review":"Individually, the strips in this book are great - relationship issues with BD and Boopsie, George Bush (Sr)-isms, the charisma Clinton exuded during his first campaign, and the highly dubious concept of good ol' Zonker moving back in with his parents in California. However, the mix seems rather mish-mash, mostly thrown in due to era relation. While that's all fine and dandy, we as readers have come to expect a better arrangement from Mr Trudeau. On the whole, however, that would more or less be the only negative feature of the book. It should be noted that hardcore Doonesbury fans like myself and/or people who want to see what the controversy is all about *need* this book, as it contains the Dan Quayle DEA investigation that got the strip banned from all but a few papers in the US ... including the one run by Mr Quayle's family."},{"Title":"Hand and Home: The Homes of American Craftsmen","review":"This is an exquisite book full of inspirational ideas for bringing art in to the home.

This book makes a perfect gift for those artistically inclined or for those looking for creative ideas when designing their home."},{"Title":"Hand and Home: The Homes of American Craftsmen","review":"I have owned this book for at least 10 years & despite quite a library of decorating books and magazines, this is one I peek at on a regular basis. The interiors are designed not for the latest trend shown in the magazines but are true to the craftsmen that live there. Each photo is imbued with such personality and creativity, I seem to see something new each time I open the book. Despite the fact that this book was published over a decade ago, it is not in the least bit outdated. As an artist, I seek to design my home with the same artistic yet homey-ness quality.

To name just a few examples, in the book, she explains the effects of caffeine, alcohol, and water on the low-carb diet, explains how to calculate true carb counts, provides excellent examples of low-carb shopping lists and ingredients, provides a list of ideal low-carb snacks, suggests low-carb substitutes for high-carb ingredients, demystifies artificial sweeteners, teaches us how to spot hidden carbs in foods, and lists essentials for low-carb baking. She has also made the book an excellent culinary how-to guide in general by scattering throughout the book little side notes and suggestion boxes where she covers topics such as useful kitchen gadgets, how to store parsley to keep it fresh longer, making flavoured butters, tips for stabilizing whipping cream, and how to peel tomatoes (and yes, she teaches us that there IS more than one way to do this!).Besides providing us with a useful reference book for following a low-carb lifestyle, most importantly, however, Karen Barnaby shows us that low-carbing isn't just about eggs, bacon, and a big slab of steak - it's about healthy, tasty, and varied foods that are not just great for a low-carb lifestyle, but for a healthy lifestyle in general. No matter what your food preferences are, there is something in this cookbook for everyone. For example, among the many recipes in this book, she even includes recipes creatively influenced by international cuisines such as Italian (\\"Flat Roasted Chicken with Prosciutto and Green Olives\\"), Chinese (\\"Daikon Radish, Chinese Cabbage, and Tofu Soup\\"), Japanese (\\"Cucumber Salad with Umeboshi and Bonito Flakes\\"), Thai (\\"Simple Chicken and Coconut Milk Curry\\"), French (\\"Braised Fennel with White Wine and Parmesan\\"), and Middle Eastern (\\"Lamb, Feta, and Olive Meatballs\\"), just to name a few. And although the book contains an impressive number of recipes, what's more impressive is the fact that the author gives suggestions for modifying the recipes and their ingredients to make all new dishes, thereby making the low-carb possibilities endless (and all delicious!).Readers will be happy to see that every recipe in the book includes a carb count and other nutritional details per serving and will be even happier to find at the back of the book a handy summary chart of nutritional information for every recipe, ranked from the lowest carbohydrate count to the highest count. There is no doubt that readers will appreciate this convenient addition to the book as it allows low-carbers to easily calculate at a glance carb counts of meals they are interested in making. As well, the chart makes it easier for readers to determine which recipes may be appropriate for them at a particular stage of low-carbing (e.g., for Atkins followers, the chart makes it super easy to figure out which recipes are best during the induction phase). And if that's not enough, the author even gives us numerous ideas for low-carb entertaining! And before all you NON-low-carbers raise your eyebrows in suspicion, I can tell you that I have impressed more than a few low-carb skeptics with Karen Barnaby's \\"Shepherd's Pie with Mushrooms, Smoked Cheddar, Bacon, and Sour Cream\\". Superb!I've made numerous recipes from this cookbook, and all of them were easy to follow for the novice chef and were absolutely fantastic! I highly recommend Karen Barnaby's \\"Low-Carb Gourmet\\". If she doesn't win you over with her amazingly delicious low-carb recipes, she'll win you over with her engaging and entertaining writing style which made the book a joy to read (AND to use!)."},{"Title":"Low Carb Gourmet","review":"I would highly recommend this cookbook! Usually if I find between 3 and 5 recipes from a cookbook that are good, I'll consider that the cookbook is okay; but I have tried 10 and found that they were all very good. Several of the dishes have been served to young adults that are not doing low carb and even they thought the dishes tasted good. The cheesecakes, tofu-roni,and the deep dish pizza quiche are now mainstays from my kitchen.This cookbook has lots of bookmarks in it, marking recipes that I am looking forward to trying.With the success of the ones I've tried so far I don't think they'll be disappointing!"},{"Title":"Low Carb Gourmet","review":"I have read and owned countless cookbooks in my life. None of them are even close in comparison to this one. I have used most of the recipes at least once so far, and every one has been just scrumptious. Not only that, but the recipes were extremelly simple to follow! I have served many of these recipes for company, and they are always asking for the recipe. I have given several copies of this book as gifts, always with the recipiants being overjoyed. I highly reccomend it to anybody."},{"Title":"Low Carb Gourmet","review":"To be honest, anything with &quot;gourmet&quot; in the title sounds intimidating to me. I'm a bacon-and-eggs kind of cook. But there's nothing to fear in this book. There's a wide variety of recipes with a range of syles and 'effort' levels. Something to please everyone, for sure. In addition to new ideas I can't wait to try, like the Asian inspired recipes, it's very strong on basic LC cooking, with recipes for (and variations on) stand-bys like spaghetti squash, mashed cauliflower, and chicken stock. Sometimes, appropriate condiments are hard to come by, so I was happy to see the recipes for ketchup, barbecue sauce, and pesto.I love this book and it's been a big asset to my kitchen."},{"Title":"Low Carb Gourmet","review":"I have recently acquired this book and find the recipes very exciting and easy. I have only tried a few so far, but they all look terrific. There is everything from soup to nuts in here, and some good information from an executive chef, written for the average cook. I would highly recommend this to anyone following the low carb lifestyle!!"},{"Title":"Low Carb Gourmet","review":"This book was highly recommended on a blog I follow. I was surprised to see that it costs $111 when it retails in Canada for $35, so I was excited when I found a copy at a used book store. Flipping through, I found only one recipe I would consider trying.The chapters are short with very few true low carb recipes. Mostly fruits, desserts, a few vegetable dishes and maybe a dozen pages of beef, pork and poultry. And far too much use of splenda. Many recipes come straight from a newer version of Atkins, where cottage cheese and tofu are fillers, fat is avoided and even savory dishes have a packet of artificial sweetener.Definitely not worth the $12.50 at the used store and I hope I have swayed you from paying almost ten times that price."},{"Title":"Low Carb Gourmet","review":"After hearing and reading a lot of hype about this cookbook, I was ecstatic to finally get a copy - and I do mean FINALLY. I live in the US and it took months in-between hearing about it, finding a copy, and getting my copy purchased and shipped to me.For starters, it's a very tiny book. For a cookbook, especially, it is remarkably thin (perhaps harkening to it's readers how thin they can expect themselves to get). I like my cookbooks to be filled with hundreds of recipes, and this is filled with no such number.Second, it is overwhelmingly filled with seafood recipes. If you are not a huge seafood eater (as I am not), then the already small number of recipes here will suddenly shrink even more.However, what recipes I have enjoyed have been lovely. Flavorful, filling, and while I wouldn't necessarily put them into the category of &#34;gourmet&#34;, they are better than the average low carb recipe of cauliflower topped with cheddar cheese, or asparagus wrapped with bacon.If you're stumped with your low carb cooking, are looking for some new inspiration, and do love seafood, then by all means -get your hands on this cookbook!"},{"Title":"Low Carb Gourmet","review":"Authentic, clear, well written and all about the food tasting good. Great book!I personally don't use Splenda because I react badly to it so the few dessert recipes at the end don't deter from the quality of the rest of the recipes!!Again, great book!!"},{"Title":"Low Carb Gourmet","review":"As I wrote about 'Paleo Comfort Foods' and 'Make it Paleo' there are cookbooks for reading, cookbooks for reference, and cookbooks for cooking...When you find a cookbook that entertains, enlightens AND provides overwhelmingly satisfying recipes that one can actually COOK frequently, in the course of a busy and often distracted life without having all day to shop and chop for that special occasion, well, it is something to applaud.Having transitioned for many, myriad reasons from a vegan lifestyle to eating animals (and being mindful and grateful for the fish, poultry and meat on my plate) 'Low Carb Gourmet' is one of several finds that combines sound nutrition (if you subscribe to a lower carbohydrate, dairy & grain or gluten free philosophy or eating style) and simple, straightforward recipes that encourage a real joy in preparing and sharing meals.While there are many good cookbooks, each with a recipe or two that become personal favorites, it is rare to find a small handful like these, each of which contains MANY recipes that can easily become mainstays.Indexing, BTW, is NOT a nightmare (but not, alas, Irma Rombauer/Marion Rombauer Becker's JOY...either, for those of us whoappreciate a book-length index of recipes, ingredients & minutia).Along with 'Paleo Comfort Foods' by Julie & Charles Mayfield and 'The Food Lovers Make it Paleo' by Bill Staley and Hayley Mason, I think I could make a case for shelving all the countless others I have in my collection."},{"Title":"Treating Depression With Hypnosis: Integrating Cognitive-Behavioral and Strategic Approaches","review":"This is a readable book on using hypnosis as an adjunct to cognitive, behavioral, or interpersonal therapy of depression. The author's views are sensible, balanced, and clinically relevant. He references the clinical and research literature to butress his arguments. The book is a bit skimpy for the price. The author refers the reader to his other books, CDs, and tapes for futher information, making this a bit like an infomercial. In addition, the author sometimes sets up a straw man to make his points. For example, he writes about therapists who tell their clients to &quot;get their anger out&quot; by pounding a chair with a bat. This example sounds like a caricature of therapy and I can't believe anyone but the most incompetent novice therapist would take such a stance -- but living on the East Coast, I may be ignorant of how therapy is practiced in California where the author resides. Nonetheless, the book contains valuable insights for clinicians who treat depression. It is also one of the few books that deals with the use of hypnosis in depression, which used to be a strict &quot;no-no&quot; according to traditional schools of hypnosis. In that sense this book is a breath of fresh air in the often dogmatic and opinionated world of hypnosis."},{"Title":"Treating Depression With Hypnosis: Integrating Cognitive-Behavioral and Strategic Approaches","review":"I am so pleased that this was my introduction to Michael Yapko. (He does not encourage therapists to have their clients beat chairs as a previous reviewer stated). As a Program Manager for an Outpatient, Non-Profit, County sub-contracted, Mental Health Clinic for adults with chronic mental health issues, (and certified in hypnotherapy), I and my treatment team assist a lot of individuals with depression or co-morbid depression. Being a non-profit organization, I often have to hire clinicians who are not fully versed in psychotherapeutic theory or technique. I found this book to be an invaluable tool in helping them learn effective cognitive, behavioral and strategic interventions in treating depression and the theory behind these interventions. The reader does not have to know or even use hypnosis as a tool in therapy in order to learn these effective interventions for treating depression. Additionally, I appreciated the questioning of the effectiveness in treating depression with psychopharmacology, without adjunctive cognitive and emotional restructuring. A brief but succinct exploration of the psycho-social etiology of depression was also a welcomed feature to this book. All-in-all a very thorough and in-depth explanation on the causes of depression and how to effectively understand and intervene therapeutically, in treating it."},{"Title":"Treating Depression With Hypnosis: Integrating Cognitive-Behavioral and Strategic Approaches","review":"This book is a follow-up to Dr. Michael Yapko's original text, Hypnosis and the Treatment of Depressions. It further expands and refines his ideas, presenting a theoretically sound approach for utilizing hypnosis as a vehicle for the delivery of well-researched treatments for depression, including Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy and Interpersonal Psychotherapy.I found this book to be a valuable resource, full of relevant information presented in a concise and coherent manner, and easy to read. It reviews what is known about depression, discusses hypnosis and its clinical applications, and examines how to engage clients hypnotically while addressing issues that often contribute to depression. Such issues include client attributional styles, ambiguity, negative expectations, perceptions of controllability, and coping styles. The book also includes two-column transcripts of actual therapy sessions, wherein session content is presented side-by-side with explanatory commentary and analysis. Studying these sessions enhanced my understanding of the ideas presented in this book.This book is most helpful for readers who already have clinical training and experience in both psychotherapy and hypnosis. As a Psychotherapist (Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist), and a member of the American Society of Clinical Hypnosis, I consider this book to be essential reading for therapists working hypnotically with depression, along with other texts by Dr. Yapko, specifically Trancework and Hypnosis and the Treatment of Depressions."},{"Title":"Treating Depression With Hypnosis: Integrating Cognitive-Behavioral and Strategic Approaches","review":"Having gone through the 100 hr clinical hypnosis training with Dr. Yapko, I found Treating Depression with Hypnosis to be an outstanding companion to the training itself. It is written clearly and crisply and is straightforwardly instructive. Compliments my background and training in hypnosis and cognitive behavioral therapy."},{"Title":"Treating Depression With Hypnosis: Integrating Cognitive-Behavioral and Strategic Approaches","review":"Great book! Many thanks. Would highly recommend. Utilizing transcripts and narrative, Michael Yapko brings creativity and wisdom to process of working with depressed clients."},{"Title":"Helen Chen's Chinese Home Cooking","review":"As an always - on - move graduate student raised in an Italian - American family, I must confess that I was always a bit mystified by the the techniques used in the Chinese food I loved so much, but was always unable to achieve in the kitchen. Since I don't have a lot of time at this point in my life because of my studies, Helen Chen's book gives me simple to perform instructions for her quick and absoluetly delicious and nutritious recipes. Thank you Ms. Chen! I highly recommend this book. It is wonderful."},{"Title":"Helen Chen's Chinese Home Cooking","review":"I've owned this book for years. The receipes and particularly the descriptions of cooking techniques have proven invaluable. I consider myself a reasonably accomplished home cook but, until purchasing this wonderful resource I never quite \\"got it\\" as far putting really good Chinese cooking on the table. Helen explains both the how and the why allowing one to re-create the tastes, aromas and textures of Chinese home cooking. The format of the book is clear and easy to follow. The heavy emphasis on FRESH produce is wonderful. Most receipes are easily adapted to those that wish to reduce or even eliminate meat in the diet. I enjoyed the stories from her youth in her mother's kitchen, in the family restaurant, shopping in Chinatown. I love chicken and highly recommend the delicious and incredibly simple \\"Chinese White Chicken\\" (if you can boil water, you can make this great dish). Helen includes many easy and tasty dipping sauces that enhance almost any meal, yum!!!!"},{"Title":"Helen Chen's Chinese Home Cooking","review":"Her straight forward instructions are easy to follow.

I think that speaks for itself."},{"Title":"Helen Chen's Chinese Home Cooking","review":"I've used this cookbook for years; I have soy sauce stains on a number of its pages! Ms. Chen takes the mystery out of preparing wonderful Chinese food. I have not tried a recipe that we did not like. Try it, you'll like it!"},{"Title":"Helen Chen's Chinese Home Cooking","review":"I already have several Chinese cook books but I am still glad that I added this one to my collection. This book covers just what it says, hearty home-style cooking. As another reviewer has already noted, the quick Scallion Pancakes are an especially good discovery. This book has sections based on main ingredients and offers lots of variations on recipes. For example, in the section on beef stir fry, there are half a dozen ways to fix beef with oyster sauce as well as other options. I was particularly glad to find so many recipes using tofu. Another thing I appreciated was the discusion of ingredients and cooking methods at the beginning of the book.My favorite source of ideas for Chinese style dishes is the collection of recipes by Nancy McDermottQuick & Easy Chinese: 70 Everyday RecipesThat book has a different style with less recipes and slightly more elaborate preparation than this one. It's my first choice for a weekend or when having people over. Helen Chen gets me through the weeknights when I have less time and a quicker, but still tasty home-style meal, probably a stir fry, is what I'll be making."},{"Title":"Helen Chen's Chinese Home Cooking","review":"This is a great home-style cookbook, obviously a fusion of what Ms Chen learned from her famous mother and more modern takes on old classics. The book is chock full of interesting dishes that have all stood the test of time, and everything I've made so far has turned out well. Her sweet & sour pork is classic Chinese restaurant fare and works beautifully, including a special batter that she has fine tuned to produce a nice crunch that stays on the pork after it is fried and sauced. There is also an interesting recipe for a simplified/quick version of scallion bread that can be put together in just a few minutes and is really good---not exactly like the original that requires a lot of kneading and rolling up and rolling out to create croissant-like layers---rather this is more of a batter with chopped bacon and scallion that is cooked like a crepe. And it works, and is easy enough that it can be thrown together (without making mess of the kitchen!) on the spur of the moment for an evening snack. If you know how to cook and can follow a recipe, and most importantly you don't expect the book to be something it isn't, I think this book fills the bill nicely for relatively quick & easy everyday Chinese family food."},{"Title":"Helen Chen's Chinese Home Cooking","review":"This cookbook helps you get started with ingredients & tools you need to succeed. Nice variety of spices to incorporate into your cooking. Includes everything from appetizers to meals."},{"Title":"Helen Chen's Chinese Home Cooking","review":"I bought this cookbook when it was first released and since that time have cooked many happy family meals using Helen Chen's Home Cooking cookbook. The recipe directions are easy to follow and Chen explains how to use Chinese ingredients. Some of our favorite recipes from her cookbook include Shanghai Golden Fried Rice, Choo Choo Fried Rice, Egg Drop Soup and Lemon Chicken. My kids (and they were in grade school when I bought her cookbok) loved the Lemon Chicken recipe as it was like their much loved chicken nuggets only better.Highly recommend."},{"Title":"Helen Chen's Chinese Home Cooking","review":"I really enjoy cooking (--a good book) so like to try new ways.

Ben Gurion was a warrior poet."},{"Title":"B-G, fighter of Goliaths;: The story of David Ben-Gurion","review":"This boom was a nice and easy read. It gives us an inside look on the life of David Ben Gurion. Overall, it has a nice flow which made it easy to read. However, I felt it could have dug deeper into some more of the details.Overall, it definitely is a must read for anyone interested in the history of Israel."},{"Title":"B-G, fighter of Goliaths;: The story of David Ben-Gurion","review":"This book is pure hagiography. Too uncritical to be of much value. Incidentally, passe what has been said elsewhere, the Nazis were not at all oppposed to the setting up of a jewish state in Palestine. On the contrary, it accorded with Nazi beliefs that Jews were &quot;foreigners&quot; in Germany and needed their &quot;own&quot; territory, being incompatible with any country they settled in. Although not true of Ben Gurion himself, many early Zionists were complicit with the Nazis."},{"Title":"B-G, fighter of Goliaths;: The story of David Ben-Gurion","review":"Completely manipulative, devious, dishonest drivel...Please look at the facts, side by side, while reading this book."},{"Title":"B-G, fighter of Goliaths;: The story of David Ben-Gurion","review":"Erm.. who's the Goliaths here? Is it the lowly Palestinian people, run out of their homeland, persecuted and oppressed, denied basic human rights and dignity; or is it an American client state armed to the teeth, engaging in routine political assasinations adn massacres? Ok, a trick question, but dramatising B-G as some modern day Biblical hero is pure obfuscation, as is this book. Someone refers to B-G as a modern day JOshua reclaiming Canaan. Fine, but the &quot;reconquest&quot; of Canaan was, acording to the Old Testament, an act of genocide."},{"Title":"WELTY'S BOOK OF PROCEDURES-OP","review":"Instead of the confrontational process of traditional rules of order, I used a negotiation of consensus procedure. My years of service in cooperatives, churches, service clubs, and other membership organizations showed me how people of good will can make democratic decisions together. I set forth the exact procedures to use to avoid hostilities and to apply the most brain power to any problem a group may face. I also describe in detail the responsibilities of the officers of membership organizations. I tell how to organize a new co-op or other organization and include guidelines for writing -- or re-writing -- your articles of incorporation and bylaws. I show how you can consider every possible solution to a problem, instead of limiting your discussion to the one idea in a main motion. This is a practical guide, not a technical manual."},{"Title":"THIS WAS ANDERSONVILLE","review":"I have read this book 'outloud' so my husband could hear this story also. You feel as though you are part of the prison system and there are times I actually cried. Very good reading with little understanding of the treatment of prisoners. It has also made me hungry for more readings about the Andersonville Prison during the Civil War."},{"Title":"Barn Signed","review":"Avi does a great job describing the openness and the lonely expanses of pioneering days, out away from neighbors and help. We had an early reader by Avi, called \\"Prairie School.\\"In \\"The Barn,\\" a 9-year-old boy has to give up his schooling to help his family after his father has a stroke. He deals with the shock of seeing his father so reduced, and quickly has to tend to his father's needs - feeding him, keeping him company, even bathing him. It is told in a way that your own children will remember. They will understand how Ben shouldered his responsibilities and tried to find the bright side.Ben learns to communicate with his father, and develops an idea that he thinks can help reach through his wasted, uresponsive body. He convinces his brother and sister to help him, and together they build the barn their father has wanted.Excellent look at belonging in a family, at duty, at leadership, and at acknowledging the weakness of a parent. Even before the stroke, Ben's father was weak on duty and responsibility - this becomes clear through the sister's conversations and through reminiscences."},{"Title":"Barn Signed","review":"The book The Barn contains many different characters with their own problems. Ben is a smart young boy who loves to help; Ben is also the first child in the family to go to school. He wants to help his family take care of their sick father. Second character is Harrison he is strong and tall. Harrison has worked in the fields his whole life that helped him get big strong muscles. Number three is Nettie she is the oldest and wisest out of the children. Nettie is about to get married and move away with her fianc&eacute; but stays longer for her brothers. Last character is Father who is sick and dieing and has no way to do anything with his children. Father has palsy and it is making like a ghost. The many different characters in the book The Barn have their own problems but in the end it all comes down to one thing."},{"Title":"Barn Signed","review":"I felt this was A fantastic book. It had a lot of detail and really made me want to read more. A good age group for this book is 9 to 11. My favorite part of the book is when they finish the barn because it is a lot for children to do.

He has a 13-year-old brother, Harrison, and a 15-year-old sister. He is now nothing more than a vegetable. Now, not only do they have to harvest the crop without their fathers help, but they must also care for their father too. His father can't talk to him, so it will be a difficult task. Ben finds out from his brother and sister that his father had been hoping to build a barn before Ben came from school. He persuades Harrison and Nettie that they must build it to give Father a reason to live, but that that they have to build it alone, without the help of their neighbors. They manage to stack rocks for the base, and build walls, and a roof. After barn is finally finished, follows a horrible ending."},{"Title":"Barn Signed","review":"The book was horrible to read.

It is the story of how the construction of a simple barn, a dying father's wish, transforms the lives and bonding between three children and their father.

The vision of the barn, standing strong on their farm property, remained a source of strength, satisfaction, love, and family pride throughout their lifetime. It was a true family gift."},{"Title":"Barn Signed","review":"It's about a boy named Ben that lives on a farm, but he is at a privite school when his dad gets a disease. He has to go back to the farm and help his brother Harrison and his sister Nettie take care of their dad. Ben thinks that theres only one thing that will cure his dad's disease. If he does it he thinks it will help his dad regain health.My opinion about the book was I didn't like the book because it didn't explain about what is going on at his house or what is going on with his family. I liked it because it had a good story line and it had Ben trying and trying to helphis dad with his disease and he really believes that he can cure his dad."},{"Title":"Barn Signed","review":"This is a deceptively simple book -- a straightforward story laden with subtleties of writing, emotion, and meaning. It best read through once and then again slowly -- the first read will satisfy your &quot;what's going to happen?&quot; curiousity and will also deliver an emotional wallop; the second read gives you a chance to savor all the telling details and nuances that lead up to the wallop. Amazing that such spare writing can convey so much and so well. What a great book."},{"Title":"Barn Signed","review":"This book starts out with a boy named Ben, and while he is at his private boarding school in Portland his father has become ill and Ben will have to tend to him.

As they plow the fields every day, Ben starts to notice that father is trying to communicate in some fashion.So Ben finally understands some of the communications and tells Nettie and Harrison and they don't seem to believe him. Later on they see the communications and can not believe it themselves.

However, potential purchasers should be advised that the articles are pulled from Donald Redford's Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt, but without the extensive bibliographies, and with fewer illustrations. (The Introduction by Redford is, I believe, original to this volume.) If you already own the Encyclopedia, you might want to think twice before purchasing this book. If you don't already have the Encylcopedia, The Ancient Gods Speak will be an important addition to your shelf on Egyptian religion."},{"Title":"The Ancient Gods Speak: A Guide to Egyptian Religion","review":"This is one of my favourite and most referred-to books in the Egyptological section of my personal library, hands-down. The articles on demons, offerings, and heka are exceptionally useful, as those topics in particular are seldom explained in-depth or accurately in the more popularly-available texts. The articles have been written and organized meticulously, and no subject represented in the tome is left wanting for detail.Another benefit of this text is the broad sampling of scholars, among them Meeks, Silverman, and Manniche. No scholar is an expert in absolutely every aspect of his/her field, after all. Such exposure to a wide array of scholars offers much more than a simple bibliography, and encourages further exploration on the part of the reader -- which is what any good text should inspire.I would not recommend this book to the casual reader, however. The academic language of the articles can be cumbersome and dry to the unversed (though not wholly inaccessible), unlike a whitewashed Egyptian Mythology survey text written for popular consumption. Some basic understanding of Ancient Egyptian Theology, History, and culture beyond the grossly misinterpreted and highly abused \\"Contendings of Heru and Set\\" satire would be ideal intellectual possessions before any prospective reader attempts to properly utilize and appreciate such a reference text on Egyptian religion. For those well-versed in all things Ancient Egyptian, \\"The Ancient Gods Speak\\" is a priceless, comprehensive reference text that will be used often, and shall swiftly become a well-loved addition to one's library."},{"Title":"The Ancient Gods Speak: A Guide to Egyptian Religion","review":"It's separated out for each subject, for example \\"Orsiris\\" is a sub-section under \\"O\\", and \\"Afterlife\\" is a sub-section is under \\"A\\", this makes it very easy to use as a reference tool. The \\"Further Reading\\" section impressed me as well, and is a great tool within the book I plan to take advantage of. Again, as with most books I have read on Egyptian Mythology there is a lack of stories or \\"legends\\" within the book, containing more oppinions on the subjects rather than the \\"whole\\" stories themselves. I'd rather read the COMPLETE STORIES of myths and legends of the gods and obtain my own oppinion from it with a summary or hypothetical explaination at the end, yes I know this is never gonna happen but a girl can dream now can't she!! ;) Don't get me wrong I'm not dawging the book, it's wonderful in educating what type of artifacts egyptians used in thier religion, and summaries of why they use them. But my preference is to have the FULL story of the legend that goes with the use of the artifacts."},{"Title":"The Ancient Gods Speak: A Guide to Egyptian Religion","review":"I purchased this book here through Amazon, and I have to say that I cannot knock the contents of the book per say only that it was a difficult Read.

With the growing number of civilians wanting practical survival skills I needed to find a book that would teach from a civilian view point. This book is exactly what I have been looking for. While giving the basics needed to survive the book is very easy to read and understand. The chapters are organized well and cover everything a hunter, camper, hiker or outdoors person would need to survive for either a short or long period of time. Len McDougall tells it like it is and does not pull any punches when making reccomendations on equipment to purchase. This book will be utilized by myself in any future civilian survival courses I teach."},{"Title":"Practical Outdoor Survival: A Modern Approach","review":"This book delivered less than I expected. Its chief flaws are that it is outdated, superficial and poorly organized. It begins with highly detailed advice about basic tools that outdoorsmen should always carry: knives, compasses, etc. This is welcome information, but the author put the cart before the horse by introducing this material first. What was needed was a general discussion of the challenges of wilderness survival and the basic methods needed to overcome it. Without this overview, how can the reader prepare a proper shopping list? And regarding the author's proposed shopping list, few of the specific tools he mentions are still available. So the author's list of compasses and survival knives is nearly useless. The same type of problem is illustrated by the author's strong recommendation that every outdoorsman should carry a \\"dog rag\\", because it has so many uses. But this term and the cloth it refers to are now obsolete. In fact, I was unable to find a single reference to \\"dog rags\\" when I performed an internet search. There may be a few old timers who still use this term, but that's the point: it's now obsolete! Many other sections of the book also seem outdated or superficial. For example, although the section about snares will help the reader understand their general nature, it doesn't provide enough detail so that he could actually build one that will work properly. Despite these problems, I found this book somewhat helpful. It's short and easy to read, and it provides many useful ideas about basic issues such as finding food and shelter. But the overall impression left by this book is that it is merely an expanded magazine article rather than a thoughtful and thorough discussion of methods that can save a hiker's life during a wilderness emergency. On balance, I'm disappointed that this very good author produced such a light weight book on this important topic."},{"Title":"Practical Outdoor Survival: A Modern Approach","review":"Thanks to Lyons Press for publishing Len McDougall's PRACTICAL OUTDOOR SURVIVAL. Thumbing through other books on living in the outdoors, I find many of them interesting and useful on the topic of surviving a calamity in the wilderness, but this book hits the mark by being both thoroughgoing and compact. If you could pass this on to Mr. McDougall I would appreciate it."},{"Title":"Practical Outdoor Survival: A Modern Approach","review":"Anyone who gave this book 5 stars has no idea what a good book on the subject should contain. This is a poor attempt at written survival manual at it's best. The beginning starts out with the author recommending survival knives. What about if you don't have one? then what? Your survival knife will be there where you don't need it(this is from experience of many). While other books teach you how to use natural resources for cutting tools and shelter, this guy recommends the latest high-tech compasses, navigaton equipment and blah blah... Maybe there's some marketing trick in the survival world that I don't know about. Hard to say but whoever ends up in a survival situation without all the fancy modern tools, best luck to ya! I will say though that it has a decent info on building natural shelters but just about every other author has covered it and done way better. Don't expect to learn alot here. Just the basic stuff that you probably already know.

This book is ideal for civlian backpackers and campers who want serious advice about surviving in a real world survival situation."},{"Title":"Practical Outdoor Survival: A Modern Approach","review":"Every sentence is essential. One thing that really helped out as well was the author's method of listing essential items, and then in each scenario detailing what could be used - but also listing what could be done in the absence of those items.

Everything has to be extraordinary, epic, full of tropical lust, palms, jaguars, people having sex in every corner, flying to the sky with a pineapple on their heads. But Latin America is a vast continent producing artist of universal stature, even if the rest of the world decides (to their disadvantage) to ignore all but the folkloric.Well, Juan Rulfo is a master of the highest sort and this book is NOT magical realism, but pure, hard realism. He only wrote two books, this one and &quot;Pedro Paramo&quot;, another masterpiece which I also don't count as magical realism, although some do, as well as a few lesser works. He didn't need to write much. His is a literature worked and reworked restlessly, until reaching perfection. Every single word fits perfectly with the rest. There are no digressions, no philosophy, no theories or grand landscapes. All his tales develop in Southern Jalisco, in a poor, dry, vast, sunburned and sad land. The prose is also dry, precise, economical and to the point. The characters are ignorant, miserable, but conscious and courageous. The titles say much: &quot;It's because we are so poor&quot; is one of them. However, you will not find self-pity or corny sad tales. Only bits of human misery perfectly narrated. By the way, this is the first review I write for Amazon in which I use the word &quot;perfect&quot;. Probably it won't happen again, with one or two exceptions."},{"Title":"Burning Plain and Other Stories","review":"Sorry, I did not buy this book from Amazon, but I will by the other Rulfo books available. I found this book in a used book store, I happened to be browsing through. I don't even know what caught my eye, but what a find. This is so beautifully written. I must admit that though I at one time had a strong interest in the Mexican Revolution, I have forgottem much of what I learned, so some of the stories were hard for me to understand in their historical context. The writing is so evocative, however, that it doesn't matter. The feeling of desolation is almost too overwhelming. I was reminded somewhat of Ernest Hemingway by the use of short declarative sentences, also I suppose because Hemingway often used Spanish phrasing in his work. The best writing, in my opinion, evokes a feeling rather than describing it. Rulfo accomplishes that amazingly."},{"Title":"Burning Plain and Other Stories","review":"Rulfo's style, like his stories, is sparse, quiet, and often harsh. He offers disturbing tales of miserable people in barren places; yet there is also a strange beauty to be found in his work. I can think of few, if any, examples of such perfect prose. The characters--though they suffer--seem close at hand and perfectly real, and he gives the most incredible descriptions of landscapes that I have ever read in my life. It is easy to see his connection to \\"magical realism\\"--it is largely in the way he sets the tone of the stories, and in those unbelievably vivid descriptions--but his work does not fall into that category. There is no escaping the terribly blunt reality he creates.Whether you are interested in Latin American literature or not, if you are at all interested in prose, you should read this book."},{"Title":"Burning Plain and Other Stories","review":"ANGST. This is the best word to describe the human landscape that Rulfo has portrayed in this collection of short stories. A lanscape of extreme sorrow that blossoms over the arid plain, where poverty, opression and ignorance intermingle with faith to shape the tragedy of the post-revolutionary rural Mexico. A tragedy that has lived over 70 years and that may help explaining the nature of the mexican people, their doings and fears. But moreover its social meanings, Juan Rulfo, has created a masterpiece of storytelling, not only at the Latin-american level, but rather as an universal gift. This is not magic realism al&agrave; Garcia Marquez or Isabel Allende. This is bare boned reality, told with the beauty and the ease that just a master can reach, in which the words mix perfectly for creating short bursts of narrative, perfectly solved stories, that will fill the mind, the mouth and the eyes of the reader with the burnt sand of the plains, with the ashes of the dead, with the tears of the desperate. If you're ready to follow Tanilo's bloody footsteps toward Talpa, to hunt toads with Macario, or to fall under the spell of Ni&ntilde;o Anacleto's preaching, or under the spell of misterious rural Mexico, dive into the pages of this collection of short stories, and compare it with any other you have already read, and you will understand why Rulfo never writed any further. Because he almost reached perfection."},{"Title":"Burning Plain and Other Stories","review":"The Burning Plains is a compilation of short stories that Juan Rulfo published on diferent publications at different times. it's also at the moment, besides his masterpiece Pedro Paramo, the only material available.The shorts stories are chilling, incledibly well written. It's superb, and the english translation more than acceptable.To me the highlights of the book are &quot;Talpa&quot; and &quot;they have given us the land&quot; (the opener on the spanish version, but some reason is not on this english edition)but the whole book is amazing.I bought this book for my girfriend as an exorsism from jennifer Wiener's &quot;Good in Bed&quot; I was worried about the translation but it didn't dissapoint me.the ideal way to read The Burning Plain is in spanish, but since this book is not that surreal as pedro paramo is, this tranlation works just fine.I hope this brief note helps you to choose a good book."},{"Title":"Burning Plain and Other Stories","review":"There are no superfluous words, nothing to ease you into the harshness. Each story begins abruptly in the midst of struggle and hardship. Each ends with death and ashes predominate, and scant resolution suggested. The lives described are marked by isolation, coercion and limited options, lived in rocky and inhospitable terrain and in exposed conditions. The writing is consistent with the scenes described, sparse, succinct and unadorned. It makes for a powerful reading experience, but not necessarily a winsome one."},{"Title":"Burning Plain and Other Stories","review":"The Burning Plain is a collection of fifteen short stories by Mexican author Juan Rulfo, originally published in 1953 under the Spanish title of El Llano en llamas. Rulfo is widely considered by his countrymen to be Mexico's greatest author, even though he only published two books of fiction during his lifetime, this collection of stories and the novel Pedro P&aacute;ramo.The stories in The Burning Plain take place in rural Mexico, around the time of the Revolution of 1910, and often focus on the harsh aspects of peasant life. While some of the stories are very specifically Mexican, others are so stark and devoid of detail that their time and place are indeterminate. Common to all is a harsh, desolate landscape whose inhabitants struggle to eke out a living, some by coaxing a meagre crop from the arid soil, others by violently wielding a gun or machete. Poverty and murder permeate these stories, and death is a ubiquitous presence that Rulfo treats with an alternatingly bleak and comic fatalism.Rulfo's writing style is as sparse and severe as the land he depicts. No one can say as much with as few words as Juan Rulfo. His characters are often just the faint outline of human beings, his stages set with but a few rocks and trees, yet from these paltry ingredients he manages to craft complex narratives that vividly capture the drama of human existence. His prose is terse and stark, almost crude in its poetic simplicity, yet he also uses modernistic literary devices such as switching from first to third person in mid-story or alternating simultaneous stream-of-consciousness narratives. When Rulfo employs such techniques, it never feels gratuitous or forced, but always effortless and vital to the tale being told. The plots often start out deliberately obscure, sometimes frustratingly so, then slowly coalesce and develop like a figure emerging from a fog.Reading this collection is like strolling through a gallery of masterpieces. The stories are consistently excellent throughout. In the bluntly titled \\"We're very poor,\\" a flood inundates a rural village, washing away a cow belonging to the narrator's sister. Without that cow for her dowry, her family fears she will become a \\"bad woman\\" like her sisters. In \\"Tell them not to kill me!\\", an elderly man awaits his impending execution, grasping for a shred of hope, as he recalls his past 40 years as a fugitive, and the murder that led to his downfall. In the bleak but powerful \\"No dogs bark,\\" an old man, carrying his grown son on his back, stumbles through darkness in search of medical attention, lamenting the trouble brought about by his son's evil ways. \\"Remember\\" starts out as a folksy anecdote, with the narrator detailing the personality quirks of his home village's inhabitants. It then slowly and unexpectedly escalates into an account of a brutal killing. If there's one brilliant gem to be singled out from this treasure chest it would probably be \\"Talpa.\\" Tamilo, whose body is covered in mysterious, disgusting sores, convinces his wife and his brother (or sister, perhaps; I don't believe Rulfo ever specifies) to take him on a pilgrimage to the Virgin of Talpa, little knowing that the two are carrying on an affair behind his back.The Burning Plain is a landmark work, not only of Latin-American literature but of literature in general. I can't think of a better collection of short stories overall. Even for those who have absolutely no interest in Mexico, its history or its culture, Rulfo's stories transcend their setting to offer profound and unblinking insight into the universal human condition."},{"Title":"Burning Plain and Other Stories","review":"I plan in the near future to travel to Bolivia, specifically the Altiplano - I read this book a number of years ago and I can think of nothing better to complement a desolate landscape.

Many of these stories are short interesting stories that give the reader what to think about, action, sad parts, and contains nasty events when people are killed.

The book will make the reader feel grossed out because in the ways some people are killed. All of these stories take place in a rural place.

When I visited the state in the summer of 2004, I found the mountains and valleys breathtaking and the old mining facilities made me appreciate the ruggedness of the Europeans who first settled in the region. However, I was also surprised at how flat and fertile the eastern section was. The plains region reminded me of my home state of Iowa.In this book, Muench presents the disparity of environments that exist in Colorado in images.

Americans are abandoning the carnivals and freak shows for the latest and greatest thing: the talkie. The freak show at the Starlight Carnival Royale's has been renamed Dugan's Cabinet of Wonders to appeal to a public more interested in the flickering of the moving picture show than what's standing before them. Rubes are still paying their nickels and dimes to see the Siamese twins, the tattooed man, the Wolf Girl, the Marvelous Morphodite, and Dugan himself, the dwarf, but money is getting tighter and tighter and the venues smaller and smaller as the carnival is about to roll into the history books.Renee Dodd's poignant and colorful debut novel, A Cabinet of Wonders, takes readers behind the canvas to reveal the wonders of the freak Show, the Starlight's most lucrative dimension.The main protagonist is the dwarf, Dugan, whose role is more than a businessman, scholar, and main attraction. He is also the man who keeps the show together, acting as father, lover, and confident to his merry little band of outcasts who make up the Freak Show, and indeed, his family.Dodd's focus, which is solely on the characters in the freak show, illustrates that no matter how different our physical shells are, everyone, freak and non-freak, is pretty much the same on the inside. Her exclusive lens on this one aspect of carnival life is revealing in the way the characters make and break alliances, love, and grow in spirit, mind, and flesh. For example, the 16th birthday party for the Siamese twins, Molly and Faye, reveals the girls, joined at the hip, fascination with boys and beads, and illustrates the fine line between where the girl ends and the woman begins.A Cabinet of Wonders is perfect example of historical fiction. The details, including a mention of The Great Gatsby, place readers into that world and uses language and description that catapults reader into this time period of American history.Armchair Interviews says: Interesting look into the lives of those who inhabit carnivals.From Our Armchair to Yours ..."},{"Title":"Cabinet of Wonders, A","review":"While the premise of Renee Dodd's book is ambitious--write a novel about the performs in a sideshow, focusing on a single character in each chapter--the result is less than impressive. Dodd's characters blend into one another, each reacting in the same way to the same set of circumstances. I never really heard the \\"voice\\" of any of these characters; instead, I heard Dodd stressing over and over that these people are unique, and yet at the same time robbing them of thier individuality. For example, the descriptions and emotions described in a chapter about the twins could easily be cut and plopped down in a chapter about the \\"Wolf Girl.\\" Dodd also tries too hard to write beautiful, sophisticated prose. She is obviously a talented writer, but some of her descriptions were cringe-worthy or too bogged down with themselves. While a sweet and intelligent novel that wants to highlight the humanity in these people, Cabinet of Wonders strips them of their voices, their faults, and their indiviuality, leaving them two-dimensional players in a quick and forgettable read."},{"Title":"Cabinet of Wonders, A","review":"Not my usual read. But I was drawn in by the unique perspective of each character. Watching their roads unfold in the exquisite detail and rich portrayal by the author made this a book that drew me in and didn't let me put it down."},{"Title":"Cabinet of Wonders, A","review":"This was definitely one of the best books I've read in a long time.

I liked the varying perspectives presented as the author gave each character the opportunity to relate their stories in the first person."},{"Title":"Cabinet of Wonders, A","review":"A Cabinet of Wonders was intriguing. In spite of some discomfort with the characters, the writing drew me in. The author's descriptions of the carnival people were clear, not subtle, and vivid. But even further, the author gave insights into the souls of each person. It was thought provoking because it pushed me to see each character as an individual person, not a carnvial oddity without feelings, hopes and desires. Excellent well-written book which I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Cabinet of Wonders, A","review":"Having a fascination with 'freak shows' of the past, I was immediately drawn to Renee Dodd's A Cabinet of Wonders. I was drawn in from the very beginning and the story kept my interest through to the very end. I would read for hours at a stretch because I was so involved with the story and the characters. Dodd creates a vibrant, and fairly accurate, picture of the a traveling circus. The characters are beautifully written and are fully developed as people, not just freaks.The opening, written in an engaging second person, drew me in just as if I were at a fair being pulled into a tent for a nickel. It gave me a quick snapshot overview of the characters in the novel. The novel manages to allow each character to develop as an individual while still retaining the feel of 'the family' they have created. The character's interactions with one another leads to immediate understanding of their relationships.The most powerful aspect of the novel is the characters themselves, they keep the story interesting. The story and plot of the novel itself is weak, there is no driving quest that keeps the story moving, it is entirely based on the character's growth and development. The beginning through the middle is strong and the actions believable, however, I found the ending too great an effort to tie up all the loose ends, and force an end.All in all though, I greatly enjoyed this novel and have now read it three times, always finding something new and more exciting. Renee Dodd has certainly become one of my favorite authors and I will be on the look out for more work by her."},{"Title":"Cabinet of Wonders, A","review":"I read this book on the heels of Water for Elephants. Both were fascinating and difficult to put down. Renee Dodd is a brilliantly expressive writer whose unusual characters become absolutely real as each page is turned."},{"Title":"Cabinet of Wonders, A","review":"With \\"A Cabinet of Wonders,\\" Renee Dodd delivers what is, at heart, a classic tale about the struggle to hold a family together, despite insurmountable forces.If you're like the rubes of the 1920's and 30's who gawked at the performers in traveling freak shows in order to satisfy some dark and morbid curiosity, then this may not be the book for you.Dodd's narrative doesn't play to shock and revulsion; instead, the author chooses to draw the reader in with honest and open characters, and she does so in a way that evokes empathy and even a degree of understanding about how such considerable physical deformities are sometimes considered a blessing for those who bear them.In essence, Dodd's characters reveal the truth--albeit uncomfortable for some--about so-called \\"freaks;\\" Other than their obvious physical traits, they're just like the rest of us."},{"Title":"Cabinet of Wonders, A","review":"If you were blown away by Katherine Dunn's GEEK LOVE and have been looking for something else like it, keep looking or just read GEEK LOVE again! That magnificent book starts with quote and promise \\"This thing of darkness I acknowledge mine.\\" and quickly introduces an operatic cast of grotesques who build to mythic levels of monstrosity which can barely be contained. This book on the other hand is about some fairly nice, differently abled peole whose main claim to fame is that they live on the road. Although each has his/her own physical deformity and single defining personality item to match the overwhelming characteristic of each freak is that it is nice person, very, VERY NICE. So nice, that I could barely tell them apart and would end up skimming back and forth several pages to see if that was the wolf girl or the fat lady or what. Remember the SIMPSONS episode where Marge gets all the splatter taken out of Itchy and Scratchy's show and they stand dumbstruck by the idea of being nice, tongues hanging out in confusion? That's how this book made me feel. That's not why I read books about freaks! Like Bart and Lisa, I went out to look at the sunset. I left this book behind in the hotel when I checked out.I should say that like all books from TOBY PRESS, the cover and production is excellent. Unfortunately, despite much research on the part of the first time author, the story never comes across and anachronisms stand out like sore thumbs.

Boy meets girl, girl already has an infatuation for the wrong guy, girl finally realizes her hero isn't worth it, boy gets girl. This isn't a plot spoiler, BTW, because it's all very obvious from the first.Although the setting is modern, the heroine is reminiscent of a Victorian character. She's afraid of her own shadow, she never figures out who the bad guys are, even when they're lying to her or saying things that are contradictory, and she generally acts like she hasn't a brain in her head, even though she's a grad student. I mean, what kind of idiot knows they're going to be working on an archeological site in Mexico for some months but doesn't figure out they need to start learning at least simple Spanish?If you like a romance that's an easy read, and don't have my objection to suffering fools gladly, you'll enjoy this.

It was light and fast, a little incongruous (would so many natives have attended the lectures?

With Path of the Jaguar, Vickie Britton and Loretta Jackson are obviously not trying to compete with John Grisham.They have obviously done a bit of research that establishes the setting and plot anchors. From there the story progresses with gripping suspense.Path of the Jaguar took me back to my Nancy Drew days and I thank Vickie and Loretta for that.

Daynes's remarkable new book, MORE WIVES THAN ONE: TRANSFORMATION OF THE MORMON MARRIAGE SYSTEM, 1840-1910. This extraordinary study clearly deserves the \\"best book of the year\\" award it has just received from this 1,000 member historical association.For several decades now, first-rate scholarship has proliferated about Mormonism's most controversial 19th century social practice, plural marriage. Virtually every aspect of Mormon polygamy has been analyzed, discussed, and dissected from a variety of perspectives. Historians have explored the intellectual and social origins of the practice; how it worked in Utah during the second half of the 19th century; the crusade against Mormon polygamy that led to Wilford Woodruff's 1890 Manifesto ending public Latter-day Saint support for the practice; the post-Manifesto expressions of polygamy in splinter off-shoots from the Latter-day Saint movement; while comparative studies have analyzed Mormon polygamy within its larger American and world context.These books have added immeasurably to our understanding of the remarkable complexity of Mormon plural marriage. No other study, however, can match Kathy Daynes's achievement in MORE WIVES THAN ONE.Every time a new book about Mormon polygamy appears, I can't help wondering whether it will actually add anything new to what we already know. MORE WIVES THAN ONE, however, breaks new ground on many different fronts simultaneously. Overall, it provides the first comprehensive and fully convincing scholarly analysis of the origin, development, and dissolution of Mormon plural marriage during the 19th century. Daynes's analysis also shows how Mormon polygamy developed in relation to both monogamous Mormon marriage practices and mainstream American family practices of the time. Using the word \\"definitive\\" is always risky. But if this book isn't the definitive analysis of Mormon polygamy practice in 19th century America, we'll have to wait a long time before anyone surpasses this superb book.The best shorthand way I can characterize Daynes's overall achievement is to remind you of an old Peanuts cartoon. In it, Linus and Charlie Brown are lying on their backs on a hill looking up at the clouds. Linus is saying something along the following lines: \\"Aren't clouds fascinating! I can see so many things in the clouds. Why, over there I can see the stoning of Stephen. And there is King John signing the Magna Carta. And up there is Napoleon just before the battle of Waterloo. What do you see in the clouds, Charlie Brown?\\" And Charlie Brown answers, \\"Well, I was going to say that I saw a doggie and duckie and a kittie, but I think I just changed my mind.\\"Compared to Daynes's MORE WIVES THAN ONE, most of the rest of us who have been studying Mormon polygamy might well have been describing doggies and duckies and kitties, metaphorically speaking. I'm exaggerating a bit here, of course; many of us have also written fine studies of our own. Yet Kathy Daynes's MORE WIVES THAN ONE stands out from all the other books on Mormon polygamy yet published in at least seven ways:First, the book provides a balanced, nuanced, and convincing assessment of the entire sweep of the development of 19th century Mormon polygamy, beginning with its origins in Nauvoo, Illinois during the 1840s and continuing through to its dissolution among mainstream Mormons during the two decades after the Woodruff Manifesto of 1890. Virtually all previous scholarly studies of Mormon polygamy--even if they discuss the overall development of the practice--have focused on one specific time, location, or issue connected with polygamy. Daynes does analyze a specific Mormon town, Manti, Utah, and the changes in its family and kinship practices across three quarters of a century, but she uses this model case study of Manti to illustrate the development of plural marriage throughout virtually the entire period when polygamy was advocated and practiced within mainstream Mormonism in Utah.MORE WIVES THAN ONE is exceptional, in the second place, because it skillfully places its analysis of the development of Mormon polygamy within the larger context of 19th-century American family values and practices. Daynes has mastered the rich and highly nuanced recent literature on 19th-century American family experience. She skillfully and unobtrusively makes comparisons with what was going on in mainstream American families, while focusing her attentions on the distinctive characteristics of Mormon families--especially polygamous Mormon families.Third, this study combines a staggering amount of primary genealogical and quantitative research into family records, census data, and similar sources, with compelling anecdotes, resulting in an engrossing read throughout. Most scholars either describe their quantitative findings in mind-numbing detail or use a narrative approach. Daynes, however, skillfully combines both quantitative and qualitative approaches throughout her book.Fourth, Daynes breaks new ground by creatively analyzing how the religious and social dimensions of Mormon polygamy were influenced by the American legal system. She explores how formal legal regulations in Utah (and in the rest of the United States) were related to the Mormon church's distinctive religious supervision of its own marriage and family practices. And she shows how the eventual Mormon loss of independent control over its marriage practices in Utah was closely related to the decline of the plural marriage system and the reversion of mainstream Mormonism to monogamy by the early twentieth century.Fifth, this book analyzes how plural marriage helped Mormons address difficult economic problems, especially during the early years of Utah settlement. Daynes argues that polygamy helped redistribute scarce economic resources in early Utah because poor or even destitute Mormon women typically became plural wives of more well-off men. Utah's economic progress after the most difficult early days of pioneer settlement, Daynes argues, combined with other internal and external factors, gradually undercuttingthe appeal of plural marriage for Mormons by the end of the 19th century.Sixth, Daynes argues that 19th-century Mormon flexibility in granting divorces--when combined with the church's concurrent encouragement of remarriage--contributed to the initial development of plural marriage. She emphasizes (and perhaps overemphasizes) the positive impact of such Mormon flexibility in dealing with divorce and remarriage, although her study also does include many negative example, as well.Finally, this book's most striking overall achievement is in demonstrating how remarkably diverse polygamous practice actually was in early Utah. The Mormon plural marriage system--and Daynes shows that it was a system, rather than merely a form of anarchic individualism--was, nevertheless, almost staggeringly complex at times. Daynes helps her readers make human sense of the complexity of plural marriage practice during the last half of the 19th century in Utah by trying to analyze it as part of the larger goals that Mormon Church was trying to accomplish.On a more personal note, I am pleased to see that this study elaborates and contextualizes some of the most complex and controversial issues that I broached more than two decades ago in my first book RELIGION AND SEXUALITY (Oxford University Press, 1981). Particularly intriguing is the evidence Daynes presents that some form of temporal \\"proxy husband\\" arrangements may have been used on a very limited basis during the earliest development Mormon polygamy in Nauvoo, Illinois, as well as in early Utah. Daynes also discusses the Mormon argument that the \\"alienation of affections\\" of the woman provided a \\"biblical\\" basis for both divorce and polygamy, showing how this may have been related to the strikingly similar use of such arguments in early Utah.Overall, then, it is hard for me even to begin to express my admiration for Daynes's work. Let me simply conclude with the assessment of another distinguished Mormon historian, Dean May, who states: \\"This superb book is far and away the best study of Mormon polygamy ever to appear. Kathryn Daynes provides a feast of information and historical context, summarizing and analyzing intelligently and with admirable balance virtually every issue that has ever been raised in connection with Mormon polygamy. This is a gem.\\" It really is.--Lawrence Foster, author of RELIGION AND SEXUALITY (1981); WOMEN, FAMILY, AND UTOPIA (1991); and FREE LOVE IN UTOPIA (2001)."},{"Title":"More Wives Than One: Transformation of the Mormon Marriage System, 1840-1910","review":"Plural marriage was by far Joseph Smith's most controversial doctrine. The Mormon founder began the practice in the 1830s and established it as a central part of the Mormon religion in the 1840s. It defined the religion's distinctiveness until the beginning of the twentieth century. Accordingly, and appropriately, it has received considerable historical attention. Kathryn Daynes' &quot;More Wives than One&quot; offers an in-depth look at the long-term interaction between belief and the practice of polygamy among the Mormons in the central Utah town of Manti.Following the obligatory, and rather unsatisfactory, opening chapter on the origins of Mormon plural marriage in Kirtland, Ohio, and Nauvoo, Illinois, Daynes begins a sustained analysis of polygamy in Manti. She shows that plural marriage followed no monolithic pattern there, but that each approach had its own rights and responsibilities. Using biographical and demographic data she also demonstrates the factors shaping the practice, analyses the ingredients of plural marriage, and explores how it evolved over time. She discusses how Mormon marriage practices solidified a patriarchal model of society, one that diverged sharply from the &quot;companionate&quot; model of marriage and egalitarian social ideas then taking hold in mainstream America. This divergence prompted resistance from elsewhere in the United States, eventually forcing ending of the practice by the church. This is a well down work that provides important insights into the Mormon's &quot;peculiar institution.&quot;"},{"Title":"Down The Rabbit Hole: A Samantha Skellar Mystery","review":"Book was received timely & in good shape as promised. Very good read although short, would have liked it to go on & on. Not your fault..just thought I would mention it."},{"Title":"Ancient-Future Faith: Rethinking Evangelicalism for a Postmodern World","review":"I found this book exciting and easy to read. The reason is that Webber connects the ethic and doctrine of the ancient Church to the postmodern world. The situations are quite similar. Webber, a conservative Baptist turned evangelical Episcopalian, argues that the history of the Church consists of different paradigms. Each paradigm is a different expression of the faith, relevant for the time, but inadequate for later generations. Thus, while reformation theology of Sola Scriptura was necessary to counteract the excesses of the later Middle Ages, for the postmodern (and for the early) Church it doesn't work very well (it has led to 1000s of denominations). Webber has some very helpful tables comparing beliefs of different paradigms.Webber correctly observes that postmodern people are more diverse, less concerned about minor doctrinal differences, and more symbolic. This coincides with new scientific theories that posit a dynamic, non-Newtonian universe. So how can we find authority and meaning? The answer is classical Christianity. Enlightenment rationalism doesn't work anymore, as relativity destroys any idea of objectivity, so theology must be done in the context of the Christian community, the Church, as it was in early Christianity. The Church provides the interpretive authority of the Bible through the creeds. However, this authority is broad, and is something that Catholics, Orthodox, and (most) Protestants share in common (see Vincent of Lerins' canon). As in the early Church, Jesus is the ultimate focal point of the Church, and apostolic tradition and the Bible point to him.Webber makes use of the \\"Christus Victor\\" model of the Atonement. This is the predominant theory of the Atonement expounded by the early Church. This theory says that Jesus, in his Incarnation, death, resurrection, and teachings, conquered evil. It is holistic, rather than narrowing down \\"when\\" Christ saved us, such as at the Crucifixion. Thus there is room for unity and mystery in the doctrine, just as in the early Church.Ultimately, as Modernity dies, Webber advocates a return to the early church of the Fathers. Thus the Church needs to be less individualistic, unified by the creeds, symbolic, sacramental, and arts oriented. However, Webber doesn't want postmodern values to *shape* the Church (e.g. when the Church is a business or side-show), but rather that the Church must be able to convey its basic truth in the postmodern world. Webber is simply advocating what many are already doing: rediscovering the riches of ancient Christianity, dismissed by many enlightenment-era Christians as \\"outdated\\" (liberals), or \\"irrelevant to faith\\" (fundamentalists). The era of Classical Christianity, when major doctrines were shaped, ethics were worked out, and the canon closed, is neither outdated nor irrelevant."},{"Title":"Ancient-Future Faith: Rethinking Evangelicalism for a Postmodern World","review":"This book provided for me an important Schaefferian Hayloft experience. I have been doing some heavy rethinking about my beloved evangelicalism and it has proved, in its contemporary manifestation, to be quite insufficient in answering some of my deeper questions and longings about the nature of God, His creation and our humanity.This book has helped answer these bigger questions and shown me that in thinking about them, I am not moving away from orthodoxy, but in fact, toward it in a grand way. That has given me a significant sense of hope and encouragement. Many thanks to the author for a wonderful book."},{"Title":"Ancient-Future Faith: Rethinking Evangelicalism for a Postmodern World","review":"This book has all ready been splendidly reviewed, but I felt I may have a few things to note. The author is a professor, and the book is written as such. People seeking &quot;warm fuzzies&quot; from reading a book about rediscovering classical Christianity are not going to find it here. They will instead find a powerful look at the way that classical Christianity can be drawn upon to reenergize the church, specifically the evangelical church, and make it a more dynamic force in the world as the body of Christ.

We suffer from a lack of understanding of the past, so we find ourselves struggling in the present for that which is meaningful with a cautious concern for the future.For anyone who finds current &quot;Pop Theology&quot; thin and longs for authentic Christianity, this book offers a challenge to examine and drink deeply of the &quot;faith once delivered&quot;.A masterful book that continues the challenge to the Evangelical Protestant mind to consider the Truths of the past in light of the present with an expectation of the future."},{"Title":"Ancient-Future Faith: Rethinking Evangelicalism for a Postmodern World","review":"\\"The road to the future runs through the past.\\" So says the late Robert Webber in the first book of his Ancient-Future series. In Ancient-Future Faith: Rethinking Evangelicalism for a Postmodern World, Webber encourages evangelicals to return to the model of the early church as a way to bring renewal and guidance to our churches as we navigate through the murky seas of postmodernism.Ancient-Future Faith is a thought-provoking book with many good insights. Webber's knowledge of history and theology ground this book in the need for corporate worship that is focused on God, a church that understands itself as the body of Christ, and an evangelistic outlook as a process of discipleship.What I LikedWebber is right to show us how we can learn from the early church. Webber is also right to chastise evangelicals for so quickly dismissing the roots of our history and heritage. There is much to be gleaned from the classical Christian period, even if we have too often neglected our past by choosing instead to chase after the most contemporary expressions of Christianity.Webber rightly emphasizes the importance of discipleship over quick-conversion evangelism. He claims that, for a postmodern world, the church's witness is the most effective apologetic that we can put forth. He is also right to advocate the recovery of symbolism in our worship services.The BadThe generalizations found in Ancient-Future Faith are often misguided. Webber's charts, diagrams, and tables comparing the current worldview to those of previous generations are helpful in their illustration, but their generalizations tend to polarize the discussion rather than elicit appropriate reflection. Because Webber seeks to show how a return to classical Christianity is the best reaction to the culture's recent turn to postmodernism, he has to squeeze and force his descriptions into these categories in order to make this case.Webber downplays the need for intellectual justification of Christianity's truth claims. I agree that the community of faith is the best apologetic for a postmodern world, but I do not think this must replace the worthy goal of Christian apologetics. Webber leans toward Fideism in his apologetic outlook (perhaps in an overreaction to a purely rational Christianity). Why do we have to choose one apologetic method over another?Webber believes that postmodernism demands a return to the Christus Victor theory of the atonement. While I agree with Christus Victor and Irenaeus' theory of recapitulation, I do not believe that one theory has to be cherished above all others. Webber has a certain distaste for penal substitution, and though he does not deny its truth, he clearly denies its power to reach the current generation. Ironically, the substitutionary model of the atonement comes out even in the early church leaders that Webber quotes as evidence for Christus Victor! The idea that classical Christianity believed in Christus Victor alone is a historical fallacy.One other part of Ancient-Future Faith bothered me. Webber goes back to the ancient church, but not to the earliest church. I kept asking myself as I read: \\"Why doesn't he just go all the way back to the New Testament?\\" Surely, the New Testament church has more to say to us as we enter a pluralistic, postChristian society than does the Constantinian -Christendom era. While I believe we can gain insight from classical Christianity, I am not convinced it is the best period from which to draw. Furthermore, Webber downplays the significance of the Reformation, both theologically and practically, only giving lip service to its goals, theology, and reforms.Ancient-Future Faith is an important book. I admire Dr. Webber for his work in the area of worship renewal. There is plenty of good insight contained in this book to merit its place on the thoughtful pastor's shelf. Even when I disagreed with some of Dr. Webber's conclusions, I felt as if the book has sharpened me and helped prepare me for the challenges ahead."},{"Title":"Ancient-Future Faith: Rethinking Evangelicalism for a Postmodern World","review":"I enjoyed Robert Webber's book and have enjoyed hearing him speak as well. At a recent speaking engagement he echoed my own concern over the \\"fate\\" of the church in America. So much \\"commodification\\" has happened in the church that one wonders if anyone knows what it truly means to be \\"ecclesia\\"? Although I agree with much of what he says and am part of a liturgical church (The Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod which utilizes the church calendar and has had a strong emphasis on liturgy - - - the church body which Webber received his doctorate from), my question is are we truly called to \\"change\\" the church in order to meet the people where they are at?I agree with his assessments yet I question the reasonings behind doing it. Do we begin to emphasize certain things to the demise of others, just because the culture would be more \\"prone\\" to come to the church? Or does the church remain faithful to its calling despite the changing tides of culture?Our self-centered culture always asks the question \\"What does this mean for me?\\", and this has been a active question in the church for sometime. I believe the question that we should be asking is how does God give meaning to me, or what do I mean to God? Our focus needs to be off of ourselves and onto the Lord of the cosmos."},{"Title":"Ancient-Future Faith: Rethinking Evangelicalism for a Postmodern World","review":"For those seeking a more liturgical, catholic (universal) faith, Webber's book is outstanding. Coming from a pentecostal background myself, and now pastor of a United Methodist Church, I believe that Webber has given us a model for the future of the Christian church. We concentrate on what divides us and he has shown in this work what unites us.I recommend this book and a good companion volume would be his &quot;Evangelicals on the Canterbury Trail&quot;."},{"Title":"Ancient-Future Faith: Rethinking Evangelicalism for a Postmodern World","review":"Robert Webber's books are great; I think at this point I have read all of them. They present an interesting analysis of the current woes that plague the Protestant Church. One thought that is persistent in his books yet is never spelled out is this: \\"Guys, we made a mistake. The Orthodox have been right all along.\\"There are a few things that are rather thin in most of his writings. He underscores the concept of 'Christus Victor' yet never shows how this concept was actualized in history. Christ's victory over the powers of evil? This he never spells out, for he'd have to go deeply unto the teachings of the Classical Church, dismantle all those theories of Atonement, which would clash with the teachings of the modern Protestantism. The other area that is also weak in his books is music. In everything else, he pushes the envelope; however, in regards to music his ideas are rather dusty. Not to worry, church musicians with brains and imagination will take it from here. Besides, if theology could be cycled back to the first six centuries of the Classical Christianity, why not music? Lucky are the Orthodox - they don't have to \\"cycle\\" anything."},{"Title":"Ancient-Future Faith: Rethinking Evangelicalism for a Postmodern World","review":"Carrying on many of the same themes he addressed in \\"Evangelicals on the Canterbury Trail\\" in his \\"Ancient-Future\\" Webber sought to continue working through being an historically rooted Christian in light of the emerging postmodern discussion. His thesis in this work is to call Christians to return to the classical Christian tradition of the first several hundred years of the early church as a way to reconnect with some of the main features of our postmodern world."},{"Title":"Ancient-Future Faith: Rethinking Evangelicalism for a Postmodern World","review":"This is a great book for deep thinkers with open minds. He rightly points out how the post-modern world is longing after something more than head knowledge in the church. The mystery is back - holy mystery that is.If only Webber could have strengthened his resolve with some heart-felt words about how God is more than just a concept, and how wodnerful worship in spirit and truth could be with symbols of both our past and our present. His head knowledge style will make Webber's book tough reading for anyone looking for encouragement and not involved in a seminary program. His language and style will dramatically limit the audience for this book. Too bad. There is some good stuff here.The only real bone I have to pick is when the church was most pure - for Webber it is the 3rd or 4th century AD. Why? He therefore cherishes the forms of the early State church of Rome, which it can also be argues had become distracted and somewhat compromised in its forms. As a result, the 1st century, which also had a fair degree of symbolism, is slighted in its potential representation in a post-modern approach."},{"Title":"Ancient-Future Faith: Rethinking Evangelicalism for a Postmodern World","review":"Lots of church growth books, seminars, 'experts' [remember an expert is nothing but a former spurt! Ha!] are all cramming down Western Christianity's throat that we've got to have 'contemporary music' [so-called] and we've got to have this and that to 'reach' our postmodern world. Webber hits the nail right on the head and brings out the grass-roots issue many of us 'small-time' small town, small church, 'in the trenches' pastors have known over the last 10 years of ministry, namely that all the fads and all the hoopla, all the 'church growth' ideas will NOT get people into church. God's way and God's Word and God's worship is the ONLY way. Returning to our 'roots' is EXACTLY what attracts folks to the place I minister in. Webber's form of Ancient-Future Worship does what spiritually hungry people WANT...EXALTING Christ, EXPERIENCING Christ...ENCOURAGING participation in Christ. I highly recommend this, even though it is sometimes a little too 'high-brow' and I'd highly recommend Hunter's 'Celtic Way of Evangelism' in tandam to get THE RIGHT picture of worship and ministry that WILL reach Generation X, Generation Y and all the others in this rapidly changing world.

It put so many things together for me that are so significant for the church in the postmodern 21st century.At the same time I was reading this book, the minister of worship and music in my congregation was finishing a doctor of ministries degree with Robert Webber as one of the professors. His D.Min. project related to developing a new worship motif for our congregation. So much of what Webber says was coming alive to me in the worship services in my congregation.From reading this book I now know that the dominant worldview of congregations who make it to the end of the 21st century will be postmodern. Modern congregations will no logner exist. Very few new congregations need to be started from now forward with a modern worldview. That category is already full. The leading innovative and effective congregation of the second decade of the 21st century will primarily be congregations that were started after 1992.One more thing: as you read this book, look closely.

His arguments for returning to the Ancient church (he defines from 100-600AD) I don't think hold up.He thinks that the Ancient church is the solution to post-modernism, and he seems to naively present that period, as if it did not have any problems. But we know that it was full of debates on theology.Can we also go back to the Ancient church? Even though some people call this period post-modern, we have not given up all the attributes of modern thinking. We are still highly critical thinkers. I am starting to think that hyper-modern is a better name for this period.Webber is more interested in the practices after the NT was written, than he is about thinking about the church as it is described in the NT. Yes the church in Acts and the Epistles was in flux trying to find it's way, but wouldn't Paul be more better to read and thought about, than the people and structures after the apostles?

Once when I was barely pubescent and had no idea that Ngaio Marsh was an important mystery author. Again in my 20's when I seriously started to read Marsh's books (an had forgotten that I'd read Death of a Peer). Once more in my 40's for the heck of it, and now, once again. The best recommendation I can ever make is that this is an immensely re-readable book.One doesn't read a classic English mystery story for the puzzle, as perplexing as that might be, but for the wonderful settings and characters. Lord Peter, Albert Campion, and Marsh's Roderick Alleyn are all not just great detectives but fascinating people that you would love to have as friends. What makes Marsh especially strong is how much detail she gives to her supporting cast.The Lampreys are all perfect jewels of the story tellers art. They are the classic eccentric, down on their luck, British nobility. Too busy being noble and sincerely lovable to remember to be practical. They are all charming, and your heart will also go out to Roberta Grey, one of the Lamprey's particular friends.Other reviewers have gone over the plot, so I'm not going to bore you with details. Suffice it to say you will be alternatively delighted and and horripilated (I think that's the word) as the book moves from light hearted comedy to a rather ghoulish end game. Everything the mystery addict could ever want!There are many good reasons to read this book. It is one of the novels that helped define the British mystery story doyen. Ngaio Marsh is on of the most important writers in that genre (even if she isn't quite British), and Death of a Peer is certainly one of her best books.But the real reason to read it is that it is simply very, very good. If you have never read a Marsh book this is a great way to start. If you have, you know what you're missing."},{"Title":"Surfeit of Lampreys","review":"The Lampreys are a family seemingly lifted from one of playwright Noel Coward's most brilliant comedies: they are charming, clever, eccentric, and virtually everyone who encounters them soon falls under their spell. Unfortunately, they are also among the most financially irresponsible aristocrats imaginable, always going broke. Even so, they have always managed to escape the public humiliation of bankruptcy--until, that is, a dubious business partnership explodes around them.Only one hope stands between the Lampreys and complete disaster: that Lord Charles Lamprey's older brother, Lord Wutherwood, may be enticed to come to the rescue. But Lord Wutherwood is largely immune to the legendary Lamprey family charm--and more than a little miserly--and the mix of eccentricity, family titles, and money proves lethal.Written on the eve of World War II, many critics regard DEATH OF A PEER (also published as A SURFEIT OF LAMPREYS) as Ngaio Marsh's single finest novel. I think that's arguable, but no matter how you look at, it is certainly one of Marsh's best. Marsh's skill at creating fascinating characters and memorable settings often outstrips her way with a plot--but in this instance the elements balance beautifully, and the result is a pager-turner from start to finish.

A throw-back to happier times, they are typical, impoverished English peers, through whose fingers money slips like water. They generally don't worry though, since something always comes through and saves them from their latest financial crisis. This time, though, they might be in trouble, if Uncle G., Lord Charles Lamprey's wealthy older brother, decides not to come to their financial rescue. As it happens, he's had enough of pulling the Lamprey fat out of the fire. The Lampreys think they're finished when Uncle G. is murdered in the ghastliest manner, and they gain their inheritance, narrowly averting a financial scandal. The only problem is, did one of them do it? So of course, Inspector Alleyn steps in to get to the bottom of the crime. While I am a general fan of Ngaio Marsh, I think that this is one of her better novels, as she draws a very vivid picture of the large Lamprey family, seen through the eyes of their friend, Roberta Grey. She successfully mixes the aristocracy with witchcraft, facts about New Zealand, and introduces us to a young version of P.C. Lamprey (a minor character that you meet in other novels, chiefly, _Night at the Vulcan_). All in all, an excellent whodunit."},{"Title":"Surfeit of Lampreys","review":"Of the 28 (of 33) Ngaio Marsh books I've read so far, this is my favorite. Surprisingly, editorial critics seem to agree. It concerns the Lampreys, a poor aristocratic family in pre-war England & their friend Robin from New Zealand. As their name (& the cover of this book) implies, they are essentially parasitic but is this just their nature? Chief Inspector Alleyn describes them as: p. 386: \\"Charming. Irresponsible. Unscrupulous about money. Good-natured. Lazy. Amusing. Enormously popular\\" & p. 241: \\"certifiable grotesque.\\" They remind me of both PBS Britcoms (perhaps a parody) & Jane Eyre (mentioned on p. 14).Besides Alleyn's usual police crew, there's recurring newspaperman Nigel Bathgate. Though his part is less important here than in some of Marsh's other novels, I always find him amusing. While the mystery is clever & difficult to figure out, the writing is awesome--Marsh is a literary mystery writer. This book has two of her very best scenes: starting on p. 227: Alleyn's fantastic interview of 10 year old Mike (who joins the force in a later novel) & on pp. 429-30: Alleyn's discussion of MacBeth w/a Police Constable. Not only are these awesome, but they are both key to solving the mystery. Indeed, the book is MacBeth-like.Marsh also has other pithy descriptions such as: p. 259: \\"She's pretty grim even when at her jolliest\\" & provides very discerning & wise observations: p. 177: Robin from New Zealand of the Lampreys--\\"I don't know what they are like...I have no knowledge of their reality. I have fitted their words & actions into my own idea of them but my idea may be quite wrong...she began to wonder confusedly if anybody had a complete secret reality or if each layer of thought merely represented the level of someone else's idea of the thinker, p. 387: Alleyn to Bathgate--\\"It's only fun being friends with a policeman when you're not also friends with his suspects,\\" & Henry Lamprey to Robin (Roberta)--p. 414: \\"Fashion addles any true conception of beauty. There's something inherently vulgar in fashion.\\" Almost archetypal. A brilliant book."},{"Title":"Surfeit of Lampreys","review":"In the Golden Age of British mystery writing, the Big Three were Dorothy Sayers, Agatha Christie, and Ngaio Marsh. I've always enjoyed Sayers, though I've always found Christie nearly unreadable. But it baffles me that readers today who (like my wife) own all the works of the first two in paperback reprints and reread them regularly often haven't even heard of Marsh, nor of her protagonist, DCI Roderick \\"Handsome\\" Alleyn. And yet, where Lord Peter Wimsey and Miss Marple exist in a sort of cozy fantasy-land, the crimes in Marsh's novels take place in a setting that closely approximates the real world. Alleyn is a real copper who calls in fingerprint and photography experts. The murders he deals with often are horrific in their methods and the victims bleed real blood. And the crimes are solved by intensive investigation and by repeatedly interviewing people, not by depending on spontaneous epiphanies of \\"the little gray cells.\\"This one comes about one-third of the way through Marsh's thirty-two novels (all of which feature Alleyn), and I think it's one of her best. The focus is the Lamprey family, consisting of Lord Charles (younger brother and heir of a marquis), his wife, Imogen, and their six children -- and all of them are notable for being absolutely charming when it comes to people and absolutely feckless when it comes to money. They live well because they don't know any other way, though they're frequently teetering on the edge of financial disaster. And yet, somehow, they have lots of friends and admirers. The story opens about 1936 in New Zealand (Marsh was a native-born New Zealander) and introduces not only the Lampreys but Roberta Grey, a very middle-class school chum of Frid (or Frieda) Lamprey, who is caught up inextricably in the family's glamour. Four years later, the family has returned to London and the suddenly orphaned Roberta comes to stay with them for awhile before going off to live with an aunt in Kent. Her arrival coincides with a visit to Lord Charles by his brother, Gabriel, whom Charles (on the brink of bankruptcy, naturally) intends to beg for money. Gabriel is thoroughly unsympathetic, and on the way back down from their top-floor double flat, he's murdered in the lift in a particularly gruesome way. When Alleyn and his crew arrive, the case becomes one of floor plans, time-keeping, and the working out of the movements of the Lampreys, Gabriel and his dotty wife, and the servants of both parties. And all the clues are there if you pay close attention.But the real pleasures of this book are the extended psychological portraits the author paints of each member of the family -- the somewhat vague Lord Charles; his devotedly maternal wife; his eldest son, Henry, whom the twenty-year-old Roberta is developing serious feelings for; the histrionic Frid, who is studying acting; the teenage twins, Stephen and Colin, who have their own ways of dealing with the world; the chubbily adolescent Patricia, who only wants to know what's happening; and young Michael, whom Alleyn discovers is the best witness of all. Roberta is cast in the role of observer, a pair of outside eyes through whom we may study the dynamics of the family. And then there's Alleyn himself and his close relationship with his prot&eacute;g&eacute;, DI Fox, and with journalist Nigel Bathgate, who has become his \\"Watson.\\" If you want to discover a superior alternative to re-reading Agatha Christie yet again, I strongly recommend Ngaio Marsh.One thing, though: When this novel appeared in the U.S., the title was changed to _Death of a Peer._ Did the publishers think we Yanks were too ignorant to appreciate the historical reference in the original title?

Occasionally the author has a turn of phrase or makes a comment that causes you to sit up suddenly and take notice. Ngaio Marsh is sorely underrated.Now, the formatting. Somewhere roundabout Chapter 2 or thereabouts, the paragraph formatting changed to centered text. This is inexcusable. The novels are available elsewhere as a collection at a much cheaper price per book than Amazon is charging. There would appear to be a substantial profit margin, yet there is not the quality control to check that the text is formatted properly.

Minutes later, while sitting in the lift and waiting for his wife, he receives a dreadfully mortal wound... a meat skewer through the eye and into his brain!It's up to Chief Detective-Inspector Alleyn and Detective-Inspector Fox to glean out the facts of the slaying but the Lampreys are a tightly-knit lot and they fear that one of their own may have been responsible for Uncle G's untimely death. Newspaper reporter Nigel Bathgate, coincidentally a pal to both Alleyn and the Lampreys, is called in by the latter to help in rescuing them from a possible murder charge.While this work appears to have all the elements of a great cozy murder mystery, it somehow doesn't click to draw the reader in to the story such as avid mystery fans have experienced withThe Mysterious Affair at Stylesor withThe Yellow Room. In fact, Marsh herself has written a number of far superior mysteries to this one,Death at the BarandFalse Scentserving as clear examples of such splendid works.Specifically with the Lampreys, we gain almost too many suspects right off simply due to the large size of the family -- and that's in addition to numerous servants, Uncle G's wife, Roberta, and even a noxious bill collector! This bulwark of a murder tale seems a bit clogged with these suspects and I felt that Marsh just threw in Nigel Bathgate's character, (of A Man Lay Dead fame.) He really doesn't seem to fulfill any worthwhile function in this tale. We also lose touch off-and-on with Roberta throughout the story. She gets pulled in to a love yarn sub-plot which seemed like an afterthought to me.Don't get me wrong -- this is a nice little murder mystery but so much of the information and so many of the suspects seem retrospectively superfluous. So, in summary, I say read the book but be aware that the late Ngaio Marsh (1895-1982) has offered us more than a few better titles than this one."},{"Title":"Surfeit of Lampreys","review":"This book generally is considered Marsh's best mystery, but I dissent. It is more a comedy of manners with an incidental murder. Those who value the puzzle plot most should look elsewhere. BTW, the English title is Surfeit of Lampreys, a much better title than the dreary Death of a Peer. And I agree...a little lamprey goes a looooong way."},{"Title":"Surfeit of Lampreys","review":"It says something about Amazon - I'm not sure what - that I was asked to review this book.

Born in Prague, he lived and worked in Austria (till 1930), from then on -due to the political circumstances- in Germany (1930-1933), french Switzerland (1933-1940) and the USA (1940-1973).His main work is the famous \\"Pure Theory of Law\\" (1934), a formalistic and structural scheme for interpret modern legal systems.Throughout his long and prolific life, across the three different legal traditions (german, french and anglosaxon) in wich he lived, taught and wrote, he published a large number of articles and books.The General Theory of Law and State (GTLS) marks a special phase in his carreer, because it symbolizes not a mere translation of his Pure Theory, but a true american version of it, because for the first time he confronts with the english and american legal tradition.For those who knows the german version of his Pure Theory, will found the GTLS es a wider and clearer explanation of its main thesis."},{"Title":"General Theory of Law and State (Leather Bound)","review":"From the father of Positivism, this book explores the true nature of the norm and the role it plays in relation to state and society.

Altough, it is one of the most important law books written in the 20th Century, one must prior have read &quot;The Pure Theory of law&quot; in order to come about to a thorough understanding of this manificent pice of art. It has been heavilly criticized by those who follow &quot;The Naturist Theory&quot; and mostly by dogmatic waves, including the Catholic Church, for it proves that relativism refers to Democracy and Republic, and dogmaticism referes to Dictatorship."},{"Title":"CliffsNotes on Buck's The Good Earth","review":"In my mind, the purpose of these notes are to help you remember details from the book.

It's a tough call because his short story collections are so damned good. Sheckley is known as the master of the lean and mean, the witty and the funny. He is one of the great wits of our age and his genius is most obvious in his very accessible and modest-looking stories. But the stories in this collection are like Borges puzzles or Calvino novels, posing simple but important problems and turning the plots in on themselves as only Sheckley can do.It's interesting to think about comparing the styles of Sheckley and Bradbury, both genius short story writers. Both are extremely bold storytellers and both have a lyrical conciseness. Both are funny and twisted and both are touching. But Sheckley is like a smirking master poker player while Bradbury deals you an amazing hand of hearts. Sheckley is to acid as Bradbury is to ecstacy.Sheckley's stories are simply as good as any stories in fantasy and science fiction. His characters are usually at the end of their rope and find extraordinary solutions to extraordinary problems. Sheckley is the original thinking-out-of-the-box guy. He's alternately nuts, a genius jokewriter, a philosophical scholar and a hard-hitting action writer. I'm tellin' ya, you've gotta read his stories and IS THAT WHAT PEOPLE DO?, along with CITIZEN IN SPACE and UNTOUCHED BY HUMAN HANDS, are the collections to start with."},{"Title":"The Quotable Farmer (Quotable Series)","review":"This book is a series of quotes with companion images of farmers, some posed and others while working. The quotes are generally from famous people and while they can all be applied to farming, many can be applied to several aspects of the human condition. Therefore, the title is a misnomer, these are not quotes from farmers, they are messages about farming and farmers.Despite the growing industrialization of all aspects of our society, including farming, there is still something very attractive about tilling the soil. Thoughts of preparing the land, planting the seeds, watching the plants develop and then harvesting the crops all are part of every national consciousness. This is a nice book to give as a gift to farmers of all types, from the old to the current to the merely wistful."},{"Title":"Narcissism: A New Theory","review":"For me, the most valuable aspect of the book was its clinical wisdom. I don't consider a collection of ideas a &quot;new theory,&quot; however, nor do I see why the &quot;lifegiver&quot;-disrupted relationship concept at the root of the author's vision of narcissism says anything more innovative than &quot;the child has chosen unconsciously to turn away from his or her inner aliveness.&quot; Some good critiques of traditional theories of narcissism."},{"Title":"Narcissism: A New Theory","review":"Symington presents a fresh approach to the suject of Narcissism.

I highly recommend this work-- easy to read and clincially profound with refreshing ideas!!! Michael Miller, MSSA, LCSW"},{"Title":"Narcissism: A New Theory","review":"The title \\"Narcissism - a new theory\\" is promising, but Symington doesn't quite succeed in challenging the old theories (which he criticizes harshly). He introduces a new psychic object: the \\"life-giver\\" which is a hypostatized energy-source which, allegedly, the narcissist has turned away from, in early infancy. Accordingly, the narcissist developes a false and shallow attitude towards life. In Symington's view narcissism is an habitual attitude which can be reversed. To my mind, it's not much of a theory. It's rather a way of describing the phenomenology of the illness. Symington draws largely upon myths and the novel Anna Karenina by Tolstoy, when analysing the problem. But I am sceptical of this method. Characters from myth and fiction cannot do justice to a psychic etiology because such characters are more of abstractions than true persons. Real case histories are preferable when describing pathological traits. Thus, Symington's book is not convincing, although I cannot argue that he is altogether wrong. Certain of his postulates are noteworthy, for instance, that the psyche is composed of relatively independent parts or complexes."},{"Title":"Stereoscopic Atlas of Macular Diseases: Diagnosis and Treatment (2 Volume Set)","review":"Gass provides the &quot;gold standard&quot; for textbooks regarding macular maladies. I have read many other texts purporting to review macular disease but none do so to the extent Gass does. Each sentence is jam-packed with information and the references are extensive and complete. The text is a must for any serious student of macular disease. One drawbrack is the black &amp; white photos but I recognize the prohibitive costs of printing the text with color prints. I recall reading the beginning part of the chapter on choroidal neovascularization as a resident and marveling at how Gass explained the pathophysiology with simple yet telling diagrams. This book rates a solid 6 stars (on the five star scale!)."},{"Title":"Stereoscopic Atlas of Macular Diseases: Diagnosis and Treatment (2 Volume Set)","review":"Gass book's is a superb book,for students, fellows,and practitioners,This book has the most important of Macular andretina diseases."},{"Title":"Stereoscopic Atlas of Macular Diseases: Diagnosis and Treatment (2 Volume Set)","review":"This book is incredibly cool.

This revised edition, by Rev. Edward H. Peters, retains the same basic structure as the original except, of course, in reference to the decrees promulgated at Vatican II. An appendix, also, containing several Catholic prayers, rites and precepts, has been added to this edition, making this one a step above the others.

It simply isn't that way. All four topics, including whatever else encompasses the book, are only dangerous if done incorrectly. You can definetly expect that when making a substance such as Tetryl, something so small as an extra few degrees of heat, for a matter of minutes, will kill you. Although, he does make the rash generalization of all anarchists, deciding to blow up things, it is strictly for the info, and is up to the reader, to use at one's disgerssion. My advice: Read it for the tactics, and the knowledge of chemistry, don't do the experiments, because you're bound to hurt someone"},{"Title":"The anarchist cookbook","review":"Dear buyers,Even though I am not obliged to partake in any activities suggested in this book, it is a very entertaining read. Many things I have pondered about and have wondered how to complete such tasks. A plethora of these are now clear to me as I have read this book. It is complete with how to grow and make drugs, make surveillance or combat it, and has a section on explosives. Overall, this is a genious book with intentions out of my range of activity. However, I do recommend it to others on behalf of the terms that nothing is actually re-enacted. Good luck! Good reading!"},{"Title":"The anarchist cookbook","review":"Undoubtedly Mr. Powell's book had an important place in history.It should not be banned for discussing the topics it does.Though it may be dangerous, due to its errors, not to any\\"establishment\\" but to readers themselves. However, Freedomof Speech includes the freedom not to speak. Based on Mr.Powell's brief history above, he probably has much greaterlegal recourse than he realizes. (He expects the publisherto explain his rights against them???? Some anarchist!)But action is required to preserve those rights.Mr. Powell should contact a copyright lawyer ASAP."},{"Title":"The anarchist cookbook","review":"I checked this book out at the local library when I was in high school. I checked the other day, and they still have a copy, but it's in the reference section and can't be taken home anymore. People make a big deal over this book, but it's nothing revolutionary. A lot of it is useless, since no sane person would ever try any of the things that it talks about. However, there are a few useful bits of information that can be gleaned from it. Just don't expect too much. The book is good for laughs more than anything else. It's worth reading, if you can find a copy, but it's not worth buying. I'm sure you can find a lot better tips on explosives and things online, if you look. The book is overrated, but it's still fun and interesting to read. Trust me."},{"Title":"The anarchist cookbook","review":"First, I want to tell everyone who is the slightest bit interested in \\"The Anarchist Cookbook\\", - Forget about it. I mean this, sincerely. I have a military background in much of the subject matter within the book. I can honestly tell you, if you were to even remotely try to put any of the recipes together that are in this book, you would immediately be putting both your life and your freedom at risk. You simply can not apply any of the subject matter to any practical use, even in the event you had the lame beliefe there was a need for it. You would have to have an industrial chemist background, vast experience in handling of dangerous chemicals and a firm understanding of industrial safety and thousands or even hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of safety equipment and apparatus in order to use any forumla or instructions in the book. As a kid, I fooled around with home made volatile materials. I had several friends, (we were all geeks), who did the same. Several ended up suffering horrible burns, others actually lost a limb or an eye or digits and one was even killed fooling around with just the stuff that is in the Anarchist Cookbook. In my militaty training and experience, I finally realized how ignorant I was to mess with the stuff. It was as if I had been wandering along the edge of a hundred foot cliff in the dark. It was only pure chance I was not seriously injured or killed. I am also a strong believer in freedom of speech and the press. But, if there was one book that should be banned forever, it is this one. Think about this; even if you decided this book may have something to offer you, for what ever misguided, idiotic excuse you can think of, when you are gone or through with it (sanely realizing it is worthless), it will still be there for some other kid or person to pick up. It could be your kid brother or sister! Kids don't realize the author of this book was a total idiot when he wrote it (read his own words at the beginning of these comments). He got the information from a library! He had no experience what-so-ever in putting any of this dangrous crap together or even testing it. He just put out a bunch of stupid, basic, ideas and because the information is in print, people will actually believe it is right! It is NOT! Believe me. Do not allow this book into your possession - ever!"},{"Title":"The anarchist cookbook","review":"I am a dedicated anarchist. I am also an avid cook. I have often dreamed of a publication that could adequetly satisfy both my culinary and political sensabilities without either infringing on the other.

What with excessive food packaging, genetically modified ingredients and massive multinational, democratically supported super-stores, my life is a constant dilemma: Consume or starve.Imagine then, my almost uncontrollable excitement when I heard about this publication through um....the usual channels. Then imagine, if you will, my mortal dissapointment on buying and reading the damned thing.This is NOT a cookbook. In point of fact, it has absolutely nothing to do with cooking whatsoever.

Back in the 80s when I was a high school student and there was no 'internet' to speak of. Well, a few BBS's the college kids were talking about, long distance phone bills to dial up another city's thing...So, because of the limited availablity of \\"Stuff\\", things like this became very alluring. Go to the bookstore, say \\"Do you have the Anarchist Cookbook, the Satanic Bible, or the Shams Al Maarif by Al Buni...\\" and hear \\"I've never heard of it...\\" or in case of the former a firm \\"We DON'T carry it!\\" and it becomes a mantra of \\"Forbidden knowledge that the man does want to keep away from you...\\"Then, actually getting things like that it becomes rather overhyped. When I read this with some friends, well fortunately I'd learned enough real science and tech to be a bit worried and skeptical about the 'instructions'... Ah, and Geraldo made the second look so cool, but it wasn't that good. And, for the third, as soon as I both get it and figure out enough Arabic to read it... Well, perhaps third's a charm...Flash forward to adulthood. I'm still a radical who only does the most minimal 'pretense' of normalcy to survive, but would love to tear down/would love when it falls down/ civilization, or at least somehow send it on a more liberal/progressive path.Here's how; Study big time the 60s, including talking to some 'old dudes'... Communes, political movements, do's and dont's, what works and doesn't. Tangent with modern \\"Anti Capitalist\\" stuff. I like Crimethinc a lot, no I'm not a member or whatever. And form a doable, local progressive plan.We are having a recession starting now, that could turn into a Depression lightning fast. Learning a lot of skills people took for granted would be a big help. Along the way, with 'global economics' shafting Americans big time at last, lots of the stuff they mocked as 'anti fair trade' will come back into appeal. Like \\"Local farms should feed local people\\", unions, trade barriers, the corporation is evil and the rich are rich because they take from the people...What you start up, be it a commune on the outskirts of town, a small business somewhere, a community project or a 'living collective' in some abandoned industrial building (likely got cheaply due to outsourcing) that will be the 'change' you broadcast into society. Save the \\"Blow stuff up\\" stuff for only if it becomes necessary, (like a paranoid 'crackdown' by globalists) then don't use this book, you'll have volunteers who know what they are doing.One thing I've learned, is that despite the propaganda lies of being spitters, real hippies actually took disgruntled vets in. They fed 'em, helped them stand up again, and believe it or not didn't preach to 'em. First, it's a nice thing to do for your fellow man. Second, disgruntled vets make the best \\"Yippies\\" should \\"The wind be blowin-\\" if you catch my drift so to speak."},{"Title":"The anarchist cookbook","review":"This book was a complete waste of time and money.

A basic chem class taught me that. I don't even want to think about what a real chemist would think.

Just dont do anything in the book titled Anarchist's Cookbook. It's WRONG. There are better chemicaly sound ways to do everything described in the book, not that you should.

There was a very brief segment on legal \\"drugs\\" or narcotics and how, where, quantity, etc. Other than that, there was very, very little substance to this popular book. I don't know what I was expecting but something a little more subversive and anti-establishment, whatever that may be. I imagine that since the advent of the world wide web, the contents of the book can be found much easier online and this book will soon, if not already, be outdated and blaise.

But let's get serious. As a pacifist myself myself I am strongly opposed to the idea that violence be in any way a legitimate means to any ends whatever, political or otherwise.

At first I wouldn't rate the book at all, but then gave it five stars to raise its average."},{"Title":"The anarchist cookbook","review":"First, I want to tell everyone who is the slightest bit interested in \\"The Anarchist Cookbook\\", - Forget about it. I mean this, sincerely. I have a military background in much of the subject matter within the book. I can honestly tell you, if you were to even remotely try to put any of the recipes together that are in this book, you would immediately be putting both your life and your freedom at risk. You simply can not apply any of the subject matter to any practical use, even in the event you had the lame beliefe there was a need for it. You would have to have an industrial chemist background, vast experience in handling of dangerous chemicals and a firm understanding of industrial safety and thousands or even hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of safety equipment and apparatus in order to use any forumla or instructions in the book. As a kid, I fooled around with home made volatile materials. I had several friends, (we were all geeks), who did the same. Several ended up suffering horrible burns, others actually lost a limb or an eye or digits and one was even killed fooling around with just the stuff that is in the Anarchist Cookbook. In my militaty training and experience, I finally realized how ignorant I was to mess with the stuff. It was as if I had been wandering along the edge of a hundred foot cliff in the dark. It was only pure chance I was not seriously injured or killed. I am also a strong believer in freedom of speech and the press. But, if there was one book that should be banned forever, it is this one. Think about this; even if you decided this book may have something to offer you, for what ever misguided, idiotic excuse you can think of, when you are gone or through with it (sanely realizing it is worthless), it will still be there for some other kid or person to pick up. It could be your kid brother or sister! Kids don't realize the author of this book was a total idiot when he wrote it (read his own words at the beginning of these comments). He got the information from a library! He had no experience what-so-ever in putting any of this dangrous crap together or even testing it. He just put out a bunch of stupid, basic, ideas and because the information is in print, people will actually believe it is right! It is NOT! Believe me. Do not allow this book into your possession - ever!"},{"Title":"The anarchist cookbook","review":"I used to own a copy of this book back in the 70s and I remembered it as being some dark, secret handbook of recipes and anarchy.Somewhere over the years I lost my copy and had totally forgotten about it.But at a recent gun show I saw copies for sale and being at the age where I am starting to get nostalgic for what I consider a \\"better time\\" (meaning the 70s and 80s), I picked up a copy to recapture some lost youth I suppose.Oh my... how 30 years can change ones perception.This book is interesting to read for its historical snapshot of late 60's drug induced hippy era idealism and anti-establishment rebellion, but otherwise THIS IS PRETTY DARNED FUNNY !!!!As a degreed Chemist myself, I will say that maybe 30% of the formulas will actually work IF (and I stress IF) you don't kill yourself first because of the inherent dangers and lack of safety instructions. The other 70% of the formulas are pretty much rubbish.As for the drawings and schematics for booby trap devices they are less detailed and about as useful as the pictures you see Wiley Coyote reading on a Road Runner cartoon.Finally the forward by Peter Bergmann is so off the mark and now proven wrong by history that it dates the book horribly -- but as I said earlier also makes it a fun \\"snapshot of late 60s- early 70s\\" mentality among the youth culture.It's a cute little relic and piece of \\"dark literature\\" from a simpler more innocent time in America --- but for those of you truly seeking to form your own world order, overthrow the government and let Anarchy run wild, you may want to look elsewhere for your motivation and education.SMILEI think it is VERY important to note that the original author of the Anarchist Cookbook has reportedly discredited this book publically and expressed his wishes that the book no longer be printed.His reasons being that he wrote it when he was only a teenager and was expressing outrage and anger at the Vietnam War in the best way he knew how at that young age with so much pain and violence around him.As with all of us who think we knew everything when we were 17 or 18 years old ------- WISDOM COMES WITH AGE AND EXPERIENCE.

(Take note: It's the parents' job to keep stuff like this away from children.) The book is interesting, but that's about it. If you plan on making chemical items from this book, don't. If you know enough to make these items you won't need this book. If you aren't skilled enough in chemistry you shouldn't try anything in this book. And, on a final thought, the author of this book doesn't even want it in circulation anymore and disagrees with what he published when he was 19.

It is literally a \\"cookbook\\", full of recipes to construct various weapons, booby traps, drug grows, etc. Some of the info is a bit out dated (the book was written about 40 years ago) but still entertaining to read. 99% of the recipe's should NEVER be tried at home. You could get hurt BAD. My favorite section is the one on hand to hand combat and non lethal weapons. The contents of that particular section could still be utilized today. Overall, it was okay.

How to make drugs, how to take drugs, how to make bombs, etc. I have no idea if the information was accurate, but simply attempting anything in this book would probably not have a good result.

I suppose that is a good thing though, we can't have too many people running around knowing how to make bombs. Especially with so many in a poor mental state. They're likely to vent their pent up frustration at the world in a very unpleasant way. So perhaps the book's vagueness was at least a bit intentional. Actually, I'm not some so-called 'anarchist'. It's merely a topic of interest. I would never make a bomb or do anything suggested in the book. I, in fact, envision higher standards of education for everyone around the globe. I think most of the people who buy this book are narrow-minded teenagers who want to either get back at the world or try to show it off at school. I ended up giving my copy to a friend of mine in AFJROTC. He was going to use it for a report on crime in the U.S.A.

I don't think Mr. Powell need worry about people throwing Malotov cocktails because of this publication, because they'll too busy laughing at this unintentional lampoon of dogmatic fanaticism.

I'm sure he hears lots of comments about the Anarchist's CookBook, but not even the fact that such controversial ideas are presented, but the fact in which that in this day and age (even if it was thirty years ago) he had enough guts (balls, whatever) to try to get something other than the norm published.There is a bit of misrepresentation, though, as this book has nothing to do with Anarchy. Anarchy is the belief that there should be no structured government. Despite this, the Anarchist's CookBook has definitely got a following of people wholoudly proclaim themselves as ANARCHISTS, specializing in all things that go boom. The Anarchist's CookBook provides detailed instructions regarding plastic explosives, credit card fraud, hotwiring cars, and many other...er...potential felonies.For those of you who have read or encountered Abbie Hoffman's STEAL THIS BOOK, I found the general feel to the Anarchist's Cookbook to mirror that of Hoffman's work.

I love fire, playing with electricity, and computer hacking (legal, of course :)). But I also would never hurt a fly (really).

Probably the majority of North Americans have heard of it, and know what it is and what it's for. Therefore, it's a celebrity in our culture. I purchased it because I wanted to know what all the hype was surrounding this &quot;devil's manual&quot;(as I have heard it called). I didn;t want to make any bombs or such (though the drugs interested me ;), so the book was fairly useless to me and I knew that before I desided to buy it. This book's celebrity is much undeserved as the recipes for making many of things in it are either too complicated for anyone who doesn't have a degree in chemistry to understand, or are simply not detailed enough to make [me] want to try them. Anyway, I still think that - if you are interested in such things - you should get it simply to have it as a part of your collection. It's famous, why not eh."},{"Title":"The anarchist cookbook","review":"Having grown up with a penchant for blowing things up (e.g. old model planes and cars, coffee cans, nasty neighbors' mailboxes, etc.) I looked forward to buying this book when it came back into print a number of years ago.

I found the introduction very interesting, as well as Powell's running commentary of government and society throughout the book. Although I don't agree with Powell's views, I believe in his right to express his views, as well as present this type of information. At the rate we're going, in 50 years your government may decide to outlaw this book, along with Catch-22, Brave New World, and Animal Farm."},{"Title":"The anarchist cookbook","review":"It is unfortunate that we loose our sense of outrage and angst as we grow into adulthood. Such is the case of William Powell. The Anarchist's Cookbook is a masterpiece and a perfect example of what the freedoms of the Constitution gives us to speak what we wish. Sure the Anarchist's Cookbook is full of information that can lead to destruction and mayhem, but so can many other works of written information and frankly, if you surpress this book then you must surpress every single piece of information because our founding fathers did not fight and die for these freedoms so that one or two individuals can come and wipe it all away.

I am proud to call myself an American and believe that all information shouuld not be censored!"},{"Title":"The anarchist cookbook","review":"The author has provided the context in which he wrote this book. As an adolescent boy in the 1970s, I found it an interesting read. Since I had the good sense to not attempt any of the hare-brained schemes in the book, I am still healthy and have all of my limbs. If people are interested in improvised munitions and the like, there are at least six (6) US Army FMs and TMs on the subject that I am aware of. Bear in mind that the making of explosive devices is a serious felony, and should not be attempted without the proper Federal and State licenses and permits.

I am very disappointed in the misleading sales tactic."},{"Title":"The anarchist cookbook","review":"My first exposure to this counter-culture classic was in the most unexpected of settings, my college ROTC classroom. The book written in protest of the Viet-Nam War was being used by a Green Beret veterain of that same war to train us who might be leading troops in, yes, that same war. The irony speaks for itself. I understand that William Powell no longer agrees with what he wrote as a young man, and symphathise with the plight of an artist who has lost control of his work. However, I am glad (and somewhat suprised) that this is still available. Not only is it an important sociological piece of the period, but it is filled with information that could be useful if (god forbid) things ever hit the fan. That same ROTC instructor told me time and again, &quot;Better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it,&quot; so this book gets a space on my shelf just in case. It's the best book I hope you'll never need."},{"Title":"The anarchist cookbook","review":"First published in the turbulent '60's, this book has attained a sort of cult status for that time. It reflects many of the mores and problems of that generation of young people, and is worth it for a read for that, if for no other reason.So far as bomb-making and all of that, the book is technically good, but the methodology involving use of nitrogen compounds, particularly red, fuming nitric acid and cotton, to make guncotton, is fundamentally ununsound and unsafe. You could blow a hand off or worse very easily, following Powell's directions. I think &quot;The Monkeywrench Gang&quot; and others of its genre are more in tune with today's eco-warrior desires. Also, the book never mentions the superiority of Oxydol and its green beads, as a binding agent for homemade napalm. For shame.Even with these quibbles, the book is entertaining, and offers a clear glimpse into the mentality of a now-settled generation."},{"Title":"The anarchist cookbook","review":"I was in the military for quite some time working with explosives of all kinds....let me tell the prospective buyer of this book this....The recipes contained in this book are dangerous and can often be lethal.

Some of the instructions are not descriptive enough and leave some questions unanswered. This book is excellent reading for entertainment purposes. And maybe if you have an extremely eventful and adventurous life you might use one thing that you learned. I do not suggest that you try any of the instructions in this book.

Nonetheless, this is a book I recommend all to study."},{"Title":"The anarchist cookbook","review":"I spent 26 years in the military, mostly Rangers and Special Forces. I attended a sabotage course taught by the \\"other governmantal agency\\" and taught a sabotage class myself for members of a classified Special Forces detachment in Europe. I can assure you all that there's a reason why the military refers to \\"improvised\\" explosives and incendiaries. Many, if not most, are obscenely unstable even if the best formulas and proceedures are followed. My SF demolitions sergeants thought the \\"AC\\" recipes were weirdly, consistently,dangerously, wrong. We never, never did things the \\"AC\\" way. Suspiciously, I find no mention of ammonium nitrate fertilizer mixed with diesel fuel. Both ingredients are highly stable, even when properly combined, yet together constitute a highly effective explosive. Both are bought by the ton in thousands of commercial agriculture operations across the world and often stored with minimal security or accountability. That was well known even back then, but there's no mention of it. Just all this unnecessarily dangerous stuff. What's all that about, if not a provocation?The weapons stuff was weird too. For instance, \\"AC\\" kept talking about pairs of weapons that were \\"great teams together.\\" To me that suggests one of two things. Maybe weapons whose capabilities complemented each other. Say, a sniper rifle and a shotgun for close-in team protection. Or a pair of weapons that shared ammunition and possibly accessories, or even allowed cross-canibalization of parts. These suggested \\"great teams together\\" seem to have been paired to negate any such synergistic benefits.I can't address the drug formulation. I can say that I thought the \\"theory\\" stuff was lame and low-brow. \\"The Wretched of the Earth\\" this ain't. And from a practice and tactics standpoint it isn't even a \\"Mini-mmanual for the Urban Geurilla\\".So what's up with all this? I can't help but suspect that it was written and published to flush out wannabe terrorits and get them to do stupid, dangerous things, operate in ineffective ways, and generally self-destruct beforethey could actually develop into efective terrorits in effective organizations. Who knows? Maybe we can hear from the author. For sure the dreaded Weathermen did not cause as many casualties total as they inflicted upon themselves in one botched bomb-making operation. Wonder whose recipes they were using..."},{"Title":"The anarchist cookbook","review":"I found the book funny and hilarious but former members of the military do not.

Gordon Liddy's insane forays into a psychiatrist's office and the abortive Watergate break-in by 3\`rd rate Cuban CIA operatives led to the Weather underground and the feeling that the next US revolution would have to happen if Nixon were to attempt a third term. The book is a reaction to much social unrest and the rejection of popular mandate by the legislative, executive and judicial branches.Never the less, this is not a book for children or parties given to violence. It is a social commentary with fireworks."},{"Title":"The anarchist cookbook","review":"This book is a good choice for someone from the country that wants to blow off their own hand. As a combat engineer I say your best bet is to go with TM's and government issued manuals on explosives.

I have seen a lot of reviews about how the explosive recipes are dangerous and unstable. True, a lot of them are. But keep this in mind: USE COMMON SENSE. All the recipes are workable and effective, but before you dwell into actually making them for any reason whatsoever, DO RESEARCH. If you seriously consider using these recipes, buy some other books that are written by the US Army and Department of Defense, read through them. Or ask for an expert opinions. In fact, there a lot of dissatisfied vets who would be more than happy to show you what is wrong, what is right, or what is downright retarded. This goes for the Explosive section.The Drug section, especially for growing Marijuana and making hash, is also workable as well, and could end up making a few bucks in your pocket. But then again, USE COMMON SENSE, and DO RESEARCH.This book is written for amateurs, by amateurs, so please USE COMMON SENSE, and DO RESEARCH before undertaking any of these activities. Nothing here is impossible, so don't let other people sway you away from means to protect yourselves and your freedom. Remember, the Weathermen, the Minutemen, and the IRA, are also amateurs. They can do it, so can we."},{"Title":"The anarchist cookbook","review":"Nice book although the author forgets a few details. I have many friends that love this book and i have many who hate it.

But a word of caution to those who want to try the bomb or drug recipies... They are grossly innacurate. Although I do not have a personal knowledge or experience with very many drugs, I believe my work as an explosives specialist with the US marines makes me a qualified expert on the subj. Here's the deal, the bomb recipies have 90% truth, and 10% error. either the author gives you the whole procedure for making the explosive, but leaves out a key ingredient, or gives all the ingredients, and leaves out a vital portion of the preperation process...causing you to blow yourself up. However as a redeeming value, the cookbook does have very valuable concepts for booby traps, surveilence, etc. Personally, I have it in my library. bottom line: The Anarchist cookbook is NOT a technical manual, but for entertainment and some learning, It's definatly worth the money."},{"Title":"The anarchist cookbook","review":"When I was 16, back in the 1980's, my friend and I bought copies of this book to try and see what kind of explosives we could make. These recipes are dangerous, ineffective, and could potentially burn your house down. Smoking banana peels is not a good idea. Gunpowder is dangerous to home manufacture in any quantity. The recipes only partly work, the booby traps are a farce, and the whole book only makes sense to an immature mind that can picture fighting a guerilla insurgency against invading Soviet scum (moi, circa 1984). Fact of the matter is, children have access to far more dangerous ideas and images on the web than they do out of this book which if serialized and published as a blog, would have gotten the author some mild notoriety but nothing more so than young people airing ridiculous ideas and their body parts on line. As an adult with a child of my own, I can understand the why behind the book, the historical context around it, and the desire by many reviewers, including myself and the author, to just bury the book, but I don't think it needs any more attention than pictures of Barbara Streisand's house, Obama-girl, Britney-Lindsey-Paris, and leaked financial documents from a Swiss bank.

What it actually is is just worthless ramblings and concoctions on how to make a fool of yourself and maybe get seriously hurt. Basically it says play around with gasoline, light a match and see how badly you can get burned. To try any of the recipes is like jumping off a bridge and then wondering why your legs are broken.

My first read revealed a text writtten by a rank amateur and likely to harm anyone who took it seriously enough to try any of the questionable procedures therein. I donated my copy to a university library with a collection of political extremist literature.I wondered at the time (consider the historical context) whether it might have been penned by some inept Cointepro operative for the purpose of torpedoing violent anti-war protests. Years down the road we find the truth more prosaic.My heart goes out to any who might have been harmed, and to the author. The publishers more than he apparently bear the moral burden as much as if not more than the writer. Had it not been he, it would have been someone else. I recall seeing similar material in many underground newspapers of the day.Even then there were the manuals published by the US government for military training far more accurate and deadly. These too survive and are widely pirated. The authors of these tomes remain anonymous, and these works are without copyright since they were created for hire by the government. Caveat emptor."},{"Title":"The anarchist cookbook","review":"I bought this book when I was about 13 years old (a little scary now, to think that the book store would sell this to some one so young). The book is an interesting read, and that's about it. The author didn't even beleive in what he was writing about, just read his review. Most of everything he talks about is idiotic at best, he makes a few good points, but doesn't even go into the real gritty world of guerrilla warfare. I was and still am dissappointed. When he talks about suppressors, he just insults the hollywood image of them and the people who think that they can be that small, he apparently doesn't know that they have it right. All the suppressor does is suppress the muzzle flash and cut down on the sound from the explosive charge that sends the bullet flying, its the sub-sonic munition that allows for no sonic boom. If he had done just a little more effort in his research, and maybe actually talked with someone who knew what they where talking about, the book would live up to its name."},{"Title":"The anarchist cookbook","review":"This book is accurate as a blind folded archer spun 3 times in a game of pinata. There is no real useful info in this book, you'd get more tactics out of a Steven Seagal film. This book should be taken out of print before some dummy hurts themselves.

I already knew my hysterectomy and ovaries/fallopian tube removal were necessary. In purchasing this book, I was looking for some positive ways to deal with emotions before the operation; additionally, I was looking for what to expect immediately after surgery and ways to reduce post-surgery trauma. I also was looking for concrete ways to help myself recover from this surgery. Unfortunately, what I found in this book was FEAR---yes, this book's contents led me to doubt my physician and myself. I felt the author was very biased against hysterectomy. I would not have purchased this book if I had known the author was basically anti-hysterectomy. I found the book extremely unsettling and do not recommend it to any one."},{"Title":"HYSTERECTOMY BEFORE AND AFTER","review":"I am 26 years old and HAD to have a hysterectomy to basically save my life. A lot in the book scared me, I felt like I was fated to shrivel up into an old woman, even though I'm still young. The nutritional advice was valuable, as was the section on what to expect from sex after the surgery."},{"Title":"HYSTERECTOMY BEFORE AND AFTER","review":"This book should be the first thing your gynocologist gives you on your fisrt visit! After purchasing a copy 3 days prior to my own hysterectomy, I learned more than I had previously learned in 25 years of reading whatever I could find about my own painful, excessivly heavy flowing menstral cycles.I followed the advice given and both doctors and nurses couldn't get over how quickly I recovered from this major surgery. In the 9 years since, I have recommended this book, lent my own copy (and have had to forcibly retrieve it!!!) to friends and workmates -- all who went out and purchased their own copy after returning mine.Upon showing this book to my surgeon, he said it looked terrific and could he borrow it to read, at which point I reminded him that with his fees he could purchase his own, and hand them out to every patient at their first PAP smear and STILL be ahead financially. He laughed and sent his receptionist out to the book store.Easy to understand and clearly written, this is the book every woman should use to make decisions about her reproductive organs. Pain is not inevitable and neither is hysterectomy.My only complaint is the title, which might discourage someone from getting this book, if hysterectomy is not a choice for them. Other than that --- this is a 5 star winner!"},{"Title":"HYSTERECTOMY BEFORE AND AFTER","review":"I must say that I do agree with &quot;a reader from California's&quot; review in that some of what Dr. Cutler had to say scared me because I bought the book right after my surgery and everything was already taken out. I couldn't go back and change that. As I began reading the book I became anxious about what might happen to me now that I have had this surgery, but as I read, I realized what she was doing with this book. So many women have had hysterectomies in the United States when there might have been better alternatives. Dr. Cutler is trying to make women understand that it is a very serious thing that you do to your body when you have this operation. She addresses HRT therapy and diet, exercise and other areas that can help if a hysterectomy is needed. This is really a very comprehensive and informative book and I intend to keep if as a reference book for the future."},{"Title":"HYSTERECTOMY BEFORE AND AFTER","review":"This is a comprehensive reference work, the result of reviewing 3,000 journal articles and including references to 1,000 articles. There is a clear and understandable explanation of how a woman's body works and why each part of the female reproductive system is indispensable. Cutler includes sections on health risks following hysterectomy and how a woman can work to offset these risks. I find this information to be invaluable in a serious effort to make the best of a bad situation--the loss of uterus and ovaries. The text has a tendency to become very dense and sometimes requires a reread to grasp meaning. Generally, she has succeeded in making technical information on hysterectomy available to the educated layperson, while maintaining the scientific integrity that makes the book equally valuable to physicians and other medical professionals. A bonus is her casual mention, in two or three places, of the importance of spiritual health in managing one's physical health. W! est's excellent book, &quot;Hysterectomy Hoax&quot; is easier to read, but if you want ALL the details, Cutler has done the job beautifully."},{"Title":"HYSTERECTOMY BEFORE AND AFTER","review":"This book contains a wealth of information on hormones, nutrition, excercise, and a womens health and well being following a hysterectomy. Had I started to read this book sooner, I would have presented even more questions to my GYN prior to my surgery.

Rodin called Gibran's drawings &quot;poetry.&quot; I can only agree.

But if you want to see the &quot;Life of Costa Rica&quot; and enjoy the natural and human side of this unique country, you'll like it. Going through this book is like telling a great photographer to get the essence of her country and translate it for you in a way you'll enjoy and will want to see again and again. Saying that Costa Rica is just beaches and parrots is like saying that the U.S. is just hot dogs and football. If you want to see what Costa Rica means to a costarican, things you enjoyed or missed while being here, or the things you'll want to see the next time you come, this book is a great start."},{"Title":"The Life of Costa Rica","review":"Costa Rica is a beautiful and complex country with an outlook that is unique in the Americas. It is hopeful, proud, respectful of its natural beauty - and complex and contradictory. I've traveled to Costa Rica several times and I was completely impressed with how the pictures captured Tico life. I think a more powerful testimony, however, was provided by my friend, a Costa Rican living in America for over a decade: When I showed him the book, it brought him to tears with homesickness.Few books tell better stories or capture more with pictures."},{"Title":"The Life of Costa Rica","review":"Holding claim to some of the most beautiful beaches in the world, I was disappointed that this book did not have more Costa Rican beach shots.

It turns me off."},{"Title":"Majestic middle Tennessee","review":"Although this almost borders on being a vanity publication for homeowners, it does provide a valuable handbook for the truly wonderful architecture of Middle Tennessee which was rich in all senses of the word before the Civil War. Here the houses, mostly resulting from the agricultural successes at the time, are presented in a somewhat guidebook fashion, convenient as there are sometimes pilgrimadges when these homes are open to the public. All the photos are new, taken for the book, and give at least a reference photo of the exterior. Most of the interiors show a confusion of out-of-sync \\"Williamsburg\\" decoration that is not particularly appropriate to the house, however. The cover photo shows the remarkable \\"Rattle & Snap\\" in rural Maury County, one of a group of Polk family plantation homes, that stands among the greatest of any built of that era. As a handbook of great vernacular architecture, it is a valuable guide and recommended for all those interested in the region."},{"Title":"Book of the Basques","review":"I usually don't review books that have already been reviewed, but I think the customer below severely misjudged this book.First of all, the reason why it doesn't go much beyond 1930 is because that's when it was published. British folklorist Rodney Gallop was a pioneer in the field of Basque anthropology and \\"A Book of the Basques\\" was one of the earliest (and remains one of the most readable) attempts to explain Basque culture to the English-speaking world.Gallop inclined heavily toward the French side of the Pyr&eacute;n&eacute;es for two reasons. First, that's where he did most of his research. Second, as he points out in the book, the French Basque Country -- at least up to the time he wrote -- had always been much less heavily industrialized than its Spanish counterpart, making it much more ideal for an anthropologist's study. The ancient traditions of the Basques survived more intact in France and, additionally, the French Basques were more culturally \\"introspective\\" than their Spanish cousins; that is, they never played as prominent a part in the national life of France as did the Spanish Basques in Spain and its empire. Consequently, they remained much closer to their \\"roots\\", so to speak.Unlike the reviewer below, I thought the book was extremely well written and a fantastic source of information on traditional Basque folklife. Gallop does quote a lot from French, but he wrote in a time when you weren't considered educated until you knew a little French. The book is divided into chapters on such aspects of Basque folklife as language and literature, folksongs, folkdance, proverbs, Basque houses, superstition and witchcraft, fishermen and corsairs (!), decoration, and that great game, \\"pelote\\". Additionally, the author discusses some of the many theories regarding the mysterious origins of the Basques, which, admittedly, is of less interest today than it was in 1930 (the Golden Age of bogus racial theories!).Unfortunately, much of the book has to be shifted into the past tense today, since the traditional Basque folkways Gallop describes have grown more and more obsolete since he wrote. But as work of history, it's still a classic and is destined to remain one. A+"},{"Title":"Book of the Basques","review":"Although Mr. Gallop's cultural knowledge of the Basque's (at least the French Basques) was very in depth, The narration is dreary, pompous, and one-sided. The author concentrated on the French Basques while neglecting the Spanish. Another unfortunate point is that it did not offer anything after 1930. I see that progress has been made over seventy years by the Spanish Basques and all they have had to endure. It wasn't until the latter chapters of this book that the reader becomes interested. This subject is very dear to me and after extensive study I would consider other sources to learn about the Basques. Agur."},{"Title":"Autumn Wind Haiku","review":"I enjoy writing Haiku, and reading it even more.

Rawlings wrote this story of subsistence living in the Florida scrub country after living with a moonshiner family for several weeks. The picture of their struggle to eke a living in this marginal land makes for fascinating reading.But the more important aspect of this novel is the revelation of what government laws and power mean in the every day lives of people living only a hair's breath away from starvation. We see how immoral and corrupt laws and those who enforce them destroyed the delicate balance of survival for the people of the scrub. I don't know if she intended it to be, but this is an anti government, libertarian novel and an important contribution to the historical record. Every liberty lover would gain much from reading this book."},{"Title":"South moon under","review":"SOUTH MOON UNDER is a page flipper and hard to set aside.

In the introduction Murray Cantor makes it clear this isn't a 'how to' book about software development -- though he writes well on this here -- but this book is about *leading* a software development process. Again and again Murray reminds us that developing software is a team effort, and that only as an effective team will we succeed.Murray drives this point home forcefully in chapter 3 when he reminds the reader that software projects are non-linear. He observes, correctly, that &quot;Common sense flows from a shared view of how the world works.&quot; On the next page he reinfoces this with his tip that our new common sense approach to development is about leadership. From this point on, Murray illustrates the way in which to apply the team concepts to the process of building software.If the reader is current with the literature as it pertains to development methods, then the technology in the book will not be new. Nevertheless, the lessons pertaining to team building are as profound as they are necessary. Those using the book as an introduction to development methodology will have the treat of learning this from one of the best, and as a bonus receive his sound advice regarding leadership.Murray has written a book that should be on the shelf of any manager, er leader, associated with the development of software products. This is definitely a &quot;two-thumbs-up&quot; book."},{"Title":"Software Leadership: A Guide to Successful Software Development","review":"Successful software projects need to be organized and managed opposite to successful companies, because of the need for creativity. This book points out the differences in crystal clarity, with very specific suggestions on what to do at each stage of moving software projects forward. Of particular interest are shortcomings of the other approaches such as waterfall, hands-off, and rapid prototyping. Details on how to use RUP (Rational Unified Process) with UML examples are provided as well."},{"Title":"Software Leadership: A Guide to Successful Software Development","review":"We all suffer from a case of TDNAH (That Does Not Apply Here), but workers in information technology seem to be the pathological case. Despite years of repeated admonitions that the only way to build successful software projects is to have a specific plan and that extensive overtime is counterproductive, many still do not listen. While most of the dot-com failures were bad ideas, there were many good ideas that were poorly planned and organized. The hours that most of the employees worked were more than what one would expect from a slave, as that seemed to be the only strategy for success that many could come up with.Once you finally admit that you are not an exceptional member of the business section of the human race, it follows that you should look for someone with accumulated wisdom regarding how to successfully manage software projects. Cracking this book open is a good place to start, provided that quality software is truly your goal. While the advice in the book is good, it is of little use for someone more interested in exercising power and fueling their ego. This book is about being a true leader that people would listen to and follow even when choices are available. Management is about motivating people with a feather duster rather than a bullwhip and this book contains a detailed plan for the creation of competent managers who can lead the development of quality software.Perhaps we are finally at the point where the popularity of the Dilbert cartoon will be due more to the humor rather than the accurate way it describes the work environment. Wherever we are in that trend, this is one book that is helping the push in that direction."},{"Title":"Software Leadership: A Guide to Successful Software Development","review":"I bought Murray Cantor's Software Leadership when I was looking for a way to help new team leaders understand how to transition from being coders and experts to being leaders who could deliver business solutions. The book's practical approach and readable size made it an instant hit so we equipped every dev lead in the company with a copy and held a series of seminars to discuss each chapter.I like the way this book breaks down into independent chapters that each teach a separate and highly relevant dimension of the software leadership role. While Cantor does cover some specifics of the software engineering process, the fundamental wisdom conveyed is not process-specific; you can use it in old-school waterfall environments, extreme programming shops or anything in between.Powerful analogies connect the big ideas to everyday leadership actions, with the right emphasis on planning vs. doing and the right balance of time, scope and quality.Cantor is an excellent writer who has packaged a soon-to-be classic book.

And the two men remained friends until Jones' death many years later. This book recounts only a small portion of the plainsman's life, but what is provided relates to us the life of an adventurer, an empire builder, and a conservationalist. Included are stories of the man's trying to rope lions in the Grand Canyon and to his attempt to preserve the last of the buffalo from extinction, after once having slaughtered them to provide meat for the railroad workers. When this book was first published it did not receive very good reviews, but has since been praised for Zane Grey's prose and narrative skills. Furthermore, the people Zane Grey met on this trip with Jones led directly to his creation of such great novels as Heritage of the Desert and Riders of the Purple Sage and set the stage for his entire career. Without this trip and the writing of this book there might not have been a Zane Grey as we know him today. It all began here."},{"Title":"The Last of the Plainsmen","review":"Zane Grey pulled out all the stops on this tale of chasing wild mustangs, buffalo hunts, cougar hunts, and wild musk-ox. Follow the tale of a rag-tag band of plainsmen led by Col. Jones. A feisty, tough old man who will stop at nothing so he can rope (yes I said rope) a wild cougar and bring it back home. They are a breed of men whose resilience and spirit are the stuff of pioneers and mountain men. The kind of indomitable spirit that won the west, and is the subject of much of America's folklore. Along the way they endure seventy degree below zero blizzards, desert dust storms, starving Indians, and a harsh, yet pristine wilderness of incredible beauty. Zane Grey s depiction of panoramic landscapes such as the Grand Canyon is picturesque. One can almost smell the forest's and sense the loneliness of the wilderness. A great read that was hard to put down. Now for my next task which won't be easy. Picking out the next Zane Grey novel to get lost in."},{"Title":"The Last of the Plainsmen","review":"This book is an outstanding true account of a trip made by Zane Grey and a plainsman, Buffalo Jones - one of the last. Jones was a famous sportsmen in North America at the turn of the 20th century and Grey a famous author of adventure stories. Unlike many of Grey's fictional novels of the old west, this is an account of a trip made to the North Rim of the Grand Canyon about 1908, for the purpose of tracking and capturing mountain lions. In those days, the North Rim was famous for the number and size of cougars - one mentioned in the book was 10' long, tip of tail to nape of neck, and weighed 300 pounds. The story is riveting with many details of the Arizona high desert and Grand Canyon areas of that era and gives a wonderful account of the Ponderosa Pine forest now known as the Kaibab National Forest. The details given about the behavior of the mountain lion are well worth finding a copy of this classic work. Grey includes a chapter (XV) entitled &quot;Jones on Cougars&quot;, in which he relates the wisdom of this plainsman on the species - gained through a long life in the wilderness including a sojourn as a game warden in the Yellowstone National Park, where he captured numerous cougars alive and killed seventy-two. Although modern views of the mountain lion seem to consider this animal more like an oversized, undomesticated sort of house cat, after reading this book you will definitely treat them with appropriate dignity and caution."},{"Title":"The Last of the Plainsmen","review":"I was looking for some good westerns and thought this would be a good choice since Zane Grey is a well known and renounded author of westerns.

He hops the fences of both enclosures in this poorly designed zoo and lives life as a seal. The customers and staff at the zoo aren't the brightest and don't notice any difference between him or the other animals let alone return him to his own enclosure so he's all set being a seal. Only he overhears a member of the public say that his favourite animal is a lion so Edward decides to hop the fence again. Hanging out with the lions (who don't eat him for some reason) someone else mentions snakes are their favourite so he decides to become a snake. Is it really a desire to be different Edward is after or is it something else. Read this book and find out!The illustrations are very well done with minute attention to detail resulting in very realistic colour sketches.

I was instantaneously blown away, to such an extent that I called Houghton Mifflin myself and asked them what we could do to have the book--originally published by them in 1973--reprinted (only to ultimately learn that Brock-Broido had beaten me to it!) And when you browse through any number of contemporary journals of American poetry today, it isn't difficult to understand why: James's language, like that of poets such as David St. John or Michael Ryan, bursts with a relentless delivery of unanticipated movements, darker detours that never once risk the morbid or maudlin, and a depth of sincerity that many lesser American poets are either afraid or unable to achieve. It is so depressingly hard to find this sort of aesthetic in contemporary American verse--poetry that results from a genuine and fearless interest in the truth rather than the tame, academic and conversational bore one more frequently encounters--I think Steve Kowit called it a \\"debilitating preference for the tepid, mannered and Opaque.\\" Precisely--the three temptations of contemporary American poetry that not a single poem in James's book indulges.

After all, the killer could be one of Lorrimer's colleagues, and that person would know how to destroy evidence and mislead investigators.Death of an Expert Witness contains all of P.D. James's usual trademarks, including haughty professionals who barely have time for Dalgleish's questions and an isolated institution filled with secrets. For those who've followed my reviews of James's work this year, you'll know her novels have been hit or miss with me, partly for their sameness and lack of interesting subplots or character development. This book, however, was one of the better ones because James did a good job of delving into characters's personal lives and foibles.There still wasn't much in the way of subplots, and I don't think Dalgleish changed at all. As usual, the story kept me guessing about the killer's identity, but it all made perfect sense in the end. This book shows why James has gained so many fans.

James (1920-) is one of the older books in the Detective Adam Dalgliesh detective tales of murder and mayhem in Great Britain. As with all of James' excellent novels this one is elegantly written evocative of both the East Anglia area and also presenting well drawn three dimensional characters. A worthy read for a rainy night!The Plot: Dr. Edwin Lorrimer is the expert but little liked forensic scientist employed at a small lab located in the gloomy fen country of East Anglia. He is murdered by being bludgeoned to death with a heavy club. Dalgliesh must investgate the case interviewing the employees at the lab. Many of these persons had reason to hate Lorrimer!

Again, James brings in Chief Inspector Adam Dalgleish of Scotland Yard, and once again, this venerable, brilliant, and honorable investigator is in good form. James usually presents a model in human behavior--she's good at this--and gives Dalgleish the full run to work out the inconsistencies, the red herrings, and finally the truth of the case. Dr. Lorrimer is a cold, efficient, dislikeable scientist; now he is a cold, efficient, and dislikeable corpse. Dalgleish must find out why he was killed--and it is more than merely because he was disliked. What did he know that panicked his murderer? After all, he was cold, efficient, dislikeable, and very knowledgeable, \\"an expert witness,\\" as it were.

Unlike Michael Connelly's books about Harry Bosch, or Lawrence Block's stories about Matt Scudder -- unlike most police detective series, in fact -- the focus here is always more on the crime and the details and circumstances surrounding it, and not so much on the person of the detective.The setting is Hoggatt's Laboratory, a government-supported forensics unit in Norfolk, where the county police send physical evidence from criminal cases to be analyzed, and whose experts usually end up presenting and explaining it in court. Hoggatt's has a new Director, Dr. Howarth, who came from outside the forensics community, and the head of the Biology Department, Dr. Lorrimer, considers that he was cheated out of a promotion. However, nobody likes Lorrimer, he's a very unlikeable person generally, and now someone has murdered him. He was found in the early morning, face down on the floor of his own lab, with the building's security locks all in place. Dalgliesh is sent up from London to get to the bottom of things, and quickly.Probing into the personality and background of the murdered man, Dalgliesh says, is \\"the strangest part of a detective's job, this building up of a relationship with the dead. . . . The victim was central to the mystery of his own death. He died because of what he was.\\" Dalgliesh knows he's bound to upset the well-being of all the people he must interview, too, as well as their routines. \\"Murder is like that, a contaminating crime.\\"The gimmick, of course, is that everyone in the pool of suspects, from the young girl working as receptionist (sorry, \\"Clerical Officer\\" -- they all love their bureaucratic titles at Hoggatt's) to the head of the Documents Department (who gave Lorrimer a bloody nose the day before), is extremely familiar with police investigative procedure and the nature of evidence. Dalgliesh will have to be more sophisticated than the killer. When it came down to it, the revelation of whodunit was something of a surprise, though the clues were there all along. (James always plays fair.) This isn't my favorite of James's novels, nor is it, I think, her best, but it's well up on the list."},{"Title":"Death of an Expert Witness (Adam Dalgliesh Mystery Series #6)","review":"This book is written in rather old-fashioned style (older, I mean, than the 1977 date of publication). There are a large number of characters, most of whom I found unlikable. It is a good mystery in the sense that almost every character in the story is presented as having a reason to want the murder victim dead. But in the end I did not think the book was worth the time spent wading through it. The writing might appeal to those who have enjoyed other \\"classic\\" mysteries like the Agatha Christie books.The story's detective, Adam Dalgliesh, has evidently appeared in a number of other books by this author.

This is important to remember if one is reading this book for the first time, as forentic science has not yet developed to what we expect today. Nevertheless, it is an excellent read.The book title refers to Dr. Lorrimer, a respected forensic professional who lives in rural England. Lorrimer's professional work is admired by colleagues but personally he is disliked as a man. When Lorrimer's body is found in his laboratory, suspicions point to someone with whom he worked. Dalgliesh is called in to solve the mystery surrounding his death.The characters are well written and fleshed-out. The plot moves along at a brisk pace. Dalgliesh is a master at winnowing the culprit and James allows the reader to follow in his footsteps, searching for clues.Frequent readers of James' work know that Dalgliesh can be a bit somber and that can be tiresome.

James' work occasionally collapses under its own weight as the author strains to combine psychological novel with crafty murder mystery--but DEATH OF AN EXPERT WITNESS shows the writer at her best, creating a memorable setting in rural England, a host of very believable characters, and a complex plot, with all aspects of the work coming together in seamless fashion.Dr. Lorrimer is a forensic scientist employed at a police laboratory, well respected by the scientific community and a bastion of authority in the witness box. Unfortunately, he is also a singularly unpleasant man: bitter at being passed over for promotion, petty in his dealings with underlings, vindictive in his personal relationships. So it is hardly surprising when he is murdered--but the circumstances are something of a shock: he is clubbed to death in the middle of his own laboratory, a situation that seems to indicate one or more of his co-workers is involved. And Chief Inspector Dalgliesh has an abundance of suspects from which to select.James' detective Dalgliesh is a rather dour creation, and in some James novels he can become a tiresome companion--but here James balances his darkness against the demands of the overall novel to considerable effect. The result is a stylish, atmospheric work with an intelligent plot and a satisfying conclusion--a book to keep mystery fans sitting up all night. Recommended."},{"Title":"Death of an Expert Witness (Adam Dalgliesh Mystery Series #6)","review":"This is an old P.D. James that I had somehow missed when I read her continuously in the mid-1990s. Although I love the James character Cordelia Gray, who appears in all of the \\"Unsuitable Job for a Woman\\"-type mysteries, my favorite James character is Inspector Dalgliesh. Since BBC/PBS did a series of \\"Mystery\\" episodes years ago based on the Dalgliesh character, I have him firmly fixed in my mind as the troubled Inspector (aren't they all?) who is also a brilliant poet and lover of all things fine in life. This book is a Dalgliesh book, not his best (that would be \\"A Taste for Death\\" or perhaps \\"Shroud for a Nightingale\\"), but even the worst Dalgliesh (I can't think of one) would be better than the best of most other people. This one takes place at a forensic laboratory where criminal and other evidence is processed and gives us a bit of a glimpse into how the Brits do Crime Scene Investigation (CSI). These are country people, not slick American city types, and that's OK. The countryside hides lots of interesting characters who have all sorts of motivations. Keep in mind that this was first published in 1986 and the world has changed rather tremendously since then!"},{"Title":"Death of an Expert Witness (Adam Dalgliesh Mystery Series #6)","review":"The first 60-65 pages were difficult to get through, because the main character is absent from them. When he does enter, Inspector Dalgleish is not developed nearly as much as he is in other books. We learn very little about him in this book. On the other hand, the search for the murderer is straighforward and interesting. There was the sense that enough clues were provided to the reader to identify the guilty party."},{"Title":"Death of an Expert Witness (Adam Dalgliesh Mystery Series #6)","review":"P.D. James has established herself as one of the definitive mystery writers of her generation and has established Adam Dalgliesh as one of the premier detectives within the literary world. 'Death of an Expert Witness' is a classic example of James' intelligent writing and thoroughly engaging plot lines that keep the reader guessing up until the end. Surely this is one of her best Dalgliesh mysteries.The expert witness in the title refers to Dr. Edwin Lorrimer, a much respected forensic biologist who leads a solitary life in rural England. Although admired by colleagues for his work and intelligence, Lorrimer is severly disliked as a person. The introductory book introduces us to several characters that inhabit Chevisham and their various reasons for disliking Dr. Lorrimer - and perhaps even their motives for killing him. When he is found dead in his laboratory, all signs point to someone on the inside, and Adam Dalgliesh is called in to piece together the mystery surrounding his death.The cast of characters is well written and believable; their supporting roles are thoroughly realized and move the plot along at a brisk pace. Dalgliesh is a master at tracking the little things that move humans to murder and the reader follows in his footsteps, searching for the clues even as he seeks them out. As usual, there is a hint of melancholy in Dalgliesh's actions and in the novel's bittersweet ending; the reader has come to empathize with the vivid characters who may or may not be guilty."},{"Title":"Death of an Expert Witness (Adam Dalgliesh Mystery Series #6)","review":"Though it pales in comparison with James' more recent work, DEATH OF AN EXPERT WITNESS, one of the best of her early novels, deserves to be judged based on its own merits. This is an excellent detective novel with interesting, believably drawn characters and an intriguing setting. James' descriptions of the goings-on at a forensic laboratory make the story even more engaging and realistic. The plot is complex, moving steadily toward the sharp climax, and the writing is, as usual, flawless. A great read."},{"Title":"Death of an Expert Witness (Adam Dalgliesh Mystery Series #6)","review":"I find P.D. James' stories adapt better to television than they do novels. She is a fine writer and I admire the heck out of her ability to render a story's setting as important (and usually moreso) than any of the characters who inhabit the spaces of her creations. However, in this novel, as in the three others I've read, I felt slightly bored because it was as if the settings, being so lovingly, artfully described, overpowered the events and cried out for adaptation to the screen, and simply failed when confined to the single dimension of the flat page. James is a better screen writer than a novelist. She tells a fine story and tells it with imagination, but I can't help but confess, I find her books a little slow moving and dull. Here I wanted to find out more about the crime lab and its experiments. I also wanted to follow the life of the young girl who is the featured character at the very start, but alas, she drifts into the background soon after the opening pages, and we don't encounter her again except as a prop at the very end. I think Death of an Expert Witness needed a few more sub-plots and deviations from the main story. It was too little mystery and too much verbiage. Sorry..."},{"Title":"Death of an Expert Witness (Adam Dalgliesh Mystery Series #6)","review":"This is my third James novel. The present work was written over 30 years ago by a James in her prime. It is short and compact; and, it has a nicely balanced structure with good characters. It is written with straightforward and simple prose and it is a compelling read that is hard to put down. In short, it is what one can describe as a masterpiece as are some of her other early novels.The book opens with the literary hook: a murder in a field in the countryside. But it quickly switches to a second murder in a science laboratory.The novel has an interesting set of characters, and as in other James novels, there are half dozen suspects with various financial and emotional motivations to be involved with the killings. The mystery unfolds slowly, and the reader is given a few clues just ahead of the Dalgliesh. By the way, Dalgliesh does not play a dominant role in the book.Readers will not be disappointed, and the book demonstrates the fame and ability of James as a crime writer. Most will want to keep the book and set it aside to read again in the future. Also, the book demonstrates again that more is not always better than less. In the elaborate 550 page slow moving story told in The Murder Room, the author has a 95 page introduction and no crime until around page 130. We wait as Dalgliesh does not enter the investigation until almost page 200. Thankfully, all of that type of writing is missing here. The story is well underway and the reader is fully engaged by page 10. James tells a well balanced and a compelling tale in half the space.This is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Death of an Expert Witness (Adam Dalgliesh Mystery Series #6)","review":"Perfect. In this sixth of her Adam Dalgliesh mysteries, the author has achieved a flawless blend of the requisite elements. Dalgliesh is now a fully developed character and is given a sidekick that provides a fine complement to Dalgliesh's naturally dark character. I would also note without any spoilers that a grasp of Dalglish's background adds greatly to the enjoyment of the work. Our author is now able to avoid providing excessive and distracting detail regarding her protagonist as well as provide themes and plot lines that resonate with the Inspector's experience. Suffice it also to say that there is a strong and unifying theme running throughout the book that neatly ties everything up in an edifying and powerful manner. As befits first-rate fiction (of any genre), the book provides a worthwhile lesson in the nature of the human condition.In short, a Forensic Biologist is whacked over the head with a mallet in his own police laboratory. Thus, the investigation of other murders must be put on hold while the police sort out their own business. The setting is well-matched to the events, the characters are diverse and excellently drawn, the plot moves nicely--but what sets this book apart are the constant red herrings. Upon encountering what appears to be a significant clue, you have not yet finished congratulating yourself on solving the mystery before your speculation is revealed to be flawed.What makes this a masterwork is that the diversions and complications appear entirely natural. Nothing is out of place and the book is seamless in its relentless march to the ultimate revelation, the tragedy of which is developed in much greater detail than in prior works.Thus far, my favorite P.D. James mystery. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Death of an Expert Witness (Adam Dalgliesh Mystery Series #6)","review":"I would recommand the death of an expert because it has all the suspence that a murder mystery fan would enjoy.The plot is that a Dr. Lorrimer who was murderd in his own lab, Now Detective Adam Dalgliesh, will try to solve the cold murder, but people in the fens don't like the unplesent doctor, so this complicates the whole senario, because theirs a lot possible suspect.The book provides you to think while you read and this written back in 1977. The plot is complex and also the climax is sharp.Unlike othere murder mystery books or movies the story does not have any flawss at all becaues it is well thought and well written.

James novel. 2, I believe that Agatha Christie was the goddess of all mystery writing.I am used to a body within the first few pages, and letting Hercule Poirot deduce things from there until the solution is provided. However, there are no bodies until 80 pages into the book, and most of the discussion includes things that Dalgliesh brings out later with witnesses anyway, making them redundant.Also confusing was James's apparent escape from reality with character names. Some are completely absurd, like the characters names &quot;Makepeace&quot; and &quot;Gotobed.&quot; Combining words into names detracts from the proposed seriousness of the situation.This book is much heavier than a true murder mystery, and the decision comes down to this: whether you want a true murder mystery, where you follow facts and psychology in the attempt to deduce the murderer, or whether you want a deeper novel -- a P.D. James novel -- where, along with the murder, time is spent reflecting on life and the world in a more philosophical fashion."},{"Title":"Death of an Expert Witness (Adam Dalgliesh Mystery Series #6)","review":"It took longer than expected to arrive (a good 10 days after receiving another book from a different vendor which was purchased the same day).

I figured them to be drab, sappy, overly sentimental and trite. How wrong I was! Upon urging of friends, I picked up \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and enjoyed it immensely (though I disagree with another poster that it was faster paced than Emma). I immediately purchased \\"Emma\\" and was delighted. The character, as is mentioned, is flawed...but charming BECAUSE of these flaws. Emma is a wonderful character and the book is a joy to read.

It's my favorite novel from Jane Austen followed by Pride & Prejudice. In fact I only like those two novels out of the six she wrote, but anyway, Emma was a really good read. The best part about this novel is that it isn't about a girl who is looking for love, it's about a girl who unexpectedly finds love where it has been all the time. Talk about right under your nose. Emma is friendly, kind, naive, smart, loyal, whitty, clever, innocent, and definatley worth reading. I truly love this book because I love romance in it's purest form, true love, when you know that these two characters will spend the rest of their lives together and will love each other faithfully! That's why I love this book, and Pride & Prejudice is the same way, maybe I'll write a review for that too, hope this helps you out, and buy the book!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Highbury, England early 1800's a quiet and pleasant place to live. Where Emma Woodhouse takes residents with her father. Emma is clever and yes, rich. She enjoys many of the same things young adults do today do including match making and visiting friends in 1800's fashion.Emma is the main character as you probably can tell by the title of Emma. She has a bad habit of match making just ask \\"poor\\" Harriet. Emma attempts to stop threw out the book but always ends up going back. She vowed never to marry early in life. Besides her father Mr. Woodhouse needs her and she enjoys calling on her single friends. If she had a husband to complicate things she could not go see those friends. Unless the man she married enjoyed calling on those same friends.Emma seems like she could walk off the page and appear in the 21-century, even thew she lived in the 1800's. Her habits are the same as many young women today of not marrying and the dreaded habit of match making.Emma is full of personality even thew she can be a little mean to long time friends and not relies it without someone telling her. But Emma appears real and grounded.I would recommend Emma to young women who are fast readers and who know someone or they themselves enjoys match making. Because Emma learns control the desire to mess with people's feelings.Get Emma today even if you don't read it you can tell your friends you own on of the classics by Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I first learned of 'Emma' by watching the movie starring Gwyneth Paltrow - I was instantly captivated by the high-class style of that era, Emma's life and her relationship with Mr. Knightly. After watching the movie probably 16 times, I went and read the book and was so glad I did! It's become one of my all-time favorite books simply because I love Emma's character and get lost in her life and world every time, and come back later craving to read it again! The book expands and clarifies so much we don't get to see in the movie and gives you the original view of Emma - apart from the movie. As a woman, I love romance and tales of older times where nobility and class presided yet values were down to earth, respectable and loving. 'Emma' combines both nobility and the 'down to earthness' in Mr. Knightly. If you love romance, strong female characters and getting lost in another world of balls, dances, society - definitely read this and watch the movie with Gwyneth Paltrow! It's gorgeous and guaranteed to uplift you."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Though not her favorite novel, Austen's Emma shines as one of her most beloved. The character of Emma is both believable and lovable. This particular edition is a great keepsake, one you can pass down to your own daughter."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Because of its popularity, I believe the literary merits of &quot;Emma&quot; are perhaps overlooked. So much more than a mere &quot;romance&quot; novel, it is also one of the most humorous works of fiction ever written, rife with some of literature's most memorable and beloved characters. &quot;Emma&quot; remains my favorite of Austen's books and is a testament to my opinion that she is one of the greatest novelists of all-time, male or female."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I really enjoyed this novel, as I do all of Jane Austen's works. The narrator is an interesting character, making comments on the action and people around her. I was surpised at how much the narrator disliked her heroine at the beginning of the story. The growth of Emma throughout the novel gives hope to every spoiled child or even prideful adult. My only regret is that I saw the movie with Gwyneth Paltrow (and even Clueless) before reading this. I think I would have enjoyed it even better not knowing what laid ahead. I highly recommend saving the movies for after the book."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Though exhasperating at times, Emma enchants us all. It is through Emma's repeated blunders,imprudence, and vanity that she becomes one of the most charming heroines of all times. Jane Austen has created a hilarious set of characters: the preposterously overprotective father, the poor chatterbox neighbour, the pretty, lighthearted proteg&eacute;, and the man of reason whose love finally dictates against his logic (to name a very few). Although the plot is at times made dreary by Miss Bates' prolongued monologues, the novel is otherwise a light read. One must not expect to turn the last page having learnt some universal truth, but rather having enjoyed a few good laughs, some heart-leaping, and a few sighs. Emma is an outstanding proof of Jane Audten's wit; the candour and modesty in her novel make it a truly refreshing read."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma is one of the best books I have ever read. The way Jane Austen displays Emma is funny. Emma's faults make her realistic and someone you can relate to. The way she relates to the other characters makes the book very interesting. I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good book."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I purchased &quot;Emma&quot; about a year ago and finally picked it up about 2 weeks ago. I was engrossed in the story from the beginning. Although it does take patience to get through some of the less exciting parts of the book, it is a very enjoyable book to read. By the end of the book, these characters will feel like your own family. I learned a lot about English culture and about how the upper class families used to live. Jan Austen is a very good author and could be classed with the best of them. Oddly, this book has a strikingly similar plot as the movie &quot;Clueless&quot;. After you read the book you will see a resemblance between Cher and Emma, Dion and Mrs. Weston, Elton and Mr. Elton, and Josh and Mr. Knightley. I HIGHLY recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"A good read.

I had recently read (correction 're-read) \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" which undoubtedly rated Jane Austen's finest and has been a favorite of mine for years! It was actually one of the reasons I had delayed so long to start another by Austen for though I had heard great things about \\"Emma\\" (as well as others) I found myself very reluctant to start for fear of being disappointed. I was very bull headed in believing I would not like Emma the main character going into the story because I hate when female characters for lack of a better word \\"meddle\\" in other characters business. Boy was I wrong.I came to adore Emma and only wish I had not gone into the book so stubborn to dislike her! For this reason I am tempted to start reading it again without the previous false pretenses. So to those who were like me and are nervous due to what they have heard, please don't be!

She thinks she knows it all. But really it's just she hasn't experienced the world. But this belief makes her get involved in the problems of others and disrupts her peaceful life. However it's not that serious, the results are comical and teaches you the important lesson to mind your own business!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Clueless is a lot like Emma. The only difference is that Emma is a story written in 1816, and Clueless is, like, a totally 90's story. I didn't know that Clueless was an adaptation of the classic novel until I read an article, and hey, the writer did a good job of updating Emma. 'Course, both Emma and Clueless are terrific and funny stories about the trials and triabulations of mediocre matchmakers. Additionally, I think Austen does a great job of creating characters that you love and hate with a passion. This is one of the funniest novels that has been written by Jane Austen. I like Emma, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to know the story upon which Clueless was based."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"This book is one of many by Jane Austen that will put you into a total field of happiness. Emma's perilous journey towards understanding herself and her own wrong doings is funny and down to earth. The English is a bit hard to read but once you get into the book, the English becomes easy to read."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I enjoyed the quaintness of Emma's society. The heroine, Emma, was hilarious, especially when her schemes backfired. However, Austen's EMMA resembles modern day soap operas. As an example the heartbreaks of Harriet and the maliciousness of Mrs. Elton can be found on any episode of _The Young and the Restless_(granted, though, without the strong sexual content). Just like a soap opera, EMMA and the contents wherein get tedious.

I certainly would have chosen another one of the available editions."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I guess I am an exception. I found the book, Emma, to be overly long and tiresome. The book focuses mostly on social calls between Emma and her neighbors and their dialogue. Emma is just so snobbish and aware of her high status that it was hard to find her likeable at first. I found myself liking her more towards the end of the book as she saw the error of her ways. I loved Pride and Prejudice...but this book just didn't really click with me."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Austen weaves a brilliant tale of Emma Woodhouse, a young socialite, and her community in Victorian England. Emma cannot resist inserting herself into the affairs and pursuits of her neighbors and dear friends and the resulting chaos is delightful. Emma is indeed a flawed character, but so are the others in this tale, which makes it all the more authentic. Emma's belated realizations of the results of her machinations are humorous as well as often disastrous. Feeling she must match her new protogee, Harriet Smith, with a suitable husband, Emma manages to mangle the situation not once but three separate times. Of course in the end it all comes out well but it is a wonderful ride. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I downloaded Emma for free on my kindle from amazon.

So she vowed never to get marry, but ended getting married to a very unexpected person .This book is a typical romance comedy friction novel. It started of slow and then the pace pick back up again. You will see Emma finding herself and becoming a better person. I think the Emma character means well and wants her friends to be in high society like her, but she comes of snobby and meddlely. while reading the book I keep saying to myself girl just fall back and fix your own self up.

While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).Modern readers tend to be squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings. A lesser delight."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"As much as I love Jane Austen, Emma is a horrible read. This was the only one of Austen's books I couldn't finish in college. I thought I'd try it again a decade later and I still don't like it (although this time I did finish reading it).Like some of the other reviewers have stated, Emma is just not a likeable character. And unlike most of Austen's heroines, she seems to have no redeeming qualities, making it incredibly hard to read about her for hundreds of pages.I guess one could argue that the book is well written by virtue of the fact that I despise Emma so much as a character. But I'm not arguing Austen's merits as a writer. I am simply stating that this book is not worth reading when there are so many other classics out there that you might actually enjoy!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"A lot of people have said that Emma is one of their favorite books but I would have to differ. This book put me to sleep every time I picked it up. It was dull and boring, this is only my opinion. I would not let this book effect and make me not want to read Jane Austen again. Since it is only one book out of many of hers. I felt this book was for a different crowd of people. Maybe I should have waited till I was older and grasped the concept more.Miss.

Emma then meets a girl named Harriet Smith, who is not as smart as Emma but she likes how she is willing to learn and listen to what she had to say. They went on daily walks around the town. Mr. Martin a very dull farmer that Emma's brother-in-law works proposes to Harriett who has had a crush on him before Emma tried to set her up with Mr. Elton. Emma influences her to refuse the offer of marriage, so she does. This was before n and got to know each other very well.Emma thinks she can match anyone up with love, if they gave her a chance. She herself has vowed to remain single. She tries to set Harriet, up with Mr. Elton, but Mr. Elton likes Emma instead of Harriet and wants to marry her. Emma refuses and Mr. Elton leaves and gets married to some person who nobody thinks is worthy of him. When Emma finds out Mr. Elton got married she doesn't want Harriet to find out since she is still hung up on him they found out Mr. Elton had married. Emma is very controlling when it comes to love, and this is one reason why I didn't like the book she aggravated me.Mrs. Weston's stepson is coming she is nervous he won't like her and confides in Emma. Emma is out for a carriage ride and she gets stuck. Mr. Churchill Mr. Weston's son comes and helps her get out, he doesn't tell her who he is till after and she is amazed by how good looking he is. She is confused with hr feelings for him after that. She thinks she may be in love but she doesn't feel like she is. Mr. Churchill likes a woman named Jane who is staying with Miss. Bates, a dear friend of Emma. Emma doesn't really like Jane since she always has one over her. For example at a party that was thrown they asked Emma if she would like to play the piano, when she is done Jane is asked to play the piano and everyone loved Jane's when people only like Emma's performance.At a picnic with Jane, Mr. Churchill, Miss. Bates, Mr. Elton, his wife, and Mr. Knightly, Emma's very good friend. Emma insults her friend, Miss. Bates. Mr. Knightly tells Emma off. Emma realizes she loves Mr. Knightly but is worried he loves Harriet. They secretly have feelings for each other but neither of them do anything. Finally they do confess there feelings and they get engaged. Harriet ends up with Mr. Martin and Mr. Churchill ends up with Jane.Mrs. Weston becomes pregnant and Emma does not want anyone to know about her and Mr. Knightly's engagement until the baby is born. Jane and Mr. Churchill are also keeping their engagement a secret.I couldn't really relate to this book. I would have done a lot of things different then what she did. For starters I would not have gone and meddled into every ones love life. Its their life and people need to respect that and not mess with it. I understand she thought she was helping everyone but truth be told she wasn't and it just was annoying to see how she kept going off and doing that throughout the book."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I've read it a million times, it was purchased as a gift for someone; but, since I never received the other two books, I didn't bother giving it."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"This book arrived new and in good condition.

I have previously read Pride and Prejudice."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"If you love literature and you love needlework, this one is double the love. The book is timeless and the needlework cover will be as well. Enjoy"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"When I first opened the novel, I realised that the book was split into three volumes, which comprised of eighteen chapters apiece. I wondered how long it would take me to get through the read. As it worked out, the organisation of the novel, and the clarity of the language makes the novel a very legible read, and can flow through the chapters in each of the volumes with much ease. It could take less than three to four days to complete one volume, in nine by nine chapters, with active concentration.As the volume chapters are split, volume one makes for a very interesting read, as divided in between the chapters, we're almost immediately introduced to Harriet and Emma's relationship, and Emma's designs on how she plans to interfere in Harriet's relationship, and make her wed mr Elton, of Emma's choice, not mr Martin, of Harriet's choice. As she breaks up Harriet's relationship with mr Martin, we find ourselves sympathising with Harriet, but with Emma a lot less, and our opinion of her schemes, makes readers feel critical of her.In volume two, we sympathise with Emma a lot less than we are critical of her. On first read, volume two can get extremely tedious, because the themes run on, and have a lot less in common with volume one. By volume three, we get a better understanding of volume two, and the themes eventually link together, into something more conclusive. On first read, however, volume two can get quite tedious, and more put-downable as readers opinion grows colder towards Emma, because of how unfairly she breaks down Harriet's relationship, and also because of her prejudices towards miss Jane Fairfax, whom we find ourselves liking, and is through the novel a lot nicer, and more consistent than Emma.By volume three, our understanding of Emma grown warmer, as her feelings towards not wanting to ever be married begins to change, as her understanding of mr Frank Chruchill, and mr George Knightley begins to change. She finds herself going to balls, and centred into some flirtation between these two men. By the end of the novel she discovers Frank Churchill has been secretly wed to Jane Fairfax, and we are also surprised to see that Emma's marital status also concludes with a wedding to George Knightley, although Mr Woodhouse, Emma's father was to a certain degree against this union of the two, believing that Emma had vowed never to get married to anyone, so that she can continue looking after Woodhouse, and not leave.If there were any further protests to the conclusion of who got married or not, or if there were ever any intentions for the centreing married couples to divorce, this is not identitifien by the author, because of the cosy-close ending of the novel, centred about the characters getting married, and divorce is never a theme that has ever been explored in Austen's novels, even in less happier, eccentric, or less committed relationship.Overall, with a little patience, the novel is a very good read, especially, if readers can get through the tedious themes of volume two, and into the merits, and warmer themes in volume three."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel.

It explores the emptiness of being without a mother, and at the same time the writer must be writing from the perspective of a young person who knew all the right things to say but coming out short. Essentially, Emma wishes to be the person who has given her birth, but is left alone with her \\"peacock-personality type\\" father who was constantly jealous of her mother's friendship while living.

Emma Woodhouse is the spoiled, rich, younger daughter of the widowed Mr Woodhouse. Her father, Henry, is nave, self-centred, a borderline hypochondriac and the ultimate pessimist. Emma lives at home with him, looks after him and has no plans to ever marry because of this. She is a strong-willed and snobbish 20-year-old with a rather dull life who fancies herself an excellent matchmaker. Most of her friends and acquaintances indulge her. Only George Knightly, the elder brother of her sister Isabella's husband, John, is critical of her behaviour. He takes her to task for meddling in others' lives. As with all novels of this era, compared with today's offerings, the reader has to be patient and allow the story to build. There's also getting one's head around the language used. It took me a few instances of the word \\"nice\\" to realise that what it meant then (foolish, stupid, senseless) was not what it means today. The garrulous Miss Bates is a source of humour and there is plenty of talking at crossed purposes. This novel seems to point to the importance of status and appearance in Miss Austen's world.

I had to watch the movie to understand who certian people were but the book is even better. She is wity and funny. I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"When commenting about the brilliant Jane Austen, Pride and Prejudice is the most commonly discussed. Though I must admit that Pride and Prejudice is my undisputed favorite from among those novels I have read by Ms. Austen, she does have many other great works. Emma is yet another example of her unparalleled skills as a writer. Most people find Austen's themes of romance most interesting but her novels, Emma in particular, are peppered with a great deal of satire. Austen manages to not only create an engaging story but also to criticize the ridged society in which she lived. In all of the Jane Austen novels that I have read she has created a humorous character who seems to talk far too much and make herself ridiculous to everybody; that character in this story is Mrs. Bates. Though Mrs. Bates long speeches did often get annoying they were not without humor and it seems obvious that Austen was poking fun at many of the women in her society. Though it took me a while to get through this book I did thoroughly enjoy it and was further convinced of Jane Austen being one of the greatest writers to ever live. This novel rather contrasted both Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility in the fact that the heroin was not an underprivileged young woman who was lifted up from inferior circumstance. Instead, Emma was born into a high circle of society and a great deal of money. It was not her who was looked down on but she who looked down on others and while she was generally well meaning she was not without her pride and sense of superiority. I had a bit of a difficult time relating to Emma's character as opposed to those of Elizabeth Bennett or Elinor Dashwood who were both more level headed and loveable. I always enjoy Jane Austen's novels and I am very glad that I read Emma. I would most certainly suggest it!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Received book in excellent condition and fast shipping. I am enjoying this book, what a great read! Thank you."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma was the first Jane Austen book I've ever read &, originally, I liked it much more than Pride And Prejudice but I've since changed my mind. While I love this book, it's not my favorite anymore.Emma is such a fun character because she is so sure that what she's doing is right when all the while she's just making a mess of things. The best part about her is that when she sees that she is wrong, she can laugh at herself & learn from her mistakes.Mr. Knightly is one of my favorite Austen characters. His name says it all, \\"knightly.\\" He is the perfect gentlemen...possibly moreso than Mr. Darcy, even.The characters in this book, as in all Jane Austen books, represent both the follies & goodness in human nature, which is what I love about her writing. This is a wonderful book that I highly recommend for anyone new to Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma Woodhouse is in need of a new particular friend now that her governess has married. As luck would have it, she meets pretty and artless Harriet Smith, a girl of obscure parentage. Emma is convinced that Harriet is a gentleman's daughter (after all, she did attend a good boarding school), and takes it upon herself to teach her the ways of a lady and to introduce her to a good eligible gentleman that would elevate her station in life. Harriet has her eyes set on a simple farmer, but that is not enough for her, at least not according to Emma. She knows what's best for everyone around. Emma fancies herself a matchmaker. In fact, she takes credit for introducing Mr. Weston to her former governess. And, at twenty-one, she has no intention of ever marrying. She has to look after her father and their Hartfield estate. She is an heiress to thirty thousand pounds and is well respected among her peers. What more could she want? But Harriet needs Mr. Elton. A girl like Harriet cannot become an old maid like the tiresome Miss Bates. Emma is determined to make it happen, and she doesn't care what Mr. Knightley, her brother-in-law's brother, has to say on the matter.Jane Austen is known for creating flawed characters, most of which are not central in her stories. The closest Austen came to creating an anti-heroine was Marianne Dashwood in Sense and Sensibility. But the novel is told mostly from Elinor Dashwood's POV, which makes Marianne seem less insufferable. Emma is Austen's official anti-heroine -- a young woman who thinks she knows so much when she actually knows nothing. She is essentially clueless to everything that goes on around her. Mr. Knightley is always there to scold her and set her right, of course. Emma, though not my favorite Austen, is a lovely story. The theme is very popular and it has inspired many authors and Hollywood producers throughout the years. (The 1995 teen flick Clueless is a modern-day adaptation of Emma.) It has also inspired an infinite number of sequels written by new authors. Austen does sort of drag the story a bit toward the end, which is why I take away half a star. That, in a nutshell, is the only drawback in this book. The rest is wonderful. You will get all of the Austenian elements here: a shocking match, irritating snobs, hilarious social commentary, balls and assemblies, silly ladies and suspiciously charming men. Mr. and Mrs. Weston, Miss Bates, Harriet Smith, Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax are my favorite characters -- after Mr. Knightley, of course. He is my third favorite of the Austen men (after Mr. Darcy and Captain Wentworth). If you're new to Jane Austen, then Emma is a good way to start. You won't be able to resist reading her five other books. I read this several years ago, but the experience was more enjoyable this time around. Jane Austen is as addictive as chocolate and I look forward to reading Mansfield Park soon."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I haven't read a Jane Austen novel in years. The last time I read one of her novels I was very young and it was not by choice. If you want to rediscover Jane Austen, start with Emma. This novel is about a very snobby, spoiled, and at times malicious young lady by the name of Emma Woodhouse. Emma lives in the village of Highbury with her hypchondriac father. After Emma's Governess, who throughout the book is known as Mrs Weston marries, Emma is left with a lot of time on her hands. I'm afraid she does not use this time wisely.Emma finds a new friend and protege in Harriet Smith, a young lady with an unknown past who Emma takes under her wing. Emma brings it upon herself to give young Harriet somewhat of a social makeover. She induces her to aspire to greatness and put on airs proper to a lady of Emma's class, although she's not even sure what class Harriet belongs to. When Harriet is offered marriage by a farmer by the name of Mr Martin, Emma is horrified! She convinces Harrriet that such a man is hardly worthy of her and intices her to find romance with the handsome but vain vicor, Mr Elton. Emma's disasterous matchmaking decison is the focus of the book.I found this novel incredibly amusing! Emma's unbashed snobbery, Harriet's ignorance, Mr Woodhouse's constant worry of illness befalling every character in the book. This book is literally laugh out loud funny at times. The novel features many other equally amusing characters. Mr Knightley, Emma's sister's brother-in-law, who is the one person in the novel to always tell Emma how it really is. The chatty and annoying Mrs Bates, the insufferable Augusta Elton who is almost as full of herself as Emma.When Jane Austen wrote this book she claimed no one but herself would like Emma Woodhouse. Emma is conceited and selfish, but the beauty of this book is that Emma is forced to come to terms with what her behavior has caused her and those she loves. The Emma you meet at the beginning of the novel is not the same Emma that you say goodbye to at the end.If you want a simple description of what this novel is about I will tell you that it is about a young lady's road to maturity and growth. Jane Austen isn't for everyone, but if you are curious or want to give her novels another try, start with Emma. It's guaranteed to renew your interest in one of the greatest writers in English literature. Five stars!!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"After reading 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' and loving it I decided to read all of Jane Austen's works. 'EMMA' was second on the list, if I am being honest, because I loved the movie 'CLUELESS' and although I believe 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' will always be my favorite Jane Austen novel, so far (I am only three novels in) 'EMMA' is a close second.I found 'EMMA' to be extremely witty, intricately woven and definitely kept me on my toes! The way Austen set the stage for the many different interconnecting aspects of this book just proves why so many readers adore her. If you are interested in reading Austen , I am sure many would say that you cannot go wrong with any of her novels, however this reader highly recommends both \`EMMA' and \`PRIDE & PREJUDICE' and hope that you will enjoy them as much as I have."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma Woodhouse is an atypical heroine for a Jane Austen novel. Usually, we see disadvantaged girls struggle to find happiness through marriage. In Emma's case, we see a girl who has everything in the world she could want. She is rich, pretty, and happy. She has no desire to be married, as it would interfere with the simple life she enjoys with her father and she knows it would break his heart to be parted from her. The story follows Emma's life beginning at 21 as she tries to help a young girl named Harriet Smith marry above her station. Emma also engages in a flirtation with a young man and generally makes a bit of a mess of things whenever she gets involved.I have read that Jane Austen felt that Emma was a character only her creator could like. I would have to disagree with that. Emma is certainly flawed, but her heart is almost always in the right place. Pride has blinded her to her own limitations but she is also one who does not shrink from the responsibility of her mistakes and tries very hard to learn from them. I found this admirable and grew to like her more and more as the book progressed.Aside from Emma, the rest of the cast was also very well written. Her father is a complete hypochondriac and often engages in behavior that would typically be considered highly rude. Yet, he is motivated so completely by a desire to be kind to others that his misguided application of that desire only endears him to the reader. Mr. Knightley, the no-nonsense friend of the family is admittedly not the most complex character in the world, but he is a very good one and his solidity is a great counterbalance to Emma's wishful thinking.In summary, Emma is a nice change of pace from Jane Austen's other novels. It starts off well and grows more engaging as it continues. The characters are interesting and Emma herself grows considerably during the course of the novel."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Like most of Jane Austen's novels, the theme is around young women and how to obtain marriages with suitable men and be in love with them at the same time. In Emma, we have a heroine who not just sits around and speculates on who would pair up with who, but actively strives to influence and guide the matchmaking. She takes on a protege, Harriet Smith, a young woman of unknown parentage and sees into every interaction with the various gentlemen, more than is actually there. Unfortunately for poor Harriet, whose emotions get tangled around various men \\"who are all above her socially\\", Emma learns that manipulation and scheming is doing more to hurt her dear friend than to have left things alone.The reason I read this book as a mystery, is that the reader is left to speculate (without peeking) which man would pair up with which lady. There are red herrings, where the characters other than Emma, misspeculate, to lead the reader into examining the clues to see if it were the case. Also, one of the male characters purposely set out to mislead where his affections are placed, and there is also a misunderstanding between Emma and Harriet on which gentleman she admires, with Emma giving encouragement because of mistaken identity.The scheming finally crashes to a sequence of revelations brought about by a sequence of events. One after another, the couples pair off with a sequence of marriages, assuring the reader that the correct matches were made and happiness for the future guaranteed. Even though the middle of the book is very slow, the reader can go back and look at the clues and events after knowing the ending to see where inclinations rested and secrets lay buried."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I found this book extremely interesting, and it held a very unique story line, which seems at times hard to come by in many recently published books. I enjoyed the main character, Emma, whose character was so incredibly... fun, (mainly) mature, rommantic, and exciting all in one. Her want to match everyone with a lover reminds me very much of the premise of the novel A Midsummer Nights Dream.

She learns of life and love during the whirlwind fo events that change her life forever. Jane Austen has really outdone herself this time. The book desplays a charming sense of humor and knowledge from the author's point of view and the way each character is portrayed gives a beautiful visual effect in the mind. If this book proves its worth I would certainly say that any of the other novels written by Jane Austen are as wonderful as this book was for me."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"No one reads a book like Fiona Shaw. No matter what she narrates, her voice weaves a golden web, entrapping the listener with great charm and ease.Shaw's narration of Emma is no exception.

You hear Mr. Knightly chide Emma for her recklessness and &quot;poor Miss Taylor&quot; speculate that Miss Fairfax and Mr. Knightly are &quot;a couple.&quot; Their voices come alive entrancingly.Austen's story is wonderful to read, but Fiona Shaw makes it an even greater treat to listen to. I give her narration the highest possible recommendation. Here's to more from Ms. Shaw!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"EMMA, Jane Austen's fourth novel was published in 1815 and dedicated to the Prince Regent, later King George IV. Austen privately abhorred the Regent for the treatment of his wife Princess Caroline and his dissipated lifestyle. In 1813 she wrote to her friend Martha Lloyd, \\"I suppose all the World is sitting in Judgement upon the Princess of Wales's Letter. Poor woman, I shall support her as long as I can, because she is a Woman, & because I hate her Husband.\\" She did however recognize the value of his name and agreed to the dedication. Upon publication EMMA also had its own share of critics. What impressed early readers was not that it lacked energy and style, but that its story was dull and uneventful. Even Austen's famous publisher John Murray thought it lacked \\"incident and romance\\" and Maria Edgeworth, a contemporary author so greatly admired by Austen that she sent her one of the twelve presentation copies allotted by her publisher, could not read past the first volume and thought \\"there was no story in it.\\" Ironically, what these two prominent and well read individuals attributed as a weakness is actually EMMA'S greatest strength.If one looks beyond the surface, EMMA is an intricate story focused on the astute characterization and social reproof which Austen is famous for. Emma Woodhouse is a complex character that on first acquaintance is rather a pill. Austen gave herself a great challenge in creating \\"a heroine whom no one but myself will like.\\" In contrast with her other heroines, Miss Woodhouse does not have any social or financial concerns and thus no compelling need to marry. Therein lives the rub. We have no sympathy for her whatsoever. She's rich, she's spoiled and she's stuck up. Who indeed could possibly like such a \\"troublesome creature\\"? During the course of the novel we witness her exerting her superior notions of who is suitable for whom as she match makes for her friends with disastrous results. It is no wonder that Maria Edgeworth gave up reading EMMA after the first volume. At that point we have met most of the characters in Emma's insular world and are coming to fully understand her ignorance and misguided perceptions in relation to them. She is truly exasperating. Austen tests our endurance fully as the novel progresses and her heroine continues to make mistakes. It is a testament to her skill as a writer and deft comedian that she holds our fascination with the \\"busy nothings\\" of every-day country life in Highbury, a small village filled with endearingly flawed characters. The transformation of the heroine from spoiled and insufferable into a contrite, mature and likeable young lady that you want to root for, is nothing less than remarkable. It is truly a shame that Edgeworth could not recognize the genius of Austen's sly sashay of characterization into a world that could be your own neighborhood. We can only account that, \\"One half of the world cannot understand the pleasures of the other.\\"If you liked the new BBC/PBS miniseries Emma (2009), enjoy the original novel with all of Austen's resplendent language in this expertly produced audio recording. Read by acclaimed British actress Juliet Stevenson, viewers of the 1996 movie adaptation of EMMA will remember her superb portrayal of the vulgar a vacuous Mrs. Elton and know you are in for a treat. Adding equal measure of energy and humor to each of the characters, Stevenson's perfect blending of a classic novel and a sensitive interpretation enhanced my enjoyment greatly. Pop this one into your CD player or iPod during your commute to work. I highly recommend it. \\"It is such a happiness when good people get together -- and they always do.\\" Ch 21Laurel Ann, Austenprose"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"And I mean that in a good way.

No, she isnt perfect, but her flaws are part of what makes her so real. While the Bennett women were certainly by no means perfect either (the crazy mother immediately took away any hopes of that), they always seemed rather flat to me. Emma is witty and charming, but with a degree of authenticity that makes her seem less like a character in a novel, and more like your best friend. highly recommend."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Jane Austen's, Emma, is about an upper-class young woman from the 18th century. She is the protagonist and makes a hobby out of match making. By doing so she injures her companion, because she is blind to other peoples' feelings and opinions. Emma is a benevolent character, but she is incredibly misguided. The only person who can criticize her is Mr. George Knightly. They have grown-up together and their relationship develops as the novel progresses.Most of the plot is propelled by Emma's antics and schemes to contro the people around her. Comical witticisms pervade the novel. The more Emma attempts to steer her peers toward certain paths the more she discovers her own lack of direction. The theme of marriage is evidents as it is the central focus for nearly every character. Some renounce it while others advise prudent matches. In the end, Emma must stop wielding others and concentrate on her own ambitions regarding marriage.I thoroughly enjoyed reading Emma. I also read Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey. Both of these paled in comparison to Emma. I found myself with a perpetual smile on my face as Emma got herself in and out of mischief. She is so likable that I was constantly rooting for her. She was great because of her fallibility. Her mistakes weer always out of good intentions.The novel is romantic, yet not in an effusive way where there is some Adonis spouting sonnets. It is more subtle and underplayed. It is above all a story about society. I learned a lot about the role of women in this time period. Emma is extremely intellectual and her only outlet for her intellect is in trying to play Cupid. Also, a woman's solitary means of advancing her situation is though matrimony. This explained the emphasis on connections.The only character that slightly peeved me was Mr. Knightly. He is the handsome \\"prince charming\\" and mentor to Emma. It is his infallibility that makes him so aggravating. Knightly was always right and Emma was always wrong. I wanted her to be right for once and laugh at him for being precocious. This, of course, never happened. Ultimately, Emma is one of my favorite historical fiction novels."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I am a burgeoning literary scholar, so it may be rather unfashionable, as I am told, to say that I am a Janeite - though I have never gone so far as to throw a tea-party in her honour, I will say that I am exceeding fond of her novels, her style, her characters, and her corrective social satire. If she were not dead, lo, these last 185 years, I would positively send her an elegantly written letter declaring my love. At any rate.&quot;Emma&quot; is a fine novel, as though it lacked only my approbation to make it so. In it, Austen explores the vagaries of the marriage plot in the way only Austen can, with all the humour and satiric bite of which she is capable. She imagines a solipsistic community, Highbury, &quot;a crowd in a little room,&quot; if you will, where everyone knows everyone else's business, and Emma Woodhouse, the 21 year old mistress of Hartfield, presides socially over all. Through and around Emma's point of view, Austen examines the various social, class, and economic relationships that hold the community together.&quot;Emma&quot; begins with a very Doodian rhexis - the cut - Emma Woodhouse and her sedentary old father's society is broken up by the marriage of Emma's governess/best friend, Miss Taylor. Creating a sort of void in Emma's life, a newcomer to Hartfield, a 17 year old girl named Harriet Smith, becomes the intimate friend and a reclamation project of sorts for Emma. Emma, convinced the &quot;natural daughter of somebody&quot; must be, like Fielding's Tom Jones, related to someone of wealth and influence, tries tirelessly to play the matchmaker, filling Harriet's head with delusions of grandeur. Throughout the novel, Emma must face the chastisements of her landed neighbour, Mr. Knightley, the quiet support of Mrs. Weston (Taylor), and the temptations of a relationship of her own, while learning the limitations of her own understanding of the world in which she lives.As in most of Austen's novels, &quot;Emma&quot; focuses on the changing nature of the English economy, and how it trickles into even the most secluded of English towns, forcing a reckoning and acknowledgment of the shift in English society from primarily aristocratic hierarchy to the moneyed-middle classes. That Emma is a young woman indicates that the transition must happen immediately, with the present generation, which is difficult, especially from Emma's privileged, though not exactly aristocratic vantage point, to understand and accept. The intrusion on Emma's peace by such characters as the young, ambitious vicar of Highbury, Mr. Elton, the up and coming interests of the merchant Cox family, the industrious farmer, Robert Martin, and the incessant bombast of Miss Augusta Hawkins (and her associations with Bristol, epicenter of the British slave-trade) provide a range of perspectives on the possibilities of the rising and increasingly influential middle classes - and the impact they have, even in so small a village as Highbury. Austen asks us to read the microcosm as in some ways, importantly representative of the macrocosm of England.I think in all of these points of interest, at least to me, I've forgotten completely to say how deftly Austen presents these critical issues with such decided humour, grace of style, and flawless execution of plot and character development, as to make the most glaring philsophical and social issues seamlessly blend into the comic forefront of the novel! One finds it difficult not to laugh straight through the first three or four chapters altogether. Her characters, from the delightfully disturbing hypochondriac Mr. Woodhouse, to the initially unreadable Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax (who must foreshadow Jane Eyre), and the irrepressibly vociferous Miss Bates - are all well drawn and memorable. This review is getting really long and pretentious now, so I'll stop - go, start reading &quot;Emma&quot; this instant."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"The problem is that Jane Austen is so popular - her books are the only 200 year old novels to stay in the Amazon top 5000- that people come to her expecting easy reading. This is 200 year-old English and takes persistence and I get upset when readers are disappointed. It's about a young woman in an English village trying to make matches for all her friends and getting into trouble. Deaths and sex take place way off stage. Some critics complain that Jane Austen ignores them but she is sharply aware of them. When Mrs Churchill dies it's a joke (People's opinions of her improve because she proves her ailments were not imaginary) The death of Emma's mother takes half a sentence and she is replaced by &quot;an excellent woman as governess&quot;. Jane Fairfax's father is killed in action (presumably against Napoleon - or maybe the Americans) Harriet Smith is the daughter of a tradesman decent enough to support her but not married to her mother. Women have no careers open to them and totter on the edge of poverty unless they inherit money or marry. An old man with rheumatism has to apply for parish aid."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"&quot;And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me,&quot; said Emma, &quot;and a very considerable one--that I made the match myself. I made the match, you know, four years ago; and to have it take place, and be proved in the right, when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again, may comfort me for any thing.&quot;Mr. Knightley shook his head at her. Her father fondly replied, &quot;Ah! my dear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell things, for whatever you say always comes to pass. Pray do not make any more matches.&quot;&quot;I promise you to make none for myself, papa; but I must, indeed, for other people. It is the greatest amusement in the world!&quot; -Jane Austen, EmmaThe edition of Emma that I just finished has a lovely portrait of a young woman on the cover painted by Josef Stieler. So as a coworker walked by my desk she asked : Are you reading a chick book !?I quickly protested it was not a chick book--one has one's pride after all--but the cover and her question raise the question : why is it not a chick book ? Why are the novels of Jane Austen, dealing as they do with the machinations of English gentry of marriageable age and their convoluted courtships, so popular among all readers ? We well understand why she should have been a favorite of Henry James, but why did Winston Churchill continually reread her also ? These questions are directly related to another which plagues modern arguments over Jane Austen : do her novels have political ramifications ? The answers to all these questions are to be found in Emma, which is my favorite of her novels.At the outset let me admit that this only became clear to me when watching the terrific movie Clueless, which is based on this novel, but I now believe Emma to be one of the greatest political novels ever written. Austen predicted of Emma Woodhouse : &quot;I am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like.&quot; She was quite wrong; Emma is exactly the kind of misguided busybody with a heart of gold for whom, unfortunately, we have trouble nursing much dislike. The plot of the tale is presumably too well known to need much rehashing here : suffice it to say that Emma is a pleasant and well-intentioned young woman who fancies herself a matchmaker, having successfully joined her governess and Mr. Weston, and so proceeds to meddle in the romantic lives of those around her despite eschewing the idea of marriage for herself. In particular, she takes Harriet Smith, a pretty young girl of dubious social station, under her wing and tries finding her a husband. There follow the expected misunderstandings and hurt feelings before true love finally outs and Emma realizes that not only did she not know what was best for others, in fact she did not understand her own heart's desires.Now, at first blush that may not sound all that political, but the fundamental point Ms Austen conveys is actually not dissimilar to the argument of the great political philosopher F. A. Hayek in The Road to Serfdom (read Orrin's review). Hayek's devastating critique of the modern state and centrally controlled economies argued that no government bureaucrat could ever effectively make decisions for other people because it is impossible to process all of the information that goes into other people's decision-making. Only the free market, which allows for the greatest flow of information that humans have thus far devised, can even begin to approach the levels of efficiency that a complex economy requires to function smoothly. Likewise, Jane Austen, over a hundred years earlier, warned us of the unsatisfactory results to expect when one person sought to make decisions for others, even when acting with their best interests at heart. There will always be those among us, like Emma or like Hilary Clinton, who wish to manipulate our lives (always, we are assured, for our benefit rather than for the joy they take in the exercise), but the results are seldom salutary and never what the manipulators intended.The idea of poor Jane Austen having to hide her writing when a family member entered the room and confined to the novel of manners is nearly totemic to feminists. They decry the system of oppression which restrained her talents to insignificant topics and sentenced her to writing about romance. In reality, Austen, at least in Emma, demonstrates that simple human wisdom knows no bounds and is as likely to be found in a comedy of manners as in any scholarly journal. In its own way Emma is as stern a rebuke to centralization and authoritarianism as can be found in the Western Canon. That her books are wonderfully witty and evoke images of an inviting pastoral past is merely icing on the cake.GRADE : A+"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel. While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).Modern readers tend to be unfairly squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings. A lesser delight."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Lively, vivid rendition of my favourite Jane Austen novel. Prunella Scales interprets the characters with great individuality and spirit."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"EMMA is a joyful read, made even more entertaining through Prunella Scales's vocalization of several characters and through her interpretation of the text. Her complementary pace actually improves the listeners' appreciation of Austen's comedic plot. Austen's novels, a treasure any time, are given a fine aural performance by Ms. Scales."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma by Jane Austen is truly a very enjoyable novel dealing with the upper-middle class women of the Victorian Era, and it gives us an illuminating insight on the way of life of the people of that time. Emma is a comedy in the sense that the novel ends on a happy note with three marriages and also in the sense that it gives themes such as marriage an exaggerated importance. Also, the novel as a whole in conceived in a spirit of irony - irony in incidents and irony in characterisation. In the novel, Jane Austen depicts her view of people as social animals who live by a social code based on a set of moral values. Thus, in Emma, Jane Austen shows, in a good-natured way, the disastrous consequences caused by human follies and stupidities, leading to the violation of the social code.The very fact that Emma is looking for \`would-be' grooms for girls she takes a fancy to is undoubtedly a trespass of the social norms existing at that time - a clear example of a folly. Emma's other folly may be said to be her excessive pride. Her pride leads her to dominate, and to see the lives of others as extensions of her own ego, and therefore deny the other characters their human autonomy. Ironically, we see that she, who delights in using others, discovers that she, in turn, has been used, or more correctly, duped.Emma also deals with the follies of arrogance and self-deception. While reading the novel, we find Emma adopting what may be called a \`know-all' attitude. She is utterly self-important and presuming. She pays no heed to Mr. Knightley's advice either with regard to Mr. Elton or with regard to Frank Churchill. She thinks that she can successfully handle the affairs of others, and the high regard the Highbury society has for her only makes matters worse. Hence, through the character of Emma, Austen warns against the dangers of influence and interference. Emma, through her actions of meddling in everybody's affairs, finally achieves nothing good, and even causes harm to her own self.Also, Austen gives marriage such an undue importance that the title character, in her pursuit of husbands for others, overlooks social norms existing at that time and gives more value to marriage rather than crucial human relationships. Thus, in a comic way, Austen depicts Emma's greatest fault in breaking social norms and overlooking crucial human considerations in pursuit of petty things such as marriage.Comedy also emanates from the narrator's treatment of Mr. Woodhouse and Miss Bates as \\"comic characters\\". But through these characters, Austen explores another facet of human follies. Through the character of Mr. Woodhouse, we are brought to see the negative aspects of indulgence - indulgence of the same kind that has caused harm to Emma. And the character of Miss Bates, while depicting the pitiable state of unmarried women, acts as a kind of test for Emma's power of responding to \`socially inferior' people. Mrs. Elton is another comic character, amusing us greatly by her airs of self-importance and her social snobbery. She has too high an opinion of her own elegance, accomplishments, and social charm that she thrusts herself upon everybody without inhibition or hesitation. She also breaks the established social rules by calling Mr. Knightley \\"Knightley\\", not giving him his gentleman's worth. In fact, we may say that Mrs. Elton is used to portray the very evils of Emma's character in a somewhat extreme way.Hence, as we have seen, Austen deals in an intellectual way the follies and stupidities of humans. We learn particularly through our understanding of Emma's faults, and by learning above all, how significant and fundamental these values are. For Emma's aloof relation to others, her willingness to treat other characters as toys - these become significant betrayals of human considerations. The social and moral universe of the novel takes a greater significance because it provides a context in which Emma's faults are not minor ones to be treated lightly, but total violations of a whole established system. The agents of retribution in this world are Mr. Knightley and Austen herself as the narrator.Thus, Austen condemns certain human foolishness such as snobbery, excessive pride and a disrespect for established moral and social values. These are the human stupidities which are purged, through Emma's process of self-analysis and redemption. It is only at that time that Austen makes her heroine rise above such human foolishness and stupidities to become a more moral and less petty human being. Hence, it may be said that the novel persuades us, through a very entertaining and comic plot, the importance of self-knowledge, a true regard for self and others, and also to consider every human action as a crucial, committing act of self-definition."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Jane Austen said of Emma Woodhouse (in a letter) that she had written a novel with a heroine \\"whom no one would like but myself\\". Indeed the first sentence (another sterling first sentence by Austen. How does she do it?) paints a picture that is easily understood as a spoilt little rich girl:\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever and rich, with a comfortable house and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her.\\"At the same time we have to disagree with Miss Austen. Readers have fallen in love with Emma (both novel and heroine) since the novel was published, and with good reasonRonald Blythe states in his introduction to the 1966 Penguin Classics edition of \\"Emma\\" that it is \\"the climax of Jane Austen's genius and the Parthenon of fiction.\\" I do not dispute it for a second. This novel is my favourite work from my favourite author.The book has a plot so timeless than even translating it to modern day Hollywood and casting Alicia Silverstone in the lead still gets you a hit movie, Clueless. OK, it's obvious from the first chapter who is destined to marry Emma but our dashing hero, Mr Knightley, is still the only person who ever criticises Emma, indeed he spends a large part of his time in the novel telling either Emma or her friends about her flaws.Austen wrote to her niece Anna (writing a novel at the time) that \\"Three or four families in a country village is the very thing to work on\\" and stayed close to this for most of her own works. Yet at the same time, in a letter to her brother Edward (another incipient novelist) she played down her concerns as \\"the little bit (two inches wide) of ivory on which I work with so fine a brush, as to produce little effect, after much labour.\\" 'Emma' is certainly the novel on the smallest piece of ivory with the finest brush, yet it pokes as much fun and wields as savage a knife on the social conventions of Austen's England as any other novelist of the time.Austen was capable of writing novels with genuine popular appeal at the same time as she flouted the conventions of fiction. 'Emma' is a marvellous example, an easily read, enjoyable novel with a heroine who is in charge of her own destiny and who marries for no other reason than she loves a good, strong man.Everyone deserves to read a novel this good. Just because teenage girls will adore this novel and swoon over Mr Knightley doesn't mean the rest of us should be stopped from this marvellous read. I enjoy Austen immensely and this is my favourite. I probably read it once or twice a year.When you come to choosing the edition I once again find myself recommending the Penguin Classics edition for its Introduction. This time it is Fiona Stafford who does such a good job (though I think the '66 edition Introduction by Ronald Blythe was a fraction better.)"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"The present novel is about the young women, Emma Woodhouse, who lives a pampered life with her father in Sussex. The family is well off financially and one of the wealthiest in Hartfield, part of Highbury. Her mother has passed away and her sister has married and left the home. Emma's governess, who is her best friend as well, has gone leaving Emma alone with her father. The story revolves around Emma's social life in the town and the development of Emma as a person. Beyond knowing those facts, you should not read any more about the plot until you read the novel, or you will risk spoiling the read. I will not give away the plot, but will only describe the writing style and structure.I read Austen's \\"Mansfield Park,\\" then read some analysis by Nabokov from his Cornell \\"Lectures on Literature\\" and the comments of Jane Stabler from the introduction of the Oxford version. After that I got a bit excited and read Austen's early writing \\"Sense and Sensibility,\\" along with the analysis by Margaret Doody in the Oxford version. Yes, I guess I am now an Austen fan, and it is a pity that she did not live longer. \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" was my third Austen novel and so far the most fun to read.Based on the four novels written over two different time periods, it is clear that she developed a certain fixed writing style and a common structure. She uses the early pages to introduce the families, and other characters, and give start the story. She moves characters around from place to place in part for time shifting. She does a wrap up in the last few chapters.Those opening chapters are an obstacle for most readers. She uses her own vocabulary and has an unusual way of structuring her prose. That structure is a trademark of Austen's writing. Also, she manages to work in a lot of drama and social issues with some humour and irony.From what Nabokov and others are saying, she got her inspiration from Sheridan, Richardson, Henry Fielding, Sir Walter Scott, and the poetry of Cowper. She modulates the complexity of the prose to reflect the characters - such as making the sentences of Sir Thomas Bertram in \\"Mansfield Park\\" somewhat elaborate instead of describing how the character is dressed or a similar description to convey qualities and traits, i.e.: she uses the complexity of speech to convey character. Also, she uses lateral shifts and epigrammatic notations and similar literary techniques. These techniques are interesting for some readers but just confusing for others. It is all part of the price of admission to entering the world of Jane Austen, and it is part of the fun in reading her novels.Overall, once you get past reading and digesting 50 pages or so and have absorbed the Jane Austen vocabulary (words such as felicity, remonstrance, countenance, etc.) and understand the structure of her prose, the book becomes a compelling read. The second Austen novel seems much easier than the first.This was written by a mature Jane Austen and by way of comparison, it is an interesting read but less complicated than \\"Mansfield Park.\\" It not as interesting nor as witty as \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\" The read is slow and a bit diffuse since there is no clear set of protagonists other than Emma, her brother-in-law, her reserved father and a few other residents of the town. The novel wanders for 350 pages, then comes together strongly at the end. Overall, it is a delightful and a pleasant read."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"There is absolutely nothing wrong with this book at all. It is a very good read, in a very standard binding. You get a good introduction to it and some nice notes which are helpful.This is set in contemporary times to Austen, and was the heroine which Austen least liked. Emma Woodhouse is young, rich and single. She lives a life of wealth and privilege in a small village just outside of London. In her world, and in her village she is queen. However there are flaws in her character which will be tested.Austen liked to write about small things, about daily life, and the petty things which people in small communities become obsessed with. And so into Emma's life come the scatter-brained Harriet Smith the daughter of \\"someone\\" who cobbles together what learning she might at a local ladies academy. Emma adopts her and tries to help her make her way in the world by finding her a good match.Emma's fine world is disrupted when first Mr Elton moves to the village, and then marries a rather smart but upstart woman who wishes to manage everyone's life.Austen's skill in reflecting Emma and her machinations for good, against Mrs Elton and her machinations for her own good are gloriously done.Emma is a brilliant novel and its themes are universal and timeless, it is all about the things in life which never change - love, pride, marriage, status and money.Don't watch dreadful movie adaptations of this book (like the one Gwyneth Paltrow did) the book is much sharper, wittier and subtler. It is greatly enjoyable reading. The introduction may (or may not) help you to greater understanding of her ability to write with a light, sharp pen. Hopefully the story will stand out for its brilliance."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"i had to read this for my english sophmore highschool class and while most of my peers *hated* this book, i found this book very intriguing and esp. realistic to even today in highschool. the subjects of vanity, friendship, honesty, control, reality, self-desire, relationships, status, and maturity is all incorporated in this book and deeply and straight-forwardly depicts the life of any teenager in any century then or now. Emma struggles to understand her intentions and learns what her mistakes were all about and the reader sees her mature through experiences and constantly learning and realizing her mistakes and flaws and misconceptions. though it was a long story and had a lot of old-language narration, i have to say, Emma is part of the epitome of what ever teenager goes through, female and male. while this is mostly a chick book, guys can find themselves related to the situations that Emma deals with with the other men in the book. i highly recommend this book for people who have patience and are open to the ideals of aristocracy back then. it's amusing, witty, and shocking. really great book."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I'm in the fellowship of the \\"unashamed.\\" That is, I'm a whole-hearted MALE fan of all things Austen. It all began when I found my daughter's dusty college copy of Emma from our library because I was bored and could not find anything else to read. After struggling through the first 100 pages and trying to make sense of Miss Austen's enormous character list, I was hooked. What hooked me? First and formost was the very intertwined plot, much like a romantic \\"whodunit\\" or \\"who's gonna do it\\" mystery. The plot thickens with subtle clues as to who loves whom and the comedy surrounding the heroine's naive' and fumbling attempts to become a matchmaker to anyone in her circle that is marriage material. Never in my life have I read such succulent and appropriate dialogue. I was so enthralled I literally roared through the book to find out what was going to happen next. A second reading is mandatory for the first-timer because part of Miss Austen's genius is that a more deliberate reading mines the depths for the clues that lie beneath the surface of the story. Like the tip of an iceberg, the reader can storm through the book and enjoy it thoroughly; then do a re-read and luxuriate on how much richness and delicate detail lie below the surface. I was so caught up that I found myself talking to the characters alternately encouraging them and warning them on what they were scheming. The heroine Emma is one of the most charming, yet frustrating heroines in all of English literature. Give it a \\"go\\" as the English would say!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma Woodhouse is an atypical heroine for a Jane Austen novel. Usually, we see disadvantaged girls struggle to find happiness through marriage. In Emma's case, we see a girl who has everything in the world she could want. She is rich, pretty, and happy. She has no desire to be married, as it would interfere with the simple life she enjoys with her father and she knows it would break his heart to be parted from her. The story follows Emma's life beginning at 21 as she tries to help a young girl named Harriet Smith marry above her station. Emma also engages in a flirtation with a young man and generally makes a bit of a mess of things whenever she gets involved.I have read that Jane Austen felt that Emma was a character only her creator could like. I would have to disagree with that. Emma is certainly flawed, but her heart is almost always in the right place. Pride has blinded her to her own limitations but she is also one who does not shrink from the responsibility of her mistakes and tries very hard to learn from them. I found this admirable and grew to like her more and more as the book progressed.Aside from Emma, the rest of the cast was also very well written. Her father is a complete hypochondriac and often engages in behavior that would typically be considered highly rude. Yet, he is motivated so completely by a desire to be kind to others that his misguided application of that desire only endears him to the reader. Mr. Knightley, the no-nonsense friend of the family is admittedly not the most complex character in the world, but he is a very good one and his solidity is a great counterbalance to Emma's wishful thinking.In summary, Emma is a nice change of pace from Jane Austen's other novels. It starts off well and grows more engaging as it continues. The characters are interesting and Emma herself grows considerably during the course of the novel."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Jane Austin captures the styles and manners of the period so well. I find her works very interesting and informative."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Some might think I'd be ashamed, giving to this celebrated Jane Austen novel a mere 4 stars. But with the greatest, the classic authors, I use a special yardstick, awarding the ultimate prize only to their absolute must-read works.Indeed I do think EMMA is done with more elegance of finish than PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. But it cannot match that 5-star work for drama and characterization. Looking back on EMMA, is there very much to the story that really stands out? Rather, isn't it the writing that's the star? Doesn't the craftsmanship, and particularly Jane Austen's gift for managing the flow of narrative, stand out even above the narrative itself?! Very odd.The story is essentially that of Emma Woodhouse's miscalculations regarding everybody and everything -- and, I guess, how in the end these do not matter anyway. The one big dramatic turn in the book is where young Mr. [withheld] is revealed to be engaged to Miss [withheld]. It's a testament to Austen's creativity that this revelation has the cataclysmic effect it does on the reader. Thus does she make a great big universe out of her tiny local ecosystem in which people are wholly absorbed in discussing and planning and brooding over other people's relationships -- that little world in which matrimony is the ultimate destiny.Only one character comes back to me as having been memorably etched, and that's Mrs. Bates, mother of Miss Bates. Her train of conversational irrelevancies is comically rendered in some of the longest and best speeches in the book, giving quite a realistic effect that, incidentally, doesn't advance the story in any way I can tell and therefore subtracts just a bit from the marvelous consistency of the whole. Of course Emma too is someone we can look back on and remember after we're finished reading the book, but that's a little different because we're always seeing her from within, hers being the central intelligence of the story.Striking passages abound throughout the novel. One can make a fun exercise out of just savoring the narrative effect of her chapter openings. Here are two of them, picked totally at random. Chapter 33's: \\"Emma was not required, by any subsequent discovery, to retract her ill opinion of Mrs. Elton.\\" Or Chapter 38's: \\"No misfortune occurred, again to prevent the ball.\\"But suddenly now I must take something back. I almost omitted mention of what is actually the biggest dramatic turn in the book, and one which provides its very crux, \\"It darted through her, with the speed of an arrow, that Mr. [withheld] must marry no one but herself!\\" That does indeed come as a shock! So yes, now that I think of it, EMMA contains somewhat more of dramatic highlighting than my above reflections would suggest. And definitely, the more I page through the book at this moment, reviewing my red underlinings in it, the more I get drawn back into Jane Austen's world of exquisite prose."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I am a huge Jane Austin fan and was not disappointed with Emma.

I don't know any woman who is completely innocent of vanity, so it's refreshing to find a character, like Emma, who is drawn out for us in all of her &quot;princess syndrome&quot; glory. The &quot;good&quot; Austen characters, like Jane Bennett or Fanny Price, often leave me with a false feeling that I can't relate to. Emma Woodhouse's story intrigues and envelops me.

The most important thing about love and relationships, however, is that no one can control who a person does and does not love. It's entertaining to follow Emma Woodhouse as she tries to play matchmaker, thinking that she knows best, and in the end she even surprises herself. You could update the time period and everything is still completely applicable in today's world.Aside from the story, I should also like to note that the formatting of this story is fantastic on the Kindle, unlike some of the other Austen novels I'm reading (Pride & Prejudice's formatting is not as smooth)."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"\\"Handsome, clever and rich\\" is how Emma is introduced to us, and a happy, carefree existence she leads, with very little to worry her other than idle gossip. The youngest of two sisters, Emma lives alone with her father, doting on him, after her sister Isabella marries. Their mother is long deceased, and Emma has grown up with a kindly governess, Miss Taylor, who bestows strong motherly affection on her.Set in 18th century rural England, the novel affords us a picturesque, detailed view of the daily tenets of English life at the time, complete with carriages, gowns, housekeepers and social traditions. Austen weaves a delicious web of Emma's life and that of her friends in Highbury, where they live. Mr. Woodhouse, Emma's father, is a gentle, kind man with an excessively considerate compassion to others that often borders on paranoia. He is constantly afraid of catching cold, or falling ill, and lectures those around him incessantly on the need for precaution. We learn of Mr. Knightley, a long-time, close neighbor of the family, whose brother is married to Isabella, and of the Westons, Bates, and Perrys, all families of the area, as they intermingle in Emma's world.Harriet, a girl of less social advantage, is taken by Emma under her wing. Emma's favorite hobby is matchmaking, and we watch her make one blunder after the next to poor Harriet. When Robert Martin, a young farmer, proposes to her friend, Emma retaliates very sharply, advising Harriet against marrying him and \\"falling into lower circumstance.\\" Harriet is miserable, but appears to be convinced. Mr. Knightley, ever present in Emma's life and home, scolds her sharply for her interference, but Emma stands her ground defiantly, insisting that she knows what is best for Harriet.When a Mr. Elton appears on the scene, pouring lavish attentions onto them, Emma is convinced of his being far superior to Mr. Martin, and does all in her power to coax Harriet into returning his feelings. All the while, she is smugly telling Mr. Knightley that she predicts a far better outcome for her friend than his preference of Mr. Martin. Harriet becomes attached to Mr. Elton, and all is going to plan, when Emma receives a tumultuous shock: Mr. Elton asks for her own hand in marriage. Emma, horrified, asks him about his feelings for Harriet, but he denies vehemently, saying that all his advances were meant towards Emma! Our heroine then sinks into utter guilt and mortification, watching Harriet's heart break due to her own wheedling and landing her in this mess.Mr. Elton wastes no time; he soon marries another rich woman, obviously keen to secure a fortune. Meanwhile, Emma's attention is caught by Mr. Frank Churchill, a recent arrival to Highbury, but she comfortably assures herself of her immunity to love and marriage. She flirts with him, but does not entertain any serious ideas towards him--only to find herself duped, again, when his secret engagement to her neighbor is revealed.Overwhelmed by all her blunders, Emma is feeling a great deal of confusion and remorse, but there is a final blow that she is unprepared for. Out of the blue, Harriet shares her new feelings for Mr. Knightley with her, and her hope that these feelings may be returned.Emma's world crashes at that moment. She panics and feels extremely agitated, which suddenly leads her to realize her own love for Mr. Knightley, a love unknown and unacknowledged by her. As she stares into herself, she reflects on his constant presence in her life, her attachment to him, her extreme care for his opinion. The thought of losing him is too painful to bear, and Emma, for the first time in the story, is plunged into total misery. But the tables turn yet again. As she awaits his breaking the news to her, of his attachment to Harriet, Mr. Knightley comes forth with a powerful declaration of love for Emma, a love he has had for years. In a very touching scene that causes the reader's heart to soar, Mr. Knightley, normally not a man of many words, pours his feelings to Emma in anguish. He asks her to marry him, with a pained conviction that he will be refused. Emma is overjoyed, assures his troubles away, accepts without a second thought.Amidst her shock, and just as she is dealing with the conflicting emotions of her own extreme happiness, and great mortification for Harriet, Mr. Knightley saves the day by encouraging Mr. Martin to approach Harriet again. The girl's feelings for him, which had never ceased, finally prevail, and the couple are united.Despite her haughty airs and egotism, Emma is \\"faultless despite all her faults\\" in the eyes of Mr. Knightley, and we can't help liking her, too, for she is always trying to do good, and her heart is in the right place. Mr. Knightley himself, kind, generous, sincere and honorable--a close reminder of Mr. Darcy--wins us over, and we breathlessly wait for things to work out between him and Emma. The author, with a remarkable talent for making us hold our breath, turning the tables and providing unexpected turns, concludes the book with happy endings for all, leaving us smiling.Austen's language, two centuries ago, is as delicious as the novel itself, the quaint writing taking us on a foray into older English and its idioms, structures and expressions. One of my favorite novels, Emma is a delight to read, from start to finish, and a story that captivates the imagination right until the last page."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Written in a very different dialogue, sometimes hard to understand what she means the way she express's her thoughts and feelings. I would call it very old English setting"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I finally finished Emma after months (yes you heard me right) of reading. I lked this book but I didn't adore it.I think the characters were well done. My favorites were Mr. Woodhouse and his germaphobic ways...as well as his distaste in people getting married and leaving their cozy little lives. I also liked Harriet Smith because she had a simple and almost innocent way about her...the way she blindly followed Emma and molded the desires of her heart according to Emma's approval. I felt a connect to Harriet in that way...especially thinking back to high school...the popular girls trying to get you to think a certain way and telling you would make a good boyfriend.Emma Woodhouse is a likeable character. She is a matchmaker who gives up on the hobby due to her matches never fall for each other and drama is the result. The secound half of the book is about Emma finding out her own heart.The reason I only gave two stars was because to me this was an okay read. I saw some of the new movie and the theme interested me...so because it was free on my Kindle and because I wanted to try a sophisticated and chic lit type read...I read it.If you can keep up with drama and who likes who...and if you enjoy a well written novel with a long letter thrown in for the juicy details you crave...than leave the gossip behind and stick your nose into one of Austen's lesser known novels. As for me I prefer Dickens and anything with a bit more action."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I bought this book to be a decoration on my shelf. I loved the picture and the book looked just like it. Love it."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I truly do love all things Jane Austen. And that includes Emma. However, I reviewed this book as a 4 star simply because it lacks the strong story that other books from Ms. Austen display.Emma is a bit scheming and conniving and the story actually is more about events that just happen because of her medling ways. When I reviewed Pride and Prejudice I wrote how I loved the language - and this is no different. The word structure is exquisite. If it wasn't for the fact that I find Emma sometimes a bit too nosey I would love this book."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Ordered for my kindle and it is an awesome book to have.

As a teacher, I would love to offer a course in Jane Austen in general; in the current educational environment, I doubt that will happen. If I were allowed to do so, I would have students compare this novel with Pride and Prejudice simply because I think the papers would be interesting to read. The book is written in typical Austen style, the characters are endearing, and the situations are frequently funny - all in all a good read."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"'Emma' is the first Jane Austen novel I've read in 20 years. My earlier experiences (with 'Pride and Prejudice' and 'Sense and Sensibility') were disappointing; they seemed to be overly genteel and without substance. Was 'Emma' any different? Er,.. no.The first thing that grabs you about 'Emma' is that it reads like a play. It is almost all dialogue. No action, no flowing descriptions of the early 1800s England country ... just talk. This makes for a very tiresome read.Worse, the story (about a sweet young thing who busily plays matchmaker without any consideration of her 'victims' or her own love life) is rather [bad]. Any dramatic moments are very tame. Emma's high society world is so devoid of emotion it is any wonder they bother living at all. And in Emma's world there are no bad guys, no poverty, ... and no one seems to work for a living. Think 'Ozzie & Harriet' transported back 150 years and plopped into rural England and you've got the idea.So why bother with 'Emma'? Purely out of respect for the author, and her legacy as one of the founding female writers of modern English literature. She attempts, although not very successfully, in writing on matters other than soap operatic tosh (\\"gothic novels\\") her female peers did during that time. True, other woman writers have since greatly eclipsed anything Jane Austen has done. But she was the pioneer. So please give at least one of her novels a try."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Some of my friends like Jane Austen, but I really don't understand why. I know she's an important part of literary history because she was the first writer to use third-person narration instead of writing novels in the form of letters or diary entries, but an innovative form does not make up for bad content. I don't think I dislike it because of the time period - I like Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre. I don't think I dislike it because of the everyday activities of the characters - I like L. M. Montgomery, James Herriot, and Ray Bradbury's Dandelion Wine. It's just boring. Emma is a whiny rich girl whose problems are on the same level as Miley Cyrus getting the wrong car for her sixteenth birthday.Emma is the only JA book I have made it all the way through. I had to read this book for a high school Lit class, otherwise I wouldn't have finished it. I have seen at least one movie for all of her books, though, so I know none of them are my cup of tea. Pride and Prejudice is the least aggravating. Mr. Collins, Lady Catherine, and Lydia are sort of funny I guess, but not much. The part where Lydia elopes is okay, because it is the only time in her entire career that JA makes her characters show any strong emotion. And Mr. Darcy is kind of hot in the six-hour movie, but so what.Maybe I would have liked Jane Austen if I had been introduced to her when I was thirteen. There's nothing in Emma that pisses off the moral guardians, but at least sex and violence can be entertaining when they aren't too gratuitous, whereas shallowness and materialism ... are ... just ... boring. JA's heroines don't seem to think about anything other than finding rich husbands and wearing fancy dresses to the local ball.In the words of Charlotte Bronte, \\"Anything like warmth or enthusiasm, anything energetic, poignant, heartfelt, is utterly out of place in commending these works: all such demonstrations the authoress would have met with a well-bred sneer ... ruffles her reader by nothing vehement, disturbs him with nothing profound ... Jane Austen was a complete and most sensible lady, but a very incomplete and rather insensible (not senseless woman).\\""},{"Title":"Emma","review":"...However not nearly as bad as _Sense and Sensibility_. The characters seem a little less sterotypical here, and while _S and S_ was harshly critical of the snobbery of the upper class the main heroine in _Emma_ is herself one of these people, which makes it interesting. She is a busy- body who meddles in the affairs of others and thinks she alone can judge the motives of everyone else with exactness. Although she is very proud, she is not overbearing or mean (except to those she snubs) and we like her.The plot doesn't hold much to it, though. It is filled with what has become typical plot devices of the romance novel-- the comedic misunderstandings between people as they miss each others meanings completely, as well as the \\"knowing/not-knowing\\" and the \\"does she love me/love me not\\" devices which are utterly over-used and stale to most contemporary readers. Perhaps these were fresh in Austen's day. That to one side, even the plot itself was too simplistic and much too easy to see through. These shortcomings combine to leave the reader with a sense of tedium. It does not \\"work\\" today, classic or not."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"IS THIS BOOK&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;CONSIDERED an......AR rated book.??..."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I appreciated the service I received.

For one it takes forever to get to the point. Plus how could we possibly like Emma. She is so self centered and ignorant. The only two times in which she can somewhat appeal to us is when she crys and in comparison to Mrs. Elton. This is a mockery of upper class life of the 19th century and Jane Austen, to my knowledge, lived a somewhat isolated life. How could she write a book on a topic which she doesn't know about. This further mocks the upper class leaving the point of this book as being entertainment. Why put us through 500 pages of pain. I think Jane Austen was right when she said &quot; no one but myself will much like [Emma].&quot;"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"If you like a tale that's as pretentious and stuffy as a yacht club meeting then this book is right for you."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma Is a bad book, fact. The only thing that gives it any value is the quality of the writing. The book is unbelievably drawn out. I fell asleep many times whilst trying to finish this book.

Anybody who likes this book is very sad because it is just the unremarkable section of some unremarkable people's lives. As a result your life would have to be extremely tedious and boring for you to enjoy this waste of good paper."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"This book is extremely shallow, it has no depth or metaphorical intensity. It is basically a chick flick with big words which often make no sense. It should be classed as trashy light romance, not as classic literature. It is not a comment on society, merely a glimpse of the life of one extremely conceited and shallow woman, Emma Gayhouse. DO NOT BUY"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"From the first sentence painfully spelling out Emma's character, this book has many problems. The characterizations are awkward, the plot contrived, and the prose is so roughly handled it makes a reader queasy. Pride and Prejudice at least had a little humor in it, but &quot;Emma&quot; has no redeeming qualities. I don't recommend spending your time on this one."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"the first chapter is a model of precision. in only nine pages, a handful of characters are introduced with masterful clarity. subtle dialouge paints a portrait of each character with a depth that many novelists never achieve over the course of hundreds of pages. jane austen's supreme talent is shining bright. then what happens? it goes on and on and on. and i got severely bored. i did not care about emma's social schemes, her obssession with ones rank within society. she is simply a dull character. and the language ultimately grows tiresome. the purple prose weighed heavy on my poor brain after a hundred pages. a bit beyond page 220 i jumped ship. i simply could not finish this dull thing. sorry."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Reading this novel was slow going. As a guy, I found the lack of action stultifying, and the flashes of humor were too quaint for me to derive any pleasure from them. The answer to the book's primary riddle--who shall Emma marry?--becomes obvious early on, and everything else is just a tedious pairing off until that riddle is expressly answered. There's a bit of local and historical color, but rarely does the narrative rise above the description of, say, a summer outing. Not one of Jane Austen's best."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"The first 2 Jane Austen books I read were Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility. Both I considered excellent books, Pride and Prejudice being my favorite. I had high hopes of Emma, considering it had been made into the modern movie &quot;Clueless&quot;. However, I have found this book very tiresome and it took me a long time to trudge my way through it. It may be the fact that I didn't like the main character as I had in the other books, but this book really went by slowly. It wasn't that bad of a story and really deserves 2 1/2 stars instead of the given 2 stars, but thats not an option. I would still recommend people to read the book for the good plot behind slow movement and seeing this prideful heroine transformed into a more likeable person."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Endowed with wealth, brains, and good looks, Emma Woodhouse (twenty-years old) busies herself with other peoples' lives as she --thinking herself worldly and clever-- goes about scheming and conjuring up romantic liaisons.But it will turn out that she's neither worldly nor clever, but nave! And that in the end the only love match that really matters is her own. Dialogue supplies an immediate image of Emma. In reply to Mrs. Weston's question: \\"She is loveliness itself. Mr. Knightley, is not she?\\" Mr. Knightley responds: \\"I have not a fault to find with her person,\\" he replied. \\"I think her all you describe. I love to look at her; and I will add this praise, that I do not think her personally vain. Considering how handsome she is, she appears to be little occupied with it; her vanity lies another way.\\"From the very beginning we can see that neither beauty nor vanity seem to be the theme of the story but--meddling. When Emma's governess-companion marries and leaves the Woodhouse household, Emma finds herself on her own; that is without a female voice of wisdom. Soon, she befriends a 17-years old illegitimate girl named Harriet, taking upon herself the duties of a matchmaker.Though Harriet is a sweet girl, she isn't so well-read or bright. Emma has her own opinion of her: She had always wanted to do everything, and had made more progress, both in drawing and music, than many might have done with so little labour as she would ever submit to. She played and sang -- and drew in almost every style; but steadiness had always been wanting.Next, Emma prevents Harriet from marrying farmer Robert Martin, who though decent, Emma thinks he's \`beneath' her. The novel depicts the British social system of hierarchies and inequalities, where titles of nobility and the landed gentry are the regents of the majority of the population. Intrigues, conspiracies, and much cleverness fill Emma's head as she cooks up schemes upon schemes to guide the docile Harriet.For this Emma proclaims her maxim: \\"I lay it down as a general rule, Harriet, that if a woman doubts as to whether she should accept a man or not, she certainly ought to refuse him. If she can hesitate as to \\"Yes,\\" she ought to say \\"No\\" directly.'\\" Having formed an opinion of Emma, at this point, readers can see how misguided she is. Emma's father is a feeble old man given to whining and wishing everyone to see the world as he himself sees it.Although he's a benign character, he proves incapable of giving sound counseling to his daughter. So father and daughter agree, \\"That is the case with us all, papa. One half of the world cannot understand the pleasures of the other.\\" To all of Emma's interventions, Mr. Knightley --a man of reason, common sense, and much nobility of heart-- disapproves, and once in a while warns Emma of her meddling. When Emma goes beyond her childish trickery and insults the town's spinster, Miss Bates, Mr. Knightley reprimands Emma, causing her to realize that she had turned into a selfish and careless brat. Much self-knowledge will come to Emma from this episode.The mysterious characters Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax add much thickness to the plot, which in some parts reads like a detective novel. The interaction between Emma and Frank and Jane helps Emma grow up and find a spiritual center.When Harriet tells her that she is in love with a man of a higher social standing and that he is being corresponded, Emma believes that man to be Mr. Knightley! Expecting to be told that Knightley will confirm his love for Harriet, she's awakened fully to the pangs of love when he --instead-- declares his love for her.And all is well that ends well: Harriet marries Mr. Martin and Emma Mr. Knightley.Although I admire Jane Austen's novels, I cannot help but to cringe at the British caste system that she describes. Titles of nobility, hierarchies, landed gentry, inequality, advantages over the common people, and so forth are all in my view detestable.The founding fathers of the United States of America wrote in the Constitution: The constitution of the United States provides that no state shall \\"grant any title of nobility; and no person can become a citizen of the United States until he has renounced all titles of nobility.\\" So, let's keep it that way."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Matchmaker, Matchmaker,Make me a match,Find me a find,Catch me a catch,Night after night in the dark I'm aloneSo find me a match,Of my own.- Fiddler on the RoofIn this romance, all the married characters are perfectly matched: Mr. and Mrs. Weston, John and Isabella Knightley, the reverend and his wife, and the list goes on. No wonder there is a friendly cupid in the village: Emma Woodhouse. This story explores the different aspects of love.Harriet Smith is Emma's friend. Miss Smith falls in love with three men in one year; quite a record even for Highbury. Hardly a flirt, Harriet Smith's heart is pure and indestructible. Bad advice makes her ditch Robert Martin, but a chance encounter reveals that her feelings for him are unchanged. \\"Unconditional\\" is the best word for this kind of love.Mr. Knightley's love is unrequited. For years he's been longing for a woman out of reach. And Emma does not even know she is in love. She only finds out when Harriet lays claim to the one man her heart desires.And the case of Mr. Woodhouse reveals a bizarre and unhealthy obsession. He refuses to believe his family and servants can ever find happiness away from Hartfield. But this actually reveals his own dependent form of love. When Emma marries he won't let her leave the house, so unfortunately her husband has to move in till Mr. Woodhouse dies.But it is not a tale of love unless the green-eyed-monster makes an appearance. Emma's jealousy is the most obvious. Jane plays the piano better than she does. Jane does almost everything better than Emma. It is no wonder that Highbury's most eligible bachelor is enraptured by this pale beauty. Needless to say, Jane Fairfax is an infrequent visitor at Hartfield.Miss Fairfax in turn discovers her jealousy of Emma at Box Hill, when Emma flirts loudly with a man who unbeknownst to her, is Jane's secret lover. Jane decides to break all ties with Emma. This might have been the best plan, because until matters turn right, sickness makes Jane paler than ever which may frighten visitors.But perhaps the worst culprit is Mr. Knightley whose disparaging remarks concerning Frank Churchill at first seem to be the wise counsel of a man of the world. Frank found true love as a young man while Mr. Knightley is fast approaching middle age unable or unwilling to find someone to marry. His constant criticism of Frank ends abruptly when he finds a woman willing to marry him.Highbury's cupid is in some ways similar to Jane Austen. They both are strong independent women who believe that marriage with the right person can create happiness. This is a light read. For the most part, Austen avoids physical description in favor of dialogue. It is amazing how depth of character can be portrayed this way. Jane Austen's ability to make fiction appear real is a rare talent."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I'm so sorry, but I simply fail to see what's so wonderful about Jane Austen.

The use of some of Austen's words and phrases from 19th century England (around 200 years ago) may make it somewhat incomprehensible for many readers, though. Since this book is focused more on characters than on the plot, and Jane Austen's own style is very elaborate, it tends to drag on with detailed descriptions of people and events. This can get very tiresome and tedious. So, if you're going to read Emma, you may need to save quite a bit of time because it might be necessary to read some parts a few times to understand them. Because Emma is such an old tale, there has been a movie made of it to make it easier to understand. Of course, it is not as detailed as the book, so the movie can not replace it. The movie Clueless, a modernized version, could also help decode some of the tough parts; just remember, watching it doesn't replace reading it; as characters were added, and names changed. Also, if you are looking for ways to create more effective characters in a story you may be writing, this would be a good story to find examples in. There are many characters who have very distinct and individual personalities in Emma. In this way, it relates to another of Jane Austen's novels, Pride and Prejudice. Emma is a long book with many creative characters, settings and plot twists. If you've read any of Jane Austen's other books, you're sure to enjoy this splendid novel."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"the first chapter is a model of precision. in only nine pages, a handful of characters are introduced with masterful clarity. subtle dialouge paints a portrait of each character with a depth that many novelists never achieve over the course of hundreds of pages. jane austen's supreme talent is shining bright. then what happens? it goes on and on and on. and i got severely bored. i did not care about emma's social schemes, her obssession with ones rank within society. she is simply a dull character. and the language ultimately grows tiresome. the purple prose weighed heavy on my poor brain after a hundred pages. a bit beyond page 220 i jumped ship. i simply could not finish the book. sorry."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"The book has been around since the 1700's and is still loved. What else is there to say?"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I love P&P, S&S and Mansfield Park, but I just did not care for Emma--primarily because of the title character. I'm not going to elaborate, b/c it is a Jane Austen and worth a read if only for that alone. Please read it and others and develop your own opinions on them."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I bought them (all the Barnes & Noble Classics) to complete my Jane Austen's collection, and honestly, didn't like the paper quality, it seems like they didn't even care for the presentation of them; it didn't look elegant, cheap to be more specific."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"yokay,So I know my thingy above this says J.Bond (James Bond) , but belive it or not you're probably are goin' with the not- my name is actually Emma!!!!

O.K. you got me don't tell anyone else I didn't read it."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"This old book sparked a lively discussion at my book club this month. Although the old English was a little difficult to wade through, we decided that we are really glad that times have changed and that finding a husband should not be a woman's total goal in life, and finding someone else a husband should be totally off limits."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"It appears to be full of errors, blank pages and missing text. I tried deleting the file and reloading it, but it didn't fix the problem. Is there something wrong with my Kindle or your books?"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Please don't misunderstand me: I love Jane Austen's Emma. I love everything by Jane Austen. What I don't love about this edition of the book is the introduction. Margaret Drabble obviously doen't care for the book, especially the heroine Emma Woodhouse. I have no idea why they would publish such an unfavorable introduction with the novel. Also, if you read the intro but have never read the novel, you're getting the entire plot line, which is only good if you're still in and writting a book report.But, if you're just looking for a cheap copy of Emma, then by all means, buy this version. Just please don't dampen the wonderful experience of reading Jane Austen by reading the horrible introduction."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Honestly, if I had not read Pride &amp; Prejudice first, I would have thought that I did not like Jane Austen's writing style. Emma is extremely slow to begin with though it picks up about half way through. The story centers on Emma Woodhouse, the unmarried daughter of a man obsessed with ailments to be potentially caught from drafts, rich foods and just about anything that is part of ordinary life. Consequently he does not go out (as a rule) and depends on Emma substantially for companionship and general well being. Despite his eccentricities, he is well loved by the community and is a very genial character. Emma, resolved not to marry, takes up matchmaking after her governess, Miss Taylor, marries friend and neighbor, Mr. Weston and Emma feels that she had contributed to making the happy union come about. Against the advice of family friend and mentor, Mr. Knightly, she \\"takes under her wing\\" a young girl at the local school to groom and bring out into good society in hopes of finding her a husband - specifically Mr. Elton of the vicarage. Despite her unknown parentage and lack of good expectations, Emma convinces the girl, Harriet Smith, to aim high in her expectations of a husband and to reject the advances of those of her natural social set in preference for a gentleman.This goes on for so long that I was convinced that this was going to be the whole of the book. Joyfully, though, the Mr. Elton angle blows up catastrophically and simultaneously several more interesting characters are introduced. The icily reserved Jane Fairfax comes to visit her grandmother and aunt before hiring out as a governess. Though she had been taken in by the Campbells and raised very genteelly along side their own daughter, she has no fortune of her own. The same age as Emma, they are expected to be fast friends but Emma's resentments of Jane's superior abilities and deportment do not bode well for this. Then Mr. Weston's son, Frank Churchill, who was raised by his aunt and uncle after his mother's death, comes to meet his new stepmother and makes a splash in Highbury society. Mrs. Weston has designs for Emma and Frank. Emma meanwhile has designs for Harriet and Frank. No one can figure out Jane's designs though Emma suspects improper attachments between her and her benefactor's daughter's new husband. Mr. Elton then brings in a new wife whose forceful manner and arrogant air threaten to turn everything upside down against Emma when Mrs. Elton tries to force a relationship as Jane's benefactress. Similarities between Emma's presumptions with Harriet and Mrs. Elton's presumptuous behavior with Jane are unavoidable and provide a relatively subtle irony.In this last half as the intrigues play out, the story takes on the flavor of Pride and Prejudice and becomes infinitely more interesting. Though the first part was slow, it did serve to really build the character of Emma and she becomes very real through her actions in the second half. It also serves to humanize Mrs. Elton's character to some extent while softening Emma's.This really is a very, very good book and I would have given it 5 stars except for how slow it was in the first half. A patient reader will enjoy this but readers who don't have patience with character studies or slow bits would do better to read Pride and Prejudice."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"After reading Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, then Sense and Sensibility, I could not help but read another one of Austen books. The merits of the book lie mostly in character development. Emma, a girl of 21, is altogether too absorbed in the dangers of matchmaking, which result in several devastating consequences for her friend Harriet and her own continual blindness to the true feelings of the men around her. The reader encounters various characters of interest that form a better &quot;tangle&quot; of plot than Pride &amp; P/Sense &amp; S has to offer. I admit that the first 2/3 of the book left me questioning Jane Austen's work. I could not admire Emma Woodhouse (whom I thought to be at first a silly girl who misinterprets everything) as much as the other &quot;heroines&quot; in Austen's other books, but she proves to be sweet and naive, but clever at the same time, and she always has the best intentions at heart, especially for her loved ones like Mr. Woodhouse. It appears that Jane Austen always saves the best for last--I found the last 1/3 of the book delightful. Throughout the whole book however, Austen's talents and satire shines in various characters, particularly Mrs. Elton, who represents society's perpetual desire to be upper-class. Austen also sheds light on the social stress of class, power, connectinos, etc, without overwhelming the reader.I highly recommend reading this masterpiece."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"&quot;Fffftt!&quot; Cupid's arrow, once again, pierces the hearts of two unsuspecting people. Causing two people to fall in love, Cupid is known for his matchmaking. Similarly, Cupid is portrayed through Jane Austen's Emma. The protagonist, Emma, tries to find her best friend, Harriet, a husband. Emma is a well thought out, insightful novel. Despite the time gap between the time that Austen composed this novel and present day, the reader can still relate with characters. By developing a setting for Emma, Austen uses a realistic setting. For example, in the village of Highbury, class rank, reputation, and family background are major factors in marriage arrangements, which was a harsh reality during those times. Austen also develops Emma really well through her actions and decisions. Because Emma is a life-like character, she too makes mistakes. In addition, Emma also chooses to make decisions that make readers love and despise her. Creating unique love triangles, they contribute to the interesting and complex plot. For instance, Harriet has affections for Mr. Elton, however Mr. Elton has feelings for Emma, and Emma is trying to set up Harriet and Mr. Elton together. Using symbols, Austen is able to help readers recognize affections between characters. Showing his love for Emma, Mr. Elton keeps Emma's portrait of Harriet and makes a riddle for Emma and Harriet. However, Emma interprets Mr. Elton keeping the portrait and the riddle as his love for Harriet, but in fact symbolizes feelings for Emma. Also, Austen's themes are well carried out in arrogance and self-deception, and marriage. Thinking she's a perfect matchmaker, Emma is constantly proud of herself and her setups. However, she is unable to realize that marriage can't be playing around with. Ultimately, Emma was a very good book because of its great setting, characters, plot, symbols, and themes."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma is definitely Jane Austen's most captivating heroine. Emma may be flawed, but her character is the most enjoyable. I loved this novel. Throughout the story, Emma overcomes many personal hurdles. A synopsis would ruin the book - this is a must read!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Watching my favourite sitcoms or a worthy comedy on the big screen I may be moved to laugh out loud. Books have a much more arduous task. Very few authors have managed to make me laugh. Roald Dahl has, so has Harper Lee. Now I can add Jane Austen to the list. Emma is more of an entertainment than an art. It is structured very much like a romantic comedy of the 90's. The characters are introduced and beautifully developed while the reader wonders who will end up with whom. It is a tribute to Jane Austen that we care for Emma even though she causes so much trouble. She is unique in that we enjoy her failings as they lead to so many embarassing situations. In fact the Emma at the beginning of the novel is a much more interesting character than the polished Emma at the conclusion. Plot? There is very little. It is characters that Austen succeeds at. We remember Knightley and Emma; Frank Churchill and Mrs Elton; Mr Woodhouse and Harriet Smith. They are all well defined characters and like any good book you miss them when they depart. Oh and the line that forced me to laugh out loud: &quot;Mr Knightley seemed to be trying not to smile; and succeeded without difficulty, upon Mrs Elton's beginning to talk to him&quot;. If you don't get it read the book, I guarantee you will enjoy it."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I loved Emma by Jane Austen. I think that the best aspect of Austen's writing is her witty irony that is featured in all of her books. I thought that Emma was a touching and funny story about a young woman whose lot in life is to play the matchmaker. She tries to fix the world to her own liking, but it does not work. Finally, she stops being so critical and realizes what is standing right in front of her. If you enjoy the book (which I think you will), buy or rent the movie starring Gywneth Paltrow. It is just as funny as the book. If that is not your fancied genre, check out Clueless, starring Alicia Silverstone. It is loosely based on the novel and also very funny, with a modern twist."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Though Persuasion is my sentimental favorite, I regard Emma as Austen's finest novel overall. She is at the top of her game and everything works: the dialogue, character development and, did I mention, the humor? While teaching Emma in my AP English class this year, I realized that many less talented readers read right over the irony and scathing remarks. Jane Austen is so very funny that she makes better readers out of those who take the time to read her carefully. I have to admit that the movie version of Emma with Emma Thompson is quite good and does the novel some justice. It also helps a first time Austen reader get a flavor for how things looked and sounded in this time period. If you haven't yet started to enjoy Austen, pick up Emma and you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I've been reading ever since I was younger, and have always enjoyed it.. After reading all of Nicholas Sparks novels, I decided to go in a different direction and read some classics.. I decided upon Jane Austen after reading reviews of her novels.. So I bought Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, Persuasion, and Emma.. I choose Emma to read first because I thought it would be less interesting than the others.. How wrong I was! I absolutely loved this book, it's the best novel I have ever read.. Now I fear that the others will not be nearly as good as this one.. I agree with the others that the beginning is rather slow, but it picks up towards the middle so just stick with it! You will not be sorry.. I have no other words to describe this book other than amazing!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Jane Austen's Emma was a wonderful book. I think it gives Pride and Prejudice a run for its money because you get to see Emma grow as a person from being arragont to being kind.Now here is a basic Readers' Digest summary. Emma Woodhouse, a bright and wealthy young woman, and her father lose Emma's governess, Mrs. Weston(\\"poor miss Taylor\\") because she has gotten married. Emma brags to a good family friend,Mr. Knightley, that she predicted the match herself. She then wants to be a matchmaker. However, Mr. Woodhouse decides to disapprove of every marriage.To replace Mrs. Weston, Emma befriends Harriet Smith, a young poor girl wiht no record of her real birth mother. The two become good friends. Emma finds a wealthy man, Mr. Elton, that she thinks would be perfect for Harriet. Harriet grows to love Mr. Elton, but the feeling isn't mutual.A poor old maid, Miss Bates has her niece, Jane Fairfax, visit the town. Emma is envious of Jane because Jane is everything Emma wants to be: respected, elegant, and musical.Frank Churchill, Mrs. Weston's step-son, visits the town. Charming and handsome, he pays much attention to Emma. Many speculate the two as a perfect match. While others approve, Mr. Knightley is determined to think ill of him.Well, I'm sorry, but I hate giving away books, but believe me, this book is worth it. I will warn you that Austen tends to ramble on, but if you hang in there you will love it!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Once you master the difficulty of the language(some in our reading group never did), you can focus on the story and relate to the witty and impudent Emma. In one incident Emma and her best friend and former governess share a non-verbal communication by stepping on the other's foot under the table when something wild is happening! So many of these &quot;modern&quot; exchanges take place, that I was able to drop my misinformed presumptions that the english gentry class of the nineteenth century are so different from me. There are moments of great cruelty (such is the case of class struggle) and there are two hilarious characters; the gossipy neighbor who barely catches her breath, and answers her own questions, and Emma's worrisome and overprotective father. The story seems to be one party after another -- from parlor rooms to ballrooms to picnic luncheons -- you will be amazed at how much time these people have on their hands! Oh, the leisure class. Emma goes through some humbling changes, and there are surprising turns of events. I found myself wishing for Emma's world -- where your neighbors are intimates and you alternately visit and are visited upon, and work isn't in the picture."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma Woodhouse is priviledged. Very priviledged. She comes from the richest, most important family in her small town. Everyone looks up to her, including her indulgent governess and even more indulgent papa. The theme of her life, from the time she was small, has always been \\"Emma knows best\\". Emma takes this to heart when she takes an interest in young Harriet Smith, the beautiful, empty-headed daughter of, well, someone. The book follows Emma's misadventures as she tries to marry Harriet off to the local parson and meddles in the lives of her friends and neighbors, eventually learning that perhaps she doesn't always know best.This is, I think, one of Jane Austen's less popular works, perhaps because there isn't a great deal of romance in it. It is, as I titled the review, more of a character study, as well as a study of society at that time. On first reading, I didn't care for the book or for Emma's self-centered goodness. After reading it again, I grew to enjoy the book as much if not more than her more popular works, like Pride and Prejudice. The wit is sharp as usual (and maybe slightly more ascerbic), and more thought seems to have been put into the secondary characters. Definitely worth a read."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Like all of her novels, Jane Austen's EMMA is essentially a comedy of manners, a work in which the characters move inside a highly restrictive code of conduct and must walk a fine line between the socially acceptable and unacceptable if they are to survive, much less reach their goals. But at the same time the central character, Emma Woodhouse, is a marked departure. Not only is she a young woman of considerable wealth and social standing, she is, as critics are fond of pointing out, &quot;flawed.&quot;The nature of Emma's flaw is essentially Austen's observation of the great failing of the upper-class: an assumption that what they think and do is inevitably correct. And although Emma is quick-witted, generous, and kind, she suffers the effect of this blind arrogance when she comes to believe that she is gifted as a matchmaker and can order the romantic lives of her circle to suit her own liking. The result is a series of seriocomic entanglements and disasters that touches virtually every one with whom Emma comes into contact.The story requires considerable exposition, and consequently the action is slow to gather; add to this the fact that Emma herself is so overbearing and self-assured that you frequently want to give her a slap. The result is a novel that many, including Austen fans, will find an uphill read. Even so, Austen is writing very close to the peak of her powers here, and her amazing talent for observation, subtle irony, and flashing wit endow EMMA with tremendous charm and interest. In many respects a remarkable novel, but one that I recommend more to determined Austen fans than to casual readers.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I definitely recommend this book to first time Jane Austen readers, and especially to young girls, for it is so cute and so amusing. I wish I were &quot;forced&quot; to read this in High School for I would have surely written good papers on it. I can't see how anyone can dislike this classic. Jane Austen's character &quot;Emma&quot; has her faults of course, be she is a true character that is amusing and utterly charming, unlike those characters in Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility, which by no doubt are wonderful books, but Emma truly has to be my favorite Austen work. It is predictable, even without having seen the movie that was based on this work (that mind some of you was written over 200 years before Alicia Silverstone existed...gosh!) but the predictability of it made it all the more enjoyable, like a sort of mystery in romance. I definitely recommend this book to anyone over the age of 11 or 12. I know I'll make my kids read it some day. It is superb!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"If I could do it over again, I would read Jane Austen's Emma before I read her Pride and Prejudice. Unfortuanately that was not the case. I loved it nonetheless. Emma combines witty humor and a fun cast of characters that makes for very enjoyable reading. It does not read as quickly or as easily as Pride and Prejudice, but it is still great fun!If you have seen the movie Clueless starring Alicia Silverstone, then you know the basic plot. The 1995 movie was adapted from Jane Austen's novel, which was published in the 1800s. The Miramax version of Emma is done very well and should be viewed after reading the novel, not before. It would make the reading even slower.Emma Woodhouse is a young woman who is the socialite of her small English town of Highbury. She is beautiful and wealthy and popular; everything that girls nowadays want to be or imagine themselves to be, so she is not terribly hard to relate to. She is not terribly smart but humorously clever and witty.This novel displays this young woman's journey to self-discovery and love; along the way she humorously meddles in everyone's lives. Her romantic blunders are extremely fun to read about. I recommend this novel to any avid reader, but I should caution you against reading Pride and Prejudice beforehand, but if it is too late, do not hesitate to read it. And even though it may drag a bit, bear with it; the ending is reward itself!Needless to say Emma will always have a place in my heart and on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Of all of the books by Jane Austen this was my least favorite. The central character is not likeable and you can't sympathasize with her. It is a long and tedious book and it was constantly set aside to read something else when a new book arrived. If you are truly a fan of the 18th century period writings yes go ahead and read it but Pride and Prejudice, Sense & Sensibility and Northlanger Abbey are far better reading."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I'm reading Emma again for the third time. It happened like this: I thought I'd try an audio book on CD for the first time, something to listen to in the car besides music. Scanning the shelves at the local bookstore, I saw loads of contemporary best sellers, self and financial help, new age and evangelical Christian spirituality, and Jane Austen's Emma in MP3 format, all on one disc. Austen! Water in the desert! I scooped her up.For the last week I've been listening to her in my car. At the beginning it was without much concentration. Over the next few days my attention gradually increased. Now I'm hooked. Down the throat. Through the gut. Again. It happens to me every time I return to Jane. I just can't get enough. The last two nights I've gone to bed reading ahead of where I've listened. Even though the story is coming back to me, I'm still taken by it, hook line & sinker. Jane's reeling me in, and the line is utterly slack.Now, I am a guy. I break out in hives if I happen to accidentally brush a romance novel. As far as I am concerned, bodice rippers where the tall olive skinned duke inevitably has his forceful yet gentle way with the heroine are good only as ammunition with which to tease the women in my life who enjoy such tripe. Having said this, I realize a lot of people also refer to Jane Austen as \\"Chick Lit,\\" equating her with the likes of Nicolas Sparks. For the record, those people are on crack.Austen is much more a comedic writer than a writer of what we call romances. She is simply a hoot. Subtle disjunctures and ironies build to exquisite crescendos. She has me laughing every other page. Her characters, even her unpleasant and ridiculous ones, tend to breed sympathy. Like most of my favorite books, she creates worlds, or a world, really (all of her books are set in the same historic and geographic milieu,) which comforts and gladdens. The feeling I get from her is much like the feeling I get when I read Tolkien describe the Shire or Last Homely House, or something like the children's book Frog & Toad to my niece.It's an eating poached egg on toast snuggled up inside under a quilt on the couch with a cup of tea on a rainy day kind of feeling. (Don't you just love English prepositions and phrasal verbs? Try doing that in French! Austen and phrasal verbs: two of the many reasons English speakers ought to rejoice in their language, I say!)Anyway, during all of her stories, including Emma, Europe was being blown apart by the Napoleonic Wars, and the only oblique references in any of her stories to that maelstrom is that Great Britain has a mobilized Army (Pride & Prejudice) and an active Navy (Persuasion.) The reason the military is important has nothing to do with Austerlitz, Waterloo, Trafalgar or any of that nonsense. Rather, it is that both services have officers which make very suitable suitors for women of her heroines' social positions (Lt. Wickham & Capt. Wentworth, for example.)Some brand this awful: elitist, sexist, parochial. I, for one, find it beautiful. Small, intimate, ordered, secure, anchored. Very human and sane, that is.What matters most is not what some silly diminutive one armed Corsican with maniacal delusions of world conquest is doing; no. What really matters is whether and how Mr. Woodhouse takes his gruel, or if Mr. Elton will propose to Harriet. Or if Mr. Knightly and Mrs. Weston have come to visit yet, today. Will Mr. Frank Churchill come, and what is he like? Has Emma truly foiled Mr. Martin's advances on her friend, he being an entirely unsuitable yeoman farmer? Harriet must marry a gentleman, you see.Just so. Indeed, these are truly the things that mattered- and still matter- most. Don't let the history books and the reverse snobbery of some critics fool you.Instead go read this book, and every other that Jane wrote, and prepare to be enchanted."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma is Jane Austen at her best, the work of a writer in her prime. While earlier novels such as Northanger Abbey and Pride and Prejudice are extremely witty and well-plotted, none are as clever, interesting or satisfying as Emma, in its depiction of the frivolous preoccupations of the landed gentry in eighteenth century England.The plot centres around Emma Woodhouse, the young, beautiful and clever daughter of a hypochondriac father, who amuses herself by attempting to play cupid to her friends and neighbours - with predictably painful results. Austen's characterisation is delightful: characters such as Mr Woodhouse and Miss Bates are brilliant comic creations but are never in danger of becoming caricatures, like Dickens' characters sometimes do. Meanwhile Emma herself is a complex mixture of intelligence and thoughtlessness, kind-heartedness and self-satisfaction, and is superbly realised. Austen's dialogue is as delicious, and frequently hilarious, as ever - she reveals the finer nuances of her characters through the things they say, intentionally or otherwise - and shows how intuitively insightful and compassionate she was.As in most Jane Austen novels, all situations resolve themselves into a happy ending, though whether this tendency was prompted by a genuine positivity and warmth of feeling or a playful sense of irony, nobody is sure. Regardless, Emma is a tremendously satisfying read."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Jane Austen wrote some of the most remarkable romantic novels in English, and Emma is said to be written at the height of her powers. Like all her novels (Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility), the narrative is simple, straightforward and the story develops through seemingly commonplace conversations and events. Emma is twenty one year old daughter to rich Mr Woodhouse, \\"full of trivial communications and harmless gossip.\\" The story captures how Emma comes to terms with her own errors of judgement, and how she discovers her liking and love for one of the chief characters of the novel. (Perhaps giving his name away here would be sacrilage on my part!!). The cast, the locations, the conversations are set in distinct Austen style, rooted in rural English counties. The romances are Victorian, and progress through delicate, slow developments that a through, diehard romantic is bound to like. Emma's actions are governed by her own romantic fantasies, where she tries to bring people together playing a matchmaker, and her failures as well as successes make this novel an interesting read. A treat for Austen fans!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Buyers be advised that, though this page as of 08/30/2005 does not specify, this is ABRIDGED. So for those of you that cannot stand the thought of missing out on something that should have been left in (like me), just keep browsing for a different edition. I found out the hard way."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I don't know which book of Jane Austen, I love more. Sense and Sensibility is just so romantic. Pride and Prejudice is awesome and Emma is just fabulous. To think that Jane Austen wrote those books so long ago just goes to show that women have felt pretty much the same about love for always."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I can't remember the last book I disliked as much as I dislike Emma. GoodReads informs me that I have been struggling through this book since the middle of October, but in actuality this book has been haunting me for at least ten years. I bought it sometime before I went to boarding school. Though I remember starting it several times, I never made it past page 30. As I vociferously complained about this book as I was reading it this time, both M and my mother asked me why I was reading it if I disliked it so much. I didn't really have a good answer at the time, but now I know. Leaving this book unread for so long was haunting me. I really don't like leaving things undone, and I wanted to challenge myself as a reader. As an apprentice-writer, you are supposed to read as much as you can. If left solely to my own devices, I would mostly read YA, so Classics and Modern, Adult Lit are good for me.Usually, I like reading about Austen's heroines. I enjoyed Pride and Prejudice. Northanger Abbey was a fun read. But Emma Woodhouse makes me want to hit people. Okay, mostly I just want to hit her. So what were my issues?In Northanger Abbey, the heroine is also fairly naive and kind of creates the problems in her life. But you know what? She feels badly about it! And she learns! Emma's excessively high opinion of herself pissed me off beyond belief, and though she feels bad for a minute or two, in another 30 pages she'll be doing exactly whatever it was that got her into trouble last time. In fact, I don't think she focuses too much on starting the rumor about Jane Fairfax being in love with a married man. If she even thinks about it, it wasn't for very long. In fact, she focuses more on making a catty comment to Jane's aunt (whose ridiculously chatty dialog is *painful* to read), and that's primarily just because Knightly chastises her for it.Which brings me to my other issue: Knightly. Not a super-hot Austen heroine, in my opinion. Call me a crazy modern woman, but patronizing guys just aren't attractive to me. Now, I think he's perfect for Emma, who continues to act exactly like a spoiled child/Mean Girl, but I couldn't get 100% behind a relationship predominately based on him trying to fix her and get her to grow up. Maybe I'm missing something, and I'd love to see your thoughts or defenses of the book in comments. But really I'm just glad I accomplished that. Hopefully my other 10+ year book that is haunting me, The Phantom of the Opera, won't be as painful.Rating: 2 stars-- At least I will never have to start this book again."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Jane Austen has a lot of fans. I am one of them. My wife is another. People have been arguing the merits of Austen's novels for quite a number of years now; some people love her work, others do not. This is as it should be. We can take this premise of love/hate Austen a step further though. It has been my experience over the years that there is conflict even among those who love this writer's work and that everyone seems to have their favorite novel. This is also only right.The problem is though that I have found people who read Jane Austen are also a very opinionated lot and quite often harsh words are spoken when discussing the strengths, merits, flaws, dislikes, etc. of Austen's various works. Alas, I have to report to you that this is the case in our household; a normally peaceful place filled with tranquility and marital bliss...about 49 years of it...thank you very much!Yes, we are a family torn asunder. My wife (silly girl) feels that Emma is Austen's best work, while I, who am far more knowledgeable of such matters, prefer her novel, Pride and Prejudice...of which I am sure most of you will agree....me, not her, i.e. my mistaken wife. (Emma, bless her heart, is such an aggravating little twit).Anyway, this is really not a review of Emma, the work (I will admit that it is a very fine read worthy of multiple readings ever few years), but rather that of the actual book edition on sale here. I felt sorry for my wife when I saw her ragged copy stuffed into one of her already overly stuffed bookshelves and felt a new edition was in order. I bought this one for her.For the asking price of this book, including S&H;, I cannot for the life of me figure out why people are disgruntled and unhappy with it. It is very well bound, the font is extremely readable, the quality of paper is quite good, the dust jacket is extremely attractive and all the pages were present. I check the binding very closely when the book arrived, and again, for what I paid for this thing, it was excellent! Trust me...I know about such things. Hey folks, this is not advertized nor is it a leather bound first edition! This is a workable, useful book for everyday use.Now I have both this work and P&P; down loaded to my Kindle. The chances of my wife ever using one of these reading machines are as about as likely as pigs flying next mayday. It ain't going to happen. Therefore, she now has a new hardback book; one that will quite likely outlast both of us; It did not cost me a fortune. She can read her copy; I can read mine and the war between us that has been going on since we were in our early teens can continue.Bottom line...this is a good buy. And I must tell you, my wife was delighted with it.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I must start by admitting I did not get \\"Emma\\" the first time I read it. Or even the second. I did not really begin to properly understand \\"Emma\\" until after reading an essay by the great P.D. James, \\"Emma Considered as a Detective Story,\\" which forms a chapter in herTime to Be in Earnest: A Fragment of Autobiography(a wonderful piece of writing too). And even after that, I have to confess, it took a while. This is a novel that does not give up its secrets easily.Although the outward plot is simple enough (some reviewers have found it tedious, and I did too, initially), the real genius of this book is that all the really exciting and dramatic stuff -- Jane Fairfax's agonized secret engagement, Frank Churchill's game of misdirection -- is happening both offstage, as it were, and under our noses. There is a very exciting, melodramatic romantic story here, but that's not the one Jane Austen tells us. She hides it in plain sight, however.All the clues are there (just as in a detective story) but we don't see them, because we are seeing the world through the eyes of Emma, who is, as the 90s remake wittily reminds us, clueless: self-absorbed, naive, convinced the world revolves around her. But aren't we all?The book itself is a kind of conjuring trick, and once you see that, it is impossible to ever see it again in the same way."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"These books are wonderful! I love feeling like not only am I reading a delightful classic but I am doing so with a piece of art. They are truly treasures on my bookshelf!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Jane Austen's Emma was published in December 1815, when she was forty years old (just 19 months before she died). It is thus a work of her mature period, and is something of a favorite among her devotees.My admiration of Austen's work is partly for her insight into human nature but also for the sheer beauty of her prose. It has a poetic texture. Her sentences can be long and complex, with some confusion of pronouns, so that they need to be lingered on, their sense teased out of them, until their structure and meaning is revealed, exactly as one would do with poetry. The effect is immensely satisfying.She spends almost no time on descriptions of place, but when she does she shows herself capable of describing a scene succinctly and effectively. Her main focus is on character. She describes her characters and their motivation at length, and reveals them through dialogue. This emphasis on dialogue makes her work eminently suitable for dramatization, so it is no surprise that there have been so many adaptations of her work in cinema and televisionEmma is unique among Austen's novels in that the heroine is a spoilt rich girl, with definite character flaws. The reader is challenged to judge her and to choose to like her or not.One or two of the plot elements are somewhat contrived, but that befits a comedy of errors, which is what this essentially is.I would advise reading as little as possible about the book before reading the book itself, for fear of spoilers. In particular, you should avoid any introduction, because editors of classics very generously provide complete synopses of plots in their introductions, presumably to spare the reader any surprises. Introductions are best read after the story or, in the case of the Barnes & Noble Classics edition, not at all. The introduction by Steven Marcus is verbose, meandering and thoroughly confused. If you want good editorial input, choose another edition.[PeterReeve]"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel. While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).Modern readers tend to be squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings. A lesser delight."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Unlike the previous reviewer, I greatly enjoyed this book. It's actually my favorite of Jane Austen's novels. Emma, to be sure, is a little frivolous and silly, but she's meant to be, as the book shows how she goes from hapless matchmaker to happily matched herself. The book is at times laugh-out-loud funny, and gives charming insight into life during that time period. Poor Harriet is a very amusing character, and Emma's father is a hoot. The many misunderstandings and romantic confusions only add to the story. Give Emma a chance...you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"The title character of \\"Emma\\" is unique among the heroines of Jane Austen's novels. She is \\"handsome, clever, and rich\\" and at twenty-one years of age, inexperienced in life. Further, for most of the novel, Emma is not actively seeking a husband. The grim economic necessity that made finding the right husband so important for Lizzie Bennet and her counterparts in the other novels does not apply. Emma can therefore be allowed to be foolish in her social forays, even to fail, without impairing the audience's ability to enjoy the resulting romantic comedy.Emma lives at the estate of Hartfield with her doting but hypochondriac father. Their social status as the leading family of Highbury is unquestioned. The recent marriage of Emma's governess to a close neighbor prompts Emma to wish to arrange suitable matches for her other friends and neighbors. Her immediate target is Harriet Smith, an amiable young woman of uncertain social status. Against the advice of Emma's brother-in-law and confidant Mr. Knightley, Emma persuades Miss Smith to refuse an offer of marriage from a Mr. Martin, a upright hardworking farmer of no social distinction. Emma then tries to match Harriet up with the ambitious young vicar of Highbury, Mr. Elton. This scheme fails, hilariously, when Mr. Elton proposes instead to a horrified Emma.Mr. Elton soon brings a new Mrs. Elton to the village, a vulgar social upstart who presumes to arrange the social life of Highbury. Among her targets is young Jane Fairfax, once the paid companion of a gentlewoman, now forced to make her own way. The arrival of the charming and handsome Frank Churchill creates additional complications. Emma, after getting over her own initial infatuation, presses a match between Frank and Miss Smith. She is also provoked by Frank into passing rumors about Jane Fairfax and the husband of the woman she formerly accompanied. The climax of the story may be an unfortunate picnic at Box Hill, where everyone seems out of sorts. Emma thoughtlessly insults the silly but harmless Miss Bates, for which she is very properly upbraided by Mr. Knightley. Emma then learns, in rapid succession, that Frank has been engaged to Jane Fairfax all along and that Harriet believes she has gained the affection of Mr. Knightley. Emma is mortified to have misjudged both Frank and Jane, and to have inadvertantly pushed Harriet towards a man she now realizes she loves herself.Emma must take responsibility for her mistakes and make good her relationships with Miss Bates, Jane Fairfax, and Harriet Smith. Her fear of losing Mr. Knightley leads to a fateful conversation with him in the garden of Hartfield, in which Emma's fear of losing his friendship works at cross-purposes with Mr. Knightley's real agenda.Austen's subtle and witty exploration of social relationships in \\"Emma\\" is both humorous and insightful. \\"Emma\\" is the least heroic of Austen's heroines, but her undoubted charm and her very human efforts to mature have endeared her to generations of readers. \\"Emma\\" is very highly recommended to fans of Jane Austen's novels as perhaps her most polished romantic comedy."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma Woodhouse is an atypical heroine for a Jane Austen novel. Usually, we see disadvantaged girls struggle to find happiness through marriage. In Emma's case, we see a girl who has everything in the world she could want. She is rich, pretty, and happy. She has no desire to be married, as it would interfere with the simple life she enjoys with her father and she knows it would break his heart to be parted from her. The story follows Emma's life beginning at 21 as she tries to help a young girl named Harriet Smith marry above her station. Emma also engages in a flirtation with a young man and generally makes a a mess of things as she tries to manage the affairs of others.I have read that Jane Austen felt that Emma was a character only her creator could like. I would have to disagree with that. Emma is certainly flawed, but her heart is almost always in the right place. Pride has blinded her to her own limitations but she is also one who does not shrink from the responsibility of her mistakes and tries very hard to learn from them. I found this admirable and grew to like her more and more as the book progressed.Aside from Emma, the rest of the cast was also very well written. Her father is a complete hypochondriac and often engages in behavior that would typically be considered highly rude. Yet, he is motivated so completely by a desire to be kind to others that his misguided application of that desire only endears him to the reader. Mr. Knightley, the no-nonsense friend of the family is admittedly not the most complex character in the world, but he is a very good one and his solidity is a great counterbalance to Emma's wishful thinking.In summary, Emma is a nice change of pace from Jane Austen's other novels. It starts off well and grows more engaging as it continues. The characters are interesting and Emma herself grows considerably during the course of the novel."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"While \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is Austen's masterpiece, Emma deserves distinction as a work of wit and fun. Austen wrote about the misfortunes of a high-minded philanthropist (\\"Emma\\" was perfectly translated into the 90's by the movie \\"Clueless\\"). In \\"Emma\\" Austen poked fun at the way Emma feels almost obligated to help her associates \\"better themselves\\" but did not realize until the end that she needed to work more on herself.I enjoyed reading this book and recommend it.

One \\"struggles\\" to decipher who, where, and when. This is much more than a comedy of manners. Holmes would have been baffled by the twists and turns, the hints and allusions; and that is what made it so difficult to put this novel down. A \\"whodunit\\", if ever there was one.

I have never read Jane Austen before so having it for free is just so convenient! I highly recommend this book. The quality in my kindle is also really good."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Among fans of Jane Austen in the U.S., most may not recognize Juliet Stevenson by name; however, they will certainly recognize her from her photograph as \\"Mrs. Elton\\" in the film adaptation of Emma starring Gwyneth Paltrow and therefore might be inclined to dismiss a reading of Emma by the deplorable Mrs. Elton. Big mistake. Stevenson's reading is energetic, precise, and diverse. As a very accomplished actress, she skillfully conveys a different and appropriate voice for each of the many characters. She easily glides from the whining Mr. Woodhouse to the pining Harriet Smith; from the jabbering Miss Bates to the judicious Mr. Knightley.I selected this audio volume of Emma because the box clearly states that the reading is _unabridged_. Naxos has published unabridged all six of Jane Austen's novels, and all are read by Juliet Stevenson except Pride and Prejudice, which is read by Emilia Fox, the actress who portrayed Georgiana Darcy in the 1995 BBC adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. We who love reading these treasures by Jane Austen are, therefore, in very good hands when listening to these unabridged audio versions."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Yet another charming & beautifully published book.

That was a special interest of Emma Woodhouse. \\"Emma Woodhouse,handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition, seemed to unite some ofthe best blessings in existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little todistress or vex her.\\"Emma lives with her father in Highbury, England in the early 1800s. Her mother died when shewas little, and Emma's governess, Miss Taylor, married Mr. Weston. Emma is now all \\"alone\\" with herfather at Hartfield. She decides to excite her boring life by trying to find Harriet Smith a husband. Emmadecided never to marry, but she breaks that decision later on in the book. She tries to make Harriet theperfect gentlewoman, who has a good taste in men. Harriet and Robert Martin, a young farmer wholikes her, are \\"in love\\" already when Emma decides to find Harriet a husband, and she convinces Harrietto dump Robert. One problem is that Mr. Elton, who Emma tries to set Harriet up with, is in love withEmma, or at least her money. Next Emma tries to set Harriet up with Frank Churchill, but only afterhaving a failing attempt to fall head-over-heels in love with him herself. Then Mr. Knightley comes intothe romantic picture, both Emma and Harriet fall in love with him. After all the attempts, both girls getmarried, but I'm not going to tell you who marries who.Emma is a comedy of manners. Jane Austin wrote the book well by using intriguing words andpainting a picture of the village and the characters. I loved this book, and loved the love story in it...what can I say I love romance novels."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Can you go wrong with Jane Austen? Love it. If you like sweet, romantic stories then you will like this. It might take you a while to get into the way it is written, but take the time to do that as it is well worth it."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Nothing struck me more about this book than its pre-occupation with class boundaries, dwarfing even its other principal obsession - the question of matrimony.Coming from a society often criticized for its rigid caste hierarchy, I cannot help wondering whether comparisons of social equations in India and England in the 18th century would yield many remarkable differences. Emma's disregard for the &quot;insignificant&quot; classes would do the most caste-conscious Brahmin proud.One of the questions that stems from a first reading is the position of Ms. Austen herself. Emma's character is obviously intended to come across as more than moderately conceited. Is the opinion she, and other characters imbued with the darker shades of gray, hold, of the importance of nobility and high birth, intended to reflect the authoress' own disapproval of the social rigidity of pre-Victorian England...or is it merely the use of an existing social situation as a tool to bring into focus, the underlying moral theme of the ills of conceit and indiscretion?Either way, it is a little disappointing to note the apparent indifference which marks the book's attitude towards the same class distinctions which it so effectively delineates. It would have been considerably more interesting for instance, if Ms. Austen's sparkling prose could have been employed to contrast the characters and social circumstances of Emma and Jane Fairfax, who is superior to the eponymous protagonist in merit but inferior in social standing, instead of restricting her role to a supporting one."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I thought Emma was a deligtful book with a great ending i knew it would end that way but it was fun to read and jane austen is now my hero."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"This was the second of Austen's books I had read, The first being 'Pride and Prejudice'.

Even if you read slowly your time will never regret it!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I would classify this book as my favorite out of all the Jane Austen novels. It makes me cry everytime I finish it, because of The beautiful artwork of Austen's writing. Making all of Emma's mistakes seem so real, and her triphums seems as though they are your's. I see such a realism that only Austen seems to have mastered in her characters. Thought it always finishes with a happy ending, it gives hope that even as clueless (not meant to be a pun) as Emma is and how many stupid mistakes she made her efforts are rewarded with all of her matchmaking adventures coming to an end and everyone who was caught in the confusing love web being freed."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Marvelous! Incredible! Amazing! Wonderful! That about sums it up right there. It was a great book. I t kept you in on going suspense on who was going to marry who.

She has a kind, loving heart, and really wants to do good, but makes a tangle of everybody's lives, including her own. I'm sick of flawless, shallow, empty heroines, so Emma's faults and conquering of faults endear her. The unabridged book is slightly complicated (such as old-fashioned language) but if you savor it slowly it is well worth it. The plot is clever, sweet, funny and leaves a satisfied, warm kind of glow in the pit of your stomach. The perfect ending makes you want to cry. Don't spoil THIS novel with any trashy sequels.TRY WATCHING the Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeremy Northam &quot;Emma.&quot;"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I have always loved this droll piece of literature! Jane Austen created a charming and hilarious heroine in Emma. The comic timing and great characterization proves that Austen was -- and still is -- the most sought-after and influential author ever! (Just look at the work of Helen Fielding, Marian Keyes and other female authors of this era.)Emma is a force to be reckoned with. She takes it upon herself to play the role of Cupid. She chooses her candidates according to social status, age, charm, etc. The irony, of course, is that Emma doesn't have a lover of her own. What happens when one of her conquests as Cupid goes terribly wrong? And will Emma find her own knight of shining armor? This is one of the funniest situations in the book.If you love Jane Austen, and if you haven't read this novel, please do!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"An intellectually stimulating piece of literature, which challenges one's beliefs and enlightens one's mind with inventive theories concerning life-- if this is the type of commentary that peaks your fancy than I would not recommend reading Jane Austen's Emma. Indeed, the book is a coming-of-age story illustrating the comical mishaps of Emma Woodhouse, the novel's heroine, who takes destiny into her own hands. Particularly, she makes it her purpose to find suitable mates for her close acquaintances. As one might imagine, at times this creates a slightly awkward situation for the parties involved. Therefore, readers are introduced to a strong set of supporting characters inhabiting the small commonwealth of Highbury.Undoubtedly there is one amongst the bunch that the reader is able to identify with. For instance, Mr. Woodhouse, the town hypochondriac, who fears any situation which could spark the onset of illness; therefore, he virtually never leaves the comfortable confines of his home. In addition, Miss Bates and Mrs. Elton, the village gossips, who make it their business to learn all the comings and goings of the townsfolk. Besides the previously mentioned characters, there are a host of others who take you into their hearts and homes within the pages of the Jane Austen's novel.In fact her strong characterizations were perhaps the most compelling factors that kept me turning the pages. Indeed, Emma lacks the complex nature of many other novels written today. It is, however, a timeless example of the dynamics of human interaction. Yet the book's strongest claim to attract readers is a carefree amusement ending with a happily ever after."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"How could Jane Austen have thought that the character of Emma would please no one but the author?I was charmed to enter Emma's world, amused by her wit, stunned by her complacency, sympathetic when she made her mistakes. I finished the book with a real affection for this character, drawn so finely and so lovingly by a truly masterful writer.I had seen the movie version starring Gywneth Paltrow before reading the book. I expected to read the entire book with Paltrow's raspy laugh and swanlike neck in mind. Yet Austen transported me away from my cinematic preconceptions. There is so much more to &quot;Emma&quot; than a movie can capture: the incisive social commentary, the near perfect grasp of human nature, which hasn't changed much since Austen's time, in all its ugliness and sublimity.There has been much discussion over why Austen remains so popular with readers today. After all, her characters are geographically and socially isolated, immensely concerned with money, and (with a few exceptions) have no discernible occupations other than hunting for mates. It is hard to find similarities between these lives and those of modern Americans. What Austen does so well is to depict her particular place and time with astonishing clarity. Through Austen's (and Emma's) eyes, we see the commonalties that exist among all people, no matter the time or place."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"&quot;Emma&quot; is definitely Jane Austen's best and most humorous book. The quirky characters, comic faux pas, and Emma's adventures in matchmaking keep you very entertained. Although it's funny, the vocabulary can be challenging.

Emma is very much like Pride and Prejudice or Sense and Sensibility in style. The characters are beautifully developed as with Austen's other novels. There may be a bit too much emphasis on understanding one's place in society. Emma's pickings become very slim making her eventual engagement predictable, and her attempt to play matchmaker and improve a friend's standing is met with disastrous results.

A lot of the terms and expressions need explanations for the modern reader. This edition of the masterwork by Austen does not have footnotes at the end, nor does it have an up-to-date scholarly introduction by some University professor."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I needed this book for a college class and it held up just fine. For the price, I was very pleased."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"It seems as though there is a law that every edition of one of Jane Austen's books must be published with a painting of a formal lady or ladies on the cover. In the case of Emma, such a painting is, perhaps, most appropriate. Emma, unsurprisingly, tells the story of a young woman named Emma. She is, as we are quickly told, spoiled and head-strong. And, as is always the case in Ms. Austen's heroines, young and unmarried.Emma has recently lost her sister/mother-figure to marriage and appears doomed to a lifetime of seclusion with her kindly, but odd and hermited father. To avoid such a result, at least for a time, Emma sets to matchmaking. She finds a neighborhood girl with only limited prospects and attempts to launch her into the stratosphere of an advantageous marriage. Irony abounds.This novel reads much like Jane Austen's other materials. The text is dense, but witty and, at times, quite funny. The action, such as it is, is slow paced and revolves around the joining together of various singles into couples. The themes are, as is often said of Austen, private. The manners, speech and attitudes are largely dated.I do not consider myself a great Jane Austen fan, but there is no doubting her greatness in crafting this novel. The characters are as lifelike as ever an author has produced. The plotting is intricate. Indeed, only a second or third reading reveals the many hints and suggestions laid before the unknowing reader on his first journey through the book. The text absolutely sparkles with wit - there are, in fact, moments where one might laugh out loud. This is without reservation a book that any reader would do well to peruse and study.That said, I find it difficult to overlook the attitudes of an earlier age and that impacts my enjoyment of the book. The casual tyranny of Jane Austen's protagonists is jarring to the modern eye. Indeed, much of Jane Austen's value system is repugnant to me. Of course, one tries to read the book with respect to the time at which it was written. In doing so, one finds a beautifully written book about a delightful set of characters who comedically come together. Ghastly prejudice, however, is very close to the surface, particularly in this book of Austen's."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Well, Jane Austen was not a Charles Dickens. This work lacks the superb construction of Charles Dickens' novels. The images are there, but Austen does not put you there the way Dickens can. Also Austen's work does drag at times even though it is only about half the length of Dickens' full length books. But aside from that, it is a pretty good novel. The book is pleasantly funny with some touching moments. Emma herself is well drawn as a young woman who thinks she knows what is best for everyone, and later learns that sometimes it is best to let people make their own decisions. In all honesty, this is not uncommon at all. I find it very interesting that the recent movie &quot;Clueless&quot; was able to portray this story in a modern day setting. (The names were all changed, but anyone who read &quot;Emma&quot; could tell the movie was based on it.) Mr Knightley is memorable as the embodiement of reason.

Thus, it doesn't make any sense to think that a novel like this one is really any better than say, Michael Crichton or Stephen King. Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between &quot;serious&quot; works of literature like this one and allegedly &quot;lesser&quot; novels. The distinction is entirely illusory, because no novels are &quot;better&quot; than any others, and the concept of a &quot;great novel&quot; is an intellectual hoax."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"There is one principle reason that Emma is remembered. It was written by a woman. If Jane Austen had been a man, her works would be regarded as banal and inconsequential works of little literary merit. The work is impressive considering that Austen came from a culture that repressed women (a characteristic that most female authors share), but beyond that it is a poor work.There is a profusion of works of greater literary merit by women than what Austen offers, Mary Shelly's &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, Kate Chopin's &quot;The Awakening&quot;, Alice Walker's &quot;The Color Purple&quot;, &quot;Nectar in a Seive&quot; by Kamala Markandaya, or a very fine piece &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot; by Zora Neale Hurston.

We all know more or less what is going to happen at the end of the book - of course the hero and heroine are going to fall in love. Austen's use of irony is not exemplary either - is there anyone who didn't realise that Frank Churchill was hiding something, if we weren't sure quite what? Anyone who describes an Austen novel as a &quot;classic&quot;, particualy this one, needs their head examined. She is an olden days Jackie Collins, whose fancy language seems to have deluded some into believing that she is something which she certianly is not."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"For some reason, I always think of Emma as my least favorite Austen, but I thoroughly enjoyed re-reading it. Emma is a very imperfect heroine, but Jane Austen was wrong in supposing that no one but herself would like her. I find Emma to be refreshing as a heroine, and she stands is stark contrast to Fanny Price in Mansfield Park (my least favorite Austen heroine). There is none of Fanny's timidness or inability to stand up for herself. Emma is independent and strong, and much more modern than other female characters in classic literature. Her mistakes in pride and arrogance are such as we all make on a daily basis. She presumes to understand people's emotions and thoughts and thinks she has a right to order things as she would have them be...very type \\"A\\", in my opinion. But, as her intentions in every case are good, as she only wants those she loves to be happy and prosperous, one cannot really blame her.The other characters in this book are also very satisfying, particularly Jane Fairfax and Mr. Knightley. Jane is the poor orphan on whom everyone in Highbury, the village in which Emma lives, dotes upon. Emma, of course, can't stand her at first, but only because of the knowledge that Jane is superior to her in many ways. How many of us have declared that we don't like someone simply because they're better at something than we are? Mr. Knightley, Emma's neighbor and long-time family friend, is her conscience, calling attention to those errors in judgment that Emma constantly seems to make. He often lectures her, but only in an attempt to set her on a better course. When faced with the prospect of losing him, Emma must confront her own feelings and question her own situation in life.It's altogether an enjoyable read, with plenty of twists and blunders, and should appeal to any fan of Jane Austen...or just anyone who wants to read the real version of the movie \\"Clueless\\"."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma Woodhouse, \\"handsome, clever, and rich,\\" is the 21-year-old daughter of the elderly owner of Hartfield, the largest estate in Highbury. Though only a couple of hours away from London by carriage, Highbury regards itself as an isolated and virtually self-contained community, with the Woodhouse family the center of social life and at the top of its social ladder. Emma, doting on her hypochondriac father, whom she represents to the outside world, has grown up without a mother's softening influence, and at twenty-one, she is bright, willful, and not a little spoiled.Having too little to do to keep out of trouble, Emma's hobby is matchmaking, \\"the greatest amusement in the world.\\" Unfortunately, her sophistication in the social graces does not extend to much insight into human beings. Taking Harriet Smith, a young woman of \\"questionable birth\\" under her wing, Emma makes Harriet her \\"project,\\" educating her in the social graces, convincing Harriet not to marry farmer Robert Martin, who has courted her, and ultimately persuading Harriet that the vicar, Mr. Elton, is falling in love with her.Bored and without a large circle of \\"suitable\\" friends, Emma is an incorrigible meddler, playing with the lives of those around her, snubbing those she considers inferior, gossiping about others in an attempt to divert attention to herself, and misreading intentions. Only Mr. Knightly, sixteen years older than Emma and a friend of her father, stands up to Emma and tells her what he thinks of her behavior, and it is through him that she eventually begins to grow.Love and the formal protocol of marriage are a major focus here, with marriage more often a merger of \\"appropriate\\" families than the result of romance or passion. Class distinctions, acknowledged by all levels of society, limit both personal friendships and romantic possibilities, and as Emma's matchmaking fails again and again, causing grief to many of her victims, Emma begins to recognize that her pride, willfulness, and love of power over others have made her oblivious to her own faults. Austen shines in her depiction of Emma and her upperclass friends, gently satirizing their weaknesses but leaving room for them to learn from their mistakes-if only they can learn to recognize the ironies in their lives. Though Emma may be, in some ways, Austen's least charming heroine, she is certainly vibrant and, with her annoying faults, a most realistic one.

While driving, folding laundry, cooking or cleaning, I can absorb Emma once more!

For all its pleasant enjoyability, however, the novel is also a fascinating character study of one woman being elevated to a nobler level by being taken down several notches.In this respect, \\"Emma\\" is a prime example of the fact that although many see Jane Austen as something of a proto-feminist, she often gave her male characters the most admirable constitutions of her entire cast. Although the female Emma may be the heroine we hope will triumph, the male Mr. Knightley (like Colonel Brandon of \\"Sense and Sensibility\\") is the unimpeachably noble person, and the one who helps Emma ascend to a higher plane of virtue when she might otherwise have been left in despair at her failures. In the end, Austen's fourth novel (and the last published during her lifetime) is not a feminist manifesto. Rather, it transcends the gender wars and remains a touching comedy of errors with a profoundly subtle commentary on human pride and folly."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"In a letter to a relative Austen once wrote \\"3 or 4 families in a country village is the very thing to work on \\"She knew this world intimately and well and it was the subject of her best novels of which Emma most assuredly is one .Emma Woodhouse is young,lively and thoroughly spolied .She is complacently sure she knows what is best for all her friends and acquaintances ,especially in matters of the heart .She is a self-appoinited matchmaker to all her friends and she particularly interests herself in the affairs of the young and naive Harriet Smith,an unassertive and timid young woman .Emma is convinced Harriet would be ideally matched with the local minister Mr Elton not knowing that he despises Harriet for her lack of social graces and standing and that he is set on wooing and winning Emma herself .Emma is idly contemplating a dalliance with a newcomer to the village ,Frank Churchill ,but her real feelings are for the local squire George Knightley .Knightley is an amused and exasperated spectator to the meddling which is second nature to Emma.The novel deals with the way Emma's plans for others collapse and she as a consequence comes to a new and painful degree of self-awareness.She knows less about herself and others than she fondly imagines .The book is a very tough-minded piece of work and has universal themes to do with human motivations and self-deception.It shows the manipulations and strategems of the marriage market as supremely important in society .Emma is essentially about growing into self awareness rather than a romantic comedy as so many other Austen novels are .It is why it still retains its impact so many years after its original publication .The support cast is well drawn -Elton,in particular being a great sketch of an odious snake who has somehow been born as human being .Any society in which people meddle in each others affairs is one in which Emma is still a valid book"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"A classic gem done full justice by the superb reading of Prunella Scales. A great listening experience was marred, however, by a surprising and disappointing flaw in disc 8 which rendered the final track unintelligible.It would be much appreciated if you could replace this faulty disc, as such a literary masterpiece deserves to be presented and preserved in mint condition.The damaged disc apart, Jane Austen would surely applaud this excellent rendition of her beloved Emma."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma Woodhouse is an atypical heroine for a Jane Austen novel. Usually, we see disadvantaged girls struggle to find happiness through marriage. In Emma's case, we see a girl who has everything in the world she could want. She is rich, pretty, and happy. She has no desire to be married, as it would interfere with the simple life she enjoys with her father and she knows it would break his heart to be parted from her. The story follows Emma's life beginning at 21 as she tries to help a young girl named Harriet Smith marry above her station. Emma also engages in a flirtation with a young man and generally makes a bit of a mess of things whenever she gets involved.I have read that Jane Austen felt that Emma was a character only her creator could like. I would have to disagree with that. Emma is certainly flawed, but her heart is almost always in the right place. Pride has blinded her to her own limitations but she is also one who does not shrink from the responsibility of her mistakes and tries very hard to learn from them. I found this admirable and grew to like her more and more as the book progressed.Aside from Emma, the rest of the cast was also very well written. Her father is a complete hypochondriac and often engages in behavior that would typically be considered highly rude. Yet, he is motivated so completely by a desire to be kind to others that his misguided application of that desire only endears him to the reader. Mr. Knightley, the no-nonsense friend of the family is admittedly not the most complex character in the world, but he is a very good one and his solidity is a great counterbalance to Emma's wishful thinking.In summary, Emma is a nice change of pace from Jane Austen's other novels. It starts off well and grows more engaging as it continues. The characters are interesting and Emma herself grows considerably during the course of the novel."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"*Warning: there are some plot spoilers in this review!*Jane Austen has a reputation as a witty, humorous writer with a keen eye for human folly and failings, and with this novel she certainly lives up to her reputation. While Emma isn't as popular as my personal favorite Pride and Prejudice, I believe that Emma is so popular, and can be considered \\"literature\\" (that is, a piece of art) because the story really has a universal quality to it. The fact that we can relate to the situations and characters in Emma some 300 years later is what makes it seem so timeless, and why the Emma movie with a \\"modern twist\\", Clueless, was so wildly successful. When you compare both Emma and Clueless they show how little has changed and that privileged teenagers (and young adults) will find themselves in the same situations and social patterns, whether they are in 19th century England or 21st century America.Of course, while the wealthy and bored teenagers in Clueless might try to set up their friends on dates, the stakes were a bit higher in Emma. Emma (the heroine) attempts to match her new friend Harriet Smith with the new minister Mr. Elton not just for dating, but for marriage as long as they both shall live (remember, divorce was rare, if not nonexistent in early 19th century Britain.) Unfortunately, this plan backfires when Mr. Elton becomes interested in Emma, not Harriet. The problem was that Emma (already conceited because she successfully \\"guessed well\\" when she matched her tutor Ms. Taylor with a local widower Mr. Weston) failed to get to know Harriet and Mr. Elton well enough to figure out if they were, in fact, right for each other. Emma shows her class-snobbery when she (through some very adolescent mind games) convinces Harriet to reject the proposal that she receives from a local farmer (Mr. Martin, the man Harriet likes and eventually falls in love with), in the hopes that Mr. Elton will propose. Emma was too self-centered and (to steal the phrase from Amy Heckerling) clueless to notice that Mr. Elton was not, in fact, interested in Harriet, but in herself--a fact that leads to Harriet's heartbreak. Of course, this is only one part of the multi-faceted story that Jane Austen created about the life of a \\"handsome, clever and rich\\" woman living in Highbury, England, but it gives you a sense of the life and times of Ms. Emma Woodhouse (as we see them in the book)Fortunately, all is well in the end when Emma learns her lesson about matchmaking and toying with emotions and discovers that she loves her brother-in-law and well loved family friend Mr. Knightly. This is a classic \\"happy ending by way of falling in love with the best friend that you had all along,\\" but with a slightly dated feel. First, he is sixteen years older than her and he, in a way, helped to raise her (at least, in principles). The fact that he admits openly to having been \\"in love with (her) ever since (she) was thirteen at least,\\" slightly bothered me. Who, in the 21st century, would admit to having a crush on their 13 year old sister-in-law? In the context and time of the novel it's romantic. Now Mr. Knightly might be described as a pedophile. However, the dated dialogue (like the above) is the only qualm I had about the book, and I hope that it doesn't discourage anyone from reading Emma. Overall, I would recommend this book to any Clueless fan, romantic-comedy fan, or anyone who wants to read the wonderfully universal writing of Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Very much like Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, Emma, a novel by Jane Austen, is a tale of confusion and intrigue over the universal topic of love. The reader's feelings of befuddlement and captivation, while nonexistent at the beginning of the novel, will grow exponentially until the climax. At the end of the novel, everything finally makes sense and the characters live on happily ever after. This is a very satisfying ending, clearing up all earlier confusion, although it leaves little room for wonder and thought after the reader has finished the book. Though I found this novel very confusing, and therefore unenjoyable at times, the intrigue and vivid setting and characterization overpowered my initial dislike. I would recommend Emma, to seventh through ninth grade students who are capable of deciphering meaning from complicated words and are able to pick out the essential subject matter of passages that do not state the meaning strait out. Readers will enjoy the frenzied, almost comical, characters in all their confusion over who loves whom, as well as all the wonderful descriptions, and the satisfying ending."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma is another one of Jane Austen's novels. It's a good book, however I don't believe it's as good as Pride and Prejudice. The protagonist, Emma, is a very bright and handsome young lady. It seems that the protagonists of Jane Austen are always female, intelligent, and pretty. The characters in this book are complex. For example, an elderly well-known bachelor suddenly falls in love and took a wife of about the same age as he. His reason for marrying is also strange, because he simply wanted to have a wife. And Emma was the person who started and encouraged their relationship. The plot was interesting too, a few surprises here and there.My problem with Emma is that it wasn't as engrossing a story as Pride and Prejudice. But this is a different style of book, so it's really unfair for me to say that Emma is not as good as Pride and Prejudice. Other than that, it's a wonderful book.I recommend it to readers who want dialogue-based novels."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"It's not that I don't like Emma as a character, I do! It's great that she's a bit flawed and gets into messes because of her arrogance, and I even liked the storyline (though to be honest it's probably only because of \\"Clueless\\") to a certain extent - I just felt it was a little dull.Nothing ever really seemed to happen. People just talked. A lot. And I felt that the whole 367 pages (of my copy) could have been cut down to 150 - at least! The one possibly exciting part (Harriet and the gypsies) you didn't see happen, as it was only ever talked about. Like the rest of the book.It's the first Austen I've read and has - I hate to say - slightly put me off trying any of her others, although I probably will in time.If you like charming books of light humour and romance - or just Austen - I'm sure you'll enjoy Emma, but if like me, you are used to a bit more excitement and adventure, you might want to try something else.

The story pretty much revolves around our heroine in her attempts at matchmaking, the social norms of England in those times etc. Though it borders on romance, I would say it is more of drama.

The characters that she creates come alive on the page and even though nothing terribly exciting happens besides the usual day to day, I find myself drawn into the lives and events anyway.In the introduction to my version of Emma, there is a comment that Emma is basically a book about nothing. While this is true in a way, Emma is about a lot more than nothing and gives the reader a fascinating glimpse into the world of Emma's England. There is also the great intrigue (insert tongue into cheek a bit) of whom will be matched up with whom and when these courtships will commence, etc.Ms. Austen's easy to read style and sense of humor really do make this an enjoyable book to read and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a lighthearted frolic through classic literature in old England."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"If you have not read Emma since you were in high school or college, read it again!!

Emma is neither wonderfully good with dreadful circumstances (like Jane Fairfax, Jane Eyre, etc.), nor rich and intolerable (like Mrs. Elton, Scarlett O'Hara, etc.), rather she is like many of us today, a well-to-do girl who is nice but has faults. I loved how she grew through the story, slowly realizing more and more of her fundamental issues. Mr. Knightly is the perfect gentleman to everyone and a wonderful friend to Emma because he loves her enough to correct her for her faults. Even so, he grows and improves in the book as well. All of the characters have many facets to their personalities and characters and Austen weaves a beautiful web through the story. Emma is a lighthearted, fun read, yet has depth and relevant themes.I recommend reading this book twice so that it can be fully appreciated."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Now that I have all my computer business sorted out (and at home sick today) I'm going to try to get moving on my Jane Austen reviews. Emma was the second Jane Austen book I read, and the only one I read for school. I was 15 at the time and actually wasn't all that fond of the book. It was funny, yes, but I found Emma herself absolutely insufferable and the relationship between her and Mr. Knightley kind of squicky (fell in love with her at 13???) but watched the Gwyneth Paltrow movie and liked it. A couple years later, I gave it another try and loved it!It's probably second or third favorite of all Jane Austen's novels. I still find Emma to be very irritating at times but she is a very amusing character to read about. Like Elizabeth Bennet in a way, she is so sure of herself and her impressions of people and turns out to be totally wrong at just about everything. I like how she learns her lesson when some of her matchmaking attempts go awry. And I realized that Mr. Knightley wasn't serious about falling for Emma when she was only 13, thank heavens. I like that Frank Churchill, the \\"bad guy\\" of the book, isn't exactly a villain per se, but still a total cad.Most of all, I like the element of mystery. Who sent Jane Fairfax the piano? What secrets are the characters hiding? It wasn't a crime novel or anything, \\"only\\" a romance, but throughout there was a sense that things weren't what they seemed, which I enjoyed. Of course, now there's no surprise to learn of Jane and Frank's engagement but it's fun to pick out the all the hints or \\"clues\\" that Mr. Knightley picks up on but Emma is totally oblivious to.I like Mr. Knightley as a character, but he's not exactly my type. Emma needs someone to keep her on the right track, but I'd be afraid he'd be nagging me all the time. I guess it's of no importance, since he's a fictional character and all, but it's still fun to think about."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Before reading the book Emma by Jane Austen, I made the mistake of watching the 1999 movie version starring Gwyneth Paltrow. For some reason I just did not like this movie and I found that I could not sympathize with our heroine Emma because I just plain did not like her. I found her childish, self-absorbed and meddling. Since watching this movie I have been a bit prejudice with the story and I never really wanted to try my hand at reading the book itself. I have been lately re-reading most of Jane Austen's novels and I realized what a disservice I have been doing myself all of this time by not reading this book. I dug out my copy of Emma and I began to read. The basic plot everyone knows and not a lot happens but I realized that the writing is wonderful and what a truly fantastic heroine Emma is. She is flawed, probably the most flawed of all of Austen's heroines but the best part about Emma's personality is that this makes her more human and more like us. She is able to see when she does wrong and she tries at the end of the book to atone for some of the mistakes she made about people's characters. Of course the novel is filled with Austen's wonderful characterizations of human personalities, and I think that since Emma is one of her later novels she had perfected her art of characterizing people and making them such wonderful individuals to read about whether they are more for comic purposes than to be a main character.This addition also contains some wonderful supplemental background information of Jane Austen as well as some of her letters and also what other writers have thought of her works and of this book in particular. I love reading other's opinions on Jane Austen and what they feel she thought or felt since we can't ask her ourselves so I found the information in this addition excellent."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"It was hard to like the main character but it is supposed to be.

I was actually surprised that the book was so similar. It features one of my favorite Jane Austen characters, Emma of course. She is a joy to read about. The dialogue was easy to follow and it was a quick but fun read."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"The fourth, longest and last of Jane Austen's books to appear in print during her lifetime, Emma is considered a classic romantic comedy and was first published in 1816. Written almost 200 year ago, it's inevitable that the dialogue may feel a bit stilted at times. However, this adds dimension and depth to the story that focuses on 19th century social hierarchies and the interaction between various social classes.Miss Emma Woodhouse is a shining example of a 19th century socialite. Beautiful, clever and wealthy, she fancies herself a master matchmaker and sets in motion a laundry list of schemes to pair off the Highbury residents. Convinced a makeover would elevate her new friend Harriet's social standing and thus her marriage potential, Emma, fueled by her feeling of superiority, plotted and planned, all to no avail. Failing to realize the extent of her shortcomings and the consequences of such hurtful behavior, Emma was finally confronted by Mr. Knightley. Afterwards, embarrassed and ashamed, she reevaluated her life and began to make amends, in hopes of becoming a better person.Emma is a beautifully written, classic, laced with wit and sarcasm. Through a vastly differing cast of characters, each delightfully inspiring in his or her own way, Austen vividly captured the heart of a community. Everything is neatly tied up at the conclusion, as things literally come full circle...ending much the way it began.A subtle, yet significant message is hidden just below the surface--the beginning and the ending are just definitive points in the journey, in between is where we write our definition of happiness. There's a depth and sincere honesty written into the very fabric of this story-that must be recognized to fully appreciate the artistic genius of Jane Austen.Like a vintage automobile, Emma is a slow, leisurely read, perfect for a lazy Sunday afternoon.Armchair Interviews says: What more can you ask of a book, even if the story is 200 years old."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I really enjoyed this a lot. It's not quite as good as Pride and Prejudice, but it is better than Sense and Sensibility. It still has a lot of things to say that are still very much pertinent to modern times. Austen's longest work is an entertaining romp that shows what happens when one young girl gets too involved in the affections of (and between) others. Although overlong, it's still a really, really entertaining read."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Jane Austen is one of the greatest women writers in history, and Emma ranks among her best. The characters are rich and varied. For anyone with an interest in Victorian literature, Emma is sure to be a hit."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I tried to read this book when I was in middle school and quickly returned it to the shelf when I found it slow and boring. I decided to give it another try and couldn't believe that I hadn't enjoyed it before. \\"Emma\\" is not a work of deep and intense literature, but Austen deftly explores human motives and emotions. Emma is consumed by the class system and buys into its importance, much like Mr. Darcy in \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\" Emma feels she has the power to change the system, especially where her friend Harriet Smith is concerned. Emma must find out the hard way about class distinctions and friendship.I'm not an avid Austen reader, in fact I'm quite a novice as far as she is concerned. Maybe after I've read some more of her novels I won't value \\"Emma\\" as highly, but for now, this novel is high up on my list, and I enthusiastically reccomend it."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Ms. Austen wrote very well about headstrong, intelligent young women. All of her books are wonderfully warm, but they show a tendency to light irony as well. Ms. Austen describes her world of early nineteenth century England so very well. In this book her heroine is Emma Woodhouse. She is the younger daughter of a wealthy landowner. She has a good heart, but she is spoiled. She also sticks her nose into other people's love affairs with some disastrous results. Miss Austen does a wonderful job describing life in a busy English village. The village in this story is Highbury. The characters in the book are wonderful, but it is the spiritual development of Emma that carries this book. Somehow she manages to grow and learn while staying within the strictures placed on her by her father and by English village life. Your journey reading Jane Austen's work is not complete if you do not read this book."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"This is a book about Emma, a rich girl's mischievous struggle in her own little fantacy world. This book is a bit boring and dry in the sense that everything is just always so beautifully fitting. Even in the worst moment when Emma's ill judgement turned into chaotic love triangle, the story went on and worked everyone's fate for the best. Since I don't read much of Jane Austen's works, I guess her style tends to be light and comic. So, if you are looking for a book with lots of heart throbbing drama, this is definitely not the one."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"When I first tried to read this book (almost ten years ago, when I was around 13), I found it incredibly dull because there is little action. I finally decided to reread Emma and realized that the appeal of this book (in addition to Jane Austen's writing style) is in its characters. Emma's setting is a small town full of an assortment of delightful personalities.At the center of the story is Emma Woodhouse, an intelligent and wealthy young woman, who believes that she knows what is best for everyone around her. Emma takes the orphaned Harriet Smith, a pretty but simple-minded girl, under her wing. The consequences are disatrous for all. I found it pleasant to watch Emma grow throughout the book and learn about the way the world works.The other characters include the loquacious Miss Bates (and her silent, elderly mother), the constantly distraught Mr. Woodhouse, and the handsome and affluent Mr. Knightley. There are also Jane Fairfax (who the movie portrays a little bit more negatively than the book) and Frank Churchill who show up later on in the book to make life a little more interesting.These people and many others add to the richness of Austen's narrative. The best part about them is that all are real people who have both good and bad points, and make mistakes. I found that a lot of them are similar to people that I know today in the 21st century.The second time I read through this book, I found myself aching for more. I felt delighted every time I find one of Jane Austen's little witticisms (and there are a lot!). These little gems are enough to make her my all time favorite author."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma Woodhouse is easily Jane Austen's most annoying character. She's young, knows absolutely everything about everything, is the judge of everyone's good character and takes those around her for granted, despite frequently praising her friends and relations. She is, for all intents and purposes, the 18th century version of daddy's little rich girl.How can a book about such a person be so captivating? The short answer is simply: because Jane Austen wrote it. The long answer is several hundred printed pages and well worth the read.Much of the story is the typical Jane Austen framework, but the character of Emma is entirely different from many of the other main figures in Austen's works. While her other heroines have plenty of outstanding qualities and several flaws, Emma has plenty of flaws and several outstanding qualities. It's the central, exceptional qualities that make Emma a worthwhile character, but the flaws - and her growing consciousness of them - that make her loveable.Countering Emma is the younger, and more gullible, Harriet Smith. She becomes Emma's project when Emma learns of her situation in life and is determined to improve it by befriending her. Emma's increasing awareness of her own flaws footnote their friendship, as she is forced to admit to being something of a snob, and a meddler.There are all sorts of loud and obnoxious people in \\"Emma\\", and Austen's orchestration of the interaction among them is, as always, brilliant. The character of Mrs. Elton alone is one of my favorite \\"bad examples\\" of all times. This is perhaps the downright funniest of Austen's books, but in ways it is also the happies and the saddest. Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith are in the throws of adolescence, where everything is either tragic or blissful.I typically say that \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" and \\"Northanger Abbey\\" are my favorite Austen works, but secretly it might be truer to say that \\"Emma\\" is. It's not as clever as \\"Pride\\" or as satirical as \\"Northanger\\", but the way in which Emma is forced to open her eyes to the world - and the way it continues to revolve, and evidently not around herself - is really something most of us can relate to all too well.Incidentally, the movie version of \\"Emma\\", starring Gwyneth Paltrow, isn't bad, but if you haven't seen it yet, please do yourself the favor of reading the book first. As always, there is so much in the pages that is ignored on the screen. Then, when you're done reading, watch \\"Clueless\\" again, which isn't nearly as true an adaptation, but is a funnier movie."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I did my best to read this book but I just couldn't get into it. The book is well written and clearly at a 187 years old, has stood the test of time. Nonetheless, at this stage in my life I was not motivated to finish the book."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I just recieved my copy of this wonderful work by Jane Austin and, even though I have hardly had time to crack open the beautiful cover, I must say the edging on the pages is exactly as they say: It is uneven and roughly cut. Just as you would have seen in Jane Austin's time. If any of you have grandparents and have stumbled upon their editions, their's probably looked the same. I don't think this is due to the fact that B&N; doesn't care how their books look, but because they wanted to keep that feel that you were reading an older book, from a different time. After all, they didn't have computers and things to measure the print paper perfectly back then.I can't wait to dig into the witty, wonderful world of Jane Austin. It's always a treat!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Although Austen's longest novel, Emma is a lot of fun to read. It was areal challenge to make us truly care about this spoiledand meddlesome character. I guess it because it is Emma's depth of feelingand her reactions to all the chaos she creates throughout the book that reallyendear her. That and the fact that in the end everything works out as itshould (no major spoiler that), and all her messes are resolved happily orcomically.I can see why many consider this to be Austen's best work: it has many of thebest qualities of the other work, but it also builds into a mysterywith a surprising resolution, and many characters turn out to be quitedifferent from what we initially suspect."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I love historical novels and Jane Austen holds a special place in my heart. Even so, I have issues with Emma. I adore much of the writing style, but the plot and characters irk me.Let me start by saying that Jane gets kudos for trying to do something different here. In other stories she had not-well-off young women who were desperately trying to get by in life, to thrive in the world they had been born into. Emma is Jane's efforts to focus on a new kind of heroine. Rather than being poor and worried about her future, Emma is quite secure. She is wealthy. She has a father who dotes on her, a house she loves, and she is perfectly content to live like this forever. She has no need of a husband or really of a partner at all. This is an interesting diversion from other stories.Emma, aged 21, grew up without a mother and with a loose-handed governess. So she is spoiled and very aware of her class and status. It might be hard especially for American readers to relate to just how stratified English culture was at the time. Some situations - like how Emma treats farmers - might be seen as cruel. It's important to put this into context. This was \\"normal\\" at the time. Heck, for a few societies on the earth this is \\"normal\\" even in modern times. You can't really judge it as right or wrong.Mr. Knightley, aged 38, has been pretty much an uncle to Emma her entire life. He was a teen when she was born and was always there to watch over her and correct her. He tries to guide Emma as she plays romantic match-making games with the people around her, but Emma thinks she knows what is best. She manages to bungle a variety of relationships. To her credit, she does feel badly right away, but then she plows ahead with a new scheme.SPOILER WARNINGOne of the key issues I have with this book is the VERY creepy idea that Mr. Knightley has been lusting after Emma since she turned 13. If I had a young daughter and a male family friend in his late 20s started following her around as soon as she hit puberty, I would be quite irate with him. Again, I realize gigantic age gaps in this time period were normal. As they say in the story, men weren't expected to take on a family until they hit age 30 and had the financial strength to support a family. Women were supposed to marry in their late teens / early 20s so they could kick out as many kids as possible. Even so, though, to have a person that was almost an uncle to Emma stalking her as soon as she started showing a womanly body really bothers me a lot.Also, I realize Emma is written to have her be spoiled. Jane Austen tries to give her some humanity by making her dote on her father and feel remorse each time she does something wrong. However, to me it just doesn't get past the way-too-spoiled aspect of her personality. Interestingly, I enjoy some of the movie versions FAR more than I enjoy the book because in the movie they alter the storyline just enough to make it much more palatable. They smooth out some of Emma's annoying traits and make the Emma-Knightly pairing a bit less creepy.Still, if you're looking to start reading the Jane Austen series of books, I wouldn't start here. I'd start either with Pride & Prejudice or with Sense & Sensibility."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Frankly I am puzzled by the criticisms leveled at this edition. There is another edition [also by Barnes and Noble] and it is cheaper, though the quality is very flimsy and I wonder if the other reviewers were confused with that edition?This edition of Emma is beautifully bound, with a cloth spine, and has a lovely portrait on the cover. The text is not too small unlike some other editions, it makes for comfortable reading. The book itself is sturdy, as it is in hardback, but not unwieldy - it fits nicely into my hands. Besides the main text of Austen's novel itself, it has added features - a brief chronology of the world of Jane Austen & Emma, an introduction, the main text, as well as useful endnotes, a list of adaptations of the novel [in both film and book format],comments, as well as a list of resources for further reading [biographies and letters of Austen] and criticisms. In all, a value buy."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma (Barnes & Noble Classics)Great Book if you like the classics as I do. Quality of the pages is very good (acid free should you wish to keep it and, smooth texture)."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"It is difficult to imagine how a book written in 1816 can still be relevant and emotionally viable, after so much change in literature. And while female gender roles have evolved and broadened (causing certain things to become irrelevant- like the drastic choice between marriage or condemnation), Emma remains one of the most complex and ambivalent characters in literature. Perhaps because Austen's major theme- pride- is a rather timeless attribute in humans.Austen was quoted as wanting to create a character \\"no one but [her]self will much like,\\" and Emma certainly answers that promise. Emma is a talented, highly intelligent woman who carries so much pride, that she deems every man an ill-suitor for her, while an under-adjusted adolescent side of her secretly resents such men for being turned off by her harsh arrogance, smugness, and severity. She acts as a match-maker for her less fortunate common friends, bringing them together with men whom she despises; thus ridding herself of her own ingrown desires while condescendingly \`helping' her girl-friends meet men who share their mediocrity. As difficult as it is to like Emma, readers will find her mysteriously compelling, perhaps because there are moments of confused kindness, where our heroine is able to transcend her vanity and truly feel happy for the couples she brings together.Enter Mr. Knightley, who after a tiresome handful of preceding men, is able to gain Emma's respect and affection simply by not buying into her mind games and calling her on her actions. Austen's genius is most manifest in her witty dialog, and the dynamic between Emma and Mr. Knightley- in their bantering flirtations veiled under intellectual stimulation- are testament to that.This novel is about self-image, and for a woman in 19th century patriarchal society that is all she has. Emma owns her self-importance until the men notice, until it becomes real (and despite early feminist tendencies, this only re-confirms female's subordination to men in that social context). Regardless of how readers feel about Emma, the novel is superbly written with wit, irony, and an almost ruthless emotional verity. If an author's goal is to gain her reader's empathy, Austen set out for herself a highly ambitious goal, one that was improbably executed with grace."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Maybe it was the way Jane Austen drew the reader into the story, or possibly the twists and turns of the plot, but whatever it was to add the extra flavor it worked. The book demonstrates a perspective on love that can only be seen through the eyes of a person who involves themselves as a whole in the book. It has a way of making it an impossible task to put it down. This story stands the tests of time and will surely work it's way into the hearts of millions more.

After every movie adaptation, I feel compelled to return to the sour ce and have always found Austin's presentation the best."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel. While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).Modern readers tend to be unfairly squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings. A lesser delight."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"\\"Emma\\" exceeded my expectations! I loved this movie! This is one of the best romantic stories I have in my colletion.

Maybe I was just in the mood for a different genre.Emma is the story of Emma Woodhouse \\"handsome, clever, rich\\". She is also extremely spoiled, and her favorite pastime is making matches for all her friends; pairing them up with men. Her beloved tutor, Miss Taylor, was recently married to Mr. Weston. Now Emma's attention has fallen on Harriet Smith. She pulls Harriet away from Mr. Martin, the man she truly loves, and tries to match her up with Mr. Elton, a wealthy handsome young vicar, with disastrous consequences. That's the main plot.There are several other side-stories: that of Jane Fairfax, an orphan taken in by a friend of her father, Frank Churchill, Mr. Weston's son who was adopted by his uncle, and of course, Emma and Mr. Knightley, a long-standing friend.Emma is a character that you don't like; I kept wishing that she would just mind her own business. Mr. Knightley redeems her a bit; he's smart, and realizes that Emma should not be interfering. But there's not much he can do about it. But he is a great character. Austen's writing is very light and witty, which I enjoyed.I read the Penguin Thread (Deluxe) edition, and I've got to say, it was just beautiful. Seeing the image doesn't do it justice.

Emma, the novel, is also a mystery. Both the two subsidiary leads, Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax seem to have secrets which are not revealed until the end of the novel.

Throughout the beginning of the novel, Emma is portrayed a nave child, with a broad imagination. Due to her broad imagination, Emma bases her own happiness solely upon her matchmaking abilities. However, although Emma has the best intentions, her actions eventually lead to the worst results.Through the key marriages of Mr. Elton, Mr. Churchill, and Mr. Knightley, the theme of self-revelation through the actions of marriage is revealed in the novel, Emma.Emma attempts to make a match between When Harriet Smith and Mr. Elton. However she is blinded in noticing Mr. Elton's love for her. Mr. Elton does declare his love for Emma, which leaves her bewildered. After this incident, Emma's first revelation is that her matchmaking abilities are flawed and resolves that she will no longer match-make.Emma then meets Frank Churchill. Emma soon begins to realize that she might be in love with Frank Churchill. However, soon after Emma learns of the impending marriage between Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax.However, soon after this event, Emma's third revelation begins to arise. Emma recovers from the disappointing event concerning the marriage of Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax, and finds herself suddenly appreciating Mr. Knightley. Emma now begins to realize at this point in the novel that Mr. Knightley is her true love.In the beginning of the novel, Emma Woodhouse is portrayed as a conceited and imaginative child, who lacks the knowledge of true love and self-respect. At the end of the novel, through the events of marriage between Mr. Elton, Mr. Churchill, and Mr. Knightley, Emma ironically becomes a mature and selfless woman. Although Emma's character throughout the novel changes dramatically from a spoiled heiress to a mature and selfless woman, I believe that Emma's endurance and triumph of numerous obstacles of oppression, gave her the strength to liberate herself from her stereotypically society, thus allowing her to realize and attain her own desires and dreams.In conclusion, I would consider Emma a very good book. However, I think the novel's only faults are that it was extremely long and at some points very difficult to understand."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma is a great classic novel and probably one of Jane Austen's best!

Upon the marriage of her governess, a match Emma purports to have arranged herself, Emma next turns to finding a suitable husband for her new young friend, Harriet Smith. She encourages Harriet into an infatuation with the vicar, Mr. Elton. Her plans fall apart, however, when Elton reveals to Emma that she is the true object of his affections. Rejected, Mr. Elton flees to Bath and finds a wife almost immediately. When the long-awaited Frank Churchill finally comes to visit, the entire social set of Highbury is swept into a tangle of suspicion, charm and deceit. Although Frank is commonly viewed as a perfect match for Emma, she feels only friendship for him, and views him instead as a potential husband for Harriet. In spite of Emma's multiple failed attempts at matchmaking, there are two couples married and one engaged by the end of the novel.Jane Austen was one of eight children, the daughter of an upper middle-class clergyman. Although her family was not wealthy, they led comfortable, socially respectable lives. Well-educated and with a love of reading, Jane Austen began to write at the age of twelve. She never married. Her first novel, Sense & Sensibility, was published in 1811, followed by Pride & Prejudice. All of her novels were published anonymously. She died in 1817, and is buried in Winchester Cathedral.I found this book to be as charming and delightful as the film, which I first fell in love with long ago. Jane Austen's wit is very much in evidence throughout the novel, and greatly improves what might otherwise be a somewhat dry style. Austen referred to Emma as \\"a heroine whom no one but myself will like much.\\" However, I found Emma to be engaging and delightful. I recommend this book to all fans of Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"So what does a &quot;handsome, clever, and rich&quot; girl like Emma Woodhouse do when she has no professional aspirations and no intention ever to marry? In addition to painting, playing the piano, and condescendingly visiting the poor, she is what might be called a social organizer, which primarily means finding husbands for single women and arranging all the social details involved in doing so. Her decision not to marry stems from her opinion, conceited but sincere, that there's not a man out there who could entertain her as a lifemate; and besides, with her mother pushing up daisies and her older sister Isabella living away in her own marriage, she already has a husband: her father.Jane Austen's novel weaves a group of several characters, balanced almost equally between men and women, into a web of romance in which the reader is led through various scenes and situations in a guessing game of who will end up with whom. Emma makes herself the prime mover of this group, but she is not as infallible a love broker as she would like to think. After she has successfully matched her childhood governess Miss Taylor with an affluent man named Weston, she turns her attention to the naive and impressionable Harriet Smith, for whom she has identified the young vicar Mr. Elton as a suitable beau. But then Elton declares his love for Emma, who of course is not interested in him, and...oh, what a mess.The plot thickens when a pretty girl named Jane Fairfax arrives in town to inspire Emma's curiosity and jealousy because she, unlike Harriet, is charming enough not to need Emma's assistance and tutelage. The main heartthrob among the women is Frank Churchill, actually Weston's son from a previous marriage, an impulsive and not totally honest young man whose amorous unpredictabilities shake the foundations of Emma's schemes. The man designed to be a traditional hero is George Knightley, sixteen years Emma's senior, who acts as Emma's moral anchor and monitors her matchmaking endeavors, gently cutting her down to size when her head gets a little too big, such as when she tells him that Robert Martin, a farmer, isn't of the proper class to be Harriet's husband.Austen maintains the right narrative pace, giving her major characters just enough room to develop themselves plausibly through interactions with some colorful minor characters. Emma's father, the slow-on-the-uptake Mr. Woodhouse, a man of extreme sensitivity to gastronomical disorders and temperature fluctuations, is an innocuous but amiable fellow who appreciates his daughter's loyal devotion but is judiciously content to remain in the background of her life and activities. The Highbury seniors are represented by the elderly Mrs. Bates and her slightly less elderly daughter Miss Bates, who has a marvelous talent for prattling about trifles in which nobody else is interested. She can be outdone only by Miss Suckling, the annoying chatterbox Elton decides to marry after being jilted by Emma.Emma is not a bad or cruel person--she genuinely feels guilty about Harriet's continual romantic misfortunes and her own momentary sarcastic behavior towards Miss Bates. However, it cannot be denied that she's a snob whose goal is a Perfect Society with all the right ladies married to the right men, and to hell with all those other little people (the farmers, the servants, the unattractive, etc.) who don't fit into her master plan. But Austen herself admitted this much, showing that Emma is far from perfect herself and allowing her to learn a lesson in humility by the end of the novel, for which she is duly rewarded--the denouement is a little too neat, but of a style so familiar to us by now that &quot;Emma&quot; seems nearly two centuries ahead of its time."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I can never decide whether Pride and Prejudice or Emma is my favourite book by Jane Austen. Emma has all the Jane Austen hallmarks - wit, exuberance, and laugh out loud moments, coupled with realistic, well drawn characters and a real feeling of being in the Regency (which is hardly surprising, as that's when the book was written).Emma is a spoiled young woman who has everything she can possibly want in life: a doting father who lets her do as she pleases, friends, family and a beautiful home. She is understandably please with herself, and this leads to complications as she tries to sort out everyone else's life. She's meddling and interfering, and yet so well meaning she comes across as a likeable character rather than as a busybody.She takes up Harriet, a young woman of doubtful birth, and encourages her to set her sights on Mr Elton, the local vicar, as a future husband. Poor Harriet is completely bowled over by Emma, and is persuaded to like Mr Elton over the farmer's son she is really in love with. Emma is oblivious to the fact that Harriet and Mr Elton are completely unsuited, and that Harriet and her farmer are made for each other.Through a variety of hilarious scenes, Emma comes to realize she doesn't know as much as she thought, and learns that it's better to let other people manage their own lives.The minor characters are wonderful: Mrs Elton with her barouche landau (anyone who's read the book will know what I mean), sweet Miss Bates, and dreadful Mr Elton, who has designs on Emma.Eventually, Emma learns how to understand her own feelings, and leaves everyone else free to listen to theirs, which leads to a satisfying ending all round.Hugely enjoyable."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"This is my favorite Jane Austen novel. Yes, Emma the heroine is a flawed human being. She is a spoiled little rich girl always trying to manage other people's lives, an effort that never turns out well. For example, she convinces her less-well-off friend, Harriet Smith, that she deserves better than the honest farmer who loves her and whom Harriet loves, and almost upsets Harriet's chances of happiness as a result. Emma continues in this vein throughout the book, at times being on the verge of doing serious harm, until at last the moment of enlightenment comes - a moment filled with shame and confusion.Of course, the overall plot in this as in all other Austen novels is the problem of getting married, and in that respect these books represent the original \\"chick lit.\\" The difference, of course, lies in Austen's brilliant satire of characters like Miss Bates, the village gossip, and in her glorious ability to make the words sing."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I felt that Emma was a great book and an informative look into the past, when it was written around 1815. It was interesting to read how everyone called the other Mr., Miss, or Mrs. It was a little confusing because of this, because, for example, there is a Miss Bates and a Mrs. Bates, and sometimes it's hard to remember which is which!The story is a good one, a great novel that pulls you in, but with lengthy descriptions, and once in awhile it drags. Throughout the story, my 21st century \\"hurry up\\" mode would prefer it to move along more quickly.The storyline, similarly, is also a bit slow at times, but it's a wonderful romantic novel with a human character like Emma. She has flaws, but is enchanting, as are the rest of the characters in the book. it's also very humorous and has a great ironic twist. I definitely recommend it, but to at least a freshman in high school, because it is a challenging book."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"i absolutely love this novel. I am a huge fan of classic literature and jane austen is by far my favorite author. emma is at the top of my book list.i hated her and loved her at the same time. i got wrapped by be the romanicism of the era and all it's wonderful characters.if you ever want to get lost in a novel; this is the one to chose."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I just reread this treasure for my book club. I first read it when I was about seventeen, and I loved it as much this time as I did then. It is truly a joy to read such wonderful writing and be so sweetly entertained.The character of Emma is so fully realized and believable. Her ineptness as a matchmaker simply adds to her appeal, and makes you love her even more for her shortcomings. And the inevitable romance that finally comes to be near the end of the novel is so completely rewarding, that you will be smiling broadly as you read the last few pages.Of Austen's novels, I've only read Emma and Pride and Prejudice. After completing Emma for the second time, I'm eager to pick up her other books and lose myself in her enchanting narrative."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"At age 13, I found the language challenging, but today at 17 I find it delightful. Nothing agrees with me more than rereading my now favorite book. Though the language is challenging for a young or first time Jane Austin reader it is well worth wading through the odd words and strange grammer to see into the heart of the story.The story touches so close to my heart it is a pleasure to read and dream of that someday romance with me in the place of any one of Austin's ladies. Now if I can find a man as gentlemanly, handsome and kind as Mr. Kingley."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma Woodhouse, \\"handsome, clever, and rich,\\" is the 21-year-old daughter of the elderly owner of Hartfield, the largest estate in Highbury. Though only a couple of hours away from London by carriage, Highbury regards itself as an isolated and virtually self-contained community, with the Woodhouse family the center of social life and at the top of its social ladder.Emma, doting on her hypochondriac father, whom she represents to the outside world, has grown up without a mother's softening influence, and at twenty-one, she is bright, willful, and not a little spoiled. Having too little to do to keep out of trouble, Emma's hobby is matchmaking, \\"the greatest amusement in the world.\\" Unfortunately, her sophistication in the social graces does not extend to much insight into human beings.Taking Harriet Smith, a young woman of \\"questionable birth\\" under her wing, Emma makes Harriet her \\"project,\\" educating her in the social graces, convincing Harriet not to marry farmer Robert Martin, who has courted her, and ultimately persuading Harriet, wrongly, that the vicar, Mr. Elton, is falling in love with her.Bored and without a large circle of \\"suitable\\" friends, Emma is an incorrigible meddler, playing with the lives of those around her, snubbing those she considers inferior, gossiping about others in an attempt to divert attention to herself, and misreading intentions. Only Mr. Knightly, sixteen years older than Emma and a friend of her father, stands up to Emma and tells her what he thinks of her behavior, and it is through him that she eventually begins to grow.Love and the formal protocol or marriage are a major focus here, with marriage more often a merger of \\"appropriate\\" families than the result of romance or passion. Class distinctions, acknowledged by all levels of society, limit both personal friendships and romantic possibilities, and as Emma's matchmaking fails again and again, causing grief to many of her victims, Emma begins to recognize that her pride, willfulness, and love of power over others have made her oblivious to her own faults.Austen shines in her depiction of Emma and her upperclass friends, gently satirizing their weaknesses but leaving room for them to learn from their mistakes-if only they can learn to recognize the ironies in their lives. Though Emma may be, in some ways, Austen's least charming heroine, she is certainly vibrant and, with her annoying faults, a most realistic one. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I love reading romance novels from 18th century and Emma kept me glued to my kindle. It is a long book, but worth every page."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Just to note: This review is of the Almost Sunday Publishing kindle edition.If you are like me, you want to buy books at the cheapest price you can get, while still getting good quality. Good news! The kindle version of this book is flawless as far as I can tell. It is simply the text, with chapters that you can jump to. There are NO annoying pictures among the text at all.The story itself is VERY good, and easy to read even though it was written over 200 years ago. I found it very amusing to read Emma's antics, and I could definitely relate to her and the other characters. For more on the plot, you can easy look at the other versions.The bottom-line is if you are looking for Austen for a low price, this one is the way to go!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Out of all Jane Austen's heroines, Emma Woodhouse is perhaps the most unique and the most beloved. Unlike all the others, Emma is a wealthy young woman who does not have the pressure of making a good marriage to ensure her happiness and in fact is determined never to wed. Likewise, due to the affections of her father and governess, Emma has been indulged and encouraged all her life into behaving just as she pleases, and as one of the few members of nobility in the small county of Highbury she is a big fish in a very small pond. Due to this, she considers herself superior to others and confident of her own perception of things: to put it simply, she is a snob. Yet she is not dislikeable - she is loving, well-mannered and kind, and deep down she realises that many of her actions are folly - it just takes her a while to get to these conclusions.Crediting herself for the recent marriage of her governess to the estimable Mr Weston, Emma takes it upon herself to play matchmaker for Highbury's society. Her eye is fixed on the eligible clergyman Mr Elton as an excellent match for her new friend Harriet Smith, a girl of obscure birth and minimal wealth. Despite the cynicism of Mr Knightley, an old family friend and the caution of her dear Mrs Weston, Emma is too wrapped up in her own opinions of how human hearts work to heed their advice...Further irony is found in the fact that whilst Emma is busy organising the hearts and minds of those around her, she has utterly no regard for her own and finds on many occasions that her perceptions of people were completely mistaken. But this is where readers' affection for her lies: she is beloved *for* her faults, not in spite of them, and such imperfections make her a rich, understandable character. Furthermore, these faults give her room to grow and improve as a person, and she is not the same Emma at the end of the book as she was at the beginning.\\"Emma\\" is also filled with many memorable supporting characters, very few of which are painted in black and white terms - rather they are small portraits of true human life, each with their own good and bad attributes. There is the talkative Miss Bates and her niece Miss Jane Fairfax (who Emma is cool toward due to the fact she detracts attention away from herself), the pretentious Eltons, Emma's sister and brother-in-law, and the and the dashing Frank Churchill, (Mr Weston's son) on whom rest many hopes by his family of an alliance with Miss Woodhouse.Austen writes in beautifully delicate language, which is filled with many of her best moments of wit and insight into the human condition, especially in her themes of social hierarchy and acceptable forms of manners. It is a common belief that authors of the past are hardly ever critical of their own times or station - Austen gloriously proves these narrow-minded people wrong as she weaves together her characters and their various ways of life with commentary on them all. Like all such reads, it's not for a lazy reader as it needs your constant attention and care. But like all truly good literature, it is well worth the effort and considered the best novel in the Jane Austen canon."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Written by renowned author Jane Austen, Emma is quite an intimidating book to attempt at first glance and takes some patience to read; yet the patience is greatly rewarded. 21-year-old Emma Woodhouse is young, beautiful, rich and witty. She finds satisfaction in her successes and pleasure in the art of matchmaking for others. In her arrogance, she believes that she knows what is right for everyone, and is determined to \\"set the world straight\\", appointing herself cupid for all of Highbury. Fortunately, Emma is eventually \\"enlightened\\", drawn out of her self-delusion, and everything works out in the end. Jane Austen's admirable style and incomparable charm gets away with the happy ending without seeming like a sappy soap opera.The characters in Emma are many, yet all incredibly human. Through wonderfully witty dialogue, these characters are depicted with amazing clarity. Emma's confidence in her knowledge of the world and ability to plan out the lives of others is simply hilarious! It's impossible not to fall in love with her wit, humor, good intentions, and ignorance. Of course, the paranoid Mr. Woodhouse, the talkative Miss Bates, and the innocent Harriet are also memorable characters. The wonders, complications, and misunderstandings of love and marriage are told brilliantly in this entertaining novel!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"A wonderful read! This is a story about a girl named Emma. She is pretty, wealthy, and a little bit haughty. And why not, since she is of a social standing where she feels she's entitled to look down on those inferior to her position. Even though she had such superior airs, I still couldn't help but liking Emma.She tries to play matchmaker to a new friend, and it's a disaster. Despite her actions, I couldn't dislike the character of Emma. She does feel guilty and remorse when she realizes her actions causes turmoil and pain for others. She feels horrible when she realizes her misconceptions of others. She is contrite and sorry for the trouble she causes to those around her.I think one of the things I liked best about this book was the characters. There were so many places where I laughed aloud at Emma's father for his eccentricity and odd behaviors, or reading Emma's thoughts on certain people. It was really a delight to read!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Almost universally, I find books to be far superior to their movie version, and I think most avid readers would be inclined to agree. However, in this case, without having seen the film first, I never would have considered reading this book because I often steer away from classics, finding them difficult to understand and hard to follow. I was quite enamoured with the highly romantic film Emma starring Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeremy Northam that I felt inspired to listen to this audiobook. The reader did an outstanding job of making me feel as though the story was happening around me and I was a part of this community, and actively participating in their festivities.Of course, my analytical mind couldn't help comparing and contrasting the book with the film. There are so many different characters, many of whom had very minor roles, or were spoken of but never appeared in any actual scene. Having seen the film first, it was far easier to \\"know\\" who everyone was, and how they related to each other. The book had many more scenes that filled in more details and had deeper character development, which drew me into the story more intensely than before. There were aspects of the film that seemed more romantic (the interactions between Emma and Mr Knightly, for example), and I preferred the way the film ended as compared to the book. But in both versions, Mr. Knightly was extremely swoon-worthy!!!I feel very inspired to read the book in print, now that I am sure to understand and appreciate it to its fullest. And I have just ordered the DVD film version starring Kate Beckensale, which is reputed to be the most romantic of all!! I have officially been \\"turned-on\\" to Jane Austen, and plan to read her other books, comparing and contrasting them to their respective film versions as I have so enjoyed doing with Emma."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Siri Amster- OlszewskiAugust 24, 2006Emma, by Jane Austen, was one of the most enjoyable books I have read recently. I chose to read Emma because, having read and loved Pride and Prejudice by the same author, I wanted to explore her other books as well. The characters in Austen's stories are both intriguing and comical and her description of the era in which they take place creates a clear view of society in those timesI was enchanted with Emma because Austen beautifully blends together a simple story of a girl and a documentation of the societal behaviors of the time. It provides insights into the life and social customs of a lady living in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.One of the book's principle topics is marriage. The main character, Emma, approves of matchmaking for marriage and, through her, the reader gets a view into the different motives for marriage. For some people, marriage was simply a way to advance in social status; for others, marriage was for love. In Emma's time, marriages had to be matched according to social status. One could not marry below their status. Marrying too far above one's status could end up disastrously.The book tells the story of Emma Woodhouse who is a pretty, wealthy, poised, and clever young woman. Her mother died when she was too young to remember or miss her and was raised mainly by her governess, Miss Taylor. Miss Taylor behaved like a best friend rather than a governess due to her mild temper and love for Emma. Therefore, Emma grew up without any firm rules or structure. This freedom caused her to think quite highly of herself and of her opinions. It was her excessive self-confidence that led her to often make mistakes creating misfortunes for others and embarrassment for herself.Jane Austen, by the style of her writing, creates some well-defined character while including other character that are left more open to the reader interpretations. For example, while Emma's faults are very apparent, I found her innocence to be charming and it created sympathy for her character. Other examples of characters like Emma are Jain Fairfax, Harriet Smith, and Mr. Elton. In contrast the character of Mr. Knightly, the family friend is set in stone. Within the first few pages of the book he is established as the moral role model of the story. Mr. Woodhouse, Mr. Weston, Mrs. Weston (the former Miss Taylor), Frank Churchill, and Miss Bates are all other characters that give off a particular feeling, the feeling that Austen intended. These characters all have good and bad qualities, all of which are left up to the interpretation of the reader. The novel is written in third person, however the detached narrator often sees through Emma's point of view. Having the effect of a not so neutral bystander.I highly recommend Emma to anyone who enjoys a light-hearted, witty book that captivates and enchants. While reading this book you will find yourself captivated in the pages of one of Jane Austen's masterpieces."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I admit, it has been a few years since I read Emma. I haven't gotten to read the rest of Austen's works (yet!), but I think she is a fine writer. As a writer, that's a high compliment. I don't mean to say she's, well, fine.. I mean she is fine and honed and respectable.. and great.I picked this book up at my library when I was tired of random teen angst-based novels about first boyfriends and horrible pasts. I wanted something written with real language, with a style. I wanted something old and truly good, like the classics I had read and been read as a young child. I wanted something with SUBSTANCE.Because of this, it took me awhile to get back in the habit of really reading. For a week or so, Emma lay in a drawer, only partway read. It was difficult not to skim and my head would swim with the small print and dark pages. I lamented, but shrugged it off as life got busy.I came out of the shower one day, with an urge to get back into it, and ended up standing, hair wet, in front of my dresser, book rooted up out of the confines of my underthings, and wasting time.I read it constantly until I finished it, as I always do when reading a new book, but this one was different. This one invoked a hunger in me, and I was definitely satisfied when it came to an end.The constant little subplots and dramas surrounding arrogant, but rather good-natured Emma, the engaging characters, with such distinct and memorable personalities, and the wonderful twist of the ending (everyone else says they were so sure, but I, for one, was surprised, I admit) were all...wonderful. Austen is, I say again, a fine writer, and no wonder she is of the classics.I have heard, as well, that she did not think anyone else would love Emma. I ask, how could you not? The people who are so vehement about her flaws clearly have many of the same. She is one of the most enjoyable heroines I have had the pleasure of visiting, among such \\"flawed\\" characters as Anne Shirley (her incessant daydreaming and such a temper! ;), in all my years of reading. And that's a very long time."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Jane Austen perfects the art of character development in Emma. The long, twisted plot carefully and slowly develops each character using rich detail that makes the characters come alive with personality. Without the rich detail and character development, I do not feel this book would have stood the test of time and become the classic that it is. Emma is a heart-warming book with enough orneriness mixed in to make it amusing."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"After reading this novel, I realized how entertaining/touching an old book could actually be. The story was about a woman (Emma) who despised marriage, and felt that there was no need to dedicate her life to only one person. I felt that Emma was a very strong character, she knew what she wanted and would not let anyone alter her decision about marriage. However, at the end of the novel the character succumbs to societal pressures and marries the man (Mr. Knightely) that desires her companionship. That shows that her character's personality is not as strong as it seems. Throughout the whole novel she lets the reader believe that nobody could ever modify her view on marriage. Yet, I feel that the love story was very touching, not many people are dedicated to a person to the point where they will wait for them for as long as needed. Love conquers all is a saying that I have always wished to be true, but never thought that it was possible. Emma swore that she would never change her mind on this issue, but after admitting to herself that she was in love with this man, she desired to be with him as much as he did with her. After reading this novel, I realized that people can have soul mates, and that if you really love someone, never let them go because you never know what will happen. I feel that everyone should read this book, because even though it was written over a century ago, individuals now are able to read it and feel like they can relate to the characters, at least I felt that I could."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma is a wonderful story. It's a timeless story and worth reading. Very light and amusing."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I can't believe the people who found this book too long and too hard. Not that it doesn't have its difficult places, but come on ...This is a fine book, great for someone in their early teens who want to read some classics and who have half a brain in their heads. For the rest of their peers, I hear Jewel has a book of poetry you can try out."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I was amazed to read all those reviews by people who gave EMMA ratings of 1 and 2. they obviously missed the point of the novel and were too ignorant to understand it (which I find hard to believe considering I'm only 11 and I read it when I was 9). EMMA made me laugh, cry and everything in-between. It's a classic worth reading over and over again."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma is twenty years old, living in the countryside of Victorian England. Her father is a wealthy hypochondriac, constantly worried about his own health or the health of others. He dotes on Emma and can see no wrong in anything she does. Emma's mother died when she was a small child, and her older sister married and moved away some years ago. This leaves her as the mistress of her estate, with much leisure time to interact with her socially acceptable neighbors and to try her hand at matchmaking.At first Emma's schemes seem to be going well. She decides that her new friend Harriet, although not of the same social level as Emma, would be perfect for Mr. Elton, a well-connected neighbor. Everything seems to be as Emma had hoped.... until it all falls apart in misunderstanding and hurt feelings.Emma is stubborn, though, and refuses to give up even when things among her social circle get more and more confused. Will she be a successful matchmaker? Will she decide to give up her determination never to get married?I found the characters in this novel very dull and shallow. I didn't find Emma at all appealing, nor did I like any of the other characters in this book. Some of the writing is beautiful and it was interesting to get a glimpse into what life was like at this time, but I found the plot utterly predictable and was a bit frustrated that it took so long for all of the mistakes to sort themselves out."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"True to Jane Austen's prediction that with the creation of her character Emma was a person that not many people would like, Emma is one of the least likable characters in British literature.This snobby, rich and manipulating heroine was despicable to the end, yet the book was hilarious to read. The characterizations were complete and read like real and interesting people. There were the irriating Bates', the hypochondriac Father, the dashing and elegant neighbor and brother-in-law, the accomplished Jane Fairfax that Emma is fiercely jealous of, and the fawning lower class friend Emma wants to &quot;set up.&quot;The comic exchanges between characters, the complexity of the plot and the witty back-and-forth between the &quot;players&quot; makes reading Emma a lot of fun indeed. You don't have to like or agree with Emma the character to enjoy this great piece of literature. If not for Jane Austen's intriguing use of the English language that just sucks you in and holds you captive, I could have never gotten through this book with so much joy and entertainment for my clear disdain of the puppeteer Emma.However, that's what makes the book a masterpiece and why we still enjoy it 200 years later. For a more true, well-rounded heroine, I prefer Anne of Persuasion and Elizabeth of Pride and Prejudice. Both novels have likable leading characters created by Jane Austen.Emma is rich with complexity and rife with interesting, funny interludes and dialogue between the characters. Depite it's flawed main character, it was highly enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Those who gave this book a three or lower must not know how to appreciate formal writing. I'M SORRY! MOST OF WHAT THEY SAID IN THE BOOK MUST HAVE GONE RIGHT OVER YOUR HEADS! Those who thought it was boring, it did have a plot because HELLO! that was the time period and that's what they did. Go out and learn something for once. Some people can be so stubborn. Hey, go out and read Remains of the Day. That was about a butler. And it was great. Emma was a good book. It's a good story. But I guess some people are to busy staring at the TV screen to notice. I recommend the movie Godzilla for you guys. Packed with action and (guess what?) no plot."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I absolutely loved Pride and Prejudice, and Sense and Sensibility, but I found Emma to be pretty boring. It's not that I didn't like the story- I did, but it was such a tedious thing to read. Anyone who read this book before Austen's others would be turned off. I would not recommend it."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"This book was excellent I recommend this book to every young lady out there. But then again books have there problems this book kind of has some problems. Sorry Jane Austen fans!

It a good one to start with if you've never read one of Austen's novels before."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I am 11 and a 1/2 years old and simple love books that take place in Europe in the 1700 or 1800's. However, this book was absolutly boring. Out of all of Austens works, which are not all to exciting themselves, this has to be the most boring and drawn out. There are long pauses of nothing but tea and long walks, and once in a while Emma will set up one of her friends. This match does not last long, however. Personaly if I were her &quot;friend&quot; Harriet, I would think myself better off without her companionship. To my knowledge Jane Austen wrote this &quot;little gem&quot; for the prince of England whom she did not exactly admire. I wouldn't be surprized if his didn't admire her so much after he finished reading it. If you are looking for a exciting and gripping book do not choose Emma."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I hate it. So boring. I fell asleep at the first page. its great if youre into that old 1800s kind of speech."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Four hundred pages of the idle rich filling up their vain and empty lives by meddling in other people's affairs while exchanging gossip and pointless drivel about their relative social standing, followed by one hundred pages of an embarrassingly bad romance novel, plus one very annoying character (Emma's father) who clearly has undiagnosed Asperger's syndrome. I wanted to slap everyone in the book. The only happy ending for this book would have been for all the characters to lose all their money and have to get jobs and actually do something for a living. Yes, I understand the points that Austen was trying to make about social mores etc., but those points were clearly made within the first 20 pages; the remaining 480 were superfluous. I wanted to rate this book higher by saying that \\"although the characters and plot are insipid, annoying, and boring, the writing was wonderful,\\" but I can't, because Austen's writing is almost as annoying as her plot."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Yep, that's about the only claim to fame of this shallow, eye-batting bit of fluff and nonsense. Needed some sex to spice it up and maybe a few curse words or a little war, courtesy of Napoleon across the Channel. Sex 'n violence, that's the key. I mean couldn't Emma have been ravished a little by one of the courtly fops who paid a call and couldn't she have gouged an eye out with a hairpin or red-hot poker in defense of her virtue? Helllooo, action and excitement, like Clarissa had a century earlier with Richardson? He knew a thing or two about keeping a bored middle school honors English class going. Yep. It would've helped. I've held a grudge against this insipid it's-somehow-great-because-it's-old bubble-headed tripe since it was forced on me like a bad blind date in the 8th grade. I hated this book. The only reason I'm giving it three stars instead of lower is that it did have a few redeeming moments and plus anything from another age that gives us a small peek into the lifestyles of the past (even a shallow and vain group of peasant-exploiting petty aristocratic-wanna-bes from the past) is worth something. Oh, plus there was the whole Clueless spin-off thing. Yeah, Clueless was so huge to us in the mid-90's we even used to go, \\"WWAD?\\" (What Would Alicia Do?) So I can't let myself utterly excoriate this headache-inducing, bulimia-inspiring, plot-thin-as-supermodel-tale from the dim brain of Miss Austen, a woman deeply in need of a good love affair. (If you catch what I'm saying.)It mystifies me they managed to make a passable film version out of Emma ten years ago during the Austen craze in Hollywood. If only the book had been that tolerable.All right, Austen fans, slam my review if you want, but all you readers-for-fun out there, those of you I might have saved from a long boring nothing-happens kinda novel: YOU'RE WELCOME!!!!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I endured through the entire audiobook because I finish what I start but this book had very little interest for me. First I think it's a chick book, one that women would find more interesting, second it's about a spoiled brat that thinks herself the world, with which most readers will not sympathize. Maybe the book was great in the time when it was published, but the style does not suit me for these reasons. The setting was not interesting for me: 18th century England in the countryside where nothing happens, where propriety is more important that authenticity and passion. The climax of the novel, like the contemporary English culture, is all too subtle for my taste and like the rest of the book lacks the drama that I expected from this supposed classic. In short I think other great books have lasted the test of time but this is certainly not one of them. It too easily loses your attention."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"After reading Emma by Jane Austin I am very much considering not reading another book by Jane Austen.I was very dissapoited with the book.

If I can suffer through 10 pages a day, I think I'm doing well. I plan some type of celebration once I'm done.One of my graduate students used the word \\"tedious\\" to describe Jane Austen. I agree 100%. Sometimes you must read a sentence a dozen times; then, maybe, you have an inkling of what Ms. Austen is trying to say. Maybe not. She simply goes on and on and on.Personally, it's novels like \\"Emma\\" (or any other novel by the outdated Ms. Austen) that turn kids against literature. When I was in the 10th grade, we had to read \\"Silas Marner,\\" a totally painful experience. I reread it years later, thinking maybe I had misjudged it as a teen. I had. It was even more painful.i'm really thinking about beginning a Website, \\"Real Men Don't Read Jane Austen.\\" But that's sexist, isn't it? I can only hear Ms. Austin responding, \\"Do you mean to say if real men don't read me, unreal men do? What's an unreal man? Are there both real men and unreal men in the world?

While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).Modern readers tend to be unfairly squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more.

A lesser delight."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"In the quiet and picturesque village of Highbury there lived a self-professed matchmaker of little experience and expertise yet she believed herself to be in possession of superior observational skills and the ability to see into everyone's heart. Emma Woodhouse, our twenty-one year old matchmaker of Highbury, rates the marriage of her governess to a wealthy and respected gentleman, Mr. Weston, as one of her laudable matchmaking successes and decidedly takes on the challenge of finding a suitable wife for the vicar of Highbury, Mr. Elton. Alas, Emma is not the talented matchmaker she thinks she is and makes frequent blunders in judgment and is often blind to the romantic inclinations of the people around her...What then ensues is a spectacular comedy of manners that is heartwarming, satirical, lively, and charming.Mr. George Knightley, brother-in-law to Emma, does not approve of Emma's new matchmaking hobby or her new friendship with Harriet Smith, \\"the natural daughter of nobody knows whom.\\" Harriet Smith, a seventeen year old parlour border at the local school, is inferior to Emma in sophistication and sense. Mr. Knightley would much rather see Emma with a companion that is her equal in intelligence and influence her positively. Mr. Knightley is one of the few people in Emma's life that recognizes her faults; and believing her too often indulged and spoiled he makes no qualms about admonishing her for these faults. Unfortunately, Emma is often willful and ignores Mr. Knightley's wise counsel.Jane Austen is quoted to have said Emma was a \\"heroine whom no one but myself will much like.\\" This is true for some Austen fans who rank Emma Woodhouse as one of their least favorite heroines. However, there many readers that find her likable and claim her to be one of their favorite Austen characters. Emma Woodhouse is unique in that she is wealthy and well provided for, thus giving her little inducement to marry. In addition, even though she enjoys pairing up her friends and neighbors, Emma has little inclination or interest in finding love for herself and declares that she will never marry. (So much for having a romantic heroine!) Nonetheless, I am very fond of Emma, her lack of experience in the world has made her naive and the indulgence of her family has swelled her head, but she is not an unworthy or unlikable heroine. Throughout the course of this novel Jane Austen beautifully depicts the journey of Emma's maturation and displays her blossoming into a self-aware, humble, and sensible woman.My favorite thing about \\"Emma\\" is the charming village of Highbury and all who reside within. There is such a pleasant mix of endearing and exasperating characters: Miss Bates, a poor spinster who dearly loves to share news with her neighbors; Mr. Woodhouse, such a generous and a caring man who suffers from nervous anxieties about the health of his family and friends; Mr. Weston with his jolly and sanguine temperament; and Mrs. Elton, who believes herself to be the first in consequence in the town and is extremely vulgar and conceited. According to Miss Bates \\"there are few places with such society as Highbury.\\" How very true!While \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the most famous and popular of Jane Austen's six major novels, I believe that \\"Emma\\" is truly an excellent, accomplished novel that is not to be overlooked. I may not recommend it to someone for their first experience with Jane Austen, as it is a bit lengthier than the others, but I highly recommend it to readers who enjoy traveling to the time and world of Jane Austen whether it be in book or on screen!Austenesque Reviews"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel.

Emma prides herself on her matchmaking ability. The happiness of the marriage of her former governess is her obvious proof. When she takes on Harriet Smith as her charge and determines to find the perfect match for her, her attempts fail time and time again. Disappointed in the outcome of her attempts, she resolves to only contribute to Harriet's happiness as her friend. In the end, when it seems that a match for Harriet may finally be made between Harriet and Mr. Knightley, only then does Emma realize the truth she has denied for so long and the folly of what she worked so hard for may cost her heart.Emma is a classic by Jane Austen and this is my first time reading one of Austen's works. I certainly understand why the book is considered a classic. Austen engages the reader who wonders about the outcome until the very end. The style in which it is written requires thought and time to truly understand the story. It is definitely not one that can be read through at a high speed and still comprehended at a high level. Personally, I loved this book.

But none of her works (except maybe the humorously offbeat &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot;) can match the high standards set by &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;. There's the usual cast of comic characters, and some scenes really are a scream, but the heroine, Emma Woodhouse, and her 'consort' Frank Churchill are a bit too brattish for my liking. Their 'humour' (acidly bitchy spoilt brat gossip about the most kind-hearted and guileless members of the village) is just a little too vicious for me, and their appalling treatment of Jane Fairfax, and Harriet Smith, and the hilarious Miss Bates left me feeling a bit sick. Thank God Mr. Knightley's there to keep Emma in line.

I often listen to books when I commute and this did keep me occupied for many miles. I appreciate much of Austen's writing and her interesting character portrayal. It's also very interesting to note the rigid social structure of that time and place. However if I had to have read this in print, I doubt that I would have gotten through it.As others have said, the central character, Emma, is just not very likable. She is very rich, very spoiled, an only child who was pampered by a governess and a highly indulgent father and is granted the highest respect from everyone in their town due to nothing but her fortunate social position. This is not a person who is plagued by self-doubt! She believes that she is the cleverest person around and has no qualms about manipulating others. When not manipulating, she is abundant in her very, very snobbish judgments of others. True, she matures somewhat in the year that the novel covers, repenting of her past misdeeds and promising to become a better person. Still it's too little/too late for my taste and I can only wonder that the \\"hero\\" who appears to be a candidate for sainthood, has chosen Emma as his beloved. I think he would have been better off with any of the other women in the novel.There are so many other novels of the period that far surpass this one; don't waste your time on Emma."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"My first Jane Austen and I loved it!! A story of hope in a hopeless situation. The ending was a bit far fetched. All in all a delightful read that I will read again. I loved it!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma Woodhouse, the heroine of Emma, is often very hard to like. She is spoiled, impulsive, conceited, and rich. However, Austen's writing is, as always, richly detailed, light-hearted, and sharp-witted, which makes this classic book a must-read for anyone who has ever watched Masterpiece Theater, read women's or historical fiction, or dreamed of living in a time where women were oppressed but sure looked pretty doing it. If you read Austen in high school or when you were younger and found yourself bored to tears, I would suggest going back to give it another try. I read Pride and Prejudice when I was a young teen, and thought it was incredibly lame--who writes a romance without a long, passionate kiss? However, when I went back to Jane after watching a few of the movies, I found it surprisingly playful and humorous, with strong female and male characters, some excellent dramatic moments, and solid comic relief.Emma is definitely not my favorite Austen book. Emma is simply too manipulative and naive at the same time for me to really root for her or against her. But the quality of the writing alone is worth the trip. I've read this a few times now, and I always find something fresh in the dialogue, the observations, the interactions between female characters, and female and male characters. So, if it's been awhile, you're looking to read it for the first time, or you're simply looking for a well-written diversion, this is a great choice."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma was such a character who in my opinion, was a little bit too conceited - she had thought to know of the feelings of other people that made her feel very confident of her match-making skills; and yet, when these matches failed to be, she thought the failures were all her doing too! Just the same, as in any chick-lit novels, everything was well and as it should be towards the end.It took me almost three weeks to finish this book, and I questioned myself why. It just didn't have that pull on me that I sometimes found myself browsing the net rather than reading the book. It's always a struggle for me to read 18th century writings; I always have to go back and reread for a more thorough understanding of what's being said. This is my second book by Jane Austen, and I'm probably getting tired of all the ceremonious ways of her period. Still, I could not fault the writing, being from a long ago era and true to it; it also elicited \`hate and like' feelings towards the characters which is a sure indication of good literature...But still, I labored through it...so three stars to be fair to Ms. Austen and to myself."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"It's not my favorite, but I was still struck by how Austen knows the human heart so well. During the first part of the book, I wanted to spank Emma Woodhouse on several occasions. She was annoying, exasperating, conceited, arrogant, and so sure of herself that is was hard to read about her. However, underneath all that, Emma is really a kind, good, generous person. She treats her father with such tenderness and concern; that was a beautiful thing.But, I know women like her and when they discover their faults, they are full of recrimination. I just loved Austen's insight into women and their natures. Some of the characters are so real, so rich; Mrs. Elton, Miss Bates. But, I'm not sure there is someone as saintly and good and patient as Mr. Knightley; he was just not totally believable to me.However, over all, I enjoyed this book. I think Jane Austen is a remarkable writer; verbose, yes, but perhaps that is the way people talked then. At any rate, Emma is a book to read and enjoy if you like period literature!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"\\"Emma\\" isn't the most sophisticated or complex of Jane Austen's book but is my favorite by far. The characters, especially Emma, are funny and moving. I'm such a romantic and this is just delightfully fulfilling."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I'm reviewing the Penguin Classics edition rather than the content of the novel itself (which is wonderful). The cover is beautifully decorated, nicely textured, and sturdy, the introduction and notes are interesting but not obtrusive, the paper is high quality, the print is very readable (the font is not too small like some other editions of classic literature), and the colored ribbon adds a touch of refinement as well as utility. I've bought the other Austen novels in this Penguin series. They're among the most handsome books on my library shelf. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"\\"EMMA\\" may very well be my favorite Austen novel :) \\"PERSUASION\\" may be a close second, or possibly a tie for first!Jane Austen was so witty and engaging. I really come to care about her characters. It may be harder to read for someone who doesn't enjoy the language of period pieces.The social structure is also sometimes hard to stomach!AND, I might add, that anytime a classic is \\"free\\" for kindle, you should at least give it a try! How easy it has become to be \\"well read\\"!!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I purchased this copy of Emma and it was the first time I read it. The second Jane Austen I've read. I must say that I enjoyed Emma much more than Pride and Prejudice. I absolutely loved the humor in Emma."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"When Jane Austen sat down to write Emma, she had a tall order. Her previous work, Pride and Prejudice, is one of the great masterpieces in English literature. Unsurprisingly, Emma does not measure up to P&P, but is still a delightful read in its own right. The same themes that readers have come to associate with Jane Austen are all present in Emma: courtship, marriage, Victorian reserve, and, of course, social status. The biggest problem I had with Emma is that the characterization is not near as solid as in Austen's previous work. The only truly interesting character is the main protagonist, Emma, whose wit and vivacity sparkle throughout. The only fair way to read Emma is to do so without comparing it to Pride and Prejudice. Doing so, this book stands just fine upon its own merit. Just don't expect lightning to strike twice."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"My mom got this book from the library not long after we saw the movie with Gwyneth Paltrow. She found out in the movie credits that it was based on a book (we caught the movie on TV by chance) and found out it was by Jane Austen. Since her favorite book is Pride and Prejudice (which she had tried to get me to read for years without success) she read the book, as I did soon after. It's funny that even though Emma is one of Austen's longer books, it took only one movie to render it perfectly, whereas the much shorter Pride and Prejudice needed seven videos altogether!However, this is a review about the book, not the movie. Ahem. The book was great, and like all Austen's books never loses your interest. It is a bit drawn out and your mind may wander a bit during the course of the story, but it was a great story. Emma, the character Austen said no one would like, is much more likeable to me than the pathetic sop that is Fanny of Mansfield Park. She is much different than all other Austen characters; she is rich and has a thirty thousand pound dowry (at least I think so, I forget exactly; I read the book a while ago) which is a lot compared to the other penniless heroines who have at the most a thousand pounds. She is twenty-one, handsome, and though her snobbery is a turn off at the start of the book, you can't help but fall for her charms. She is, as the reviews say, irresistible. And Mr. Knightly is just like most other Austen heroes; a real dreamy guy -sigh- I'm so jealous of these girls. He's not romantic though, and unlike other books, the romance is a minimum, with barely an, \\"I love you\\" in sight.The situations are original and entertaining, and the mismatches of Emma the would-be matchmaker (with no sight in mind of marriage for herself) are very amusing. I would recommend this book to any Austen fan, but for beginners I would recommend Pride and Prejudice or Northanger Abbey, as they are shorter and much lighter, funnier stories. Emma is a bit more quaint. My only complaint is the speeches of that girl who talks too much, what's-her-name; she talks for pages on end, interrupts herself and is in general much more boring than amusing. Highly recommended, buy it now!!!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I confess: I often read Jane Austen as an exercise in self-discipline. However, caution should be exercised in reading her books. Little surprises turn up which force a certain circumspection of all characters and events. In \\"Emma\\", we meet with the practice of \\"giving up\\" children, illegitimacy and the concomitant existence of, and suspicion of, extra-marital sex, flirting clergymen who, naturally, view courtship as a Machiavellian enterprise, egotism, snobbery, hypochondria and maybe even a little attention deficit disorder--heroes, heroines, villains alike. It is a great tour de force. Austen draws her characters well--who hasn't met a Miss Bates or a Mrs. Elton in their lifetime? Finally, also watch out for those little dollops of wisdom interspersed throughout--they pop up, wake you up and then are gone, leaving you in the midst of the question of just what is the best way to prepare a piglet's leg."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Jane Austen's book Emma is creatively woven together with the characteristics of Emma Woodhouse, a young lady with much prestige. Even though the flaws of her character are questionable, her intentions are clear. Her role as a matchmaker during a unique time period creates a diversion from reality in the high social class where Emma resides. The encouragement by one lucky guess pushes her to create absolute non-sense. A reader only hopes to read faster in order to reveal and figure out the out come of all her mistakes. Emma hooks readers, addicting them to the humor and \\"tangled mess\\" in which she finds herself. This beautifully illustrated book quickly creates an exclusive impression every time it is read."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"As with all of Austen's novels, the reader will find the breadth of human character within the cover. The novel demonstrates a biting wit as well as a sentimenal side. I first read this book when I was fifteen and I was absolutely captivated. If you have not read this book then you are in for a treat."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"This book was wonderfully uplifting and entertaining. I enjoyed it immensely, and I believe you will as well, if you like amusing stories dealing with romance, confusion, friendship, matchmaking, and true love. Do not listen to some of the other reviews that say this book is a rip-off of Clueless. Obviously the people who posted those are incredibly ignorant, especially since Emma came out a very long time before Clueless, and if anyone was eligible to sue, it would be Jane Austen (if she was still alive) suing the makers of Clueless. Again, this was a very enjoyable book, and I would definately recommend it to anybody!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Actually, every Jane Austen is essential, so the title of this review is pretty unnecessary.I just finished Emma. I've had this book on my shelf for over a year, hesitant to read it because I've seen the movie (the Gwyneth version) about 100 times. I was worried that there would be no suspense in the book for me, having memorized the movie characters so well.I needn't have worried. Books are never the same as movies. I found even more to love about Emma as I read this book, and grew to like other characters (such as Jane Fairfax) more, and other characters, such as Frank Churchill less. While this book did not hold the suspense for me that Pride and Prejudice does (still!), it was nonetheless a great read and I can't wait to reread it next summer."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I am not normally a fan of this type of novel (hell, I read science fiction), but I read this book for an English AP class this summer, and I must say that I liked it. As a snapshot of English social life at the time it was written, it is faultless. The plot, while somewhat inconsequential by today's so-called &quot;standards&quot;, is entertaining, and leaves the reader in a state of suspense up 'till the conclusion. The dialogue is also very charming, witty, and definately a product of it's time, but relevant. There are novels throughout the history of literature that stand as epoches for certain time periods, and Emma can be realistically called one of them. It wraps up the early 19th century English social life period very well, and more realistically and less sense of being dated than Pride and Prejudice or some of Jane Austen's other novels (or those of her contemporaries.) If you like this type of novel it is a must read, or, if you're like me, it is something interesting to pick up when you want something different from what you usually read."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I absolutely loved this novel!! I'm also glad that before reading this novel I read Jane Austen's other famous works because I had practice with Austen's confusing vocabulary. Once I got used to it I was able to appreciate what was truly happening with Emma. I highly recommend this book to young girls that have a pedestrian outlook on love, because after reading this novel I learned that love isn't always about emotions but you have got to be sensible as well. Emma is a woman to be emulated, not because of her match-making attitude but of her convictions and strenght. She does not need a man to complete herself, but after finally allowing her eyes to open she does find bliss with the man she loves. I can go on and on about this novel, but then what would be the use of reading?? Get yourself a copy now! You won't regret it.."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"This was a book that I 'tried' to read in 5th grade and fell asleep, now years later I decided to give it another shot. To my suprise, Emma was a delightful book. At times it may seem boring, but at those times I learned to savor the details that I did read. I thoroughly enjoyed all the characters and plot twists. Jane Austin is an absolutely amazing author! I do not reccomend this book to younger kids who have trouble reading or get bored easily, but it is perfect for teenagers and up, esspecially girls. :)"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Having been a devoted fan since early childhood, I have read all of Miss Austen's books at least twice, and I find this the most endearing. 'Emma' is a dazzling combination of wit, not-too-dreadful mishaps, mild drama, and affectionate, though insightful, looks at society.Emma, though a little petted and given to overconfidence in her intellect (brilliant people often struggle so), is definitely endearing (even more so than Gwyneth Paltrow). And, of course, Miss Austen's inventive method of relating dialogue is delightful. Of Mr. Woodhouse, the definitive hypochondriac: &quot;He was afraid they should have a very bad drive...He did not know what they had best do...&quot; Jane Austen has a splendid way of drawing the characters through such dialogue - it is almost as if they come alive.If you ever read one book of Miss Austen's, read 'Emma'!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"By E.G. (AP)\\"Seldom, very seldom does complete truth belong to any human disclosure; seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised, or a little mistaken...\\" This was a hard lesson for twenty-one year old Emma Woodhouse to come by. Emma takes on the role of a matchmaker, believing it is in her power to arrange marriages. Predictably, Emma eventually fails at her task. Failure causes Emma to lose innocence and become less ignorant to what in fact she can control.Emma is of a rich family; she's good looking, and she's clever. Emma is held in awe by most, especially her father who believes she is flawless. With such qualities and ideals at her disposal, Emma has very little to distress or vex her. The same circumstances convince her that she will never marry and promote naivete making reality a hard concept for Emma to grasp.Emma lacks knowledge of societal expectations especially where marriage is concerned. Taking place during the Victorian time period, one was expected to marry inside his class. Emma doesn't grasp this ideal which leads to failure and disappointment in her pursuit of making matches.Emma tries to acquaint Mr. Knightley with Harriet and to a certain extent, Jane. Emma discovers that she's once again led herself and Harriet astray. This instance in the book along with the knowledge that Mr. Knightley is one of few that can see faults in Emma, foreshadows an eventual change in plot. This is also the point in the story that a change in Emma's character becomes evident.When reading Emma, allow yourself plenty of time. There are many intricate details Involving who's interested in who that are interwoven into the plot and would be easy to pass by if not reading leisurely. It may be helpful to read a passage twice if you find yourself questioning what just took place. In order to fully enjoy the story; don't hurry through the book.A few of the characters have similar names. Sometimes the only thing separating one person from another is a subtle Miss or Ms. This can be frustrating if you don't fully grasp whom the book is speaking of. Again, read slowly and reread a passage if there's confusion about who the talked of subject is.Some characters are void of the story for an extensive amount of the book. This is also frustrating, as it may be hard to recall what role the character plays. It's beneficial to jot down character names and a few descriptors about them so when they reappear, their role can be recalled. Or, you may want to take time to flip back in the book and reread the scene in which they first appeared.Jane Austen did an exceptional job of writing satirically in order to portray silly ideals that Emma and society held. The standards for which marriages were arranged by become superficial and absurd through Austen's diction. Because it is apparent to the reader that Emma is chasing a dead end with her beliefs of who has taken interest in who, it's humorous when Emma comes to this realization herself. Austen chose exaggerated adjectives of perfection to describe Emma this creates a snicker because obviously Emma is not perfect but rather nave.Emma recalls memories of high school dance date set-ups that went wrong. It's comical to think back on either playing the role of matchmaker or having been the victim of a matchmaker when the quest for a date to the homecoming dance or prom is thrown into full effect. Most times the involvement of a third party misconstrues things much like Emma did. Feelings can be hurt similar to those of the characters in Emma making the matchmaker feel foolish but hopefully providing a lesson to all involved."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma is a great story, the heroine, depicted to be a selfish woman, who has been raised to believe she has no flaws, shows us through the book, how she learns tobe a woman that many people would dream to be. She shows true nature, adn acts as any human would. Her ongoing task to matchmake all her friends end in disaster, but in the end all is well. She handles her problems as one should, adn learns not to think so highly of herself. People say that it is too &quot;worldy&quot; but the book is one of the classics, Jane Austen outdid herself, this is my favourite Jane Austen book, it shows us that we all have flaws,a d that no one is ever perfect."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I really thought this book was wonderful! It was the first Jane Austen book I've read and I loved it! It was easy for me to keep the characters staight because I saw the movie first but totally enjoyed it the book too. Most people who gave this book a bad review called it, &quot;boring&quot;. One thing you should know: Jane Austen is not a writer of action novels. She likes to spread the story out. For anyone who have read her other novels, you know what I mean. If you found this boring, you should wait until your a little older to read this one. Although I like P&amp;P better, this was definatly not a bad book if your in the right mode to read it."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I love this book because it's timeless. True, it's set in the 1800's, but this book could have been written today. I know it's hard to sympathize with Emma, but deep down she just wants to see everyone happy. I love the part where she finds her own match right under her nose. I recommend this book to everyone who likes historical romances."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I'm just wondering what kind of a world those clueless people live in, to think Jane Austen is robbing some 90s movie of its story?"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"On a personal note I loved the book as I do all other Jane Austen classics, but I'm not going to trash anyone else's opinion. No one book can ever be loved by everyone. For other readers that enjoyed this as much as I did don't get upset when others don't like it, they just don't WANT to have to translate the different dialect from a different country over a century ago. It's not that they can't, but the more modern setting suits them better. It is true you do have to be a serious reader to get through this novel. If you loose hope in the first few chapters you're not giving it enough time, at this point you've just been introduced to the characters, dialect, and culture of these people. The first 4 or 5 chapters are the hardest, but that's because you're having to learn so much with out any aids to guide you. For everyone who did not enjoy this no one should scoff at your taste, but in the future don't trash mine either. We have different taste neither is betteror worse, just different. For anyone interested, yes, their is a plot but you have to understand Jane Austen's style to see it. If you like a challenge and you like to have your heart pounding in tune with the characters this is a book for you. Bye the way, I am now 16 but I read three of Jane Austen's novels as a freshmen in high school. It's not impossible but it's not easy either.I also recomend &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; and &quot;Pride and Predjudice&quot; also by Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"As one of the few teenagers who will read Emma voluntarily, I'd just like to say that, thought the length is daunting, I loved reading it all the way through. I first found out about it through the movie and was hooked! I would recommend this book for anyone who likes a good plot with a good, happy ending."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Many writers and critics consider Emma, the last of Austen's novels published in her lifetime, the climax of her genius. Dominating the novel is the character of Emma Woodhouse--vital, Interesting, complex, and predisposed to playing power games with other people's emotions. Austen called her a heroine &quot;no one but myself would like,&quot; but she endures as one of Austen's immortal creations. Charting how Emma's disastrous foray as a matchmaker precipitates a crisis in the small provincial world of Highbury, and in her own heart, this novel of self-deceit and self-discovery sparkles with intelligence, wit, and irony. In fact, as critics say,Emma is indeed a fine piece of work which was was written, surprisingly, by someone who lived a rather secluded life. It has all the Austen trademarks, as the constant concern over marriage and social status, which was a poignant and true characteristic of her time."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Jane Austen was a truly gifted author whose simple stories, memorable characters, and insights into human nature make her writings as relevant today as they were in the early 1800's.Emma is the story of an attractive and fortunate young woman who has never had anything really bad happen in her life, and who believes herself to be much more wise and worldly than she actually is. For one who has led such a sheltered existence, never leaving home or intending to marry, Emma believes herself possessed of incredible powers of perception and feels that she knows what is best for those she loves far better than they could possibly know for themselves. It is this belief of hers that causes her to meddle in the affairs of those close to her, creating chaos, confusion, and misunderstandings everywhere. Her well-intentioned interference produes comical results and eventually teaches her a valuable lession about minding one's own beeswax.I was sorry to see this book end"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I have read few books written with such a brilliant pen. There is more than a touch of sarcasm when Austen writes of society, but this is perhaps what keeps this book so alive. It is surprising how little society has really changed since the Victorian era. Emma comes across as a spoilt child, but lovable, as there is a shade of Emma in all of us. We all share the need to be involved in everything, and meddle with everyone's affairs, and there is a tale of unrequited love in all of our histories, even for a short time. I have not yet seen the film, as I am not sure of whether or not this would spoil it, as though there can be no doubt about the brilliance of Hollywood, Jane Austen should be present to direct it"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I read Emma by Jane Austen. In this case, the title Emma means snobby, rude, and self centered. This meaning portrays itself throughout the book because of the way the main character, Emma, acts. This story takes place in the small town of Highbury, England in the early 1800's. This is significant because the story would have been very different if it took place in Draper, Utah in 2010. Manners and social standing would not have been as important as they were back in the 1800's. The language, dress and customs were so different back then but human nature is still the same. The protagonist of this book is Emma Woodhouse. She is a wealthy, snobby, clever girl who is content with the way her life is. The antagonist is Mr. George Knightley; a trusted friend of the Woodhouse's and is the only person Emma knows who is openly critical to her. Emma lives with her father at their estate called Hartfield. She was not interested in marriage because she feared that if she did marry, her life wouldn't be as wonderful as it was at the present time. Miss Taylor, Emma's governess however, did want to marry. Emma's father, Mr. Woodhouse had a friend named Mr. Weston. Emma encouraged his visits and introduced him to Miss Taylor. After long talks and numerous dinners, Mr. Weston proposed to Miss Taylor. Emma decides she needs another project and puts her sights on her friend Harriet. Emma, over proud of her match making skills, tried to match Harriet with a man named Mr. Elton. He showed signs of really liking Harriet, but in the end he was in love with Emma instead. Emma finally realized she needed to end her career as a matchmaker after hurting many people along the way.The style of Emma is a satire of social class. Jane Austen makes fun of the importance of social propriety with her characters. For example, Emma felt that the Cole family was beneath her and wasn't willing to dine with them until she found out she wasn't invited to a party they were having, and then she wanted to go. Also Mrs. Elton was constantly made fun of because she was too informal. Jane Austen does a really good job of describing the characters and the scenery. I have a very vivid mental image in my mind of what everybody and everything looks like. The theme is \\"Love is complicated and doesn't always go as planned.\\" Emma had to learn this the hard way. I would recommend this book because it is unpredictable and even though it is set in a different time period people are essentially the same regardless of time and place. Human nature is ageless."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"When I first picked up \\"Emma,\\" I was expecting it to be as charming and alluring as Austen's well-known \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". What I found, however, was it didn't quite measure up to my expectations. Although I had high hopes for this book, and anticipated it's spectacular outcome, I wasn't as thrilled with it as I thought I would be. I found it hard to connect with Emma, the main character. At first, she seemed like a sweet young lady, caring for others and rarely found at fault. But once I learned of her snobby disposition, wealthy pride, and little care for the feelings of others, I wasn't as fond of her. Her character was set up as the stereotypical \\"snobby, rich girl\\" we think of today--one of whom makes sure to always get her way. The idea of the upper-class's success and how they are, evidently, the most intelligent of people, was the way Austen seemed to portray her character. Because of Emma's lifestyle and family setup, she was able to get most of what she wanted, most of the time. Although she wasn't always arrogant and rude, she certainly did have her flaws.Emma delighted in matchmaking, but, while doing so, didn't think of the feelings of others--which would later lead her into trouble. This \\"hobby\\" of hers often caused misunderstanding and, ultimately, ended in heartbreak. When Emma recognizes her \\"gifting\\" in this area, she uses it to her full potential. Even though she would try to turn things in the favor of those she was closest to, she often ended up in control of their lives. She went along assuming the emotions of others, when in reality, their feelings were not at all what they had seemed. Emma's assumptions led her nowhere. But, through all the distress she caused, she discovered a great deal about herself and her unrecognized love.When Emma's only mother figure in her life--Miss Taylor, the family governess--gets married and moves away, Emma becomes distraught. However, this discomfort soon gets pushed aside when Harriet comes into her life. Harriet is an orphan who becomes a friend to Emma. But, this relationship doesn't do good for either of them. Emma takes advantage of Harriet as her \\"pet\\", pulling her around and using flattery to make her do things. She puts things into Harriet's mind that aren't always true, trying to give her a hope of love.Throughout the many complicated relationships of Emma and her friends, there is one particular friend who stood beside her the entire time. He was Mr. Knightley--an old friend who steps in whenever he thinks Emma is taking things a little too far. She rarely listens to him, though, and must suffer the consequences. Even as smart as Emma was, she didn't have the intelligence to understand the feelings of others. She hardly put anyone before herself."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel. While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).Modern readers tend to be unfairly squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings. A lesser delight."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Thank you for the quick shipment!

Prunella Scales is particularly fine at delineating the voices of the various characters: the forthright and sensible Mr Knightley, the self-satisfaction of Emma, the tremulous old-womanish Mr Woodhouse, and the silliness of Harriet Smith, are all definitely and exactly given utterance. The dialogue has all the crack and vivacity you could ask for.However, Scales is slightly less convincing in the author's own voice. She doesn't always fully characterize the many distinctions the author makes but her reading still remains on the happy side of neutrality because it never intrudes: it understates rather than obscures the point of Austen's writing. Even so, delicate reticence is always more welcome than brazen misreading of which, alas, many examples abound."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"\\"Emma\\" is a multi-layered tale of self-deception and self-discovery; as claustrophobic and at the same time as sparkling as the interior of a glass Christmas tree ornament. At one level it's a telling of the familiar \\"what you wanted was right there all along\\". But much of what we see is filtered through the thoughts of Emma - and she is such a deliciously unreliable narrator. She's clever, and knows herself to be so, which makes her (often willful) blindness about almost everything all the more delightful.In the hands of a lesser author Emma could be loathsome. Because this is Austen, we can smile at the happy ending that Emma's machinations have kept from her for so long."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Though far from my favorite Austen work, Emma is still laugh-out-loud hilarious in its ironic and witty prose and dead-on-accurate portrayal of human behavior, character, psychology, and society. Emma is certainly Jane's most social novel, dealing so greatly with class and courtship, the definitions of proper behavior and manners. It also has her most deeply flawed heroine in Emma Woodhouse, a brilliant, imaginative, yet snobbish, shallow, and socially-retarded (as in, she is oblivious to social cues) young woman who knows next to nothing about the human heart, least of all her own, yet so delights in creative matchmaking. Luckily, Emma is contrasted with Miss Bates, who knows and understands all, and her love-interest, Mr. Knightly, who tries desperately to guide her behavior. Though Emma has been criticized due to its class-consciousness and its seeming sexism (i.e. in Emma's treatment at Mr. Knightly's hands), these are unjust when Emma's character development is traced. Emma also has the distinction of boasting Jane's most charming \\"villain\\" in Frank Churchill, the gentleman who delights a little too much in deceit. Emma is absolute Jane, but certainly not my favorite (Persuasion, Pride and Prejudice, and Sense and Sensibility, and Northanger Abbey come far ahead), but it's Jane. It's charming, it's thought-provoking, it's hilarious, it's introspective, it's filled with all-too familiar characters. So, what more can you ask for? Grade: A"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"This book is light-hearted and fun to read if you have a decent attention span. Emma is proud of her recent match-making success and sets out to do more. After a few awkward setbacks, she learns not to play Cupid, and that love is random and spotaneous, and can't be forced. In some places, the book can be kind of slow, but if you keep going, it gets better. All in all, I enjoyed it very much."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I also expected more, but i liked it a lot. And yes, it is for serious readers (you cant read Jane Austen if youre not one). Is funny and I liked Emma a lot. Although mr. Knightley was too old :p But is great. You must read it."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I will admit that when it comes to reading things that are regarding as &quot;classics&quot; I usually want to kill myself. I find the language and story etc. boring. Emma, is actually the exception to that.Emma was written in the late 1800's by Austen who is known for her work Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice. Emma is a young woman who prides herself on setting up her friend/governess with her new husband. Emma decides to continue her matchmaking skills by taking on a new protege. Her new protege has a crush on Mr. Martin whom Emma deems as not acceptable. Emma tries to persuade Harriet's interest to others and well it is a fisaco. The first man actually likes Emma. The second man Harriet is interested in ends up being the man that Emma herself discovers she likes. Of course all ends well with all the characters getting what they deserve.It is an amusing read. The theme seems to be that although Emma in the beginning seems like a shallow, selfish girl, in the end she realizes that she was snobby and wrong and tries to rectify her mistakes. She doesn't want to hurt her friends and realizes that what she thought was best for them was wrong.If you are looking for some &quot;quality fiction&quot; or if you have a school report to write, this is an excellent book to read. you won't be bored."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Having recently read Pride and Prejudice in under a week, I expected Emma to suck me in and spit me out just as easily. It didn't. I had to work to read Emma.For starters, I didn't like Emma, the character, very much in the beginning. She came off as stuck on herself and very know-it-all. But, I was determined to give her a chance b/c a friend of mine named her daughter Emma for this book. So, I trudged on, and did begin to like the girl. I also read the commentary on the book and constantly compared it to scenes from Clueless (since Clueless is a modern-day Emma).The story dragged on a lot longer than I normally would be comfortable with, but once I got into a good pace for reading, that was fine. More than anything, I just wanted to know what was going on with Jane Fairfax. The outcome was very welcome, and I enjoyed Emma's love-life conclusion.It was a very enjoyable book, though I wouldn't call it &quot;the most perfect of Jane Austen's perfect novels,&quot; as was written on the inside flap of the book."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"In Jane Austen's Emma, there is an abundance of irony that can clearly be seen. This can be seen in several parts of the book, and is at work throughout it. One example is the web woven between Emma Woodhouse, Mr. Elton, and Harriet Smith. Another is Frank Churchill's secret engagement to Jane Fairfax. Yet another is Mr. Knightley and Emma being in love. Austen usesirony expertly to keep us, the readers, guessing.Austen's use of irony between Harriet, Mr. Elton, and Emma is obvious. She uses it when Emma paints a portrait of Harriet for Mr. Elton. Referring to the portrait, Mr. Elton says, \\"\`Letme entreat you, Miss Woodhouse, to exercise so charming a talent in favour of your friend'\\"(38). There is verbal irony and situational irony in this because Mr. Elton was intending to compliment Emma's artistic skills, but both Emma and Harriet took it as a compliment to Harriet's beauty. Mr. Elton also sends a riddle that indicated he wanted to court Harriet when all along he intended to court Emma.There was very apparent irony in a entanglement between Emma, Jane, and Frank. We think that Emma and Frank are meant for eachother and will end up together. There is a considerable amount of flirtation between Emma and Frank, and, at one point, Emma fancies herself in love with him. All along though, Frank is involved in a secret engagement with Jane.Lastly, and probably the most significant, is the irony of Emma and Mr. Knightley being in love with eachother all along. Austen strategically refrains from telling us he is in love with her and Emma never knew she was in love with Mr. Knightley. Their love is portrayed to be of a brother and sister. It is ironic that while Emma is trying to set up all her friends, she is unaware of her own love for Mr. Knightley.The irony in Emma is necessary to create the confusion that makes this book so splendid. With all the irony throughout the book it makes it almost impossible for the reader to realize whatis actually going on. This adds to the surprise ending. How Austen uses irony makes her a great writer and her book worth reading."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma is not such an easy read. The plot is enough to cure anyone's insomnia.But if you really think about it you can get alot out of it about human character. Funny enough Austen never married as Emma planned to never marry and both for the same reason. They wan't to stay and take care of their fathers.I particulary liked the character Miss Bates. She was a very realistic character. Where ever you go there will always be a Miss Bates and a Miss Fairfax. Well, the book was certainly worth reading."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Unlike some of Austen's other famous works, EMMA centers around a beautiful young woman, quick and clever. Though at twenty-one, she is sitting a bit high on the fence as regards marriage, this is of little importance. Emma the character professes not to desire marriage. This is a decision of privilege, and one that is not seen much in many female characters appearing in novels of this time. The reason Emma has the luxury to refuse marriage is not her strong will or great intelligence, it's her great fortune. Emma need not marry because she does not need the money and thus security that a husband would usually bring a woman of lesser fortune and social status. Emma will inherit from her father, and she already enjoys a high position in society. It is therefore not necessary that she marry for any reason beyond love, and when we first meet Emma, we find her skeptical of love and determined to progress slowly into old maidenhood. Long before Maslow developed his Hierarchy of Needs in the field of psychology, Jane Austen understood intuitively that one had to remove physiological need and want before one could get to the greater things of life, like love and self-fulfillment. The beauty of Austen's setting and the social status of her characters, is that since the accumulation of wealth by any one character is virtually a given, and that to speak of money directly is an almost unpardonable social error, these characters are freed to go about their vain, frivolous lives completely unencumbered by thought of where the next meal will come from, or whether or not it is prudent to send one's child to school or to keep him at the farm. Actually working for one's living is definitely unfashionable, and the best position to have is one where you've accumulated so much wealth that you can sit on your estate, live off the interest and not discuss how much money you have or where it came from. True, social status counts for much, and much of social status is determined by the amount of money in one's bank account-but the greater determinant of social rank lies in birth. The daughter of a character with little money but a good name might still be a good catch. The daughter of character who has amassed a great fortune, but done it in some vulgar way or not married well is not such a good catch. In either case, it is not really the amount of money one has, but one's position on the social ladder that Austen wants us to pay attention to.As usual, Austen addresses her characters with great wit. Of her title character in EMMA, Austen wrote \\"I am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like\\" and sets about doing her best to fulfill this prediction. From the first, Austen seems to regard her character with a smirk and a wink. Within the first few paragraphs she is characterized as \\"handsome\\" and \\"clever\\", yes, but Austen also speaks \\"of the real evils of Emma's situation,\\" namely \\"the power of having rather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little too well of herself.\\" Yet it is clear that by the end of the novel Emma's character will have changed from one of vain frippery to that of a good, noble woman, modest and sure of her true responsibilities. You always know how an Austen novel will end before you even start it; the fun is in GETTING that far. EMMA is no different. An excellent read for a rainy day."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma is one of the best books I have ever read. The way Jane Austen displays Emma is funny. Emma's faults make her realistic and someone you can relate to. The way she relates to the other characters makes the book very interesting. I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good book."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma is a touching, comeing of age story. It is about a young girl who is close to becoming spoiled and conceited, but through many experiences both good and bad she slowly turns into a caring considerate woman. I have read all of Jane Austen's novels and Emma is definately my favorite. It contains more humor than most of Jane Austen's stories and is fun to read. I would recomend this for a first time Austen reader, because it is such a fun book that is somewhat lighter and easier to read than some of Austen's other novels."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"This book is well-written for a love story. The outcome fits the story line perfectly. Jane Austen does a good job on having Emma manipulate peoples lives so they fall in love with one another. Then Austen has Emma going hay-wire because of her mixed feelings and she kind of gets a taste of her own medicine. Her love set ups are not going as she had planned. Then everything hits her all at once. I love it! I would recommend this book is great if you like romance and all of the mushy stuff. Jane Austen did it again."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma is perhaps one of Miss Austen's most controversial heroines. From the age of match-makers and suppressed feminism, comes a book which makes you angry, ashamed and overpowered along with Emma herself. Accused of being materialistic, Jane Austen has written a timeless tale of a pretty girl living on the assurance of beauty, sensitivity, and wealth, and perhaps there is more than a touch of money in this story, but in this century, and the one past, there is more than a touch of money in everyone's story. In every story comes a lesson for everyone, and Emma is no exeption"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma is a loveable character who isn't really sure what she wants at first.

It isn't that long of a book, and, after all, its a classic. So read it as soon as possible!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I can never decide whether Pride and Prejudice or Emma is my favourite book by Jane Austen. Emma has all the Jane Austen hallmarks - wit, exuberance, and laugh out loud moments, coupled with realistic, well drawn characters and a real feeling of being in the Regency (which is hardly surprising, as that's when the book was written).Emma is a spoiled young woman who has everything she can possibly want in life: a doting father who lets her do as she pleases, friends, family and a beautiful home. She is understandably please with herself, and this leads to complications as she tries to sort out everyone else's life. She's meddling and interfering, and yet so well meaning she comes across as a likeable character rather than as a busybody.She takes up Harriet, a young woman of doubtful birth, and encourages her to set her sights on Mr Elton, the local vicar, as a future husband. Poor Harriet is completely bowled over by Emma, and is persuaded to like Mr Elton over the farmer's son she is really in love with. Emma is oblivious to the fact that Harriet and Mr Elton are completely unsuited, and that Harriet and her farmer are made for each other.Through a variety of hilarious scenes, Emma comes to realize she doesn't know as much as she thought, and learns that it's better to let other people manage their own lives.The minor characters are wonderful: Mrs Elton with her barouche landau (anyone who's read the book will know what I mean), sweet Miss Bates, and dreadful Mr Elton, who has designs on Emma.Eventually, Emma learns how to understand her own feelings, and leaves everyone else free to listen to theirs, which leads to a satisfying ending all round.Hugely enjoyable."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Lovable Emma Woodhouse, Pretty, bright, and rich, not to mention a little mischievious. Since she has lived nearly twenty-one years with very little to distress or vex her, carefree Emma spends her time match-making for her friends. But when she undertakes the office of matching pretty, but not very bright Harriet Smith with the local Vicar she gets more than she bargains for.The characters are rich and consistent, and Austen again gives us, the ridiculous; mr. woodhouse, Miss Bates. The scoundrel who pretends to be an angel of light;Frank Churchill. The concerned friends; Mrs. Weston, Mr. knightly. Then there is Emma, who belongs in a class of her own. She is the most fortunate, yet the most flawed Austen heroine, which flaws only endear her all the more. And in the end they pay off, when she falls in love with someone as imperfect as herself.The language and diolouge are as shining, bright, and charming as the characters themselves. Overall this novel can do nothing but please, just as Austen's novels before and after Emma show. A must-read for Austen fans."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Wonderful! All the Austin books that I have read have been superb. She really draws you into the character's lives. The way she ties all the pieces together to end the story is interesting."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I saw the BBC film adaptation of this (not the one with Gwyneth Paltrow) AND Clueless before reading this, so I was expecting to have some difficulty, as tends to happen when I've seen the film first.However, I really enjoyed reading and although it takes some getting used to, I enjoyed the rich and interesting dialogue and language.This is the third Jane Austen book I have read - after Persuasion and Northanger Abbey. This is by far my favourite as I thought the character of Emma was very well developed and very enjoyable - I couldn't help but love her despite her pride and prejudices. Haha.I did attempt to read Pride & Prejudice a few years back and gave up because of Austen's writing style. Emma has encouraged me to persevere, and I just love the P&P; BBC series - it's amazing!Emma (the book and the character) is not to everyone's taste but I was surprised at how much I enjoyed reading this."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"If no one else liked this book, I would be responsible for keeping it a classic. I couldn't. As for the plot, I think it goes something like this -- they talk, they talk, they talk, then they shut up, and the book is over."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I have always loved Emma the movie, the one with Gwyneth Paltrow in it. Her Emma is so clueless, so innocent, yet somehow loveable. I finally decided to pick up the classic novel to see if the movie missed anything and to get the full story straight from the author. The book delighted me just as much as the movie did, as I am pleased to say.Emma Woodhouse is a young, rich woman living with her germaphobe father in the town of Highbury. Bored and eager for some sort of excitement, she decides to matchmake her new friend Harriet Smith with the local vicar Mr.Elton. Emma is convinced that her matchmaking skills are among the best, wrongly taking credit for pairing her governess Miss Taylor with their neighbor Mr.Weston. Many mishaps occur, and many hearts broken and confused, but in the end all is well, with all three of the main couples finding happiness.It took me a little while to get in the vocabulary of the time, but once I did the book breezed by. Emma is so flawed like all of us; that is why we love her. Just because this book was written almost 200 years ago doesn't make it bad: it makes it better."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I think most people are already familiar with the story of Emma, and many are probably also familiar with the back-story, which is that Jane Austen decided to write about a character which she thought \\"nobody but myself will much like.\\" I dare say there are plenty of people who indeed do not like Emma Woodhouse, but I have loved plenty of books, TV shows, and movies centered on a character I disliked (or even hated) far more than Emma, whose faults do not, at least, include witlessness, stupidity, or true ugliness of character.Added to Emma's attractiveness as a protagonist and other well-rounded characters that we may love or hate, is Jane Austen's excellent prose and story plotting, and, most importantly, her cutting humor and social commentary. Oh wait, perhaps most important is the love story--or love stories--that touch the readers' hearts. Or at least touched mine. All of those elements are there, and so I enjoyed the book. While not my favorite book of Austen's, Emma is far from my least favorite (ahem, Mansfield Park)."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I have always loved \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" and wanted to expand into more of Austen's works. This one did not disappoint! It is a fantastic tale with all the usual Austen humor and wittiness that work so well in her stories! In fact, it is now up there with \\"Sense\\" as my favorite Austen work!\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her.\\"The first sentence in the novel really sets the stage for all the mistakes the main character makes throughout! This novel tells the story of Emma Woodhouse, a privileged young lady who, with nothing else to occupy her time, loves matchmaking among her friends. She loves it so much that she doesn't pay any attention to her true love right under her nose! Of course things don't go the way Emma would like and there are the usual misunderstandings but things work out in the end and everyone ends up with who they are destined to be with.This had been called one of Austen's best works and I can agree with that. I really loved this story. This certainly is the \\"lightest\\" of Austen's novels as you will not find any lives ruined or huge scandals that ruin reputations. It is simply (and wonderfully so) the story of a small, English village where the inhabitants really have nothing substantial to occupy their time; none more so than Emma. I think one of the things Austen is so marvelous at is her ability to really focus on her characters and their everyday lives and none of her novels do this as well as Emma. As there is no serious \\"action\\" the story must therefore focus on everyday occurrences. You could call this a comedy of manners as the characters revolve within a very strict code of behavior and etiquette where everything should move along very smoothly but of course, because of meddling (mainly Emma's) things always go completely wrong! The novel is full of the usual, heavy Austen dialogue and description which I'm sure can get tedious for some readers (I did find myself skimming over some of Miss. Bates' extended ramblings) but, as in her other novels, it does not get in the way and can really help the reader come to terms with a time very foreign from our own. Many modern readers find the \\"elitist\\" attitudes in Austen's books a turn off and condemn the novels. However, Austen is not intending to make these attitudes seem wonderful; if some readers would look closer they would realize that she is really satirizing these attitudes and showing them for the silliness they really were. The main character, Emma, can be a bit annoying at times, but she is so open about her own faults and weaknesses that its hard to dislike her. In fact, you do see her acknowledging in several places her mistakes and is able to laugh them off and learn from them. Austen herself said that Emma was a character that nobody would really like but herself; I disagree.Yes, she can come across as snobbish, arrogant, and overly conscious of her place in society but what can you expect from a girl who has been raised by a doting father and governess? Mixed with those slightly irritating qualities, though, is a sweetness and a true desire to be helpful which really makes her endearing. I highly doubt Emma's personality is that much different from other young ladies of the time. I think the true shining star in this novel, though, is Mr. Knightley, Emma's close friend and true English gentleman (supposedly this was Austen's favorite hero as well and created her ideal gentleman in him; his name is no accident). He is kind and thoughtful, witty and intelligent, but blunt and always ready to bring Emma back down to Earth. Their bantering back and forth is really charming. I only wish we knew more about Mr. Knightley's background and that we could see more of him in the novel! The rest of the characters in the novel are all brilliantly drawn and even though they are not the focus of the story, you come to know them as well as the two mains: the eccentric and hypochondriac Mr. Woodhouse, sweet and naive Harriet Smith, the kind Westons, slightly foppish Frank Churchill and the very reserved Jane Fairfax, the kindly Miss. and Mrs. Bates, and the exceedingly arrogant Eltons.This is a wonderful and delightful story and I would highly recommend it to anyone. It is a light and charming story about a slightly flawed but kind young lady (and who among us is not flawed?) who, through a series of blunders, grows and matures. It is also a humorous story poking fun at the strict code of behavior and the social classes of the day."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Jane Austen's novel Emma has been well known since it's publishment. In the 90's, a successful chick-flick movie, Clueless was based on this novel. Even though the movie does not in any way depict the intelligence of Jane Austen, it serves the main characters' personalities. The book by far was absolutely and brilliantly written while easy to understand in fairly relatable modern English. This book is a great read for literature analysts because it serves a wide variety of character traits within their society. It can also be used to analyze the socio-economic stereotypes and lifestyles of their time. The plot and storyline were at a consistent pace with a surprising climax and turn towards the end. Because it is a love story, it does follow the usual typical love story scenes. However, love is depicted differently by each couple and character, which sets it apart from other cinderella-like stories, which were popular during that time period. It is a very relaxing book -- not an intense read. It is also a classic even though not as widespread or as known as other Austen's novels such as Pride and Prejudice. It is definitely a recommanded read."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Many literary critics have proclaimed Emma to be the most accomplished of Jane Austen's novels. That may well be, but I don't personally number it among my favorites. That said, it easily deserves its five-star rating; I haven't read an Austen novel yet that doesn't.Emma is, of course, the story of beautiful, young, wealthy and accomplished Emma Woodhouse. Of her, too many kindnesses can not be said. At least, that is the attitude displayed by everyone around Emma. She's heard nothing but praise and exaltations her entire life, and has come to quite believe her own billing. And while she generally means well, Emma has grown into an unforgivable busybody and snob.Emma lavishes most of her attentions on her dear friend Harriet Smith. While Harriet is of a lower status and desirability than Emma herself, Emma feels confident she can improve upon Harriet, introduce her to all the right society, in short, make her a most advantageous match. Never mind the perfectly nice farmer who is already in love with her.And so, Emma insinuates herself into the affairs of Harriet and several others around her. She is certainly not the most sympathetic of Austen's heroines and my feelings about her tended to fluctuate from chapter to chapter. Nevertheless, no conflicted feelings got in the way of the joy brought about by a patented Austen ending. Additionally, Austen proves yet again that humor based on an intimate knowledge of human nature is timeless. I defy you not to laugh over the antics of Emma's possessive and gruel-loving father. Austen's social satire is as sharp as it ever was."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel. While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).Modern readers tend to be unfairly squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings. A lesser delight."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"In the quiet and picturesque village of Highbury there lived a self-professed matchmaker of little experience and expertise yet she believed herself to be in possession of superior observational skills and the ability to see into everyone's heart. Emma Woodhouse, our twenty-one year old matchmaker of Highbury, rates the marriage of her governess to a wealthy and respected gentleman, Mr. Weston, as one of her laudable matchmaking successes and decidedly takes on the challenge of finding a suitable wife for the vicar of Highbury, Mr. Elton. Alas, Emma is not the talented matchmaker she thinks she is and makes frequent blunders in judgment and is often blind to the romantic inclinations of the people around her...What then ensues is a spectacular comedy of manners that is heartwarming, satirical, lively, and charming.Mr. George Knightley, brother-in-law to Emma, does not approve of Emma's new matchmaking hobby or her new friendship with Harriet Smith, \\"the natural daughter of nobody knows whom.\\" Harriet Smith, a seventeen year old parlour border at the local school, is inferior to Emma in sophistication and sense. Mr. Knightley would much rather see Emma with a companion that is her equal in intelligence and influence her positively. Mr. Knightley is one of the few people in Emma's life that recognizes her faults; and believing her too often indulged and spoiled he makes no qualms about admonishing her for these faults. Unfortunately, Emma is often willful and ignores Mr. Knightley's wise counsel.Jane Austen is quoted to have said Emma was a \\"heroine whom no one but myself will much like.\\" This is true for some Austen fans who rank Emma Woodhouse as one of their least favorite heroines. However, there many readers that find her likable and claim her to be one of their favorite Austen characters. Emma Woodhouse is unique in that she is wealthy and well provided for, thus giving her little inducement to marry. In addition, even though she enjoys pairing up her friends and neighbors, Emma has little inclination or interest in finding love for herself and declares that she will never marry. (So much for having a romantic heroine!) Nonetheless, I am very fond of Emma, her lack of experience in the world has made her naive and the indulgence of her family has swelled her head, but she is not an unworthy or unlikable heroine. Throughout the course of this novel Jane Austen beautifully depicts the journey of Emma's maturation and displays her blossoming into a self-aware, humble, and sensible woman.My favorite thing about \\"Emma\\" is the charming village of Highbury and all who reside within. There is such a pleasant mix of endearing and exasperating characters: Miss Bates, a poor spinster who dearly loves to share news with her neighbors; Mr. Woodhouse, such a generous and a caring man who suffers from nervous anxieties about the health of his family and friends; Mr. Weston with his jolly and sanguine temperament; and Mrs. Elton, who believes herself to be the first in consequence in the town and is extremely vulgar and conceited. According to Miss Bates \\"there are few places with such society as Highbury.\\" How very true!While \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the most famous and popular of Jane Austen's six major novels, I believe that \\"Emma\\" is truly an excellent, accomplished novel that is not to be overlooked. I may not recommend it to someone for their first experience with Jane Austen, as it is a bit lengthier than the others, but I highly recommend it to readers who enjoy traveling to the time and world of Jane Austen whether it be in book or on screen!Austenesque Reviews"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel. While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).Modern readers tend to be unfairly squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings. A lesser delight."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma is a young woman from a little town not far from London, but isolated and unfrequently visited. Her mother has died and she lives with her father and her governess. Her family is at the very top of social standings in town, and Emma is all too aware of it. The starting point is her governess's engagement to a good man, which Emma imagines she has engineered by herself. Consequently, she thinks she is the ideal matchmaker, and makes this \\"skill\\" her vocation, which creates all sorts of intrigues, equivocations, and comical situations for all the unfortunate people who surround her, especailly her young and poor protege, Harriet, whom she corners into rejecting a decent fellow in order to get her someone \\"better\\", someone she will be able to receive at her home. So, Emma becomes trouble, and the initial success is hard to repeat. Emma proclaims that she will never marry, as her role in life is only getting other people to marry, besides the fact that she must take care of her old father. Who, by the way, is an unsympathetic, hypocondriac, complaining, and blackmailing man, who has utterly spoiled Emma. Her elder sister, by contrast, is married to a rich banker and lives in London. The rest of the characters is also very well rounded, especially the family friend Mr. Knightley, who is always lecturing Emma about her meddlesome habits; Mrs. and Miss Bates, a couple of neighbors who are poor but close to the family (Miss Bates speaks constantly and erratically, which makes many people avoid her), and the unlikable Elton and Frank Churchill, who Emma believes is in love with her.The book is funny and written with the mastery of Austen, who manages as always to create a closed world, bounded by very strict rules of conduct and prejudice, in an ecnhanting setting. Emma is definitely a spoiled brat, kind but arrogant, and her delusion about matchmaking unbearable, but nevertheless she is an attractive character, and her youth makes the reader forgive her faults."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"While this novel is certainly a cut above most modern fiction, Emma is not Austen's best work. In contrast with Pride and Prejudice and Northanger Abbey's tight narrative structures, Emma is long and rambling. The narrative presents many insignificant details even as it leaves out more important scenes. For example, we are privy to several examples of Miss Bates' idle chatter, but Harriet's capture by the gypsies and Robert Martin's proposal happen offstage. Although Miss Bates is supposed to be a lovable character, I found myself putting the book down during one of her conversations and not returning to it for several months (which is unusual, as I read Northanger Abbey in a day).Nevertheless, the novel does have its redeeming features. Several people have noted that they disliked Emma's snobbishness, but we're not meant to adore her, and the author gently pokes fun at her elitism. Prior to the book's publication, Austen wrote that she feared no one else would love Emma as much as she did, so the protagonist is not intended to be a likeable character. Her flaws balance out her good traits, such as her wit and liveliness. Her dialogues with Mr. Knightley and even Harriet contain subtle zingers that may not be readily apparent to a 20th century reader the first time around. If you think you didn't like this book, you will appreciate it more on a second reading (and you can always skim the boring parts, like poor Miss Bates!). You will learn a great deal about the classist ideology lurking beneath Regency Britain's prim veneer. And if nothing else, reading with the intent to pick up on the characters' oblique but witty repartee will help you sharpen your own wit and social skills."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma Woodhouse is an atypical heroine for a Jane Austen novel. Usually, we see disadvantaged girls struggle to find happiness through marriage. In Emma's case, we see a girl who has everything in the world she could want. She is rich, pretty, and happy. She has no desire to be married, as it would interfere with the simple life she enjoys with her father and she knows it would break his heart to be parted from her. The story follows Emma's life beginning at 21 as she tries to help a young girl named Harriet Smith marry above her station. Emma also engages in a flirtation with a young man and generally makes a bit of a mess of things whenever she gets involved.I have read that Jane Austen felt that Emma was a character only her creator could like. I would have to disagree with that. Emma is certainly flawed, but her heart is almost always in the right place. Pride has blinded her to her own limitations but she is also one who does not shrink from the responsibility of her mistakes and tries very hard to learn from them. I found this admirable and grew to like her more and more as the book progressed.Aside from Emma, the rest of the cast was also very well written. Her father is a complete hypochondriac and often engages in behavior that would typically be considered highly rude. Yet, he is motivated so completely by a desire to be kind to others that his misguided application of that desire only endears him to the reader. Mr. Knightley, the no-nonsense friend of the family is admittedly not the most complex character in the world, but he is a very good one and his solidity is a great counterbalance to Emma's wishful thinking.In summary, Emma is a nice change of pace from Jane Austen's other novels. It starts off well and grows more engaging as it continues. The characters are interesting and Emma herself grows considerably during the course of the novel."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I think Emma is a sparkling, witty and engaging story that beats a lot of modern works hands down. I found it hard to choose a favourite Austen but I think this one is just brilliant and Mr Knightley is definately my favourite of her heroes. If I could be anyone in literature I would choose Emma Woodhouse! I saw a very funny theatre play of emma which made me laugh out loud. I think it is a lovely story that should be read by everyone - I can't stop grinning when mr Knightley proposes! I would choose it as my favourite classic."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"The point of this book was to look at the life of society in those days of Jane Austen. However stuck-up Emma was, she was a true character, not dull and plain old nice, it's usually the evil and devious characters that are the most fun to read about."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I read Emma for a book report, but I got to choose the book. I had seen the movie, but I wanted to read the book, too. I thoroughly enjoyed this book; not only that, but I would thouroughly recommend it to others, because I loved it that much!!! I was appaled to read the reviews of the 1 and 2 star people. I can see that these people don't read very much at all and only, say, Babysitter's Club Books or some crap like that. I know that a lot of people hate reading in general and so, therefore could not possibly comprehend a wonderful novel like Emma. They obviously don't recognize classic literature when they &quot;read&quot; it! I liked this book because of the wonderful characters. I especially liked Mr.Knightely! Jane Austen is a wonderful author and I'm working on my 3rd book by her, which I'm really enjoying!! If you enjoy reading REAL literature, I would certainly recommend Emma, by Jane Austen!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I, like several other people who responded, have half a brain and taste in literature and therefore greatly enjoyed this novel. Not only does it have excellent plot, amusing dialogue, and a happy ending but it also lends a great amount of insight into this time in history. I am 18 years old and have read this book several times, surprisingly enough before any films were released, and can honestly say that it was my favorite novel ever written. Obviously those who only gave it one or two stars are more at home reading such low class literary works as Stephen King novels, which certainly have more excitement but don't actually require any real thought. I don't believe that the responses of such people to real literary works would really have any true value in my opinion since they quite apparently have no real intelligence or taste in literture whatsoever. My advice to such people would be to avoid real books and to stick to what they are actually capable of understanding."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I've always been a fan of the British actress Prunella Scales and already own some of her readings of classic novels, including Cranford which she handles delightfully.So it was a big disappointment to find that she seems to have completely misjudged her narration of Emma. One of the pleasures of a Jane Austen novel is the author's deceptively quiet tone; its very understatement sharpens her satire and makes her jokes even funnier. Unfortunately, Miss Scales has adopted the opposite approach, using a hopelessly inappropriate shrill, impatient voice. Given that the opening chapters are dominated by two of literature's most tiresome characters, Emma Woodhouse and her feebleminded father, the result is unbearably irritating. I gave up after an hour, and was glad to track down a far more enjoyable reading by Juliet StevensonEmma (Classic Fiction)- by far the best Austen narrator on the market today."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"In the constricted world of Jane Austen's EMMA, there is a general lack of a sense that anything exists beyond that which Emma can see or Austen can relate. Emma, her family, and friends live either in the small town of Hartfield or its equally miniscule environs. The action of the novel is more or less coterminous with the very real events of the Industrial Revolution, the French Revolution, or even just some whooping and hollering of some village bad boys. This smallness of space is matched by a smallness of psychological depth. Austen tacitly assumes that good is ubiquitous, and where good seems to be lacking, its normal contrary is not evil at all. Those who show a deficiency of good either are merely mischievous or are incapable of doing no more than sputtering about their evil. Further, those who sputter do so in isolation and do not seriously disrupt the social order. They are neither punished nor remorseful. In the interactions among the characters, Austen in EMMA makes a marked change in the basic makeup of her cast. In PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, for example, she shows only the landed gentry. But here, Austen presents a definite variation in character. It is this wider cast of type that allows Austen to play the magician and make the reader think that Austen's world is bigger than it is. And at the center of this static world is Emma herself, who, in the canon of Austen, is the heroine only in the broadest sense of the word.For the first time in any of her novels, Austen gives the reader a heroine who has numerous grievous faults. Emma is a young headstrong woman who comes across as a huge snob. Emma describes Mrs. Elton, who is more purposeful in her mischief, as \\"self-important, presuming, familiar, ignorant, and ill-bred.\\" Emma might as well have been talking about herself. Readers who note Emma's genteel manner allow that surface patina of gentility to suggest that there is a basic difference between her and Mrs. Elton. This difference is more a matter of degree than in kind. In her harsh treatment of Harriet Smith and disparagement of Jane Fairfax, Emma is more than thoughtless; she is downright sadistic. The best that can be said for her is that in the benevolent atmosphere of Jane Austen, nastiness is not permitted to materially affect the outcome. Those who are nasty are rendered impotent in their nastiness, like Mrs. Elton, or are allowed to improve by degrees through a slow process of self-realization, like Emma. And it is this growing understanding of Emma's own faults that is at heart the theme of the book. The plot, which is really an incredibly contorted series of misunderstandings based mostly on Emma's constant misapprehensions of who loves whom, is the hook by which the theme comes into play. Regardless of who tries mightily to set things aright, the only one who can teach Emma to look inwardly for wisdom is Emma herself. The comedy that results from all these miscalculations sets up the satire which arises from the contrast between the way Emma misreads relationships and the way that the readers do not. Despite the fact that some readers complain that the smallness of setting renders the smallness of the morality as insignificant is to misunderstand why each new generation of reader finds Emma to be an uplifting vision of the regeneration of a woman that is probably not unlike many of her readers."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Had this story been written in a more contemporary style, my review would have been totally favorable. I found the story to be quite sweet, with great characters and a wholesome storyline.Unfortunately, this particular style of writing for me, as a fourteen year old, was a tad daunting. I found it slow, with way too many words and descriptions. I found myself often wishing she would just get to the point.I would have awarded more stars if it wasn't so difficult for me to get through."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"&quot;Emma&quot; has been called Jane Austen's most flawed heroine, but I'd rather reserve that title for Fanny Price of &quot;Mansfield Park&quot;, whose very &quot;perfection&quot; makes her one of the most obnoxious inventions of British literature. How can one stand a hero or heroine who is never, ever wrong? We'd rather have someone like Emma, who, for all her flaws, or maybe because of them, is a delightful creature. She's a hopeless busybody, meddling and interfering in everyone's lives, too much the lady of the manor for her own good; but she means nothing but everyone else's good. Unlike Austen's other heroines who are barely in the leisure class like Elizabeth Bennet or one step away from poverty like Fanny Price, Emma Woodhouse is comfortably well-off; she doesn't need a husband to support her because she'll inherit a fortune from her widowed father, so she's free to cheerfully attempt to marry everybody else off according to her own inclinations. And her main project is her friend Harriet, the child of an unknown father (an enormous social stigma in early 19th-century England), whom she attempts to pair off with a snooty, social-climbing vicar, unable to see the damage she is doing to both. Fresh from one blunder, Emma races headlong into another, and yet another, until you want to yank her chain and bring her up short. And she almost undoes her own self when the man she realizes she has loved all along, her neighbor Mr. Knightley, begins to see potential in Harriet himself.We know the mess is going to get sorted out sooner or later; Austen has a genius for untangling messes and getting everybody back on the right track, but it's fun to watch Emma racing from one hairbrained scheme to the next and getting caught in the traps of her own devising. And we like her none the less for it. Because Emma, wrongheaded as she often is, doesn't have a mean bone in her body. She genuinely wishes everyone well, even though it's on her terms. It takes an older, wiser and more experienced head like Knightley's to help her see the error of her ways. Knightley is the perfect foil for Emma, with a wit and intelligence as sharp as her own, but providing maturity and stability to balance her free-floating exuberance.&quot;Emma&quot; is not Austen's best work; just as Emma is a somewhat airheaded creature, &quot;Emma&quot; lacks the depth of Austen's later books such as &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; and &quot;Persuasion&quot;. Emma, along with Elinor Dashwood and Elizabeth Bennet, is one of my three favorite Austen heroines, but Emma lacks the insight and maturity of the other two. Too often acts without thinking, but it's just this quality that makes her so endearing at times, even while it makes her so aggravating. Emma is probably Austen's most humanly fallible heroine, and maybe that's why we like her so much. Perfection is for gods and saints; Emma is for real."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I must admit, I had really high hopes for this novel. However, after reading the first chapter, I put it down to go onto a different novel. A few months and a few novels passed and I again picked it up to try again. History does, indeed, repeat itself. Another chapter down, I went to another novel.Finally, after owning the book for 8 months, I decided it was time to just do it. So, I refused to allow myself to put it down again for another novel. It took me about twelve chapters to become involved in any character besides Mr. Knightly and to enjoy the story... but it did come.Had I reviewed this book before chapter 12, I would have said, &quot;No way... this book is too slow and long winded!&quot; However, after finishing it, I appreciate the author and the story more than I did before.I will say this much, however: I have discovered that I am a reader of Charlotte Bronte, but a viewer of Jane Austin movies adapted to film."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"While doing research for a high school paper on Pride and Prejudice, I often came across the statement that Emma was Austen's masterpiece. Having practically memorized P&P; and Persuasion as a child, I found this near impossible to believe, especially as I couldn't get into Emma's dense text. Well, it's been 7 years hence and I'm eating my words. Emma is by far Austen's greatest literary achievement. The style and language and overall concept display her restraint and command as an author. Every word is perfectly chosen and placed - a brilliant feat that doesn't excite, but soothes the soul. The work isn't quite as plot-driven as P&P;, or even S&S;, and everything revolves around the ingenue, Emma Woodhouse. If there was such a thing as an epic about one simple person, Emma would be it.Love her or hate her, Emma is quite a creation. She's somehow both the heroine and anti-heroine, sincerely generous and wildly selfish, preternaturally poised and childishly weak. While Emma is not spared when she is wrong, it's very clear that Austen loves her - the sharpness of her satiric voice is soften by the overall tone of complacency and fondness. Never do you worry that Emma will turn out badly.In addition to the remarkably controlled and polished language and structure, Austen's voice is more in evidence here than in any other novel, much to her credit. The lack of a precise plot, makes the author's tone much more important - you feel with Emma, while also being able to judge her. Austen inhabits Emma's head, giving you her particular slant on things (with remarkable nonchalance and neutrality), but also looks at the world of Highbury at large, giving you the chance to also see things as they actually are (and gently laughing at Emma's egocentricity). Emma isn't the darling Elizabeth Bennet is, but neither is she so nearly one-dimensional. Elizabeth is a latter-day Emma - too right, too cool, too witty. Emma is more graceful, but human, conflicted, young. Sometimes seeing a character's gradual growth is a worth more than watching her get from Point A to Point B.The lesser characters set off Emma as the heroine more than her own actions do. They are seen as the typical flawed humans, who will stay irredeemably mediocre. Emma isn't really as perfect as she thinks she is, but she can and will grow beyond her immaturity. It's abundantly clear that Elton, Mrs. E, and even Harriet will never do so. As for the character who spouts off the mind-numbing chatter in all Austen's works, Miss Bates is the best of the bunch. What is amazing is how logically it all flows together. Genius.Emma is a princess, a do-gooder, a child-woman becoming a woman. While Emma is a bit hard to love, she is Austen's ideal: warm, sincere, graceful, teachable, and thinking. Her counterpart in her metamorphosis is Mr. Knightley. He's the everyman version of Darcy's integrity and presence, but approachable, wise, eloquent, and practical. His semi-role as Emma's teacher bothers some readers, but given their difference in age and experience, it's only natural. After all, he can't still be learning life's lessons at his age, unlike the young group in P&P.; All in all, Emma will be appreciated by readers who care about authorial voice and respect her more mature grasp of language. It's really quite impossible to compare P&P; and Emma - so to avoid disappointment, I don't recommend fixating on a rehash of a boy-meets-girl plot. This story is richly told and is most definitely about the girl."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Wow. I watched the movie before I read the book and just love what Jane Austen does to make this wild woman come to life."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"It was a most interesting story line. The very best feature of the book, though, is the quality of the prose. I only wish people today spoke with a little more elegance. Jane Austen should be our role model."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Everytime I read this I find something new. I love it. It's very witty and very entertaining.

The character has flaws that she takes a long time to realize, showing a very real situation that happens to all of us. We all become pretentious when we do something right and we tend to want to repeat feats without considering the particularities of each condition. We want to be observers without look each situation with attention and we want to be wise without learning to listen."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Jane Austen's works are an extreme favorite of mine but this is not my favorite. Emma is really snobby and a meddler. Hers is not a personality I would want others to emulate but she is well meaning. Mr. Knightley is the best character of all. There are several very fun characters in this novel."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma Woodhouse, author Jane Austen tells us in the very first sentence, was handsome, clever, and rich, and blessed with a happy disposition. In her first page, she suggests that the young Emma has perhaps had her own way in things too often. In her first chapter, we learn that Emma credits herself with having arranged the fortunate marriage of her governess to a wealthy neighbor, and believes herself more than ready to manage the social affairs of her hometown of Highbury.\\"Emma\\" is perhaps Jane Austen's most delicious romantic comedy, built around the match-making attempts of Miss Woodhouse, and the mangled relationships and social disasters that ensue. Although Emma means well, she ignores the advice of her good older friend Mr. Knightley to leave well enough alone, begining with her attempts to raise up the social status of her friend Harriet Smith. In the end, amid the ruins of her plans, Emma may face some difficult choices, and a fateful but priceless conversation with Mr. Knighley about her future.The comedy ripples through every chapter. Austen's supporting cast is well-chosen and well-written; this is a fun novel, and much more than a comedy of manners. Along the way, the reader will be treated to Emma's education in life, a worthwhile journey with an interesting ending. \\"Emma\\" is very highly recommended to fans of Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma is somewhat of a flip from Pride and Prejudice. Not as good, but still worth reading. Emma is the privileged one in her society and as she tries helping a less fortunate friend find love, she discovers that she is not as wise as she once thought. With a steady flow of characters and a great growth depiction in Emma, I just might read this again.The beginning dragged on a bit, you really have to get past 60% before anything particularly interesting happens, and I even really disliked Emma at first. However, she changes slowly (as opposed to the ever upsetting sudden growth that happens so often in other books) and even finds the classic romance of her own. Austin has a way of depicting things that describe so much more than she says. By the end I loved Emma, and even her most annoying companions. Don't read for a fast moving story, but if you want something that is relaxing and refreshing, Emma is your thing."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Beautiful Deluxe Edition!

This is one that is better in film IMHO."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Who can deny the fact that almost every earthling has taken up the fancy of arranging others' lives as roles of puppets? &quot;Life is a stage&quot; so Shakespeare claims, Emma Woodhouse just finds herself enthralled to such dramatic performances, and being so confident of her &quot;directing&quot; skill, scene after scene of Highbury romantic comedies come alive under the hands of Emma before she is even aware of them herself.A charming sample of Austen's lighter works, Emma presents the story of a Victorian era Cher, busy meddling with the love-conquests of her young apprentice Harriet Smith, fumbling into a carelessly-knit net of pretence, then rising to find her Prince Charming in a quiet corner of her throbbing young heart."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"The divison of opinion on this page is interesting but probably not surprising. Emma is a book for serious readers and if you go in expecting an easy-to-read page turner, then stick to Danielle Steele. (It is beyond depressing that two people who wrote reviews were somehow of the amazingly ignorant opinion that Jane Austen ripped off Alicia Silverstone's Clueless.....Rather difficult seeing as she was alive in the early 1800's .....hmmm.) Emma takes patience but it's a rewarding read, with all the complications, misunderstandings andbanality of your average soap opera yet shining with Austen's trademark subtle wit and mordant intelligence which has made this novel a classic.Books do require a little more time, effort and thinking than sitting mindlessly in front of Alicia Silverstone, but what you take away from the experience is a much wider understanding."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"As good as this book is, it is slow to start does not really pick up until after the 150 pages or so. But stick with it. However, those looking for an introduction to Jane Austen might be better suited with faster paced Pride &amp; Prejudice and gradually make your way toward this one.Two things that I liked very much about this book. The lead character is a likable but strong willed heroine with fixed ideas and the author is not afraid to use that to a disadvantage. Emma is flawed and it makes her interesting to read. Also, you get a stronger sense of community in a small victorian town and how they relied on one another found here than any of her other works that I have read. It's a very charming enjoyable aspect that works in the books favor. As far as premise goes, this is one of the more cohesive and linear of Austen's works and I can see the reason why this has been this has been adapted to film and stage so many times.What I liked about Bantams edition was there was no droll introduction or afterward by a scholar indicating why the book and author are important and lets the work speak for itself. What they did have was useful footnotes when the characters were referencing now obscure objects, writers and poets making the book more accessible.But as well as the book starting slowly, the other problem I had was that I found myself not emotionally investing in the characters. Emma is likeable, as stated before, but that was about it. Despite her appeal, she has no impact. Same goes with everyone else save for Miss Bates. The town spinster had me in stitches with her rambling monologues and sweet nature. When someone picks on her, it does make an impact.A nice story, just not a great one. Outside of the reservations mentioned, I'm glad I read it and recommend it."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma by Jane Austen is one of her more unknown works, and yes, it does seem tedious to read. However, those readers out there who say that they are &#34;very disappointed by emma&#34; are not thinking the right way.If everybody in the world were disappointed by books that are &#34;boring&#34; or &#34;tedious&#34; to read, nobody would ever have read Moby Dick or Les Miserables. (Not saying I think those books are boring, but in today's increasingly unappreciative society those books are considered boring to read).The real charm of classic books is digesting it and comprehending it, and in Austen's case, simply enjoying the satrical humor and wit that she subtly managed to sneak into all of her works.I know, as a middle school student, how easy it is to wander while reading or to just skim over the pages. Just keep on trying and one day you won't be disappointed by Emma. Just read slowly and get all those little gems of humor that Austen employed in her books.Also, who ever said you need to like the main character? Of course, everyone loves characters like Elizabeth Bennet. She's personable and likable. However, main characters are &#34;imperfect&#34; for a reason. What is the point of using literary examples in an essay if the literature doesn't depict realistic characters?Yes, Emma can be a snob, ignorant, and a little vain, but appreciate her for the human being she is and enjoy the classic Jane Austen book!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I've been a fan of Austen for 20 years and this is one of my favorites. It can appear to be a little stilted due to the time period it was written in, but the story is timeless and that's why movies keep getting made with it as a base story."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"The Penguin clothbound classics are beautiful. They make beautiful gifts and look great on the bookshelf. I looked everywhere and the price I paid on Amazon ($13.60) is by far the cheapest. They're a bargain at that price."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"If you collect books, this is a wonderful addition to almost any collection.

Can't wait for penguin to release more in this series."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma Woodhouse is an atypical heroine for a Jane Austen novel. Usually, we see disadvantaged girls struggle to find happiness through marriage. In Emma's case, we see a girl who has everything in the world she could want. She is rich, pretty, and happy. She has no desire to be married, as it would interfere with the simple life she enjoys with her father and she knows it would break his heart to be parted from her. The story follows Emma's life beginning at 21 as she tries to help a young girl named Harriet Smith marry above her station. Emma also engages in a flirtation with a young man and generally makes a bit of a mess of things whenever she gets involved.I have read that Jane Austen felt that Emma was a character only her creator could like. I would have to disagree with that. Emma is certainly flawed, but her heart is almost always in the right place. Pride has blinded her to her own limitations but she is also one who does not shrink from the responsibility of her mistakes and tries very hard to learn from them. I found this admirable and grew to like her more and more as the book progressed.Aside from Emma, the rest of the cast was also very well written. Her father is a complete hypochondriac and often engages in behavior that would typically be considered highly rude. Yet, he is motivated so completely by a desire to be kind to others that his misguided application of that desire only endears him to the reader. Mr. Knightley, the no-nonsense friend of the family is admittedly not the most complex character in the world, but he is a very good one and his solidity is a great counterbalance to Emma's wishful thinking.In summary, Emma is a nice change of pace from Jane Austen's other novels. It starts off well and grows more engaging as it continues. The characters are interesting and Emma herself grows considerably during the course of the novel."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Be warned: this book is slow. very slow. i loved pride and prejudice, but i would have quit partway through this one if it hadn't been a gift.However, if you have the patience and fortitude to get through it, you will be rewarded. Though i could have done without so much detail about the planning of a party, or full chapters of Emma and Mr. Knightley talking things to death, it was an overall good book. Emma is very fully developed. She starts out, not as a good girl with some faults, but as a vain, selfish, silly young woman, and comes out by the end of the book deeply and believably changed.one thing I particularly enjoyed is that since Emma was always so wrong in her guesses, it was up to the reader to figure out what was really going on, and who was in love with whom. Especially towards the end, I had a lot of fun picking out hints and speculating, and seeing my guesses come out right.The book isn't so amazing that i would urge everyone to struggle through the whole length of it, but it's a worthwhile and enjoyable read. it just could have been much shortened."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"This was the first time I had \\"read\\" Emma. What have I been missing? This is a beautiful book, and beautifully read in this CD version. I don't think literature gets any better than this. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma Woodhouse, \\"handsome, clever, and rich,\\" is the 21-year-old daughter of the elderly owner of Hartfield, the largest estate in Highbury. Though only a couple of hours away from London by carriage, Highbury regards itself as an isolated and virtually self-contained community, with the Woodhouse family the center of social life and at the top of its social ladder. Emma, doting on her hypochondriac father, whom she represents to the outside world, has grown up without a mother's softening influence, and at twenty-one, she is bright, willful, and not a little spoiled. Having too little to do to keep out of trouble, Emma's hobby is matchmaking, \\"the greatest amusement in the world,.\\" Unfortunately, her sophistication in the social graces does not extend to much insight into human beings.Taking Harriet Smith, a young woman of \\"questionable birth\\" under her wing, Emma makes Harriet her \\"project,\\" educating her in the social graces, convincing Harriet not to marry farmer Robert Martin, who has courted her, and ultimately persuading Harriet, wrongly, that the vicar, Mr. Elton, is falling in love with her. Bored and without a large circle of \\"suitable\\" friends, Emma is an incorrigible meddler, playing with the lives of those around her, snubbing those she considers inferior, gossiping about others in an attempt to divert attention to herself, and misreading intentions. Only Mr. Knightly, sixteen years older than Emma and a friend of her father, stands up to Emma and tells her what he thinks of her behavior, and it is through him that she eventually begins to grow.Love and the formal protocol of marriage are a major focus here, with marriage more often a merger of \\"appropriate\\" families than the result of romance or passion. Class distinctions, acknowledged by all levels of society, limit both personal friendships and romantic possibilities, and as Emma's matchmaking fails again and again, causing grief to many of her victims, Emma begins to recognize that her pride, willfulness, and love of power over others have made her oblivious to her own faults. Austen shines in her depiction of Emma and her upperclass friends, gently satirizing their weaknesses but leaving room for them to learn from their mistakes-if only they can learn to recognize the ironies in their lives. Though Emma may be, in some ways, Austen's least charming heroine, she is certainly vibrant and, with her annoying faults, a most realistic one. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"&quot;Emma&quot; was the first Jane Austen book I read, and after reading all of Austen's novels, it is still my favorite. The plot is amusing, and it kept my interest from beginning to end. Indeed, I couldn't put the book down until I finished it. For those who think that it is too difficult a read, try it. I was only 12 the first time I read it, and I enjoyed it immensely. Also, I would like to set the record straight concerning the movie Clueless, which was based on &quot;Emma&quot;. Clueless was made in the 1990's, while Jane Austen was born in the late 1700's and died in her forties. It is rather obvious that &quot;Emma&quot; came first. I know this at the age of 17, and can only wonder where certain reviewers were during English class. Back to the book, though - I loved it and would recommend it to anyone!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma is the first Jane Austen novel I ever read, and 13 years later it's still my favorite. It's also the most accessible, easy to read Austen novel. I literally could not put this book down. I thought all the characters, especially Emma, were wonderful. The title character, whie arrogant, was well meaning in her attempts to play matchmaker for the people around her. I could really relate to her, because I recognized that I've met people like her. She was at once funny, well intentioned, spoiled, controlling, and sweet. This book is really funny. The introduction is very useful in helping the reader keep all the events of the story straight. As well, it gives readers insight into the times, and into Austen's views about society. I really appreciated having the cast of characters printed at the beginning of the book, because there are alot (sometimes, it seems, too many) characters inhabiting the book. Because each person in the novel is so distinct and well drawn, the occasional confusion is worth it. I highly reccommend this book to anyone!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Jane Austen's \\"Emma\\" is a good read. I consider Austen a mistress of dialogue and of creating very colourful, vivid and almost touchable characters. These two points make \\"Emma\\" a very enjoyable novel.The only thing I found weak - as it is in other Austen's books - is the sudden turns in the story, events that have an incredibly atrificial (or deus ex machina) taste to them.It almost feels like Austen has tried to twist the entangled situations in such a way as to ensure a undisputable happy ending.Despite of the shaky storyline, the main character - Emma Woodhouse - comes through as credible and realistic. She has her faults, she makes mistakes, and inspite her wit and intelligence, she is young and inexperienced and this makes her very much like any other young woman in the 21st centrury - a young woman who has to go through some blunders in order to learn about life and herself.It is Emma's character that makes the whole book worthy of purchasing and adding to one's library. I would suggest \\"Emma\\" above any other Jane Austen's classics for it is obviously the most mature book of them all."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I first read this novel when I was a teenager, and while I liked it because it was Jane Austen, I was so exasperated by Emma herself that I left it alone after that. I have just re-read it, and realized that I just didn't get it first time round. Fun is being poked at Emma the entire time by Austen - Emma's words and thoughts are her own, reported through the ironic medium of Austen's prose. It is Emma who is too snooty to go to the Coles' party, for instance, and Emma who is mocked by Austen both for that and for her fall from that supposed high ground when she sees that she will be bored and alone if she doesn't go. Austen doesn't say it, she merely reports Emma, and we have to work it out. It is all perfectly done; the perfection of it makes me catch my breath. If you didn't like it, try it again."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"For me, reading Jane Austen's novel EMMA is a delight. However, not all readers have been in agreement with me over the years including Jane Austen herself who warned her family before publication \\"I am going to take a heroine whom no-one but myself will much like.\\" She was of course making fun of herself in her own satirical way; - her critics on the other hand, were quite serious. When the book was published in 1815, Austen sent a copy to her contemporary author Maria Edgeworth who gave up reading the novel after the first volume, passing it on to friend and complaining, \\"There is no story in it.\\" Others had mixed feelings offering both praise and blame for its focus on the ordinary details of a few families in a country village. One important advocate of Emma was Sir Walter Scott, whose essay published in the Quarterly Review of 1815 represents the most important criticism on Austen's writing during her lifetime. Even though the review was published anonymously, she must have been quite giddy when the reviewer heralded her EMMA as a \`new style of novel' designed to \`suit modern times'. Heady stuff to be sure. When it was later learned that Scott had contributed the review, it would placed Jane Austen in a whole other league of writers.EMMA can be enjoyed on different levels, and for pure humour and witty dialogue it may reign as Austen's supreme triumph. Just Google quotes from EMMA and you might agree that it has the best bon mots of any of her novels. Modern critics claim it as her masterpiece, and I do not doubt it. PRIDE AND PREJUDICE may be the most beloved and well know of her works, but Emma represents Austen at the height of her writing skill and power as a story teller. Like some of Austen's contemporaries, the modern reader might find challenges in its minutiae and supposed lack of story. Not to worry. There are many sources available to assist in understanding Jane Austen's subtle and often witty dialogue, her unique characterizations, and help place the novel in historical context.One source to consider is the new 2008 edition of EMMA, by Oxford World's Classics. Recently revised in 2003, this re-issue contains the same supplemental and textual material with a newly designed cover. For a reader seeking a medium level of support to help them along in their understanding you will be happy to find a thoughtful 23 page introduction by associate Professor of English and Women's Studies Adela Pinch of the University of Michigan. The essay contains a brief introduction, and segments on Shopping and Suburbia, Narrative Voices: Gossip and the Individual, The Politics of Knowledge, and Emma: Much Ado About Nothing?. Her emphasis is on understanding Austen's choice of writing about the ordinary and extraordinary aspects of the lives of its heroine Emma Woodhouse and her circle of family and friends in Highbury, a small English village in which she sets about to match make for all of its singletons blundering hilariously along the way. I particularly appreciated Prof. Pinch's positive comments throughout the essay.\\"Austen makes voices stick in the mind through her use of free indirect discourse, which makes character's voice seem indelible, capable of soaking into other beings. But she also uses the same technique for representing thought. Her cultivation of this mode of representing her heroines' minds has made her novels crucial to the history of the English novel, markers of a movement when the novel as a literary genre perfects its inward turn, and begins to claim human psychology as its territory. Above all it creates the feeling of intimacy with her heroines that many readers prize.\\" Page xvii-xviiiIf I may be so bold and interject as the everyman Austen reader for a moment, parts of this essay are scholarly and touch on areas beyond my immediate understanding, especially when she delves into the philosophical and psychological pedantry. For the most part, Prof. Pinch's essay is written in accessible language and is reverent and admiring to the author and the heroine. I found this outlook refreshing since the heroine Emma, and the novel EMMA have received some criticisms for their shortcomings over the centuries. The novel is about so much more than the \\"no story\\" that Maria Edgeworth hastily condemned it to be. I especially adore Emma's little friend Harriet Smith and think her much maligned in the recent movie adaptations, and well - can there ever be enough praise bestowed upon Mrs. Elton? She is comedic genius and worthy of a nomination to the literary comedy hall of fame.Professor Pinch has also supplied the helpful explanatory notes throughout the text which are numbered on the page allowing the reader to refer to the back of the book for explanation. Honestly, I prefer them to be footnoted at the bottom of the page instead of riffling back and forth, but that is a quibble on convenience. The remainder of the supplemental material; Biography of Jane Austen, Note on the Text, Select Bibliography, Chronology of Jane Austen, Appendix A: Rank and Social Status, and Appendix B: Dancing are repeated throughout the other Jane Austen editions in this series.This Oxford edition is a sweet little volume at an incredible price if you are in the market for a middlin amount of supplemental material from reputable sources containing an authorative text edited for the modern reader. If you enjoy matchless wit and irony, unforgettable characters, and a unique story that turns the everyday imaginings of a young Georgian era woman into an extraordinary story filled with a comedy of manners and romance, then take note; - Miss Emma Woodhouse commands you to purchase this book immediately!Laurel Ann, Austenprose"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Prunella Scales is wonderfully talented. Good separation of characters. Her rendition of Miss Bates is incredible - leaves one breathless."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I've read Sense and Sensability, Pride and Prejudice, Northanger Abbey, and most recently Emma, and while all of them are wonderful, this one was, to me, the most engaging. The characters are all really well developed, especially Emma, who is portrayed as incredibly human. You always like and sympathize with her, but sometimes you want to slap her. The story is, briefly, about Emma, who lives with her father Mr. Woodhouse. She has vowed herself never to marry, but loves to play matchmaker. She has just matched her former governess, &quot;Poor Miss Taylor,&quot; up with Mr. Weston, and is quite proud of her success. Mr. Knightly, a neighbor and the brother of her older sister's (Isabella) husband (Mr. John Knightly), warns her about meddling, but she doesn't take him seriously. Soon Emma befriends a young girl of unknown parentage (she is illegitimate and her father, while providing for her care, remains anonymous) named Harriet. Harriet is in love with a farmer named Robert Martin, but Emma thinks that he is beneath her, so manages to talk her out of accepting his marraige proposal. Instead, thinking that she would be a perfect match for Mr. Elton, another local gentleman, encourages Harriet to set her sights on him. Harriet actually talks herself into being in love with him, until everything is ruined because Mr. Elton turns out to be in love with Emma instead. She turns him down and he leaves town, soon returning with a wife, whom no one likes.Meanwhile, Mr. Weston's son (Mr. Frank Churchill), who was sent to be raised by his aunt when his mother died, comes to visit his father and flirts constantly with Emma, who is flattered and flirts back. She begins to think she might be in love with him, but when he leaves town again to go back to his aunt and uncle, her feelings cool down. Another out of town visitor, Jane Fairfax, who is the niece of the rather irritating Mrs. and Miss Bates, has also come. Jane is destined to become a governess because she does not come from a wealthy family. Emma and Frank had been speculating about her, because Emma thought she was secretly in love with her friend's husband and that was the reason for her coming, and Frank said he agreed. Emma is jealous of Jane anyway because she is more talented and accomplished than Emma, but whenever she says anything against her to Mr. Knightly, he defends her. Mrs. Weston tells Emma that she thinks Mr. Knightly is in love with Jane, which horrifies Emma because if Knightly marries, then her nephew would no longer be the heir of his estate. Meanwhile Frank Churchill returns and Emma thinks that Harriet is now in love with him. Harriet does say that she has feelings for a certain gentleman that they both know, and that she thinks Emma knows the one she means, and asks for advice about whether she has a chance and should persue it. Emma encourages her, and meanwhile realizes that she has feelings for Mr. Knightley. Then another problem arises. I don't want to say too much more because I don't want to spoil the story if you don't know it, but the plot becomes even more complicated before everything is resolved. But it's a great book and if you are only going to read one Jane Austen novel, this is the one to pick."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel. While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).Modern readers tend to be squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings. A lesser delight."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I read this book in college and I reread it every so often. Emma is a funny, light story that is more than a little touching.

It is a long but engaging story of Emma Woodhouse who lives in the fictional village of Highbury 16 miles from London. The novel is in many ways a \\"bildungsroman\\" as Emma changes and matures to win her man and a place in literary lovers' hearts.The major players in this Jane Austen classic are:Emma Woodhouse-Emma is the spoiled daughter of widower Woodhouse. She loves playing matchmaker to young couples resulting in disastrous results!Emma is flawed but lovable and good hearted.Mr. Woodhouse-One of Austen's most hilarious characters. Mr. Woodhouse is a foolish nincimpoop always worried about the temperature and catching a cold. He does not want Emma to marry since he prefers she stay home and take care of his fussbudget needs. He reminds this reviewer of a character who could have fit in well in a Dickens novel.Mr. Knightley. This wealthy landowner has been in love with Emma since she was 13. One of the charms of this comedy of manners is the conversation he engages in with Emma. He is a wise man and good judge of moral character. Emma foolishly thinks the merchant's daughter Harriet is in love with him. His name says it all for he is a knight in shining armor!Harriet Smith-Emma seeks to mate her with the odious Rev. Mr. Elton but her plans go awry with he weds the foolish Mrs. Augusta Elton. Harriet is an innocent young lady who wrongly allows Emma to advice her on matters of the heart. She will later wed the mundane farmer Robert Martin.Frank Churchill; He is the son of Mr. Weston a local landowner. Weston had married Ms. Taylor who had been the maid at Emma's home for 18 years.Frank is a charmer with a weak character. Emma is briefly infatuated by him but learns his true nature from the faithful Mr. Knightley. He is anything but frank in explaining his past amours to Emma and Harriet.Jane Fairfax is a lovely lass who has been secretly engaged to Frank Churchill. As the novel ends this pair wed. Jane is lovely but strikes this reviewer has lacking mental strength!Miss Bates-A minor character who has the gift of gab! She rattles on withlittle thought in several of the novel's chapters. I see her as an early form in English fiction of stream of consciousness monologue later mastered by such masters as James Joyce and William Faulkner.Emma is usually rated alongside \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" as one of the two best novels written by Jane Austen. I enjoyed it immensely but note that there is a lot of talking and not much action. Austen liked to take a few country families and discuss a love affair or two in her narrowly focused works. She is the indisputed queen of romance fiction and is as popular today as she was when the book was published in 1816. This fall Masterpiece Theatre will be airing dramatizations of all six novels. We Janeites are a growing army of devoted fans. Jane only wrote 6 books but each is a masterpiece!"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Genteel society in early 19th century England proved resourceful in conjuring up their own rural entertainment. Dinner parties, amateur musicales, cards, charades and balls provided indoor amusement, while picnics, local excursions or taking the waters in fancy resorts took the restless upper crust out of doors. Lacking telephones and even telegrams Austen's characters relied on local mail delivery by their servants or trusted in the efficiency of the British Post to bring detailed, epistolary news into their information-starved lives.While the men discussed politics and their farming interests, most ladies devoted great mental and verbal energy to schemes for romance-encouraging or quashing. The fair sex plotted and surmised about their neighbors and relatives'affections for one another. In true Victorian style pregnancy was hushed over, but village gossips took great delight in pondering such weighty matters as one's birth, social station and probable inheritance.In addition the whims of older relatives must be humored at all cost, since they held the of purse strings which could make or break the success of a young person's suit. Marriage after all was still more in the interest of the parents than for the sake of actual love.Twenty-one-year old Emma Woodhouse is the younger daughter and mistress of the home of her elderly father. Having recently lost her young governess/companion to marriage, Emma undertakes a new social challenge: to mentor in her turn 17-year-old Harriet-a recent graduate of a local boarding school. The plot revolves around Emma\`s subtle attempt to mold Harriet's immature heart in certain directions, indicated by insincere behavior on the part of various young men. Having frustrated what she considers an inferior proposal on Harriet's behalf, Emma gradually learns that she has meddled too much and caused needless unhappiness.Several young couples court and become engaged in the course of this light novel, but all is not as it seems on the surface, due to a secret engagement and surprising twists of Cupid's darts. Harriet's heart is easily swayed by suggestions and appearances--without direct, verbal confirmation--so it is Emma who matures the most. She has long been sensitive of the good opinion of her 31-year-old neighbor, Mr. Knightly, who on two occasions finds it necessary to reprove her thoughtless behavior. What does she care, since she has already declared that will never marry-which would mean deserting her doting butdoddering father.This novel is Austen-lite, though in extensive format (over 400 pages), with many long letters which fill in the off stage action--which proves to be wherever our Emma is Not present. The heroine's own tender heart is swayed first by this man, then by another. The advent of young persons into the village of Highbury is welcomed by local society-ever appreciative of newcomers to the social mix. Inside these pages one encounters the typical village gossips and snobs of course, who make everyone's business their private agenda. Ah, how will these impetuous young persons sort out their feelings andrelationships? Especially without antagonizing or distressing their elders? EMMA is almost a sly treatise on early Victorian social and moral restrictions, delightfully disguised as a novel."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Although I enjoyed the novel, I believe it is really a matter of personal preference. If you like this kind of books that don't take place in our century and are common to Austen's style (that is, long and elaborate expositions and extensive character development), then Emma is a perfect read. However, if those books are not exactly what you enjoy, then it would no longer be as captivating for you."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"Emma is a must read for Austen fans. Filled with the wit, the scandal, the light-hearted fun and the 17th century morals we have come to expect.

This story not only lacks any action or plot of sorts but insists on spending copious amounts of pages on meaningless blabber. I had to make a summary of the novel. It took only 1 page. My teahcer could not criticise my summary. I had covered EVERYTHING in the novel! I found Emma to be one of the most irritating characters ever created, for those who boldly state she is the greatest 'heroine', I will say, Joan of Ark was a heroine, Mary mother of Jesus was a heroine, Mother Teresa was a heroine, EMMA is a pretentios, self absorbed, controling, spoilt, BORING individual and should be left in her time and not studied in ours.

And boy did I have to push myself to finish it ! Like another reviewer said: it looks like a blueprint of the movie Clueless. But less funny and al lot more boring.But maybe I'm being to harsh on Jane Austen. Not all books survive the teeth of time like Pride and Prejudice. If that is what life was like for a lot of high class girls in the early 19th century, than I am so gratefull that I'm born at the end of the 20th century !!! Miss Bates monologues were kinda funny the first few times, but after that... The same goes for Emma's father with his hypochondriac tendensies.We see Emma growing up during the book, from a spoiled girl who likes to matchmake her best friends, into a (still spoiled) woman who has given up the matchmaking after she realizes that time after time her meddeling in the love-life of other people did a lot more harm than good.Also not of this time (I hope) are the class-differences. Of course, we still have them, but it is not like they cannot mix, these days. Or that we still have those rules about visiting and inviting. or at least nog were I live."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I do like 19th Century fiction. I do like Pride and Predjudice. I know lots of people don't like saying Classics are uninteresting. Apparantly Jane Austen said after writing this book that she had wanted to create a character that no-one would like but herself. I am the only person I know who hates Emma. I agree that the book is well written but I just don't like Emma. Sorry if you do."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I'm sure for some people out there, this book's a godsend, and I'm sure some people actually like Emma. Me personally, the book's not all that great, and I despise Emma. Why?, you may ask; because a) too many words, there's at least twice as many words to describe one thing as there is necessary. Yeah, so maybe I don't feel like 'hard reading' but it doesn't leave much to the imagination, and I'm a person who likes to have my imagination do the driving. The other reason I didn't particularly like the book - well, I don't get my kicks from reading about manipulative, immature women, which is my opinion of Emma. Manipulative, because she assumes it's her right to make matches, immature because she doesn't see anything wrong with it, especially when she's confronted with it. she has the 'i'm always right' feeling you'll sometimes find in a five year old. Other than that, for people who like wordy books, and as someone else said, like soaps, then read the book."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"This book tell us such a simple story. But I guarantee that its simple story would make you not to be bored to read this book more and more."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"I love the time period in which Jane Austin writes-these books are very good and also very captivating"},{"Title":"Emma","review":"This book is VERY poor condition. The pages are uneven and look like they were cut when the blade needed changing or sharpening or cut with too many at once.I am returning it to Amazon, the only good thing is that I bought it with Amazon, they are paying for return shipping. I have to say that I am very pleased with Amazon's CS. I am a frequent customer and will continue to be."},{"Title":"Emma","review":"If you have not yet read this book, and are not a regular reader of literary fiction, be forewarned. Though Jane Austen has skyrocketed in popularity these days (what with all her novels being made into movies) do not think that what you have seen on the screen is what you will get between the book covers. Emma Thompson did not get the Oscar for BEST ADAPTATION for a screenplay for nothing (Sense and Sensibility).Contemporary readers are used to being drawn immediately into a story and kept interested by a novel's action. Emma does neither. Emma was written at a time in history when there was no film industry, television, or radio to compete with a leisurely journey through a book. For those of us born in the 20th Century, Emma is boring at times. Emma is confusing at times (did she say that or did Frank Churchill?). And Emma is sometimes too subtle for the backwoods American public to pick up on (I'm being cute, not derogatory). I personally will admit to liking the movie (with Gweneth Paltrow) better than the novel. Emma is the third Jane Austen novel I have read, and I oh, so long to feel like Meg Ryan does in &quot;You've Got Mail&quot; wondering if Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy will get together each time she reads Pride and Prejudice. But I don't. I just want to know when I'm going to be finished.And this is coming from someone who studied Shakespeare in college and found it so frustrating that I couldn't share his hilarious jokes with my roommates because they never understood them. So I'm not as uncultured as I seem (to all you Jane Austen fans).Historically, however, Jane Austen deserves to be read. Her rhythm and her magical way of putting together a sentence are things to be experienced. She deserves the place she holds in Literary History. However, a Jane Austen virgin must come to the table with that understanding. You must read for the experience, read for the erudition, and expect to push through some dialogue that runs longer than one page.As for what the book is about-- Well, read everyone else's review! :)"},{"Title":"The builders;: A story and study of Masonry, (National Masonic library)","review":"I finished reading this book between my E.A. and F.C. confirmations and want to read it again (as a M.M.), but it is on loan to one of my brothers. This is a book every mason ought to read. It is full of references to good literature and gives a very articulated and informative view of many aspects of masonry. While not as hard to read as Moral and Dogma, it does take a minute to absorb, but it is none the less very well written. I say all this pertaining to the 1916 or so 1st edition (from the 2nd printing) that I inherited from my Grandfather, which is hardbound approx. 292 pages.

After all, the S.A.T.'s aren't about what you've learned in the past twelve years, but rather how well you take the test. This year, six seniors (Kyle, Matty, Anna, Desmond, Fransesca, and Roy) are going where no high school seniors have gone before. Into the ETS building, to steal the S.A.T.'s, and secure their futures. And, you know, to also please their parents.Levithan has done a fantastic job of turning the movie THE PERFECT SCORE, into a very enjoyable novelization. The characters are witty, and smart-mouthed, and the dialogue is exactly the same as what is shown on the previews for the movie. Unlike most teen movies/books, THE PERFECT SCORE's main story is not overshadowed by romance between characters, which is an enjoyable change. Teens preparing to take the S.A.T.'s will relate greatly to the characters, and see exactly where they are coming from. Fans of the movie will be impressed by the novelizations likeness to the film, and relish in every page they turn. A must-have.Erika Sorocco"},{"Title":"The Perfect Score","review":"This book was boring!! There was only a couple funny parts! One good part in the whole story is when they're are trying to steal the test, you keep reading to see what happens. One funny part is when Roy sees the crow and he's scared of it, then when they steal the test Roy's friends (not sayin anymore names) told him to go outside he's like \\"I'm not stayin out there wit dat big ass crow!\\" I thought that was pretty funny, but you have to read it to see. If you read this book and don't like my review never take opinions from a twelve year old, but out of all the books I read this one was really boring!!"},{"Title":"Frank Lloyd Wright: Preserving the Architectural Heritage- Decorative Designs From the Domino's Pizza Collection","review":"This tremendous book, brought to you by the nation's favourite pizzeria, shows a genius at work. What is evident in the work of Lloyd Wright, and what can certainly be seen in this magnificent retrospective, is his continual striving to incorporate innovation with consistency in order to create an architectural grammar which was, though eclectic, uniquely American. Take, for example the Larkin Building, in which the architect showed his willingness to experiment with new materials and technologies. Just as Lloyd Wright innovated with air-conditioning, plate-glass windows, integral desk furniture and suspended toilet bowls, so the Domino's Master Piemaker brings an almost symphonic unity to his work with multifaceted swathes of mushroom, cantilevered tranches of melting cheese and geometric designs hewn from pork. As David Hanks says in his helpful introduction &quot;The romantic spirit that Wright brought to all his buildings is that same unabashed virtuosity that is brought boxed and piping hot to your door (thanks to their revolutionary new HeatWave packaging system) when you phone for a delicious Domino's pizza from any one of their 6200 franchised stores worldwide&quot;."},{"Title":"Colebrook Stories","review":"I will update the info with this book soon.

Marriage - to him ! Not a love match, of course, but a marriage of convenience.Venetia should have rejected him but strangely found herself agreeing - hoping with all her heart that the stranger she was marrying would one day grow to care for her - as much as she loved him.This is another of Neels' wonderful stories about a lovely, compassionate woman making her way in the world all alone. She loses the last of her family and faces little prospect of sharing her vast reserves of compassion and kindness with anyone other than her patients. Though she considers herself plain and unremarkable, the doctor has better instincts. It may take him a while to admit all of what he has gained, and how deeply he cares, but he takes care of her and protects her from the first moment they meet. He finally proves his ability to judge true beauty and character from an ordinary pair of loving gray eyes !This is a true Betty Neels staple romance and will greatly satisfy loyal readers as well as indoctrinating and enslaving new readers of her work."},{"Title":"The Convenient Wife","review":"God only knows why I like these books so much but, alas I do! I am a Betty Neels addict. This was one of her best with the heroine student nurse Ventetia Forbes and the brain surgeon Duert Lan te- something.

I'm sorry but I think she did a terrible job and I was very disappointed. Occasionally she would use an English accent for the heroine but mostly spoke with an American accent and seemed to keep forgetting that the character was an English girl and even worse was her accent for the hero who was from Holland. Her attempts at a Dutch accent were horrendous and the worst attempt at a Dutch accent I have ever heard and it sounded more like she was speaking with her mouth full of food or with a mouth full of marbles and it made the character sound like someone with a bad speach impediment rather then some guy from The Netherlands. I have heard real, actual Dutch accents and they do not sound like that!"},{"Title":"The Convenient Wife","review":"This review is for the March 2007 Large Print Edition (ISBN 0263198413); there was no link to review this edition.Book Description: The professor made it very clear, \\"You have no family, no home, and no prospect of marrying.\\" Duert ter Laan-Luitinga told Venetia, as if she wasn't fully aware of her precarious position. His solution to the problem took her by surprise. Marriage-to him! Not a love match, of course, but a marriage of convenience. Venetia should have rejected him but strangely found herself agreeing hoping with all her heart that the stranger she was marrying would one day grow to care for her-as much as she loved him.She was plain, had no looks to speak of; her grandmother, who raised her after her parents' death, died leaving only an unknown distant cousin as her only family; she no longer had a home; and with no boyfriend or marriage prospect on the horizon. But she was a second year student nurse, a sister-like friend to everyone, and could make a career for herself.He was a consultant, eminent brain surgeon and professor, no nonsense, and medicine was his life.

And what would happen to their marriage then?This is another typical Betty Neels story-doctor and nurse, but I liked the way the plot moved, and the love grew between them. Though at times Duert's character could be annoying. Why a wife, why not a governess? Venetia's character was quiet and shy, but not a doormat.

So i continued to read it and by the time he (i can't remember the leading man's name) drops Venetia home for the first time, I was slowly being drawn in. Mostly because I was irritated at this man's lack of concern. I wanted to see if she would put him in his place. Although there was not a confrontation of that sort, I still enjoyed the book immensely. I cannot explain what it was about the book, but it definitely held my interest. It was a love story, and yet it was not. I mean it was not a blatant love story, but instead the insinuation of it. I just can't explain it.

Most review books are written in a paragraph form that does not at all aid the visual memorization of the page ; Something that makes one lose focus as one reads more and, after sometime, the acquired information starts to melt together into a perfectly unrecognizable cocktail that can by no means help one in an exam setting , much less in a clinical one. This book, however ,with its question-answer format, presents the information in a very memorable and thought-provoking manner that makes later revision a MUCH easier task than the revision of other review books. With all due respect to the great and famous Lippincot Pharmacology , this book is a lot better . It has almost all the information in Lippincot but written in a more user-friendly manner.

The layout is the same as it is in the entire \\"Recall\\" series and, in my opinion, greatly enhances the effectiveness of this book. Instead of reading paragraph after paragraph of explanations, I think the question-answer format is much more conducive to memorization.Having said that, knowing the information in this book will probably only be sufficient to get you 80-85% of the Pharm questions correct. It was published in 2000 and perhaps the material in it was completed a year or two before that. Consequently, there were a few drugs that I had never seen before - especially in the CNS pharmacology, cancer, and anti-inflammatory drugs. As an example, in one of the cases, the book states that enuresis in kids is treated with imipramine. So, when I read through the case I was relatively confident that I would pick the correct answer and move on. Nope, imipramine was not listed in the foils. Instead, the follow-up question was something along the lines of: \\"if first-line therapy does not work, which second line agent would be appropriate?\\" This time it was listed. That's just one example, but there are others and, in some cases, questions asking for the indications, adverse effects, and contraindications of drugs that are not listed in Pharm Recall.If I had it to do over again, I would probably buy this book but not rely on it exclusively. Instead, I'd look for something a little more recent and use that as my primary source - maybe do a section of Pharm Recall at night before bed to hammer the big ideas home. Good luck guys."},{"Title":"Pharmacology Recall","review":"There was only drug I didnt know about on my Step 1 exam thanks to this book. It comes with free audio, so you can always study on the go.

There are short, individual chapters for the book and audio portions, which makes finding specific topics easy. I listen to each section a few times and eventually try to answer the questions before the other person on the audio responds.

May of Purdue University, offers an in depth look at mid-19th Century filibusters.Dr. May first gives a detailed history of the filibusters. First, he details the origins of the name and then describes the roots of filibustering. Then, he details all the prominent attempts to filibuster. He goes on to explain why Americans filibustered, why the United States government was unable to stop the filibusters, and the logistics involved in financing a filibuster attempt. Lastly, he deals with the consequences of the filibuster movement; specifically, how it affected United States foreign policy and the War Between the States.Dr. May's goal in writing this book was to give the filibuster movement its proper place in history. He thought that too few historians had studied what the filibuster movement was, who was involved, how it came about, and its consequences. Dr. May wished for people to get a better understanding of the filibusters and what they meant in the history of America.Dr. May did an excellent job in making his arguments and conclusions. Every time he makes a proposition, he backs up the statement with numerous facts. At the end of the book are 107 pages of notes, showing the amount of detail Dr. May gave to the book. I had always thought filibusters sought the expansion of slavery, and were few. This book taught me how widespread the filibuster movement was, and how much United States officials hated it. I never before realized how much the filibuster movement affected antebellum life in America. Previous lessons about filibusters never taught me as much as this book; after reading this book, I feel that I have read The Complete Idiot's Guide to Filibusters, only written in words that do not insult my intelligence. The author could not have done a better job at illustrating his points.The best feature of the book is how well organized it is. Everything is logically discussed at the appropriate time. The voluminous notes guarantee the academic reliability of the book.The only thing wrong with this book is that some details were skipped over in order to give further impact of other subjects. The epilogue was rather rushed; more detail about filibusters adjusting to life after the War Between the States would have been welcomed. A comparison between the filibusters and the gold miners of the California Gold Rush and the Yukon Rush would have been welcomed. The legacy of the filibusters in the annexation of Hawaii in the 1890's would also have been welcomed. Also, the Monroe Doctrine was curiously absent throughout the book; how it was impacted by the filibuster movement seems necessary, but absent. Still, it is easy to overlook these deficiencies.Still, I am glad that I have read this book. As an American historian, I feel now that I had missed out on an important aspect of antebellum American society. I never before realized how necessary it was for an American historian to have knowledge of the filibusters."},{"Title":"Manifest Destiny's Underworld: Filibustering in Antebellum America","review":"I had the honor of studying under Professor May as a graduate student in the early 90s. May had the well earned reputation of being a tough task master, especially when it came to our research skills and proper citation of sources. This work lives up to my memories of the author as being exacting, an exceptional writer, and \\"deep\\" in his examination of a fascinating and little known phenomena in the pre-war South. Highly recommended to serious students of the period and the more general reader wishing to explore the activities of proponents of slavery and American expansionism prior to the advent of the war."},{"Title":"Manifest Destiny's Underworld: Filibustering in Antebellum America","review":"If you're looking for relaxing weekend reading and a well-spun tale then avoid this book. I imagine that it is excellent source for academic historians of the period. There are scattered references to a few critical incidents all through the book so it is not easy to follow.I was also disappointed that the book is written only from a US-centric perspective with no coverage of the victims of filibustering: did nothing of note happen in Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Panama, etc during the period? How were the coalitions built that finally disgorged Walker and other filibusters from their Central American footholds? The epilogue finally addresses some of the damage that these pirates did to US reputation in the rest of the Americas, but a lot more could be said."},{"Title":"Cosmic Keys: Fortunetelling for Fun and Self-Discovery (Llewellyn's Self-Help Series)","review":"I have had the pleasure of having many personal readings by the author.

It enables you to learn about several methods of divination--all the while practicing these to learn more about yourself. It seemed dead-on accurate to me. It covers surprisingly many methods. For example the astrology section typical zodiac as well as chinese style. The numerology section includes your personal days as well as where you are in terms of your personal cycle. The palm-reading section is clearly illustrated. In fact the whole book has great artwork. One of the coolest things about this book is that it doesn't just teach you about the methods--it leads you to use them for self-inquiry.It's a nicely-done book and they have kept the price very reasonable."},{"Title":"The Most Dangerous Man","review":"This book has the full title of &quot;Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, the most dangerous man since jesus christ&quot;... From the back cover: I think of him (OSHO) as a great man, that his persecution makes a liar and a hypocrite out of anyone who claims there is religious freedom in the US. Im sure the US government is behind him being denied entry to this and other countries... He is obviously a very effective man, otherwise he wouldnt be such a threat. He's saying the same things that nobody else has the courage to say..."},{"Title":"The Heritage","review":"This is one of my most favorite books. When I read it last a couple of weeks ago, it finally started to fall apart (paperback). But hardback copies are available used, so I was able to replace it easily. Here's the story. A young American in Ireland to visit relatives falls in love with a beautiful young woman on a train. They consumate their sudden love on a Ferry boat, a leg of his jouney. She had never revealed her name. In the morning he finds her gone with no way of tracing her. He finds her under incredible circumstances, but burdened by her guilt over their illicit interlude, she refuses to acknowledge or return his love. When she is found to be pregnant, he is unable to claim his child. The author felt duty bound to include historical politics which is irrelevant to the plot. Filter (skim over) the political letters, and you have a delightful romance. Awesome."},{"Title":"Good Cops: The Case For Preventive Policing","review":"David Harris, a University of Toledo Professor of Law, has made a significant contribution to the literature on policing in his book Good Cops. Harris' Preventive Policing may well be the bridge between Community Oriented Policing model of the 1990s and the yet jelled Homeland Security Policing model of the post 9/11 era.The Preventive Policing model's concepts are summarized at page 131 of his book, where he writes:Strong, active, committed leadership as absolutely critical to the success of preventive policing. The core concepts of preventive policing-partnership with citizens based on trust, becoming proactive problem solvers instead of responders and establishing accountability - all represent fundamental breaks with the long-held beliefs and traditions if law enforcement going back well into the twentieth century.Harris' book is broad in scope, and he weaves comments upon almost all the current controversies in modern policing from the PATRIOT Act and Consent Decrees to partnerships with federal authorities to enforce immigration law and the racial profiling controversy to name just a few.The book's nine chapters are subdivided into three sections - The Theory Behind Preventive Policing, Preventive Policing in Action and The Future of Policing. His approach is to blend theory and commentary with vignettes from several cases (from Pittsburgh to Providence, with Boston, Los Angeles, New York, Detroit thrown in for good measure) to buttress his argument that there are successful alternatives to current practice. However, with more than 18,000 law enforcement agencies nation-wide establishing the \\"norm\\" or \\"current practice\\" is no small task.A skilled and trained advocate, he uses his talents fully to make his argument. However, his frequent and repetitive attacks on what he refers to \\"Ashcroft Policing\\" quickly become tiresome. Harris maintains that Ashcroft and the Department of Justice have initiated a domestic response to terrorism that undermines the hard won progress realized through community policing nationwide and in his words Ashcroft's efforts are in\\". . . precisely the wrong direction\\".Although you may not agree with some or most of his points, his book is well written and logical in presentation. It is an interesting argument from an advocate of community policing. Time will tell if his \\"preventive policing model\\" has an enduring impact on the nation's police departments."},{"Title":"Good Cops: The Case For Preventive Policing","review":"Although this book was published several years ago it remains current in its thought, focus and approach for modern and effective policing. Every police officer and police administrator, mayor and governor should read this book. Today, many police forces suffer from a jaded culture of policing and ineffective approaches to law enforcement which no longer meet the needs of the communities served by their police departments. This good book is about a new approach to law enforcement and one that statistics show has proven successful. Effective modern policing is necessary and smart policing is necessary. This book weaves the two concepts together and offers practical strategies to make it work for both the police officer and the neighborhoods they serve.Well written, focused and practical this is a must have book for anyone remotely connected with law enforcement."},{"Title":"Thirty Years a Slave: From Bondage to Freedom","review":"I live not far from the site of the subject house the family built in Memphis and have followed the McGehee family history through to the present.This narrative was extrodinary and brought to life a time past that I can now visualize as I walk around the old property where the house stood.

In her writings, the Florence Nightengale tells us that nursing was born through her analysis of the extraordinarily detailed observations and outcomes she collected.

Nursing-schools, many years ago, designed the curriculum--and educated the aspiring nurses--with this in mind. Sadly, many present-day nurses (and nursing-schools) have lost this ideal...and the state of affairs in nursing bears this out.If you're seriously considering nursing--or are a nurse who is \\"burned out,\\" read this book. It will enlighten and edify you."},{"Title":"Notes on Nursing What It Is and What It Is Not","review":"First I am an RN (an OLD RN) and to me modern Nursing began with Miss Nightingale. Prior to her works hospitals were a place to be feared. Nurses were women who were paid in Port Wine and worked 20 hour days carrying slop buckets and then delivering meal trays or changing bandages. Miss Nightingale along with Dr Ignaz Semmelweis on th emedical side,brought the simple idea of cleanliness equals health to the public. The simple act of hand washing and circulating air by opening windows made dramatic changes in a patient's chance of survival. Prior to that era doctors would go from autopsy to surgery to office hours and never wash their hands or change their bloody coat. (That's just nasty isn't it?)Now the younger Nurses I know say Miss Nightingale was old fashioned and something of a prude as it came to what a Nurse is. Well maybe so, but if it had not been for someone beginning a school to educate Professional Nurses there would not BE the career/calling/occupation of A NURSE for the past century or more. We don't wear aprons, don't wear caps, don't salute the doctors, but we DO make all the difference in patient care. Thank you Miss Nightingale for being A NURSE!I downloaded this as a free book, but just as well would have paid for a hard copy as it is a classic beauty in my opinion."},{"Title":"Notes on Nursing What It Is and What It Is Not","review":"Florence Nightingale was the first &quot;modern&quot; nurse. Her methods were revolutionary in her time, and they form the basis for the techniques of patient management that have been taught ever since. This volume is a great overview, in her own words, of her ideas on care, cleanliness, and the nursing process in general. Her directives are widely applicable today. Anyone interested in the healthcare process, nursing, or notable women in history would do well to read this little volume. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Notes on Nursing What It Is and What It Is Not","review":"This is a wonderful book that should be a required reading for anyone working in or around the healthcare field. It is a sad reminder of how little we have done to maintain her work ethics,especially, in regards to cleanliness ,ventilation, and wholistic treatment of the infirm.Nightingale has a certain \\" tongue in cheek\\" way of speaking in parts of this book. She suffered no ignorance nor laziness.It is striking to me how people of this modern age think their thoughts are so \\"cutting edge\\" and \\"innovative\\". Read this book and you will see Florence was thinking it long before they thought it. She speaks of the implications a certain painting might have on an ill person viewing it day in and day out as well as every other detail affecting the sick person. As a nurse,I am in awe of her;and, as a nurse, I see how much we have failed her in modern hospitals and healthcare systems.I recommend this book to everyone: young/old, and all backgrounds."},{"Title":"Notes on Nursing What It Is and What It Is Not","review":"I purchased the valuable first edition hard copy for my wife and this Kindle edition allows her to read the original without ruining the original.

As nurses, we become so focused on the science and technology,(and dare I say, overrun by the weight of our workloads and liability that comes with it) the ability to \\"minister\\" to the human being before us is lost.. daily barriers prevent us from providing the \\"care\\" that is fundamental. Interventions such as light, fresh air, sleep and comfort and \\"quieting of the mind from excessive worry\\" are not just interventions to be used in the absence of technology but as an important adjunct to it.

Ancient tales like the &quot;Calabash Man&quot; and &quot;The Tale Of The Gentle Folk.&quot; These stories can be appreciated across the board by all ages. The fantastic wording creates vivid pictures in the mind, and slips a moral in while you're not looking. I struggle to describe my appreciation for this wonderful compilation of tales. It is still my favorite book, since the 4th grade, and I'm in college. So it just goes to prove my point."},{"Title":"Tales from silver lands","review":"Tales from Silver Lands by Charles J. Finger won the John Newbery Award in 1925. I didn't know anything about the book when I picked it up other than it's Newbery, but I must say, I was quite pleasantly surprised by what I found.I have always loved Fairy Tales. Like, a lot. If you remember, a few weeks ago I talked about my first experience reading Grimm's Fairy Tales, which helped cement my love for reading them as well. (If you are really interested, click here, and you can go back and read it.) So, imagine my delight when I realized this was a collection of 19 fairy tales recorded by Finger from South America. Although I'm not nearly as knowledgeable about other countries and their rich cultural histories as I'd like to be, I'm always open to learning more. And I think you can learn a lot about a society from their fairy tales and children's stories.This was a real treat for me to read, and one I'm definitely looking forward to adding to my shelves and rereading, not only for myself but also to read to kids. I used to read some of the Grimm's fairy tales to my little brothers as a bedtime story, and I'd love to be able to add these tales to stories I can read/tell to young kids.Although some of these stories might be classified as more mythology than fairy tale, I felt the same way reading these as I did reading the classic fairy tales. There's that sense of magic and possibility, where you know anything can happen, and although things might get a little rough along the way, and there probably won't be super happy ending, the good guys do win in the end.I also noticed that the emphasis of each tale was placed on the struggles of each character rather than the resolution. The ending is always over so quickly. Normally, this is something that is a major no-no in writing, I mean, seriously. Who wants to read a 400 pg. build up to a 4 paragraph resolution?! But it seems to work in fairy tales. The stories aren't about what happens, it's about learning how to get there. We see their struggles, know their challenges and then we get to know they end up relatively alright in the end.This is definitely a book I would recommend. The writing is a little older, but to anyone who is a fan of fairy tales in their original setting (or people who want to write a fairy tale retelling but are wanting new material) this is a great book to read and one that I strongly recommend."},{"Title":"Tales from silver lands","review":"i enjoy folk/fairytales in general, and this collection is esp. interesting as a comparison to the more well-known european ones (the magic dog is eerily similar to the famous french fairy tale donkeyskin). there are some great images and situations, and although more than a few sort of meander and fizzle out there were enough uniques ones to keep you reading to the end. not the best, but not the worst either."},{"Title":"Tales from silver lands","review":"This children's book is a collection of nineteen folk tales collected and retold by the author from his travels throughout Central and South America. The book won the 1925 Newbery Medal for best contribution to American children's literature. I am oviously in the minority with my opinion: I only awarded the book two stars. I simply found it boring. But, this is obviously a good resource of South American folktales. Perhaps those who enjoy such material will like the book more than I."},{"Title":"Tales from silver lands","review":"This is a wonderful collection of tales from South America, which won the Newbery Medal 1925. The stories are for all ages and written to intrigue the reader and whisk him or her to a far away land. Brave worriers, fair maidens, rich kings, evil witches, and ferocious giants are all a part of these tales. My only negative comment about this book is that towards the end it became somewhat repetitive. All the characters became somewhat similar and the plots (although diverse) had similar paths. However, this is a great book for children's bedtime stories, and a treat to the adult who reads it to them."},{"Title":"Tales from silver lands","review":"This book has a collection of South American folk tales about witches, etc. It is written very well and can be read without having to reread and comprehend more of the page."},{"Title":"Tales from silver lands","review":"This book was an anthology of 19 stories.

Thank you for reading my review."},{"Title":"October Vagabonds","review":"I just read a book of this author's poetry which I liked a lot, so I'm not a bit surprised that I like this prose work also. It's in first person, and the narrator starts off living in a shack in the woods near Buffalo, regretting the passage of summer. After just a few pages of that, he and a friend pack up and start walking across the state to NYC. He tells about people they meet and towns they walk through, and spends lots of time describing landscapes and natural features. I like how when he goes on a 400-mile walk he takes 9 books to read along the way. Le Gallienne is obviously a poet at heart, since he slips 5 or 6 poems into this book and occasionally quotes other poets. It's a short book, and is written in a pleasant, gentle manner. It's a nice travelogue of a walk through rural America when there were very few motorized vehicles."},{"Title":"October Vagabonds","review":"This was a short and sweet read. It takes you on a journey from Buffalo to NYC. The author describes the people he meets and the nature he observes. It is quite obvious from this book that the author is a poet at heart, and quite a few poems are mixed into his prose. It is not the best story I've ever read and there are no underlying plots: just a simple documentation of one authors journey as he travels part way across the country. It's short and it's free. Definately worth downloading to join the author on his adventure for a few hours."},{"Title":"October Vagabonds","review":"This was an enjoyable recounting of two naturalist artists who decide to hike back to New York rather than take the train. They did not want to return to soon to the noise and clutter of city life. A nice short excursion thru up state New York around the turn of the century. Maybe not for everyone.but if you like travel writing and observations of people whom they met on the way it is rewarding."},{"Title":"October Vagabonds","review":"Such a beautiful work, and an excellent introduction to the writing of Richard Le Gallienne.\\"October Vagabonds\\" is a relatively short novel, its beauty all the more concentrated for it. I'd not heard of Le Gallienne beforehand, and found his writing style both engaging and very accessible. His obvious love for the subject, a walking tour through New York State, communing with Nature, a love of simple people, is evident on every page.Also bearing in mind the time in which the story took place (1908) and was published (1910), we have an almost contemporary report on then-rural parts of New York State that may be of interest to regional history buffs. Like \\"Travels with Charley\\" by John Steinbeck, Le Gallienne crafts a story of real places, real towns, real events, as his two Bohemian characters travel along.This is a sensitive work, full of the romance of Nature, and almost poem-like in its approach. It's the kind of work that creates a special mood, and will leave you longing for more. And imagine, this copy was FREE! Formatting is good, with only the occasional typo, certainly nothing that would distract the reader from the text.Fortunately, many of Richard Le Gallienne's other works are also available on Kindle (for free, no less!), and I plan on exploring his work further."},{"Title":"October Vagabonds","review":"What a neat book. I felt like I was traveling right along with these fellows and really enjoyed being part of their travels."},{"Title":"The complete poems of Paul Laurence Dunbar","review":"Paul Laurence Dunbar was the first great Black poet; Booker T. Washington called him the &quot;Poet Laureate of the Negro Race&quot;. Dunbar, the son of ex-slaves, grew up in Dayton, OH, where he was friendly with the Wright Brothers. He had a successful high school career--founding editor of the school paper and elected class president of the predominantly white school--but upon graduation, he was forced to work as an elevator operator. His second book of poetry was praised by William Dean Howells and by age 24, he was one of the most renowned Black literary figures in America.Dunbar wrote in two different styles. On the one hand, he wrote straightforward classic verse that was filled with racial pride:THE COLORED SOLDIERSIF the muse were mine to tempt it And my feeble voice were strong, If my tongue were trained to measures, I would sing a stirring song. I would sing a song heroic Of those noble sons of Ham, Of the gallant colored soldiers Who fought for Uncle Sam!In the early days you scorned them, And with many a flip and flout Said &quot;These battles are the white man's, And the whites will fight them out.&quot; Up the hills you fought and faltered, In the vales you strove and bled, While your ears still heard the thunder Of the foes' advancing tread.Then distress fell on the nation, And the flag was drooping low; Should the dust pollute your banner? No! the nation shouted, No! So when War, in savage triumph, Spread abroad his funeral pall-- Then you called the co]ored soldiers, And they answered to your call.And like hounds unleashed and eager For the life blood of the prey, Sprung they forth and bore them bravely In the thickest of the fray. And where'er the fight was hottest, Where the bullets fastest fell, There they pressed unblanched and fearless At the very mouth of hell.Ah, they rallied to the standard To uphold it by their might; None were stronger in the labors, None were braver in the fight. From the blazing breach of Wagner To the plains of Olustee, They were foremost in the fight Of the battles of the free.And at Pillow! God have mercy On the deeds committed there, An the souls of those poor victims Sent to Thee without a prayer. Let the fulness of Thy pity O'er the hot wrought spirits sway Of the gallant colored soldiers Who fell fighting on that day!Yes, the Blacks enjoy their freedom, And they won it dearly,too; For the life blood of their thousands Did the southern fields bedew. In the darkness of their bondage, In the depths of slavery's night, Their muskets flashed the dawning, And they fought their way to lightThey were comrades then and brothers, Are they more or less to-day? They were good to stop a bullet And to front the fearful fray. They were citizens and soldiers, When rebellion raised its head; And the traits that made them worthy,-- Ah! those virtues are not dead.They have shared your nightly vigils, They have shared your daily toil; And their blood with yours commingling Has enriched the Southern soil. They have met as fierce a foeman, And have been as brave and true.And their deeds shall find a record In the registry of Fame; For their blood has cleansed completely Every blot of Slavery's shame.So all honor and all glory To those noble sons of Ham-- The gallant colored soldiers Who fought for Uncle Sam!WE WEAR THE MASKWe wear the mask that grins and lies, It hides our cheeks and shades our eyes,-- This debt we pay to human guile; With torn and bleeding hearts we smile, And mouth with myriad subtleties.Why should the world be over-wise, In counting all our tears and sighs? Nay, let them only see us, while We wear the mask.We smile, but, O great Christ, our cries To thee from tortured souls arise. We sing, but oh the clay is vile Beneath our feet, and long the mile; But let the world dream other-wise, We wear the mask!But on the other hand, he was a master of dialect poems:AN ANTE-BELLUM SERMON.WE is gathahed hyeah, my brothahs, In dis howlin' wildaness, Fu' to speak some words of comfo't To each othah in distress. An' we chooses fu' ouah subjic' Dis--we 'll 'splain it by an' by; &quot;An' de Lawd said, 'Moses, Moses,' An' de man said, 'Hyeah am I.'&quot;Now ole Pher'oh, down in Egypt, Was de wuss man evah bo'n, An' he had de Hebrew chillun Down dah wukin' in his co'n; 'Twell de Lawd got tiahed o' his foolin', An' sez he: &quot;I 'll let him know-- Look hyeah, Moses, go tell Pher'oh Fu' to let dem chillun go.&quot;&quot;An' ef he refuse to do it, I will make him rue de houah,Fu' I 'll empty down on Egypt All de vials of my powah.&quot; Yes, he did--an' Pher'oh's ahmy Was n't wuth a ha'f a dime; Fu' de Lawd will he'p his chillun, You kin trust him evah time.An' yo' enemies may 'sail you In de back an' in de front; But de Lawd is all aroun' you, Fu' to ba' de battle's brunt.

But I want to wa'n you people, Don't you git too brigity; An' don't you git to braggin' 'Bout dese things, you wait an' see.But when Moses wif his powah Comes an' sets us chillun free, We will praise de gracious Mastah Dat has gin us liberty; An' we 'll shout ouah halleluyahs, On dat mighty reck'nin' day, When we 'se reco'nised ez citiz'-- Huh uh! Chillun, let us pray!Inevitably, in a Reconstruction America that was both nostalgic and regionalist, his dialect poems were wildly popular &amp; tended to overshadow his more serious verse. As a result, he has always been a figure of some controversy in Black America; alternately dismissed for popularizing a derogatory stereotype of Blacks and hailed as a great literary figure. Dunbar captures this dichotomy in his own poem, The Poet:The PoetHe sang of life, serenely sweet, With , now ant then, a deeper note. From some high peak, nigh yet remote, He voiced the world's absorbing beat.He sang of love when earth was young, And Love, itself, was in his lays. But ah, the world, it turned to praise A jingle in a broken tongue.Given the perspective of 100 years, it seems to me that he deserves to be read by all Americans.GRADE: B+"},{"Title":"The complete poems of Paul Laurence Dunbar","review":"Dunbar's poetry is so good that it should be almost impossible to ruin a collection of his poems, yet somehow they've done it.Start with the table of contents and the index of first lines. The page numbers are apparently from an earlier edition of the book where the poems started on page 3. In the present edition, the poems begin on page 23, so the page numbers given start out 20 pages off. But each page contains a few extra lines, so that when you try to find the poem Sympathy (\\"I know what the caged bird feels, alas!\\") on page 102 and you think \\"well, let's add 20\\" and look on page 122, no, wrong again. It's on page 112. So if you need to find a certain poem, go to the page number they give you, read the name of a poem that is actually on that page, look that poem up in the index, and compare the page number given in the index with the page it is actually on. That will tell you approximately how many pages away your poem is. As another example, you will find We Wear The Mask on page 85, not page 71. (On the principle that even a stopped clock is right twice a day, the poems that appear on pages 184 to 186 actually are correct. Poems from page 187 on are on lower page numbers than the number given, until they are 4 pages off by the end of the book.)Typography? It appears to have been typed. With a typewriter. Remember typewriters? The titles of the poems are in capital letters, probably because typewriters didn't have boldface type. This compounds the pagination problem, because the titles do not stand out from the text. Sometimes the title of the poem is at the bottom of one page and the poem at the top of the next page.And they didn't bother to put the title of the book on the spine, so good luck finding it on a bookshelf.The phrase \\"High Quality\\" appears twice on the cover of this book. That's false advertising."},{"Title":"The complete poems of Paul Laurence Dunbar","review":"I have looked for this book of poems for a long time.

At times it was a struggle to read the poetry because the line breaks were so awkward. Page numbers are added INTO THE BODY OF THE POETRY ITSELF, smashed into the first word of a line. There are mistakes in the poetry due to either a poor OCR being used or because the editor wasn't paying attention.That makes me sad and mad; sad, because this poet has some truly wonderful things to say, and mad because I just expect a higher level of professionalism to be paid to our American authors and the words they've written.Truly, I'd give the author much higher marks, but I have to downgrade this edition as nearly unusable and quite unprofessional."},{"Title":"The complete poems of Paul Laurence Dunbar","review":"The poems of Paul Laurence Dunbar are classic and classy in nature.

The great land responded by inviting her into a world which while more materially primitive than Paris displayed a far more profound emotional intelligence. In Alaska she found love, death, mystery, the great attention to the ordinary which is both the poet's burden and her gift. She saw literary culture bump heads against an older kind of storytelling, the kind of stories which teach us how to be human, the sacred stories, Akhmatova and Mandelstam stories. She writes courageously about her own lack of understanding. She wonders why we ourselves live in a culture too &quot;advanced&quot; to trust the ancient wisdom of dreams.A Narrow Road to the Deep North is a profound celebration of earth sacredness. We stand at a crossroads where we will either understand that the animals, the earth and ourselves to be a single organism, or we will drown in the toxic oil spill of technology and greed. That is the great tension in Alaska, both when McNamara lived there and today, when the Bush Administration wants to rip up the fragile tundra.But Narrow Road is no polemic. It is first and foremost a work of poetry. Thanks to the author for the care and courage to share it with us."},{"Title":"Narrow Road to the Deep North: A Journey Into the Interior of Alaska","review":"McNamara's gorgeous writing is a journey to the far north of the imagination.

These traits strongly show in this book. These traits shown forth when he was President, and for some, these same took advantage of him. The Iranian Hostage Crisis is the utmost example, being a man of peace, the primitive and simple minded could abuse him. This has always been the case in the past, the intelligent and peaceful get run over by the aggressive lower minded. Now Mr. Carter is showing forth by continuing this peaceful way and effort. These pages are more than memories, the insightful can read better than that, they can see that he has a powerful message of peace and advancement that 95 percent of the world is not able to grasp yet due to simple mindedness. But people like Mr Carter are offering us valuable contributions that will in time help. My way of saying Hi President Carter (always the president of peace) is check out another mind similar, a book ahead of its time, SB 1 or God By Karl Mark Maddox. Destiny is what it is all about now, the only way we can assure that is a move to peace world wide. What would our destiny be without the true and honest peace makers?Recommend reading Karl Mark Maddox, way ahead of our time."},{"Title":"Christmas in Plains Signed","review":"In An Hour Before Daylight former President Jimmy Carter reminisced about his boyhood on the farm during the Great Depression. Included in that were memories of Christmases, both for his family and for those around him in the farming community of Archery. Following up on the reception of An Hour Before Daylight, President Carter has focused his reminiscences on Christmases on the farm, in Plains, in Atlanta, and in the White House.Christmas in Plains is a short but warm book that will not take long to read. In that short time, however, the reader will be struck by the importance of family, tradition, and holiday in President Carter's life. Some of the material presented is repeated from An Hour Before Daylight, and perhaps from some of President Carter's other books as well. It doesn't matter. The book is well-written, and evokes in the reader his own stirring of ghosts of Christmas past.Written by almost anyone else, this book would not attract much attention. Many people have experienced Christmases much like these (except for the White House). Perhaps that is why it does receive attention-because of President Carter's celebrity we will read it and remember our own roots, family times, and traditions. And this is a time when those memories bring us a special comfort."},{"Title":"Christmas in Plains Signed","review":"Merry Christmas from the Former PresidentProlific former President Carter's slim volume of Christmas memories--most spent in his hometown--makes for a quick and easy read and leaves a lingering satisfied feeling. No vignette is particularly earth-shattering, but perhaps it is the mundane and wholesome nature of his experiences that makes them all the more engrossing.While few observers would term Jimmy Carter a great president, only the most blindly partisan Republicans fail to see him as a noble patriot overflowing with integrity. These identifying attributes are quietly displayed throughout the episodes he narrates. Even when he steps on a few toes, they are feet that deserve it. Those with a phobia about vestiges of Christianity in public schools will shutter when he writes of his childhood, \\"it would have been ridiculous in those days for anyone in our community, or the state of Georgia, to think that the dedicated religious services that were held every day in the public school might violate in any way the First Amendment.\\" The former president sees great value in the school's religious presentations \\"because they reached every child, not just the churchgoers.\\" Such virtuous suasion may earn him membership in the vast right wing conspiracy in some circles, but unabashed honesty forms the basis of Jimmy Carter.Perusing his others Yuletide tales spent in the Navy, as a young father and husband, serving as Georgia's governor, on to the White, House, and back home again, readers may be disappointed by the skeletal nature of certain chapters. However, Carter's post-presidency has produced a substantial oeuvre, and other works can undoubtedly flesh out the missing tidbits.Maybe the book's greatest strength is near complete avoidance of the political realm. Carter seems to be saying that Christmas is for all Americans, and while politics has its place, it takes a back seat--or at least it should-- to our nation's sacred holidays."},{"Title":"Christmas in Plains Signed","review":"In the short &quot;Christmas in Plains&quot; Jimmy Carter shares mermories from a lifetime of very disparate Christmases. He remembers childhood holidays in rural Georgia where his young African-American neighbors might get an orange and some raisins. He recalls the four Christmases he spent as President. A very religious and family-oriented man, Carter has alsways treasured the birth of Christ as one of the highlights of his year. Easily read in one night this is a charming little book. To better understand this complicated and important man, a fuller read is last year's &quot;An Hour Before Daylight&quot; which is a more thorough memoir of his childhood years. But &quot;Christmas in Plains&quot; stands on its own: a charming, sometimes heartwarming account of a good man and his 70+ Christmases.

There are happy childhood memories of finding the Christmas tree and fireworks. Jimmy and Rosalynn always tried to get back to Plains, but there are included a few absent remembrance from Navy years, and a rather tense Christmas with the holding of the Iran hostages.

Since then, I've read the book and have no desire to keep it - but I am glad to have read it. It's a nice look at Christmases gone by and a tiny window on the interaction between blacks and whites in rural Georgia over the years.Carter shares his memories of Christmas throughout his life. As a member of a well-off family in Georgia, he is blissfully unaware of any real difference between himself and his black playmates and shares Christmas joys with them as well as with his close family. Even the town figures into the earliest celebrations, with fireworks and church services. Through his years at West Point and in the Navy, including the early years of his marriage and finally reaching his time in public service, when his family grew and grew until, returning to Georgia from the White House, he and his wife find that much has changed - and much has stayed the same.For other former presidents, perhaps the years in office would be their choice for an uplifting ending to a book like this. Carter chooses to end with the beginnings of his time with Habitat for Humanity, a fitting place to leave things for this man who, more than any other recent president, comes across as a normal guy with the ability to relate to the rest of us.I was a little annoyed to find that the first chapter or two never really came into focus. Carter spends most of his ink there pointing out, in various ways, how not racist he is. While I believe that Carter's an open-minded non-racist, it seemed a little much. On the other hand, bookending the entire tale with his childhood among black neighbors in the 1930-1940s with the story of Curtis and Martha, black neighbors in need of help, is a great choice. Despite being part of a close family, and his mentioning the days before his father's death, he glosses over that death and its impact on himself, his family and their holidays. The illustrations by Amy Carter would have been cute, had they been done when she was 8. She's not eight and the only cute factor is that they're evidence of her closeness to her father.
